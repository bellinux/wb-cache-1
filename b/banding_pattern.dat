5|$|In {{the middle}} of August 2015, a strong {{westerly}} wind surge along the equator produced two areas of convection, or thunderstorm activity, near the Marshall Islands in the western Pacific Ocean. The westernmost disturbance became associated with a circulation center near Ujelang Atoll. With low wind shear and favorable sea surface temperatures, tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated further development of both convective systems. The westernmost system developed a <b>banding</b> <b>pattern</b> by August13, indicative of increased organization. At 18:00UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified it as a tropical depression, centered about 700km (435mi) east-southeast of Guam. Early on August14, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system with the designation Tropical Depression 16W.|$|E
5|$|The system {{originated}} {{from one of}} several powerful tropical waves that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa {{in the second half of}} August. When the wave came off the African coast, it already had cyclonic rotation, although it was fairly disorganized. As the wave moved westward into open waters, it developed rapidly. Late on August 21, it formed a low-level circulation and was declared Tropical Depression Nine. The system quickly matured and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Humberto early on August 22. Beginning on a west-northwest track, it was clear from the outset that Humberto would not affect land, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge to the north which would eventually turn the storm northward. Favorable outflow and distinct <b>banding</b> <b>pattern</b> quickly formed in a very conducive environment, with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. Humberto intensified into a high-end tropical storm on the afternoon and evening of August 22. Early on August 23, the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Humberto.|$|E
5|$|Initially, a small upper-level low {{pressure}} {{system to the}} north of the depression generated northerly wind shear and dry air, which inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity. However, after the tropical depression was designated, the low weakened, and the wind shear relented. Located over warm waters, the storm attained tropical storm status at 0600 UTC on July 11, and as such it was named Bud by the National Hurricane Center. Subsequently, the storm quickly intensified. With more favorable conditions, the storm displayed a fairly organized <b>banding</b> <b>pattern,</b> and the previously exposed center of circulation became surrounded by convection. At 0000 UTC on July 12, the storm developed an eye and was upgraded to a hurricane. The convection surrounding the center deepened, and a burst of thunderstorm activity within the southeastern eyewall obscured the eye on satellite imagery. Outflow was well established in all quadrants, though it was slightly restricted to the east, which was believed to have resulted from interaction with Tropical Storm Carlotta. Later on July 12, Bud was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{an optical}} <b>band</b> <b>pattern</b> that we recently discovered in an optical interferometric tensile analysis.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Torbjörn Caspersson {{developed}} a quinicrine fluorescent staining technique (Q-banding) which revealed unique <b>banding</b> <b>patterns</b> for each chromosome pair. This allowed chromosome pairs of otherwise equal size to be differentiated by distinct horizontal <b>banding</b> <b>patterns.</b> <b>Banding</b> <b>patterns</b> are now used to elucidate the breakpoints and constituent chromosomes involved in chromosome translocations. Deletions and inversions within an individual chromosome {{can also be}} identified and described more precisely using standardized banding nomenclature. G-banding (utilizing trypsin and Giemsa/ Wright stain) was concurrently developed in the early 1970s and allows visualization of <b>banding</b> <b>patterns</b> using a bright field microscope.|$|R
5|$|Sinosauropteryx was {{the first}} dinosaur to have its life {{colouration}} described by scientists based on physical evidence. Some fossils of Sinosauropteryx show an alternation of lighter and darker bands preserved on the tail. Chen and colleagues initially interpreted this <b>banding</b> <b>pattern</b> as an artifact of the splitting between the main slab and counter-slab in which the original specimen was preserved. However, Longrich suggested in his 2002 presentation for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology that these specimens actually preserve remnants of the colouration pattern the animal would have exhibited in life. He argued that the dark, banded areas on the tail were too evenly spaced to {{have been caused by}} random separation of the fossil slabs, and that they represent fossilized pigments present in the feathers. Additionally, rather than an artifact of preservation or decomposition, the presence of dark feathers along only the top of the body may also reflect the colour pattern in life, indicating that Sinosauropteryx prima was countershaded with dark colouration on its back and lighter colouration on its underside, with bands or stripes on the tail for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{majority}} of specimens are almost or even totally black, (with the exception of head and facial markings), the color pattern may consist of a brown, gray, tan, yellowish-olive, or blackish ground color, which is overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–17 dark brown to almost black crossbands. These crossbands, which usually have black edges, are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered halfbands {{on either side of the}} body. These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center, almost matching the ground color, often contain irregular dark markings, and extend well down onto the ventral scales. The dorsal <b>banding</b> <b>pattern</b> fades with age, so older individuals are an almost uniform olive-brown, grayish-brown, or black. The belly is white, yellowish-white, or tan, marked with dark spots, and becomes darker posteriorly. The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually none to almost completely black. The head is a more or less uniform brown color, especially in A. p. piscivorus. Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark, parietal spots characteristic of A. contortrix, but sometimes these are still visible in adults. Eastern populations have a broad, dark, postocular stripe, bordered with pale pigment above and below, that is faint or absent in western populations. The underside of the head is generally whitish, cream, or tan.|$|E

40|$|Barley beta -amylase {{exhibits}} {{two distinct}} <b>band</b> <b>patterns</b> after isoelectric focusing (IEF), termed Sd 1 and Sd 2. A {{comparison of the}} deduced amino acid sequences revealed five amino acid {{differences between the two}} types ofbeta -amylase. To investigate whether the two <b>band</b> <b>patterns</b> are due to these amino acid substitutions, four Sd 2 mutants (Sd 2 -R 115 C, Sd 2 -D 165 E, Sd 2 -L 347 S and Sd 2 -V 430 A) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The analysis of IEF <b>band</b> <b>patterns</b> of mutant and wild-type beta -amylases revealed that only the replacement of R 115 with cysteine converted the Sd 2 <b>band</b> <b>pattern</b> to the Sd 1 one. The contribution of the R 115 C substitution to the IEF <b>band</b> <b>pattern</b> of barley beta -amylase was further confirmed by generating a Sd 1 mutant (Sd 1 -C 115 R), where cysteine at this position was in turn replaced by arginine. As a result of this mutation, the Sd 1 <b>band</b> <b>pattern</b> was converted into the Sd 2 pattern. Calculation of the electrostatic potential and reducing agent treatment revealed that the R 115 C substitution altered both the net charge on the protein surface and intermolecular interactions by disulfide bonds, thereby altering the IEF <b>band</b> <b>pattern</b> of barley beta -amylase.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the inheritance of anthocyanin production and of malate dehydrogenase <b>banding</b> <b>patterns</b> in Agastache rugosa. Results of the study support the hypothesis that anthocyanin production is controlled by a single dominant gene, designated as A, for anthocyanin production.

500|$|At {{the time}} of its designation, Lua was nearly {{stationary}} in terms of forward movement, caught in the equilibrium between a blocking ridge to the southwest and increasing monsoonal winds from the northwest. The ridge began to drive Lua north-northwestward at up to , before the storm resumed its slow pace on 14 March. The storm remained relatively disorganised, its strengthening limited by moderate wind shear and dry air entering its centre. Consequently, a large void of thunderstorm activity created a [...] "horseshoe pattern". Nonetheless, Lua proved resilient, and good outflow helped compensate for the adverse shear. The southwesterly steering currents weakened, causing the storm to begin its anticipated curve toward the east and east-southeast. According to the JTWC, the storm completed a small loop as a result of competing steering factors. At the same time, the upper levels of the atmosphere became far more conducive to the cyclone's intensification, and the storm's <b>banding</b> <b>pattern</b> tightened. With a building ridge to its north, Lua accelerated east-southeastward on 15 March, and with wind shear oscillating but generally decreasing, the storm became a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone at 1800 UTC.|$|E
