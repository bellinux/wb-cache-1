There are numerous high resolution crystal structures of GR, yet these are invariably bound to either D-glutamate or very weakly bound oxygen-based salts.

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{relative}} solvent accessibility provides {{insight into}} understanding protein structure and function. Prediction of protein relative solvent accessibility {{is often the}} first stage of predicting other protein properties. Recent predictors of relative solvent accessibility discriminate against exposed regions as compared with <b>buried</b> <b>regions,</b> resulting in higher prediction accuracy associated with <b>buried</b> <b>regions</b> relative to exposed regions. Methods Here, we propose a more accurate and balanced predictor of protein relative solvent accessibility. First, we collected known proteins in three subsets according to sequence length and constructed a balanced dataset after reducing redundancy within each subset. Next, we measured the performance associated with different variables and variable combinations to determine the best variable combination. Finally, a predictor called BMRSA was constructed for modelling and prediction, which used the balanced set as the training set, the position- specific scoring matrix, predicted secondary structure, buried-exposed profile, and length of a query sequence as variables, and the conditional random field as the machine-learning method. Results BMRSA performance on test sets confirmed that our approach improved prediction accuracy relative to state-of-the-art approaches and was balanced in its comparison of <b>buried</b> and exposed <b>regions.</b> Our method is valuable when higher levels of accuracy in predicting exposed-residue states are required.

Metal deposition of variable-thickness masks was adopted to implant channels with emerging endpoints and high temperature annealing was performed in order to induce the graphitization of the highly-damaged <b>buried</b> <b>region.</b> When an electrical current was flowing through the biased buried channel, the structure was clearly evidenced by KPM maps of the electrical potential of the surface region overlying the channel at increasing distances from the grounded electrode.

Therefore the knowledge of hydrophobic regions and its prediction is of great help in understanding the structure and function of the protein. Hence determination of membrane <b>buried</b> <b>region</b> is a computationally intensive task in bioinformatics. Several prediction methods have been reported {{but there are some}} deficiencies in prediction accuracy and adaptability of these methods. Of these proteins that are found embedded in cellular membranes, called as membrane proteins, are of particular importance because they form targets for over 60 % of drugs on the market. 20 - 30 % of all the proteins in any organism are membrane proteins. Thus transmembrane protein plays important role in the life activity of the cells. Hence prediction of membrane buried segments in transmembrane proteins is of particular importance. In this paper we have proposed signal processing algorithms based on digital filter for prediction of hydrophobic regions in the transmembrane proteins and found improved prediction efficiency than the existing methods. Hydrophobic regions are extracted by assigning physico-chemical parameter such as hydrophobicity and hydration energy index to each amino acid residue and the resulting numerical representation of the protein is subjected to digital low pass filter.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to select proteins that are thermodynamically destabilized yet still folded and functional. The gene for the B 1 IgG-binding domain from Group G Streptococcus (StrpG) has been fused {{to the end of}} the gene III protein from bacteriophage M 13. The resulting fusion protein is displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage giving the phage the ability to bind to IgG molecules. Phage displaying the wild type B 1 domain exhibit a small plaque phenotype that can be reversed when destabilizing mutations are introduced into the protein. By selecting phage that recover a normal plaque morphology coupled with IgG binding function, it is possible to identify mutants that are folded but destabilized compared to native Strp G. These mutants can be divided into three general categories: (1) those that disrupt packing of the hydrophobic core, (2) those that destabilize secondary structure, and (3) those that alter specific stabilizing interactions between side chains. The mutants exhibit folding stabilities that are decreased from 2 – 5 kcal/mol compared to native Strp G. ^ The NMR structure ofa deletion mutant identified by this selection is described. The deletion occurs within the last β strand of the protein where it may have a deleterious effect on protein stability by changing the registry of the final three residues of the sheet, forcing a polar Thr to be buried in the interior of the protein and exposing a hydrophobic Val to solvent. The deletion could also create a large cavity in the β-sheet and force the α and γ carboxylates of the C-terminal Glu residue into a partially <b>buried</b> <b>region</b> of the sheet.

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{proteins}} function by {{interacting with}} other molecules. Their interaction interfaces are highly conserved throughout evolution to avoid undesirable interactions {{that lead to}} fatal disorders in cells. Rational drug discovery includes computational methods to identify the interaction sites of lead compounds to the target molecules. Identifying and classifying protein interaction interfaces {{on a large scale}} can help researchers discover drug targets more efficiently. Description We introduce a large-scale protein domain interaction interface database called InterPare [URL]. It contains both inter-chain (between chains) interfaces and intra-chain (within chain) interfaces. InterPare uses three methods to detect interfaces: 1) the geometric distance method for checking the distance between atoms that belong to different domains, 2) Accessible Surface Area (ASA), a method for detecting the <b>buried</b> <b>region</b> of a protein that is detached from a solvent when forming multimers or complexes, and 3) the Voronoi diagram, a computational geometry method that uses a mathematical definition of interface regions. InterPare includes visualization tools to display protein interior, surface, and interaction interfaces. It also provides statistics such as the amino acid propensities of queried protein according to its interior, surface, and interface region. The atom coordinates that belong to interface, surface, and interior regions can be downloaded from the website. Conclusion InterPare is an open and public database server for protein interaction interface information. It contains the large-scale interface data for proteins whose 3 D-structures are known. As of November 2004, there were 10, 583 (Geometric distance), 10, 431 (ASA), and 11, 010 (Voronoi diagram) entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) containing interfaces, according to the above three methods. In the case of the geometric distance method, there are 31, 620 inter-chain domain-domain interaction interfaces and 12, 758 intra-chain domain-domain interfaces. </p...|$|E

40|$|Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} {{can reveal}} {{insights into the}} structure, function and dynamics of proteins using the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan (Trp) residues. Time-resolved fluorescence is uniquely sensitive to the local microenvironment of Trp residues. This methodology is widely used, yet extensions allowing the further study of protein interactions are desired. Tryptophan analogs are targeted as new intrinsic probes, since their structures may camouflage them sufficiently to trick the relevant protein synthesis mechanisms to allow their incorporation into proteins. The specificity of a single enzyme, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS; E. C. 6. 1. 1. 2), {{is the key to}} success for biosynthetic Trp analog incorporation. TrpRS catalyzes the ATP activation of Trp, and the subsequent aminoacylation of tRNATrp, prior to ribosomal protein synthesis. Bacillus subtilis TrpRS has a single conserved and essential Trp- 92 residue in each of its symmetrical alpha- 2 subunits. The fluorescence of this Trp was very useful for investigating the TrpRS mechanism, together with the nonfluorescent isomorphous analog 4 -fluorotryptophan as substrate. A tryptophanyl- 5 '-adenylate dependent quenching of Trp- 92 fluorescence was observed, consistent with a local alpha-helix formation, placing a conserved Cys residue in quenching proximity to the Trp- 92 fluorophore. This corresponds with the recent crystal structure of the homologous B. stearothermophilus TrpRS. Titrations while monitoring Trp- 92 fluorescence revealed that the TrpRS dimer undergoes a concerted conformational change, virtually complete with the reaction of one subunit. This change seems necessary since this very small enzyme could only bind the relatively large tRNATrp substrate through interactions with both subunits. Potentially useful Trp analogs for fluorescence studies were examined to determine if they were TrpRS substrates. 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 HW) and 7 -azatryptophan (7 AW) were studied both as TrpRS substrates, and as biosynthetically incorporated replacements of Trp- 92. Methodology for efficient incorporation of these normally toxic Trp analogs is demonstrated. 7 AW was shown to be very sensitive to solvent exposure, as its inclusion into a <b>buried</b> <b>region</b> of the protein causes large increases in its fluorescence yield. 7 AW is recognized as having particular utility for the study of protein folding. Observations of the time-resolved fluorescence behaviour of Trp and 5 HW in the same protein microenvironment are of consequence for fluorescence theory, as they indicate that the current assumptions regarding radiative properties may require modification. By combining insights from both the crystal structure and these intrinsic fluorescence studies with both Trp and the analogs, a clearer picture of the mechanism of TrpRS was obtained. Prior to this study, the role of the essential Trp- 92 was not understood in terms of the mechanism of TrpRS. This study demonstrates Trp- 92 is crucial for both TrpRS conformational stability and for its very dynamic mechanism which involves large, substrate-dependent conformational changes...|$|E

The choice of geometry uses principles of non-imaging optics. A global temperature maximum at depths up to 50 μm into the target is achieved.

An interesting question is whether these proteins have incompletely solvated regions that drive the folding/ binding process. Although the presence of predominantly hydrophobic <b>buried</b> <b>regions</b> can be easily ascertained by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry analysis, the identification of those residues implicated in the burial requires NMR analysis.

Surprisingly, the terminal domains respond in opposite ways when pH is decreased from 7 to 5 : Urea denaturation and temperature stability assays show that NT dimers get significantly stabilized and then lock the spidroins into multimers, whereas CT on the other hand is destabilized and unfolds into ThT-positive beta-sheet amyloid fibrils, which can trigger fiber formation.

40|$|Intrinsic {{nucleosome}} dynamics termed “site exposure” provides {{spontaneous and}} cooperative access to <b>buried</b> <b>regions</b> of nucleosomal DNA in vitro. Two different mechanisms for site exposure have been proposed, {{one based on}} nucleosome translocation, the other on dynamic nucleosome conformational changes in which a stretch of the nucleosomal DNA is transiently released off the histone surface. Here we report on three experiments that distinguish between these mechanisms. One experiment investigates the effects on the accessibilities of restriction enzyme target sites inside nucleosomes when extra DNA (onto which the nucleosome may move at low energetic cost) is appended onto one end. The other two experiments test directly for nucleosome mobility under the conditions used to probe accessibility to restriction enzymes: one on a selected nonnatural nucleosome positioning sequence, {{the other on the}} well-studied 5 S rRNA gene nucleosome positioning sequence. We find from all three assays that restriction enzymes gain access to sites throughout {{the entire length of the}} nucleosomal DNA without contribution from nucleosome translocation. We conclude that site exposure in nucleosomes in vitro occurs via a nucleosome conformational change that leads to transient release of a stretch of DNA from the histone surface, most likely involving progressive uncoiling from an end. Recapture at a distal site along DNA that has partially uncoiled would result in looped structures which are believed to contribute to RNA polymerase elongation and may contribute to spontaneous or ATP-driven nucleosome mobility. Transient open states may facilitate the initial entry of transcription factors and enzymes in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Thermostability of {{a protein}} is a {{property}} which cannot {{be attributed to}} the presence of a particular amino acid or to a post synthetic modification. Thermostability seems to be a property acquired by a protein through many small structural modifications obtained with the exchange of some amino acids and the modulation of the canonical forces found in all proteins such as electrostatic (hydrogen bonds and ion-pairs) and hydrophobic interactions. Proteins produced by thermo and hyperthermophilic microorganisms, growing between 45 and 110 degrees C are in general more resistant to thermal and chemical denaturation than their mesophilic counterparts. The observed structural resistance may reflect a restriction on the flexibility of these proteins, which, while allowing them to be functionally competent at elevated temperatures, renders them unusually rigid at mesophilic temperatures (10 - 45 degrees C). The increased rigidity at mesophilic temperatures may find a structural determinant in increased compactness. In thermophilic proteins a number of amino acids are often exchanged. These exchanges with some strategic placement of proline in beta-turns give rise to a stabilization of the protein. Mutagenesis experiments have confirmed this statement. From the comparative analysis of the X-ray structures available for several families of proteins, including at least one thermophilic structure in each case, it appears that thermal stabilization is accompanied by an increase in hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Thermostability appears also related to a better packing within <b>buried</b> <b>regions.</b> Despite these generalisations, no universal rules can be found in these proteins to achieve thermostability.

50|$|The granite and {{sedimentary}} rock {{that makes up}} much of the North Fork John Day Wilderness reflect the Blue Mountains' history as a volcanic island archipelago in the Pacific Ocean some 250 million years ago. As the {{crust of the earth}} shifted, the archipelago collided with the advancing North American Plate approximately 200 million years ago. Later, bubbles of less dense granitic rock, or batholiths, rose through the sediment to form the granite cores of the Elkhorn and Greenhorn ranges. Columbia River basalt flows <b>buried</b> the <b>region</b> some 15 million years ago, the remains of which can be seen today in the rimrock on the benchlands in the western portion of the wilderness.|$|R
40|$|Processing of {{a protein}} antigen into {{fragments}} {{is believed to}} be a prerequisite for its presentation by the antigen-presenting cell to the T cell. This model would predict that, in oligomeric proteins, T cells prepared with specificity for <b>regions</b> that are <b>buried</b> within subunit association surfaces should recognize the respective regions in vitro equally well on the isolated subunit or on the oligomer. Three hemoglobin (Hb) alpha-chain synthetic peptides, corresponding to areas that are situated either completely [alpha-(31 - 45) ] or partially [alpha-(41 - 45) and alpha-(81 - 95) ] within the interface between the alpha and beta subunits of Hb, and a fourth peptide representing a completely exposed area in tetrameric Hb were used as immunogens in SJL/J (H- 2 s) mice. Peptide-primed T cells were passaged in vitro with the respective peptide to obtain peptide-specific T-lymphocyte lines. T-cell clones were isolated from these lines by limiting dilution. T-cell lines and clones that were specific for <b>buried</b> <b>regions</b> in the subunit association surfaces recognized the free peptide and the isolated subunit but not the Hb tetramer. On the other hand, T cells with specificity against regions that are not involved in subunit interaction and are completely exposed in the tetramer recognized the peptide, the isolated subunit, and the oligomeric protein equally well. The responses of the T-cell lines and clones were major histocompatibility complex-restricted. Since the same x-irradiated antigen-presenting cells were employed, the results could not be attributed to differences or defects in Hb processing. The findings indicate that in vitro the native (unprocessed and undissociated) oligomeric protein was the trigger of major histocompatibility complex-restricted T-cell responses...|$|R
