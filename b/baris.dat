5|$|The Ancient Greek term acra {{was used}} to {{describe}} other fortified structures during the Hellenistic period. The Acra is often called the Seleucid Acra to distinguish it from references to the Ptolemaic <b>Baris</b> as an acra and from the later quarter in Jerusalem which inherited the name Acra.|$|E
5|$|<b>Baris</b> stubbornly holds Kirk {{responsible}} for this apparent fiasco, and Koloth additionally demands an apology from Kirk after some of the Enterprise crew are provoked into a brawl with the Klingons in the station's bar. However, the tribbles reveal {{the identity of a}} Klingon agent masquerading as a human: Arne Darvin (Charlie Brill), Baris' own assistant. He had infected the grain with a virus that becomes an inert material in an organism's bloodstream which eventually prevents the organism from taking in enough nourishment to survive.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, the {{officials}} {{were chosen for}} the final by UEFA, led by Turkish referee Cüneyt Çakır. His compatriots Bahattin Duran and Tarık Ongun were chosen as assistant referees, and fellow Turks Hüseyin Göçek and <b>Barış</b> Şimşek the additional assistants, with Mustafa Emre Eyisoy the reserve assistant. Jonas Eriksson, of Sweden, was chosen as fourth official. Çakır is a UEFA elite referee, and has refereed at UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, {{as well as the}} 2012 FIFA Club World Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{is called}} to Deep Space Station K7 by a {{distress}} call. It is near Sherman's Planet, a world whose ownership is under dispute between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. On arrival, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) becomes furious when he finds out {{the reason for the}} distress call, which was made by station manager Lurry (Whit Bissell) by the orders of Nilz <b>Baris</b> (William Schallert), the Undersecretary of Agriculture for the sector: <b>Baris</b> wants someone to guard the shipments of quadrotriticale (related to triticale) grain bound for Sherman's Planet, since quadrotriticale is the only Earth grain that would grow on Sherman's Planet and thus is required to resolve the ownership issue. Kirk assigns two crewmen to guard the grain, but afterwards learns that Starfleet Command share Baris' concerns. In addition, a Klingon ship commanded by Captain Koloth (William Campbell) arrives, who requests permission for his crew to board K7 for shore leave. Kirk agrees, but limits the number of Klingons at any one time and they must travel under Starfleet guard while on the station.|$|E
5|$|Thus in this version, Simon did not {{immediately}} demolish the Acra, but instead had it occupied and may even have resided within it himself. 1 Maccabees does not mention its ultimate fate. The fortress had been built as an internal checkpoint to monitor and control Jerusalem and its population. If situated in the City of David as most scholars agree, its location would have added very little to Jerusalem's defenses against external threats. It may have fallen out of use and been dismantled {{around the end of}} the 2nd century BCE following the construction of the Hasmonean <b>Baris</b> and Hasmonean Palace in Jerusalem's upper city.|$|E
5|$|Following Alexander the Great's {{death in}} 323BCE, Judea was contested between the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt, and the Seleucid Empire based in Syria and Mesopotamia. Seleucid emperor AntiochusIII's victory over Egypt in the Battle of Panium brought Judea under Seleucid control. The Jewish {{population}} of Jerusalem had aided Antiochus during his siege of the <b>Baris,</b> the fortified base of Jerusalem's Egyptian garrison. Their support {{was rewarded with}} a charter affirming Jewish religious autonomy, including barring foreigners and impure animals from the Temple's precincts, and an allocation of official funds {{for the maintenance of}} certain religious rituals in the Temple. Despite being allowed religious freedom, many Jews were enticed by and adopted elements of the prestigious and influential Greek lifestyle. The imperial culture offered a route to political and material advancement, and this {{led to the formation of}} Hellenistic elites among the Jewish population. Hellenization produced tensions between observant Jews and their brethren who had assimilated Greek culture.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{a tribute}} album was {{released}} {{under the name}} Yüreğimdeki <b>Barış</b> Şarkıları ("Songs of <b>Barış</b> (Peace) In My Heart"), featuring 15 popular Turkish artists of such diverse genres like arabesque, pop and rock (both Anatolian and western style) demonstrating his wide range of influence.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish premiere was in 2016 in Istanbul {{featuring}} Yilmaz Sutcu as Hedwig and Ayse Gunyuz as Yitzhak, with {{direction by}} <b>Baris</b> Arman at Kazan Dairesi.|$|E
25|$|Akarsu {{was born}} and raised in Amasra, in {{northern}} Turkey. He was a huge fan of rock music, listening to music from Ruhi Su, Cem Karaca and <b>Barış</b> Manço as well as Western acts like Led Zeppelin or U2.|$|E
25|$|<b>Barış</b> Manço {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} Turkish musicians. In his early career he and his bands contributed to the Turkish rock movement by combining traditional Turkish music with rock influences, which is still one of the main trends of Turkish popular music.|$|E
25|$|<b>Barış</b> Akarsu (June 29, 1979 – July 4, 2007) was a Turkish rock {{musician}} and actor who rose to fame {{after winning the}} television series Akademi Türkiye (Academy Turkey) in July 2004. He released two studio albums in three years and was also acting in television series Yalancı Yarim (My Lying Lover) which aired on Star TV.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{documents}} linking to the Ergenekon conspiracy are {{the basis}} of the case against <b>Barış</b> Terkoğlu, Ahmet Şık, Nedim Şener and the other detainees in the OdaTV case. Examinations of the documents conducted by computer experts at Boğaziçi University, Yıldız Technical University, Middle East Technical University and the American data processing company DataDevastation have refuted the validity of the documents and concluded that outside sources targeted the journalists’ computers. Rare and malicious computer viruses, including Autorun-BJ and , allowed the placement of the documents to go unnoticed by the defendants. Another judicial report prepared by the governmental agency Tübitak also confirmed the infection by malicious viruses but couldn't neither confirm nor reject any outside intervention. A second report rejected the journalists' claims on the basis that the documents had been created before the computers were infected. Yet another review of the OdaTV evidence by digital forensics company Arsenal Consulting revealed that local attacks, which required physical access, were responsible for delivery of the incriminating documents to <b>Barış</b> Pehlivan’s OdaTV computer.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish rock scene {{began in}} the mid- to late 1960s, when popular United States and United Kingdom bands became well-known. Soon, a distinctively Turkish fusion of rock and folk emerged; this was called Anatolian rock, a term which {{nowadays}} may be generically ascribed to most of Turkish rock. Cem Karaca and <b>Barış</b> Manço are the best known performers and Moğollar is the best known group of older classical Anatolian rock music.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1963, he moved to Europe, {{travelling}} around Paris and Liège, where he formed bands with local musicians and recorded some singles mainly in English and in French but also in Turkish. Then, in 1964, <b>Barış</b> Manço continued his studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Liège, Belgium. He toured with his band Les Mistigris (not related to Mistigris) in Germany, Belgium, France and Turkey until 1967.|$|E
25|$|On June 29, 2007, Akarsu and {{two friends}} {{were on their}} way to a celebration party for his {{birthday}} in Bodrum. Their car collided with a truck at an intersection with no traffic lights. The driver of the car, Zeynep Koçak,and passenger Nalan Kahraman died on the day of the accident. <b>Barış</b> Akarsu was transported to a hospital with severe injuries. On July 4, 2007, Akarsu died due to complications arising from the accident.|$|E
25|$|<b>Barış</b> Akarsu {{released}} his first album “Islak Islak” followed by his second “Dusmeden Bulutlarda Kosmam Gerek” released in August 2006. He appeared on music videos for his songs “Islak Islak”, “Kimdir O”, “Mavi” and “Amasra” {{from his first}} and “Vurdum En Dibe Kadar” and “Yaz Demedim” from his second album. He composed and wrote the lyrics for “Ben” and “Yeter Be” from his second album. At {{the time of his}} death, he was working on his unreleased third album.|$|E
25|$|The troops {{then set}} about filling the ditch {{protecting}} {{the northern part}} of the Temple enclosure and building two ramparts, one next to the <b>Baris</b> and the other on the west, while the defenders, from their superior position, sought to hinder Roman efforts. When the banks were complete, Pompey erected siege towers and brought up siege engines and battering rams from Tyre. Under the protection of slingers driving the defenders from the walls, these began to batter the walls surrounding the Temple. After three months, Pompey's troops finally managed to overthrow one of the Baris' towers and were able to enter the Temple precinct, both from the citadel and from the west. First over the wall was Faustus Cornelius Sulla, son of the former dictator and a senior officer in Pompey's army. He was followed by two centurions, Furius and Fabius, each leading a cohort, and the Romans soon overcame the defending Jews. 12,000 were slaughtered, while only a few Romans troops were killed.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately for Pompey, Hyrcanus II {{still had}} {{supporters}} in the city. They opened a gate, probably situated in the northwestern {{part of the city}} wall, and let the Romans in. This allowed Pompey to take hold of Jerusalem's upper city, including the Royal Palace, while Aristobulus' party held the eastern portions of the city—the Temple Mount and the City of David. The Jews consolidated their hold by breaking down the bridge over the Tyropoeon Valley connecting the upper city with the Temple Mount. Pompey offered them the chance to surrender, but when they refused, he began prosecuting the siege with vigour. Pompey had his forces construct a wall of circumvallation around the areas held by the Jews and then pitched his camp within the wall, {{to the north of the}} Temple. Here stood a saddle allowing access to Temple, and it was therefore guarded by the citadel known as the <b>Baris,</b> augmented by a ditch. A second camp was erected south-east of the Temple.|$|E
25|$|The HDP first {{participated in}} the 2014 local elections, where it ran in most provinces in western Turkey while the DBP ran in the Kurdish south-east. The two parties {{combined}} gained 6.2% of the total votes but HDP failed to win any municipalities. Selahattin Demirtaş was the party's candidate for the 2014 presidential election, where he won 9.77% of the vote with support mostly coming from south-eastern Turkey. The 21 MPs from the Peace and Democracy Party, the predecessor of the DBP, joined the HDP on 28 August 2014. For the June 2015 general election, the HDP took the decision to field candidates as a party despite the danger of potentially falling below the 10% threshold. Even {{though most of the}} politicians from HDP are secular left-wing Kurds, the candidate list included devout Muslims, socialists, Alevis, Armenians, Syriac Christians, Azerbaijanis, Circassians, Lazi, Romanis and LGBT activists. Of the 550 candidates, 268 were women. In 2015, <b>Barış</b> Sulu was the first openly gay parliamentary candidate in Turkey as a candidate of the HDP.|$|E
500|$|The Acra was not {{the first}} Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources {{indicate}} that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic <b>Baris,</b> had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the <b>Baris</b> is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The <b>Baris</b> fell to AntiochusIII {{at the turn of the}} 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the <b>Baris</b> was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the <b>Baris</b> and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the [...] "impious or wicked" [...] had [...] "remained" [...] rather than [...] "dwelt" [...] in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.|$|E
500|$|<b>Baris</b> is a {{traditional}} dance of Bali, in which a solo dancer depicts the feelings of a young warrior prior to battle. Originally, <b>Baris</b> was performed as a religious ritual. [...] The dancer may bear a kris, a spear, a bow, or other weapons, depending on the variant performed. [...] The word [...] "Baris" [...] literally means [...] "line" [...] or [...] "file", and referred {{to the line of}} soldiers who served the rajas of Bali. The dance is usually performed by men in a group with as few as four dancers and as many as ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of casting, William Schallert had just {{finished}} filming the ABC sitcom The Patty Duke Show. He described himself not as a fan, and had not read any science fiction since 1948. He thought {{that the role of}} Nilz <b>Baris</b> was just another guest spot, and the role of a [...] "rather stuffy bureaucrat... not the most appealing character". He did not remember the character's name, only recalling it when he first attended a Star Trek convention at a hotel near Los Angeles Airport, as the fans called it out when he entered the lobby. He was later cast {{in the role of the}} Bajoran musician Varani in the DS9 episode [...] "".|$|E
500|$|Around 500 tribbles {{were created}} for the episode, with special tribbles created for certain {{purposes}} with beanbags or surgical balloons inserted in them. Three additional sets were {{created for the}} episode, although there were problems with finding enough matching chairs for the trading post area. The chairs had to be pulled out of showrooms around Los Angeles County, and Pevney was warned {{to make sure they}} were not damaged during the episode's brawl scene. William Campbell had previously appeared as Trelane in [...] "The Squire of Gothos" [...] and was intended to be a recurring villain as Koloth. Because of his other work commitments, these plans were not followed up on until he returned as Koloth in the [...] episode [...] "" [...] in 1994. William Schallert appeared as Nilz <b>Baris,</b> and later appeared as a Bajoran in the DS9 episode [...] "".|$|E
500|$|Marrash often {{included}} {{poems in}} his works, written in muwashshah and zajal forms {{according to the}} occasion. Shmuel Moreh has stated that Marrash tried to introduce [...] "a revolution in diction, themes, metaphor and imagery in modern Arabic poetry", sometimes even mocking conventional poetic themes. In the introduction to his poetry book Mir'at al-Hasna (The Mirror of the Beautiful One), which {{was first published in}} 1872, Marrash rejected even the traditional genres of Arabic poetry, particularly panegyrics and lampoons. His use of conventional diction for new ideas marked the rise of a new stage in Arabic poetry which was carried on by the Mahjaris. Shmuel Moreh has also considered some passages from Ghabat al-haqq and Rihlat <b>Baris</b> to be prose poetry, while Salma Khadra Jayyusi has described his prosaic writing as [...] "often Romantic in tone, rising sometimes to poetic heights, declamatory, vivid, colourful and musical", calling it the first example of poetic prose in modern Arabic literature.|$|E
500|$|In 1867, Marrash {{published}} Rihlat <b>Baris,</b> {{an account}} of his second journey to Paris. The book begins {{with a description of}} his progress from Aleppo to İskenderun, Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Jaffa, Alexandria, Cairo, and then back to Alexandria from which he had boarded a ship to Marseille, where he arrived in October 1866. The Arab cities had inspired in him revulsion and indifference, except Alexandria and Cairo, where Ismail Pasha had already begun modernization projects. He had then travelled through France, with a stopover in Lyon before ending up in Paris. Marrash was fascinated by France, and by Paris the most; everything he described in his account, from the Paris Exhibition of 1867 to gas lighting in the streets, served to praise the accomplishments of Western civilization. [...] In Mashhad al-ahwal ("The Witnessing of the Stages of Human Life"), published in 1870, Marrash would again compare the East and the West, writing that [...] "while the East sank deeper into darkness, the West embraced light". The optimism he had formerly expressed about the first reform currents under the reign of Sultan Abdülaziz in the Ottoman Empire gave way to pessimism in Mashhad al-ahwal, as he realized these reforms were superficial and that those he had hoped for would not soon come into being. Yet, in Durr al-sadaf fi ghara'ib al-sudaf (Pearl Shells in Relating Strange Coincidences), which he published two years later, he depicted the Lebanese social life of his day and criticised the blind imitation of Western customs {{and the use of the}} French language in everyday life.|$|E
500|$|The US and UK {{were the}} major centres of {{psychedelic}} music, {{but in the}} late 1960s scenes began to develop across the world, including continental Europe, Australasia, Asia and south and Central America. In the later 1960s psychedelic scenes developed in {{a large number of}} countries in continental Europe, including the Netherlands with bands like The Outsiders, Denmark where it was pioneered by Steppeulvene, and Germany, where musicians began to fuse music of psychedelia and the electronic avant-garde. 1968 saw the first major German rock festival in , and the foundation of the Zodiak Free Arts Lab in Berlin by Hans-Joachim Roedelius, and Conrad Schnitzler, which helped bands like Tangerine Dream and Amon Düül achieve cult status. A thriving psychedelic music scene in Cambodia, influenced by psychedelic rock and soul broadcast by US forces radio in Vietnam, was pioneered by artists such as Sinn Sisamouth and Ros Sereysothea. In South Korea, Shin Jung-Hyeon, often considered the godfather of Korean rock, played psychedelic-influenced music for the American soldiers stationed in the country. [...] Following Shin Jung-Hyeon, the band San Ul Lim (Mountain Echo) often combined psychedelic rock with a more folk sound. In Turkey, Anatolian rock artist Erkin Koray blended classic Turkish music and Middle Eastern themes into his psychedelic-driven rock, helping to found the Turkish rock scene with artists such as Cem Karaca, Mogollar and <b>Baris</b> Manco. In Brasil the Tropicalia movement merged Brazilian and African rhythms with psychedelic rock. Musicians who were part of the movement include Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Os Mutantes, Gal Costa, Tom Zé, and the poet/lyricist Torquato Neto, all of whom participated in the 1968 album , which served as a musical manifesto.|$|E

Beginning his musical career while attending Galatasaray High School, {{he was a}} pioneer of rock music in Turkey {{and one of the}} founders of the Anatolian rock genre. Manço composed around 200 songs and is among the best-selling and most awarded Turkish artists to date. Many of his songs were translated into a variety of languages including English, French, Japanese, Greek, Italian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Persian, Hebrew, Urdu, Arabic, and German, among others. Through his TV program, 7'den 77'ye ("From 7 to 77"), Manço traveled the world and visited most countries on the globe. He remains one of the most popular public figures of Turkey.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Barış</b> Manço {{was born}} in Üsküdar, Istanbul, Turkey on 2 January 1943. His mother, Rikkat Uyanık, was a famous singer in the early 1940s. His older brother, who was born during World War II, was named Savaş ("war" [...] in Turkish) while he was named <b>Barış</b> ("peace" [...] in Turkish) by his parents to {{celebrate}} {{the end of the}} war. At birth, he was additionally named Tosun Yusuf after his deceased uncle Yusuf called Tosun (literally: Joseph the Sturdy). However, this name was erased just before he attended the primary school.|$|E
2500|$|As a last {{attempt to}} reach {{international}} success, he released the LP titled <b>Baris</b> Mancho (1976), a strange transcription of his name, mostly with George Hayes Orchestra under CBS Records label, in Europe and South Africa. Although the album {{did not bring}} the fame he was expecting, it did reach {{the top of the}} charts in Romania and Morocco. The following year, the album was released in Turkey under the title Nick the Chopper. [...] In 1975 he starred in the movie Baba Bize Eversene (Father make us marry) which is the only movie he ever starred during his career. The music of the movie consists of a compilation of tracks composed by <b>Barış</b> Manço and Kurtalan Ekspres.|$|E
