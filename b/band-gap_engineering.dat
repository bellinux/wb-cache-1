50|$|Based on Newton’s {{observation}} we {{can conclude}} that a key factor for acoustic <b>band-gap</b> <b>engineering</b> is impedance mismatch between periodic elements comprising the crystal and the surrounding medium. When an advancing wave-front meets a material with very high impedance it will tend to increase its phase velocity through that medium. Likewise, when the advancing wave-front meets a low impedance medium it will slow down. We can exploit this concept with periodic (and handcrafted) arrangements of impedance mismatched elements to affect acoustic waves in the crystal - essentially <b>band-gap</b> <b>engineering.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Band-gap</b> <b>engineering</b> is {{the process}} of {{controlling}} or altering the band gap of a material. This is typically done to semiconductors by controlling the composition of alloys or constructing layered materials with alternating compositions. A band gap is the range in a solid where no electron state can exist. The band gap of insulators is much larger than in semiconductors. Conductors or metals have a much smaller or nonexistent band gap than semiconductors since the valence and conduction bands overlap. Controlling the band gap allows for the creation of desirable electrical properties.|$|E

40|$|Architected {{material}} used {{to control}} elastic wave propagation has thus far relied on two mechanisms for forming band gaps, or frequency ranges that cannot propagate: (i) Phononic crystals rely on their structural periodicity to form Bragg band gaps, but are limited in the low-frequency ranges because their unit cell size scales with wavelength; and (ii) Metamaterials overcome this size dependence because they rely on local resonances, but the resulting band gaps are very narrow. Here, we introduce a class of materials, elastic metastructures, that exploit resonating elements to broaden and lower Bragg gaps while reducing {{the mass of the}} system.

Microscopy, infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements are carried out to investigate the properties of SWNTs after hydrogenation. Structural deformations, drastically reduced electrical conductance and increased semiconducting nature of SWNTs upon sidewall hydrogenation are observed. These changes are reversible upon thermal annealing at 500 C via dehydrogenation. Harsh plasma or high temperature reactions lead to etching of nanotube likely via hydro-carbonation. Smaller SWNTs are markedly less stable against hydro-carbonation than larger tubes.

Extending the study to nanoribbon geometry shows that reduction of dimensionality makes the tendency to phase segregation of the two phases even stronger.

The data reveal the presence of localized states within a transport gap, whose interactions lead to a soft Coulomb gap and associated Efros-Shklovskii variable range hopping (ES-VRH). This conduction type is preserved upon application of magnetic fields up to 1 Tesla, above which a transition to Mott variable range hopping occurs.
