5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man who was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits {{what appears to be the}} visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may <b>be,</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

500|$|For all {{of their}} efficiency, atomic line filters are not perfect; there are many sources of error, or [...] "noise", in a given system. These are {{manifest}} as electromagnetic radiation independent of the working processes of the filter {{and the intensity of}} the signal light. One source of error is the thermal radiation of and within the ALF itself. Some thermal radiation comes directly from the filter and happens to be within the bandpass of the second broad band filter. More noise is created if the filter is designed for output in the infrared range, as most of the thermal radiation would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> spectrum. These emissions may stimulate the vapor and create the radiation it is trying to detect in the first place.|$|E

After plans for [...] "Ame wa Kimagure" [...] to become the leading song were scrapped, Yamaguchi decided to {{elaborate}} on the [...] "oriental" [...] feel of the song. [...] "Malaysia 32" [...] is the band's first instrumental song, and was based on a synthesizer riff made by the band's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera which was then completed with ideas from everyone in the band. The song was called [...] "Malaysia" [...] because of how at one point they added a vocal melody that sounded like the name of the city Kuala Lumpur.
