500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Hollywood studios had {{contacted}} George R.R. Martin about possible adaptation {{of his book}} series A Song of Ice and Fire into a film, however Martin expressed the opinion the books could not {{be made into a}} film as too much would have to be cut from the books, but thought it could be made into a television series. In January 2006, David Benioff spoke to Martin's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption, and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to David Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, called D. B. Weiss and said: [...] "Maybe I'm crazy, but I haven't had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years. So take a look <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> might make a great HBO series." [...] Weiss, who then read the first book in two days, was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books. They arranged a meeting with Martin, who asked them if they knew who Jon Snow’s real mother might be, and was satisfied with their answer.|$|E

[...] "It was the first goal I ever set for myself. It seemed like {{it would be a very}} unrealistic one." [...] She described Disney movies as [...] "the ones [...] watched over and over again when [...] was a kid," [...] and continued, [...] "I knew every line from The Little Mermaid. I love Aladdin. When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, [...] "Ariel from The Little Mermaid. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a shift that Disney had, where a female lead—the [...] "princess," [...] I guess—didn't just want to find her mate. She was singing [...] "I want to be where the people are. I want to see the world. I want to venture outside my comfort zone."" [...] Bell described her initial reaction when she first found that she was cast as [...] "I was in glee". Lee admitted Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened a couple of vocal tracks from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World" [...] that the actress recorded when she was young, stating that without these recordings, it would've been very difficult to the find the right one to play Anna.|$|E
500|$|Case {{said she}} was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior. New head writer Josh Griffith told TV Guide that the {{character}} would reach a [...] "total mental breakdown", which would {{take her to the}} edge and beyond before being rebuilt. Griffith said the breakdown would help her find salvation, with a [...] "stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon" [...] emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol. Griffith stated that the damage Sharon has done to the Newman family is [...] "physical, professional and emotional". After seeing a doctor, Sharon is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and begins treatment; however, she is alarmed after discovering she must take prescribed medication, possibly {{for the rest of her}} life. Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, [...] "When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but it worked out perfectly and explained all of Sharon’s past behavior. I applaud Josh for making that decision <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> makes the most sense considering her history." [...] The actress in addition was pleased that she didn't have to continue justifying Sharon's questionable actions.|$|E

500|$|Never Let Me Gos {{score was}} {{composed}} by British composer Rachel Portman. She worked on Never Let Me Gos music for four months. Portman {{said that because}} of the film's sad themes, she wanted to [...] "put some hope" [...] and humanity into the music. It was important to her that there be a [...] "real emotional heartbeat {{in the midst of this}} story." [...] Believing that a [...] "huge sweeping score" [...] would not have fit Never Let Me Go, she instead worked with a smaller orchestra of no more than 48 players. At the urgent request of the director and the producers, she tried other approaches, such as the use of a child's voice and what was described as a [...] "big finale cue." [...] In the end, they went for a simpler and more subtle approach. Stating that most of the score was written for piano, strings and harp, with solos for violin and cello, she called her score something of a [...] "chamber piece". [...] "If you use a solo instrument, it's like having a voice", she says. [...] "It highlights the emotion." [...] But, she adds, [...] "the violin is played with virtually no vibrato, because I didn't ever want it to sound sentimental". She notes that [...] "for my own taste, I stay on the side of restraint, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> works better in film". Her work on Never Let Me Go earned her a San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Score.|$|E

[...] He explains that the song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions, and author Ed Morales observes that [...] "It's a calling out of the morality of Latin America. [...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking people to go on that journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music). [...] Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, [...] "I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them." [...] "El Avión Se Cae" [...] depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger. In [...] "Pal Norte", Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States. [...] Commenting on the track's lyrical themes, he explained [...] "I had wanted to do that theme <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is an important topic. And not just for the immigrants in the United States but all over. It is a song that immigrants can identify with, Dominicans as well as Puerto Ricans. All the people leave one country for another for the same reasons." [...] Although much of the album addresses immigration and moving to different countries, [...] "La Crema" [...] is a celebration of living in Puerto Rico.|$|E

2500|$|The {{overwhelmingly}} positive British {{response to}} the film led to its critical and commercial success throughout Europe.

The great virtue of the film is the way it grabs hold of its audience and simply refuses to let go. It exploits all our fears of irrational violence and unmotivated attack, {{and at the same time}} manages to laugh at itself without spoiling the tension - a very considerable feat. Carpenter, who is clearly a director with places to go, has succeeded in making a comedy that scares the pants off us. And don't think you're laughing at it. As a matter of fact, it's laughing at you." [...] Malcolm later wrote that he held some reservations about the film: [...] "I don't feel like going on and on about the movie, partly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is in grave danger of being oversold anyway, and partly because it isn't much more to me than tremendous fun".

But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy.
