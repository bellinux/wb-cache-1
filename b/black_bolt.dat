500|$|In November 2016, Marvel Television and IMAX Corporation {{announced}} Marvel's Inhumans, to {{be produced}} in conjunction with ABC Studios. The series' first two episodes were filmed entirely on IMAX digital cameras, and premiered on IMAX screens on September 1, 2017, for two weeks. ABC will then broadcast the series weekly starting with the first two episodes on September 29, 2017, with the network airing {{of the first two}} episodes featuring exclusive content, outside of the versions screened on IMAX. Select action sequences {{in the rest of the}} series were also shot on IMAX. The series was neither intended to be a reworking of the planned film from Marvel Studios, nor a spin-off from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ben Sherwood, president of Disney–ABC Television Group, added that [...] "We’ve worked very carefully with our friends at Marvel Studios—and this is a critical point—to make sure that calendar-wise and content-wise we are only enhancing" [...] the MCU; the theatrical debut of the series was timed to not interfere with the release of any Marvel Studios films. In December 2016, Scott Buck was announced as showrunner and executive producer for the series. In February 2017, Anson Mount was cast as <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt.</b> Filming began in March 2017 in Hawaii, and concluded in June.|$|E
50|$|Gorgon first {{leaves the}} Inhuman city of Attilan to rescue Medusa (suffering from amnesia at the time), who became {{lost in the}} outside world.

50|$|The once-secret {{existence}} of the race has come to light among the general public as the Inhumans interact more often with many of Earth's superheroes—including the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and the X-Men—whom they have aided against threats such as Doctor Doom, Ultron 7, Magneto, and Apocalypse. However, nobody came to the Inhumans' aid when an army of Portuguese mercenaries attacked Attilan, which was now located on risen Atlantean ruins. This was actually a coup-d'etat orchestrated by <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt's</b> brother Maximus the Mad.|$|R
50|$|The Inhumans and the Kree later form an {{alliance}} with the Badoon alongside the Centaurians, the Dire Wraiths, and the Kymellians. They were put through the same experimental procedure so that they cannot be harmed by the Terrigen Mists. The Badoons' procedure had them going through Amphogenesis upon injecting one drop of the diluted water from the dormant Amphogen (a mutagenic substance). The Badoons were present on Earth's moon upon <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt's</b> return and when the prophecy of the four cities is known.|$|R
500|$|The episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] {{introduces}} the Kree alien {{race to the}} MCU, members of which {{play a significant role}} in Guardians of the Galaxy. This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something [...] "in the works" [...] for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be [...] "one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film." [...] The third season {{introduces the}} concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the [...] "writer and director [...] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that." [...] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt</b> and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
2500|$|The story {{continues}} in the limited series Son of M, with Quicksilver, desperate to regain his powers, exposing himself to the Terrigen Mist (the source of the Inhumans' mutations and abilities) and inserts Terrigen crystals into his body—all without permission from <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt.</b> Courtesy of the Terrigen crystals, Quicksilver gains new [...] "time jumping" [...] powers and kidnaps his daughter Luna. Quicksilver discovers the crystals can restore mutant abilities but have an extreme effect on non-Inhuman physiology, causing several deaths. Quicksilver and Crystal meet again in the direct sequel, limited series Silent War, when <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt</b> demands {{the return of the}} crystals. When Crystal sees how he has mutated, she declares their marriage annulled according to Inhuman law.|$|E
2500|$|In issue 11 and 12 of the Earth X series, <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt</b> calls upon Galactus to come {{destroy the}} Celestial seed growing within Earth.

50|$|He {{was later}} sent to Earth with Gorgon {{in an attempt}} to find <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt's</b> missing son with Daredevil's help. There he and his companions fought against Ultron-13 in which Karnak's power allowed him to {{discover}} the weak spot in Ultron's neck. Later they became entangled in Mephisto's plot against Daredevil, and were transported to a netherworld where they were personally attacked by the supernatural entity known as Blackheart. Karnak's animosity towards Gorgon was fanned into a rage, causing actual physical violence. Blackheart was soon defeated and the group went their intended ways.|$|R
5000|$|Crystal {{appears in}} Guardians of the Galaxy, voiced by Vanessa Marshall. In the episode [...] "Crystal Blue Persuasion," [...] Crystal {{is among the}} Inhumans that were {{affected}} by a Terrigen Plague that caused crystals to grow on their bodies. Crystal appears {{at the end of}} the episode where Medusa thanks the Guardians of the Galaxy on <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt's</b> behalf. In the episode [...] "Inhuman Touch," [...] Star-Lord officially meets Crystal and tries to romance her to no avail. She later helps the Guardians of the Galaxy when Maximus tricks his way out of prison.|$|R
50|$|Crystal {{would later}} {{leave the city}} for a brief career with the Fantastic Four. Soon after joining, she battled the Wizard, and helped defeat Maximus. She also fought Doctor Doom {{alongside}} the Fantastic Four. She was temporarily blinded by the Mole Man, but helped the Fantastic Four defeat him. She was abducted by Medusa and reunited with the Torch in Atillan. She revealed how she had used her powers to save <b>Black</b> <b>Bolt's</b> life, and then rejoined the Fantastic Four.

40|$|In current timber design, member {{sizes are}} often {{determined}} {{by the need to}} have an adequate section size for jointing. The use of high performance jointing systems has the potential to achieve substantial reductions in the volume of timber used in conventional structures such as roof trusses. In this programme four different jointing systems which are suitable for large timber sections have been tested: Standard <b>black</b> <b>bolts,</b> Split ring/shear plates, resin bonded steel dowels and butt joints with uni-axial glass reinforcement. The results have shown that the shear plates and the glass-reinforced joints offered the best performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} the European design code for timber structures (EC 5) will facilitate a number of design options previously unsupported by British Standards. This code uses design equations that need characteristic material data, which exists for solid timber and some sheet materials, {{but not for the}} structural timber composites that were evaluated in this research. In this programme high-tensile steel <b>black</b> <b>bolts</b> have been used with solid timber, glulam and two commercially available structural timber composites — Microlam™ and Parallam™. The results suggest that the timber composites offer similar performance to high-density timbers in line with EC 5 design guidance...|$|R
