40|$|The {{species of}} squid {{referred}} to as Loligo brasiliensis Blainville, 1823 by Castellanos and Cazzaniga (1979) <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Loligo sanpaulensis (Brakoniecki, 1984). The name Loligo brasiliensis <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a nomen dubium. Loligo gahi d'Orbigny, 1835 and L. sanpaulensis are redescribed and illustrated. Loligo patagonica Smith, 1881 <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a synonym of L. gahi. Loligo ellipsura Hoyle, 1885 <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a nomen dubium.

5|$|Ethylene glycol {{was once}} thought innocuous; in 1931 it was {{suggested}} as being suitable {{for use as a}} vehicle or solvent for injectable pharmaceutical preparations. Numerous cases of poisoning have been reported since then, and it has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> toxic to humans.|$|E
5|$|In the past, it {{was thought}} that {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic liver disease are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, copernicium is a d-block transactinide element.

50|$|Again, this 2-size {{algorithm}} <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strongly-competitive. The generalized k-size algorithm which <b>is</b> similar <b>to</b> the 2-size algorithm <b>is</b> then <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> O(log)-competitive.|$|R
40|$|Upward {{combustion}} of 316 {{stainless steel}} (SS) rods is discussed and a combustion model is presented. The effects of varying oxygen pressure and rod diameter on the rate limiting processes for combustion of 316 SS are evaluated. The rate-limiting steps for combustion up 316 SS rods <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{dependent on the}} incorporation and mass transport of oxygen in the molten mass, and heat transfer between the molten mass and rod. Both these rate-limiting steps <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dependent on rod diameter. Small (d/r/ = 0. 051 cm) 316 SS rods <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dependent on convective heat transfer, and larger rods (d/r/ not less than 0. 32 cm) <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dependent on oxygen incorporation and mass transport in the molten mass...|$|R

5|$|TgPVR21 mice have {{incorporated}} the human PVR at chromosome 13. These mice are {{less susceptible to}} poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR. TgPVR21 mice have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> susceptible to poliovirus infection through intranasal inoculation, and may be useful as a mucosal infection model.|$|E
5|$|The Anthology of Pliny's Natural History is an {{epitome of}} Pliny the Elder's Natural History {{dedicated}} to King Henry II of England.

5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of these}} patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the MELD score) has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a determinant of outcome.

40|$|AbstractCertain {{infinite}} Thue systems over {{a finite}} alphabet are studied, in particular, systems S⊆∑∗×(∑∪{e}) such that for each aϵ∑∪{e}, the set {u| (u,a) ϵS} is a context-freelanguage. The syntactic structure of sets of ancestors and sets of descendants is considered, {{as well as}} that of unions of congruence classes, taken over (infinite) context-free languages or regular sets. The common descendant problem <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tractable while the common ancestor problem <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> undecidable (even for finite systems). The word problem for confluent systems of this type <b>is</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tractable.

5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
