5|$|During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos {{relocated}} to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming the Swift Current Broncos. Sakic, {{playing in his}} first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, {{he and his team}} faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the Regina Pats, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of <b>black</b> <b>ice</b> outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.|$|E
5|$|The band's next album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You, {{was their}} first album to reach {{number one in the}} United States. Drummer Phil Rudd was fired in 1983 and {{replaced}} by ex-A II Z drummer Simon Wright, who left to join Dio in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of The Razors Edge. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after Chris Slade, who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album Ballbreaker. Stiff Upper Lip, released in 2000, was well received by critics. The band's studio album, <b>Black</b> <b>Ice,</b> released in 2008, was the second highest-selling album of that year, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to Rock, eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement due to early-onset dementia and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss, and Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player Cliff Williams retired from the band {{at the end of their}} 2016 Rock Or Bust world tour.|$|E

25|$|Fuel lines {{can also}} be {{attacked}} by another form of degradation: hydrolysis. Nylon 6,6 is susceptible to acid hydrolysis, and in one accident, a fractured fuel line led to a spillage of diesel into the road. If diesel fuel leaks onto the road, accidents to following cars {{can be caused by}} the slippery nature of the deposit, which is like <b>black</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diesel is less {{flammable}} than gasoline/petroleum spirit. However, {{because it}} evaporates slowly, spills on a roadway can pose slip hazard to vehicles. After the light fractions have evaporated, a greasy slick is {{left on the}} road which reduces tire grip and traction, and can cause vehicles to skid. The loss of traction {{is similar to that}} encountered on <b>black</b> <b>ice,</b> resulting in especially dangerous situations for two-wheeled vehicles, such as motorcycles and bicycles, in roundabouts.|$|E
