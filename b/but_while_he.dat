5|$|Krishna and his siblings' capital becomes Dvaravati. The Arjuna and Krishna {{interaction}} {{is missing in}} the Jataka version. A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson. The Jataka tale also includes an internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by {{the hand of a}} hunter named Jara, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> is traveling to a frontier city. Mistaking Krishna for a pig, Jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet, causing Krishna great pain and then his death.|$|E

It is during this time that Peter learns May Parker is alive and Osborn's actress died in her place. Osborn's complete madness is evident, as he hallucinates unmasking and killing Peter; yet in reality Peter easily defeats him. He is rescued from custody thereafter by his cabal of henchmen.|$|E
5|$|As Chief of the Intelligence Division, Matsui was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Chiang Kai-shek, who was attempting to end the civil war in China and unify the country under his leadership. Matsui hoped that Chiang would succeed and form a strong partnership with Japan to resist both Western influence in Asia and communism. However, Matsui's tenure in office was punctuated by a series of crises. Against Matsui's advice the Japanese government sent troops to the Chinese city of Jinan in 1928 to protect Japanese property and civilians, but they ended up clashing with the Chinese Army. Matsui headed to Jinan to help settle the affair, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> was still there Japanese army officers assassinated Zhang Zuolin, the warlord leader of Manchuria. Matsui, who had been a supporter of Zhang, immediately left for Manchuria to find out what had happened. He demanded that the officers responsible for the assassination be punished.|$|E
5|$|At Arsenal, Fàbregas {{also often}} assumed {{responsibility}} for set pieces, taking corners, free kicks and penalties. By his own admission, scoring was a weaker {{part of his}} game in his first few seasons at Arsenal; wasteful finishing also being symptomatic of the larger problem surrounding Arsenal in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. This changed initially in the 2007–08 season when he scored 11 goals in his first 16 games, and Arsenal manager Wenger claimed that the Spaniard's previous inability to score was down to a mental state, and even compared the Spaniard to Michel Platini, a French midfielder renowned for scoring. There were also concerns raised over {{the large number of}} games Fàbregas was playing for club and country at such a young age, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> initially avoided long spells on the sidelines, he played significantly fewer games due to injury in his last three seasons with Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{withering}} fire, Klenau's force reached Essling's edge, {{where his}} men set up 64 artillery pieces and bombarded the French {{for nearly an}} hour. Taking the village by storm, Austrian cavalry poured into the village from the north, and the French were pushed out in a methodical advance. Klenau's batteries were able to fire on the French-held bridges south of the village, over which the French had to retreat. In bitter house-to-house fighting, the Austrians entered the village. Combat at the granary was especially brutal, as Hungarian grenadiers battled unsuccessfully to dislodge the French from their positions {{in the second and}} third floors. The battle resumed at dawn of 22 April. Masséna cleared Aspern of Austrians, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> did so, Rosenberg's force stormed Jean Lannes' position at Essling. Lannes, reinforced by Vincent Saint-Hilaire's division, subsequently drove Rosenberg out of Essling. At Aspern, Masséna was driven out by Hiller and Bellegarde's counter-attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 335BC Alexander {{felt free}} to engage the Thracians and the Illyrians, <b>but,</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> was campaigning in the north, Demosthenes spread a rumour—even {{producing}} a bloodstained messenger—that Alexander {{and all of his}} expeditionary force had been slaughtered by the Triballians.* J. R. Hamilton, Alexander the Great, 48. The Thebans and the Athenians rebelled once again, financed by Darius III of Persia, and Demosthenes is said to have received about 300talents on behalf of Athens and to have faced accusations of embezzlement. Alexander reacted immediately and razed Thebes to the ground. He did not attack Athens, but demanded the exile of all anti-Macedonian politicians, Demosthenes first of all. According to Plutarch, a special Athenian embassy led by Phocion, an opponent of the anti-Macedonian faction, was able to persuade Alexander to relent.|$|E
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and left him with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E

Toyah develops a crush on Spider Nugent (Martin Hancock) and turns vegetarian to impress him. She also asks him to help save a turkey from being slaughtered for Christmas.

5|$|Vasey held {{a series}} of staff postings in Australia and India. From 1928 to 1929 he {{attended}} the Staff College at Quetta, India, where Bernard Montgomery was an instructor. In October 1934 he was appointed as a brigade major once more. Following a brief stint as a GSO2 on the headquarters of the 1st Indian Division, his final posting in India was again as a brigade major, from April 1936 to March 1937. By November 1934 his substantive rank was that of captain, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> held the brevet and local rank of major, he was not promoted to the substantive rank of major until 1 March 1935. Vasey was finally promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1937, after nearly 20 years as a major, although he was only promoted to the substantive rank on 2 November 1939. This was not unusual, and it fostered a sense of injustice and frustration among regular officers, who found themselves outranked by CMF officers who had enjoyed faster promotion.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's {{return to}} the prime ministership meant Lord Cherwell's {{return to the}} post of Paymaster General. He was a strong {{supporter}} of the atomic energy programme, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> agreed with its size and scope, he was critical of its organisation, which he blamed for slower progress than its Soviet counterpart. In particular, the programme had experienced problems with Civil Service pay and conditions, which were below those for comparable workers in industry. The Treasury had agreed to some flexibility in exceptional cases, but the procedure for doing so was absurdly slow. Hinton in particular was concerned at the low remuneration his senior staff were receiving compared with those with similar responsibilities at ICI. When he attempted to bring Frank Kearton in as his successor, the Treasury refused to adjust the salaries of his other two deputies to match. Rather than ruin his organisation's morale, Hinton had dropped the proposal to appoint Kearton. Nor could any reorganisation be carried out without Treasury approval. Within a month of assuming office, Cherwell had prepared a memorandum proposing that responsibility for the program be transferred from the Ministry of Supply to an Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E

5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief {{that the purpose of}} art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still lifes, beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, <b>but</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
