This building was eventually incorporated into the Grandmaster's Palace, and the present auberge began to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> Strada San Giacomo (now Merchants Street).

5|$|Marseillois {{was ordered}} on 16 January 1762, to <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> Toulon on a design by the {{engineer}} Coulomb, and named {{the same day}} by Louis XV, following the request of her patrons. The chamber of commerce of Marseille further requested that the ship <b>be</b> <b>built</b> <b>in</b> Marseille, but Coulomb determined that the harbour there was too shallow for the launch of a 74-gun ship, and the order for Marseillois was eventually confirmed at Toulon. There, lack of timber in the shipyards, that were already busy building Languedoc, Zélé and Bourgogne, delayed the construction of Marseillois until 1764. Her building was directed by the engineer Chapelle.|$|E

5|$|After Rome {{conquered the}} Ptolemaic kingdom in 30BC, Roman {{emperors}} {{took on the}} role of ruler and temple patron, reducing the temples' wealth and political power.

Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E
