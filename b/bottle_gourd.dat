5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd,</b> bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E
25|$|By 10,000 BCE the <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd</b> (Lagenaria siceraria) plant, {{used as a}} {{container}} {{before the advent of}} ceramic technology, appears to have been domesticated. The domesticated <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd</b> reached the Americas from Asia by 8000 BCE, most likely due to the migration of peoples from Asia to America.|$|E

American Indians raisedbottle gourds {{for use as}} bowls, scoops, colanders, ladles, spoons, can-teens and dippers. Larger gourds were used as cooking vessels.Eastern Woodland Natives hung <b>bottle</b> <b>gourds</b> on poles in their cornfields to serve as habitats for insect-eating birds (a form of biological pest-control, which the Native Americans developed). Native Americans in Northern Peru also used <b>bottle</b> <b>gourds</b> as floats for fishing nets.|$|R
5000|$|Guilá Naquitz Cave in Oaxaca, Mexico is {{the site}} of early {{domestication}} of several food crops, including teosinte (an ancestor of maize), squash from the genus Cucurbita, <b>bottle</b> <b>gourds</b> (Lagenaria siceraria), and beans. This site is the location of the earliest known evidence for domestication of any crop on the continent, Cucurbita pepo, as well as the earliest known domestication of maize.|$|R
50|$|Gourds {{continued}} to be used throughout history, in almost every culture throughout the world. European contact in North America found extensive gourd use, {{including the use of}} <b>bottle</b> <b>gourds</b> as birdhouses to attract purple martins, which provided bug control for agriculture. Almost every culture had musical instruments made of gourds, including drums, stringed instruments common to Africa and wind instruments, including the nose flutes of the Pacific.|$|R
25|$|The {{domestication}} {{of plants}} began at least 12,000 {{years ago with}} cereals in the Middle East, and the <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd</b> in Asia. Agriculture developed in at least 11 different centres around the world, domesticating different crops and animals.|$|E
25|$|Another {{plant species}} at Riverton that can {{confidently}} {{be identified as}} domesticated was sunflower (Helianthus annuus).

25|$|The {{theory of}} pre-Columbian contact across the South Pacific Ocean between South America and Polynesia has {{received}} support from several lines of evidence, although solid confirmation remains elusive. A diffusion by human agents {{has been put}} forward to explain the pre-Columbian presence in Oceania of several cultivated plant species native to South America, such as the <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd</b> (Lagenaria siceraria) or sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). Direct archaeological evidence for such pre-Columbian contacts and transport have not emerged. Similarities noted in names of edible roots in Maori and Ecuadorian languages ("kumari") and Melanesian and Chilean ("gaddu") have been inconclusive.|$|E

Prepared with condensed milk and ghee, without semolina to bind it together, {{the end result}} has a moist, yet flaky, texture when freshly prepared. Other examples include the famous Agra Petha- easily available at Taj Mahal, Agra.|$|R
40|$|This thesis gives a {{detailed}} {{overview of the}} use, production, decoration and iconography of calabashes (Crescentia cujete) and <b>bottle</b> <b>gourds</b> (Lagenaria siceraria) among the Amerindians and Maroons of Suriname. This {{is the first time}} that such an overview is made for Amerindian calabashes and gourds. Next to that it will also investigate the possible exchange between Amerindians and Maroons in relation to calabashes and <b>bottle</b> <b>gourds,</b> as it can be assumed that these two groups lived in much closer contact than previously thought. Furthermore, it will become clear that these fruits had a much more prominent role in the material culture of pre-Columbian societies. Not only did they serve as model for early pottery, but they were also used alongside their ceramic counterparts. For this research a wide range of sources is used, varying from literature research to museum collections of the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden and the Stichting Surinaams Museum in Paramaribo which is supplemented with fieldwork in Donderskamp, Konomerume, a Kari’na village along the Wayombo River. This thesis is the result of an internship at the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden and ethnoarchaeological fieldwork in Donderskamp/Konomerume, Suriname...|$|R

The {{skeletal}} remains and other finds show evidence the culture once flourished in the area. Scientists have classified three phases of cultural development. The earliest people were hunter-gatherers and fisherman. At approximately 6000 BC the culture {{were among the first to}} begin farming (<b>bottle</b> <b>gourd,</b> Lagenaria siceraria, and an early type of maize, Zea mays L.) The best known remains of the culture are The Lovers of Sumpa. These human remains and other items can be seen at Museo Los Amantes de Sumpa y Centro Cultural in Santa Elena.|$|E
25|$|Maize (corn), {{beans and}} squash {{were among the}} {{earliest}} crops domesticated in Mesoamerica, with maize beginning about 7500 BC, squash, as early as 8000 to 6000 BC and beans by no later than 4000 BC. Potatoes and manioc were domesticated in South America. In {{what is now the}} eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated sunflower, sumpweed and goosefoot around 2500 BC. At Guilá Naquitz cave in the Mexican highlands, fragments of maize pollen, <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd</b> and pepo squash were recovered and variously dated between 8000 and 7000 BC. In this area of the world people relied on hunting and gathering for several millennia to come. Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC, referred to as the formative period.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} this early {{agriculture}} {{is in the}} middle Mississippi valley, from Memphis north to St. Louis and extending about 300 miles east and west of the river, mostly in Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The oldest archaeological site known in the United States in which Indians were growing, rather than gathering, food is Phillips Spring in Missouri. At Phillips Spring, dating from 3,000 BCE, archaeologists found abundant walnuts, hickory nuts, acorns, grapes, elderberries, ragweed, <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd,</b> and the seeds of Cucurbita pepo, a gourd with edible seeds that is the ancestor of pumpkins and most squashes. The seeds found at Phillips Spring were larger than those of wild C. pepo. The agency for this change was surely human manipulation. Humans were selecting, planting, and tending seeds from plants that produced larger and tastier seeds. Ultimately, they would manipulate C. pepo to produce edible flesh.|$|E
5000|$|Hogong was a {{minister}} of Silla {{in the age}} of nation-building. It is recorded that he was originally from the Wa people of Japan, though his family name or clan name was unknown to the compiler of the Historical Records of the Three Kingdoms. He was called Hogong (meaning [...] "Duke Bottle Gourd") because he was wearing one or more <b>bottle</b> <b>gourds</b> on his waist when he first came across the sea. He was a very important person in initial Silla because he appeared in stories of primogenitors of all royal families.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays, <b>bottle</b> <b>gourds</b> {{are grown}} by direct sowing of seeds or {{transplanting}} 15- to 20-day-old seedlings. It prefers well-drained, moist, rich soil. It requires plenty of {{moisture in the}} growing season and a warm sunny position sheltered from the wind. It is cultivated in small places such as in a pot, spread on a trellis or roof. In rural areas, many houses with thatched roofs are found covered with the <b>gourd</b> vines. <b>Bottle</b> <b>gourds</b> grow very rapidly and their stems can reach a length of 9 m in the summer, so they need a solid support to climb by the pole or trellis along the stem. If planted under a tall tree, the vine can grow {{up to the top}} of the tree. To get more fruit, sometimes farmers cut off the tip of the vine when it has grown to 6-8 feet long. This forces the plant to produce side branches that produce fruit much sooner and more flowers and more fruit. The plant produces white flowers. The male flowers have long peduncles and the females have short ones with an ovary of the shape of the fruit. Sometimes, the female flowers drop off without growing into a gourd due to the failure of pollination if no bee activity occurs in the garden area. To solve the problem, hand pollination can be used.|$|R
5000|$|Kon-Tiki carried 275 gal of {{drinking}} water in 56 water cans, {{as well as a}} number of sealed bamboo rods. The purpose stated by Heyerdahl for carrying modern and ancient containers was to test the effectiveness of ancient water storage. For food Kon-Tiki carried 200 coconuts, sweet potatoes, <b>bottle</b> <b>gourds</b> and other assorted fruit and roots. The U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps provided field rations, tinned food and survival equipment. In return, the Kon-Tiki explorers reported on the quality and utility of the provisions. They also caught plentiful numbers of fish, particularly flying fish, [...] "dolphin fish", yellowfin tuna, bonito and shark.|$|R
25|$|The {{integration}} of plant cultivation in El Paraíso occurred slowly {{as there were}} plentiful sources of marine organisms. Due to the evidence of such high marine resources, agriculture mainly acted as an industrial resource. The earliest cultigens {{are found to be}} cotton (Gossypium barbadense) and <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd</b> (Lagenaria siceraria) which date back to 2500B.C. Other cultigens include squash (Cucurbita ficifolia, C. maxima, and C. moschata), chili pepper (Capiscum sp), the common bean (P. vulgaris), achira (Canne edulis) and jicama (Pachyrrhizus tuberosus). There are remnants of guava, Lucuma and pacae which insist on a varied diet as well as management over some crops that were not cultivated. An abundance of Solanum spp., found within coprolite remains indicates there were plants ranging from night shades to potatoes most likely being domesticated as well. Cotton is one of the highest found crops at the site. It was important as an industrial crop to build nets and lines for catching fish and other marine resources. It also doubled as a resource manufactured into textiles to make clothing.|$|E
500|$|The {{first record}} of a named {{cultigen}} occurs in De Agri Cultura. written about 160 BCE by Roman statesman Cato the Elder (234–149 BCE) in a list that includes 120 kinds (cultivars) of figs, grapes, apples and olives. The names are presented {{in a way that}} implies that they would have been familiar to fellow Romans. The [...] "cultivar" [...] names were mostly of one word and denoted the provenance of the cultivar (the geographical origin of the place where the plant selections were made). Writers up to the 15th century added little to this early work. In the Middle Ages the book of hours, early herbals, illuminated manuscripts and economic records indicate that plants grown by the Romans found their way into monastery gardens. For example, in 827 CE the following herbs were mentioned in the poem Hortulus by Walafrid Strabo as growing in the monastery garden of St Gallen in Switzerland: sage, rue, southernwood, wormwood, horehound, fennel, German iris, lovage, chervil, Madonna lily, opium poppy, clary, mint, betony, agrimony, catmint, radish, gallica rose, <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd</b> and melon. It seems likely that aromatic and culinary herbs were quite widespread and similar lists of plants occur in records of plants grown in Villa gardens at the time of Charlemagne (742–814 CE).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{authors have}} argued that the Calusa {{cultivated}} maize and Zamia integrifolia (coontie) for food. [...] But, Widmer argues that the evidence for maize cultivation by the Calusa depends on the proposition that the Narváez and de Soto expeditions landed in Charlotte Harbor rather than Tampa Bay, which is now generally discounted. [...] No Zamia pollen has been found at any site associated with the Calusas, nor does Zamia grow in the wetlands that made up most of the Calusa environment. Marquardt notes that the Calusa turned down the offer of agricultural tools from the Spanish, saying that they had no need for them. The Calusa gathered a variety of wild berries, fruits, nuts, roots and other plant parts. Widmer cites George Murdock's estimate that only some 20 percent of the Calusa diet consisted of wild plants that they gathered. However, no evidence of plant food was found at the Wightman site. There is evidence that as early as 2000 years ago, the Calusa cultivated papaya (Catrica papaya), a gourd of the species Cucurbita pepo, and the <b>bottle</b> <b>gourd,</b> the last two of which were used for net floats and dippers.|$|E
