50|$|When {{the front}} <b>lines</b> <b>bogged</b> down into static trench warfare in Summer 1951, forward air control diminished in importance. To {{cope with the}} {{communist}} switch to night operations, both radar and Shoran bombing techniques were developed. However, close air support continued, and sometimes used to direct interdiction missions against the communist lines of communications. By this time, Allied air forces were contributing a considerable portion of the tactical air strikes.|$|R
25|$|By 1973 JRC's {{operational}} deficit {{had risen}} to J$3.4 million, and in 1975 it was nearing J$4 million and carrying a J$11 million loan. The government was paying over J$1.4 million in subsidy to keep the island's trains running. However, the financial crisis had led to a backlog of deferred maintenance, with stock and buildings also neglected. In 1974 the May Pen-Frankfield line closed, with the <b>Bog</b> Walk-Port Antonio <b>line</b> closing in 1975.|$|R

50|$|Work on the {{extension}} of the Ipswich to Bury St Edmunds Railway line from Haughley Junction towards Norwich commenced in early 1848 by the Eastern Union Railway (EUR). A single track railway opened as far as Finningham on 7 June 1848 which was for goods traffic only. Extension towards Diss and Norwich was difficult due to the challenges presented by Thrandeston <b>bog</b> and the <b>line</b> to Diss opened 28 May 1849. Six months later on 11 November 1849 the line opened through to Norwich with a second track.|$|R
50|$|As of October 2013, of the 5.3 million {{hectares}} {{of land in}} Nova Scotia, only about 1.53 {{million hectares}} (3.8 million acres or about 29% of the province) is designated as Crown land. Crown land {{is owned by the}} Province and managed by the Department of Natural Resources on behalf of the citizens of Nova Scotia. It is a collective asset which belongs to all Nova Scotians. Many acres of Crown land are licensed for a variety of economic purposes to help build and maintain the prosperity of the Province. These purposes range from licenses and leases for cranberry bogs, forestry operations, peat <b>bogs,</b> power <b>lines,</b> wind energy, to broadband towers, and tidal energy. In addition, most of the submerged lands (the sea bed) along the Province's 9,000 km of coastline are also considered Crown land. Exceptions would include federally and privately owned waterlots. The Province owns other land across Nova Scotia, including wilderness areas, protected areas, highways, roads, and provincial buildings. These parcels and structures are managed and administered by other departments and are not considered Crown land.|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of ACT rivers and their riparian zones have been outlined in s. 2. 1. 1 to s. 2. 1. 3. Before European settlement, {{the upper reaches}} of these rivers were characterised by <b>bogs</b> and seepage <b>lines</b> developing into creeks and narrow, often rocky, stream channels. Through the undulating elevated plains around Canberra, stream channels became broader with deep pools separated by rock bars, and deposits of sand, silt, logs and debris. Floods formed river terraces within the normally confined valleys, but there was no substantial floodplain development. Snow melt and winter rainfall in the mountains was the main factor in providing an annual flow cycle, with high flows of colder water in spring, and flows reducing and water becomin...|$|R
40|$|Interaction between {{cultural}} {{development and the}} natural environment is generally accepted. Holocene climate change is described {{as one of the}} main environmental factors behind a step-wise development of the cultural landscape in Northwest Europe. Seven periods of human impact changes- 5900, 5500, 4500, 3800, 3000 - 2800, 1500 and 1100 cal. BP-are defined and compared with reconstructed climatic scenarios, based on insolation, glacier activity, lake and sea levels, <b>bog</b> growth, tree <b>line,</b> and tree growth. There is a positive correlation between human impact/land-use and climate change, although precise correlations are difficult because of weaknesses in the chronology. Future studies of annually laminated (varved) lake sediments and wiggle-matched radiocarbon sequences are emphasized, as well as a combination of palaeoecology and archaeology. It is hypothesized that agrarian society and the landscape developed step-wise, dependent on the interaction between the technological/social complex and the ecological capacity of a region, highly influenced by climate.

5000|$|The action {{primarily}} {{takes place}} in The Mogamma in Cairo, a well-known mammoth-sized government building that is a center of bureaucratic work. [...] Adel Imam's character, Ahmed, queues up at the Mogamma one day {{to try to get}} a school transfer for his children, but gets <b>bogged</b> down. Endless <b>lines</b> of citizens march through the building and up and down its iconic spiral staircases seeking help. One government worker frustrates Ahmed particularly, because he is constantly praying in a show of alleged piousness to avoid getting any work done. This leads to a scuffle between the two, and eventually Ahmed ends up with a rifle from a guard and shots are fired in the resulting confusion. A mass spontaneous evacuation of the building ensues, Ahmed inadvertently takes the building hostage, and subsequently is assumed to be a terrorist. He is joined in his [...] "takeover" [...] by a few other [...] "misfits," [...] including Hind, a prostitute played by Yousra.|$|R
40|$|Preservation {{of plant}} genetic {{material}} {{is essential for}} any biological field. Compared to serial in vitro sub-culturing, cryopreservation often represents optimal long-term conservation technique. The crucial factors influencing successful cryopreservation include 1) proper pre-treatment, 2) cryoprotectants, 3) adequate freezing pace and 4) cold-hardening. Finding the appropriate method for cryopreservation of each species is {{the ultimate goal of}} research in this field. This work is focused on finding the optimal protocol for cryopreservation of embryogenic cell masses of coniferous species bog pine (Pinus uncinata subsp. uliginosa) and optimizing the existing one for European silver fir (Abies alba), both endangered in the Czech countryside. Cryopreservation design compares effectivity of different pre-treatments and cryoprotectants, determines the role of cold-acclimation step and evaluates resistance of selected conifer cell lines to freezing and desiccation. Post-thaw recovery of <b>Bog</b> pine cell <b>line</b> BE 4 was better than cell line BR 1, where no living cells were visible using FDA/PI staining. Proliferation rate was higher for European silver fir than for bog pine, especially for cell line II- 2 - 10. Cryoprotective mixture with DMSO (PGD I) proved to be more effective than the mixture with glycerol (PGG) in cryopreservation of European silver fir. PGD I also proved to be optimal cryoprotective mixture for bog pine. In both cases, 0. 4 M sucrose was used as a pre-treatment and cold-hardening was included...|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand {{conifers}} (20 {{species of}} trees and shrubs in the Araucariaceae, Podocarpaceae, and Cupressaceae) are often regarded as ancient Gondwanan elements, but mostly originated much later. Often thought of as tall trees of humid, warm forests, they are present throughout in alpine shrublands, tree <b>lines,</b> <b>bogs,</b> swamps, and in dry, frost-prone regions. The tall conifers rarely form purely coniferous forest and mostly occur as an emergent stratum above evergreen angiosperm trees. During Maori settlement in the thirteenth century, fire-sensitive trees succumbed rapidly, most of the drier forests being lost. As these were also the more conifer-rich forests, ecological research has been skewed toward conifer dynamics of forests wetter and cooler than the pre-human norm. Conifers are well represented in the pollen record and we here we review their late Quaternary history {{in the light of}} what is known about their current ecology with the intention of countering this bias. During glacial episodes, all trees were scarce south of c. 40 ° S, and extensive conifer-dominant forest was confined to the northern third of the North Island. Drought- and cold-resistant Halocarpus bidwillii and Phyllocladus alpinus formed widespread scrub in the south. During the deglacial, beginning 18, 000 years ago, tall conifers underwent explosive spread to dominate the forest biomass throughout. Conifer dominance lessened in favor of angiosperms in the wetter western lowland forests over the Holocene but the dryland eastern forests persisted largely unchanged until settlement. Mid to late Holocene climate change favored the more rapidly growing Nothofagaceae which replaced the previous conifer-angiosperm low forest or shrubland in tree line ecotones and montane areas. The key to this dynamic conifer history appears to be their bimodal ability to withstand stress, and dominate on poor soils and in cool, dry regions but, in wetter, warmer locations, to slowly grow thorough competing broadleaves to occupy an exposed, emergent stratum where their inherent stress resistance ensures little effective angiosperm competition...|$|R
