5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|Cyclists can deter {{attack by}} {{attaching}} a long pole with a flag to a <b>bike,</b> <b>and</b> {{the use of}} cable ties on helmets has become common {{and appears to be}} effective.|$|E
5|$|Each bike dock has {{a repair}} button; users press this {{to report a}} damaged or {{malfunctioning}} <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> {{take it out of}} service. Riders are expected to notify Capital Bikeshare if a bike is unable to dock at a station and are responsible for the rented bike until it has been returned.|$|E
50|$|In late 2016 HSL {{announced}} {{the details of}} a revamped bikeshare system, this time spanning 1500 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 150 stations. The expanded bike program has brought the service to Munkkiniemi, Pasila, and Vallila. In addition to having 1400 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 140 stations in Helsinki, the service covers Matinkylä and Olari in Espoo with 100 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 10 stations.|$|R
25|$|The ride is also {{completed}} on {{all manner of}} bicycles. Most riders use regular road bikes, mountain <b>bikes,</b> hybrid <b>bikes,</b> <b>and</b> touring <b>bikes</b> of varying standard, quality, and age. Some less typical bikes are also used, including recumbent <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> tricycles, tandem <b>bikes,</b> folding bicycles, children in bicycle trailers <b>and</b> on trailer <b>bikes,</b> <b>and</b> even occasional unicycles, scooter style footbikes, and custom made bicycles.|$|R
25|$|Wenzhou has {{multiple}} bike share programs serving different districts of the city. The first one opened in 2012 serving Lucheng District with about 5,000 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 180 stations. Next year, a bike share with 2,200 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 66 stations opened in Longwan District. At the same time, a separate bike share program with 1,040 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 32 stations opened in Ouhai District. The latter {{of the two}} is being expanded to 3,250 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 109 stations. According to local government records, more than 20,000 dockless bikes from various private bike share companies have entered service in Wenzhou recently.|$|R
5|$|If the <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are due to gravity, inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The internal forces are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|For example, a bike in a 10m (33ft) radius {{steady-state}} turn at 10m/s (36km/h, 22mph) {{must be at}} {{an angle}} of 45.6°. A rider can lean {{with respect to the}} bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright if desired. The angle that matters is the one between the horizontal plane and the plane defined by the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider.|$|E
50|$|Once completed, {{the bridge}} {{will carry the}} East Coast Greenway, a long-distance <b>biking</b> <b>and</b> walking trail, and the Meadowlands Connector, a New Jersey <b>biking</b> <b>and</b> walking trail that links Hudson and Essex counties.|$|R
50|$|Between 1997 and 2017, Storck has {{designed}} and produced over 100 bicycles, including road <b>bikes,</b> cross- <b>and</b> triathlon <b>bikes,</b> mountain <b>bikes,</b> <b>and</b> hybrids.|$|R
50|$|Bike co-ops assist {{individuals}} who {{are in need of}} <b>bike</b> repair <b>and</b> maintenance. They often sell new <b>and</b> used <b>bike</b> parts as well as refurbished <b>bikes,</b> <b>and</b> offer formal <b>bike</b> repair <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> assembly classes. Visitors can learn repair skills both for breakdowns on the road and for home repairs. Staff and instructors are normally volunteers.|$|R
5|$|London {{has nine}} major parks and gardens {{throughout}} the city, {{many of which}} run along the Thames River and are interconnected {{by a series of}} pedestrian and bike paths, known as the Thames Valley Parkway. This path system is 40km (25mi) in length, and connects to an additional 150km (93mi) of <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> hiking trails throughout the city. The city's largest park, Springbank Park, is 140-hectare (300 acre) and contains 30km (19mi) of trails. It is also home to Storybook Gardens, a family attraction open year-round.|$|E
5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5|$|San Francisco {{transport}} authorities began a {{feasibility study}} in 2006 {{to evaluate the}} introduction of congestion pricing. The charge would be combined with other traffic reduction implementations, allowing money to be raised for public transit improvements and <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> pedestrian enhancements. The initial pricing scenarios were presented in public meetings conducted in December 2008, and the final study results were announced in November 2010, proposing modified alternatives based on the public's feedbacks, and the updated proposal calls for implementing a six-month to one-year trial in 2015.|$|E

40|$|In {{consultation}} with the Central District Health Department, the Community and Regional Planning program conducted a bike share analysis that locates and optimizes the number of <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> share stations for a 2. 25 -mile radius in the Downtown Boise area. After examining several bike share projects in other cities and studies of their methodologies two analyses from Seattle, Washington and Los Angeles County, California proved helpful in developing the Boise Bike Share Location Analysis. Using GIS optimization analysis to determine the optimal number of <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> stations resulted in 140 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 14 stations as the optimal finding...|$|R
25|$|Cast lugs {{are found}} on higher quality {{production}} <b>bikes,</b> <b>and</b> virtually all custom bikes now made; stamped lugs are found on less expensive production <b>bikes,</b> <b>and</b> older custom <b>bikes.</b> Lugs are usually stamped {{with a letter}} or symbol code identifying the maker, and possibly the angle.|$|R
5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the <b>bike,</b> <b>and</b> the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the rear wheel. Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of the <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E

50|$|In August 2015, Capital Bikeshare {{announced}} that it had found a new equipment supplier and would add 435 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 40 stations in D.C. <b>and</b> 140 <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> 20 stations elsewhere. It also reported having 29,000 members who had taken {{a total of more}} than 10.5 million trips.|$|R

5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E
5|$|Ash pedals furiously toward Viridian City. Ash loses {{control of}} the <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> wipes out, {{crashing}} down a hill. Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, Ash pleads him to go inside his Poké Ball so that Ash can protect him from the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much Ash cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which drives the Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon and that there are several yet to be identified. Ash carries Pikachu into Viridian City, and Pikachu licks Ash's cheek.|$|E
5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, {{and fell asleep}} when {{he stopped at the}} side of the road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained a spare <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.|$|E

On weekend afternoons, skateboarders and inline skaters often share the open, paved area inside the 12th Street entrance.|$|R
5|$|Bart stays up late on Christmas Eve to kill Santa Claus for not {{bringing}} him a dirt bike three Christmases ago. He eventually falls asleep and dreams that the Polar Express, driven by Otto Mann, lands {{in front of}} the house and flies him to the North Pole. Bart meets Santa (Krusty the Clown) only to find out that he has run out of money, since giving out presents in return for cookies every year is not a sustainable business model. Feeling pity, Bart decides that Santa no longer has to give him a dirt <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> leaves with Santa throwing a party in his office after revealing how stupid kids are.|$|E
5|$|Eberardo Pavesi {{dominated}} the difficult ninth stage that contained the major climbs of the Nava, Tenda, and San Bartolomeo. Pavesi {{went on to}} win the stage by close to six minutes over the second-place finisher Luigi Ganna. The race's tenth and final stage was marred by rain. Race leader Carlo Galetti crashed into a hay wagon early on in the stage and sustained some heavy wounds, he would get back on his <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> finish the stage in fifth place. Despite the rain in Milan, many spectators still came to watch the riders arrive. Luigi Ganna was the first rider to cross the finish line in Milan and in doing so, he won his third stage of the 1910 Giro d'Italia. Carlo Galetti won the Giro d'Italia by a margin of eighteen points over Pavesi. Galetti and his team, Atala-Continental, won the team classification.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
