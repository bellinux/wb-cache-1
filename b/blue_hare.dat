5000|$|... "Farther Up the Road" [...] {{has been}} called a [...] "seminal Texas shuffle" [...] {{featuring}} [...] "a style which Bland evolved as his own, with his light, melodic vocals riding over an ebullient shuffle". [...] According to music critic Dave Marsh, [...] "Bland's deep vocal and Scott's arrangement, which swings as hard as it rocks, links Ray Charles' big band R&B to more modern currents in Southern soul". [...] Bland's smooth vocals are contrasted with Pat Hare's raucous, overdriven guitar fills and soloing, a style which prefigured the blues-rock sound of the late 1960s. Music critic Dave Marsh adds that the song is [...] "a virtually perfect Texas <b>blues</b> ... <b>Hare's</b> signature lick provides the missing link between T-Bone Walker and Eric Clapton". [...] The backing arrangement is provided by the Bill Harvey Orchestra, who added a big band-influenced intro and outro as well as chord substitutions to the twelve-bar scheme. The song has been notated in [...] time in the key of F with a moderate (108 beats per minute) tempo.|$|R
50|$|There are 47 {{species of}} mammals, 279 species of birds, 10 species of reptile and amphibious animals and 10 {{species of fish}} {{reported}} in the reserve. In addition more than 1000 species of invertebrates are found. Typical mammals of the steppe zone are steppe polecat (Mustela eversmanni), corsac fox (Vulpes corsac), common fox (Vulpes vulpes), Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), long-eared hedgehog (Erinaceus auritus), European hare (Lepus europaeus) and several rodent species like bobak marmot (Marmota bobac), large-toothed souslik (Spermophylus fulvus), red-cheeked souslik (Spermophylus major), little souslik (Spermophylus pygmeus), common hamster (Cricetus cricetus), jerboas (Allactaga major, Stylodipus telum) {{as well as several}} species of voles and lemmings. The forests are inhabited by elk (Alces alces), Tartarian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), badger (Meles meles), ermine (Mustela erminea), weasel (Mustela nivalis), pine marten (Martes martes) and raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), <b>Blue</b> <b>Hare</b> (Lepus timidus). Mainly along rivers one can also find wild boar (Sus scrofa). Among the species, which can be found occasionally in the deserts and semi deserts of the reserve is the rare saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica).|$|E
50|$|The fauna of the Madelenian epoch seems, indeed, to have {{included}} tigers and other tropical species {{side by side}} with reindeer, <b>blue</b> foxes, Arctic <b>hares</b> and other polar creatures.

6000|$|Among {{the grand}} houses {{pointed out to}} me were those of Claes Bakker, and Cornelius Bakker, richly carved and gilded, with flower gardens and clipped shrubberies; and that of the Great Ditmus, who, my poor devil cicerone {{informed}} me, in a whisper, was worth two millions; all these were mansions shut up from the world, and only kept to be cleaned. After having been conducted from one wonder to another of the village, I was ushered by my guide into the grounds and gardens of Mynheer Broekker, another mighty cheese-manufacturer, worth eighty thousand guilders a year. I had repeatedly been struck with the similarity of all that I had seen in this amphibious little village to the buildings and landscapes on Chinese platters and tea-pots; but here I found the similarity complete; for I was told that these gardens were modeled upon Van Bramm's description of those of Yuen min Yuen, in China. Here were serpentine walks, with trellised borders; winding canals, with fanciful Chinese bridges; flower-beds resembling huge baskets, with the flower of [...] "love lies bleeding" [...] falling over to the ground. But mostly had the fancy of Mynheer Broekker been displayed about a stagnant little lake, on which a corpulent little pinnace lay at anchor. On the border was a cottage within which were a wooden man and woman seated at table, and a wooden dog beneath, all the size of life; on pressing a spring, the woman commenced spinning, and the dog barked furiously. On the lake were wooden swans, painted to the life; some floating, others on the nest among the rushes; while a wooden sportsman, crouched among the bushes, was preparing his gun to take deadly aim. In another part of the garden was a dominie in his clerical robes, with wig, pipe, and cocked hat; and mandarins with nodding heads, amid red lions, green tigers, and <b>blue</b> <b>hares.</b> Last of all, the heathen deities, in wood and plaster, male and female, naked and bare-faced as usual, and seeming to stare with wonder at finding themselves in such strange company.|$|R
40|$|PKU is {{the rare}} single-gene disease {{belonging}} to disturbance of metabolism of the amino acids, which {{in its own}} basics halved the mutated gene, whose leaning at the 12 -chromosome charge for the synthesis of phenylalanine hydroxylase, turning on phenylalanine into tyrosine. Enzyme block usually leads to the accumulation of a toxic substrate and/or the deficient synthesis of a product needed for normal body function. In PKU there is a toxic accumulation of phenylalanine behind the deficient enzyme, phenylalanine hydr–æxylase. The symptoms are: lighten <b>hare,</b> <b>blue</b> eyes, lithe pigmented skin, convulsion, mental retardation, low level of adrenalin caused {{for the lack of}} tyrosine, the urine have a specific smell of rats or gab. Inheritance of disease become in autosomal recessive way which always become possibility to stay hidden in the family and to inherit from knee to knee without manifestation of its own phenotype. The only therapy that successfully avoids the causes of this disease is phenylalanine-restricted diet. Today we have some affords for improvement of gene therapy, which can help us for determination to these disease. The success of the therapy depends from timing of the right detection also diagnostics all trough equivalent therapy which can successfully interrupt the new forms of mental retardation and other symptoms...|$|R
