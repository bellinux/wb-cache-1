25|$|Eclecticism is {{not open}} to the {{superficial}} objection of proceeding without a system or test in determining the complete or incomplete. But it is open to objection, assuming that a particular analysis of consciousness has reached all the possible elements in humanity and in history, and all their combinations. It may be asked, Can history have that which {{is not in the}} individual consciousness? In a sense not; but our analysis may not give all that is there, and we ought not at once to impose that analysis or any formula on history. History is as likely to reveal to us in the first place true and original elements, and combinations of elements in man, as a study of consciousness. Besides, the tendency of applying a formula of this sort to history is to assume that the elements are developed in a certain regular or necessary order, whereas this may not at all be the case; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> find at any epoch the whole mixed, either crossing or co-operative, as in the consciousness of the individual himself. Further, the question as to how these elements may possibly have grown up in the general consciousness of mankind is assumed to be nonexistent or impossible.|$|E

500|$|The 2005 final was {{the sixth}} time Liverpool {{had reached the}} final and it was their first {{appearance}} since the 1985 European Cup Final, when they lost 1–0 to Juventus and were subsequently banned from European competition for an indefinite period due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. They had previously won the European Cup on four occasions in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984. The match was Milan's tenth appearance in the final. They had won on six occasions (1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003), and lost three times (1958, 1993, 1995). In total the teams had participated in 14 finals between them. Prior to the game, Milan were assured of entering the Champions League the following season after finishing second in Serie A. Liverpool meanwhile had failed to finish in the top four in the Premier League, and had to win the final to enter the competition the following season. Even if they did win the match, they were not assured of a place after UEFA failed to confirm whether they would allow Liverpool to defend the championship. The Football Association supported Liverpool, stating, [...] "We have already submitted a written request to have an additional place, should they win the Champions League". Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti said [...] "I think a team that wins {{should have the right}} to defend it <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> just do the English federation a favour and solve this." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the Test, it was {{announced}} that Jardine would captain the M.C.C. team to Australia that winter, although he seemed to have had last minute doubts about accepting. Others were also concerned about whether he was the best choice. For example, Rockley Wilson is reputed to have said that with Jardine as captain, [...] "We shall win the Ashes... <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> well lose a Dominion". However, the selectors thought that a determined leader was needed to defeat the Australians and a more disciplined approach than that of Percy Chapman on the previous tour was needed. Jardine began to plan tactics from this point, discussing ideas with various people. He was aware that Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the main worry of the selectors, had occasionally shown vulnerability to pace bowling. During the final Test of the 1930 Ashes at the Oval, during Bradman's innings of 232, the wicket became difficult for a time following rain. Bradman was briefly seen to be uncomfortable facing deliveries that bounced higher than usual at a faster pace. Percy Fender was one of many cricketers who noticed, and he discussed this with Jardine in 1932. When Jardine later saw film footage of the Oval incident and noticed Bradman's discomfort, he shouted, [...] "I've got it! He's yellow!" [...] Further details that developed his plans came from letters Fender received from Australia in 1932 describing how Australian batsmen were increasingly moving across the stumps towards the off-side to play the ball on the on-side. Fender showed these letters to Jardine. It was also known in England that Bradman had shown some discomfort during the 1931–32 Australian season against pace bowling.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the James–Stein estimator dominates the usual estimator for any ν. [...] A natural question to ask is whether the improvement over the usual estimator is independent of the choice of ν. [...] The answer is no. The improvement is small if [...] is large. [...] Thus to get a very great improvement some knowledge of the location of θ is necessary. [...] Of course this is the quantity we are trying to estimate so we don't have this knowledge a priori. [...] <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> have some guess as to what the mean vector is. [...] This can be considered a disadvantage of the estimator: the choice is not objective as it may depend on the beliefs of the researcher.|$|E

His flow of commissions in 1926-1927 provided enough money to finance a three-story house of his dreams. At this time, many well-to-do Russians were into building their own city houses; Melnikov {{was one of the}} few who managed to retain his property after the fall of New Economic Policy. His request for land (790 square meters) had few chances to pass the district commission; to his surprise, a working class commissioner supported him, saying that [...] "we can build public buildings anytime and anywhere, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> never see this unusual house completed if we reject Melnikov". The city endorsed Melnikov's draft as an experimental, one-of-a-kind project.|$|E

The majority of the buildings were only supposed to remain standing through 1916 and were not constructed with long-lasting materials. When the expo ended, several city discussions were held to determine {{what to do with}} the buildings. Goodhue recommended demolishing the buildings, saying [...] "They are now crumbling, disintegrating and altogether unlovely structures, structures that lack any of the venerability of age and present only its pathos, and the space they occupy could readily be made into one of the most beautiful public gardens in the New World." [...] Joseph W. Sefton, Jr., president of the Society of Natural History also called for their demolition, citing fire hazards: [...] "All those old exposition buildings are nothing but fire traps. ... They are pretty to look at, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> wake up any morning and find them gone, and our million dollars worth of exhibits with them." [...] However, a city-appointed committee hired an architect to review the buildings, and he determined that the buildings could be restored by a slight margin over any costs to demolish the buildings. The necessary funds and materials for restoration were donated by San Diegans and the labor was financed by the federal government. Some of the buildings and infrastructure constructed for the Panama-California Exposition that still exist include: ...|$|E
