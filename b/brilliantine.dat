500|$|The {{idea was}} {{ultimately}} scrapped, {{as it turned}} out such a guarantee would be highly expensive; the insurance company believed that there would be difficulty in proving that the hair grew back exactly the same as before. Instead, Khambatta visited the Georgette Klinger Skin Care Salon in Beverly Hills, where experts recommended that she receive six facials and scalp treatments during the course of production. The salon also prescribed a daily scalp treatment routine of cleansing bars, <b>brilliantine</b> lotion, conditioner, makeup remover, and cleansing lotion. The studio agreed these measures were necessary and footed the bill while Khambatta spent six months following the tedious instructions (her hair eventually regrew without issue, though she kept her shaven locks after production had ended.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{choice of}} Davis's leading men became {{important}} as well. Davis was aghast {{at the initial}} costume and makeup tests of Austrian actor Paul Henreid; she thought the [...] "slicked back" [...] gigolo-like appearance [...] made him look [...] "just like Valentino." [...] Henreid was similarly uncomfortable with the <b>brilliantine</b> image and when Davis insisted on another screen test with a more natural hairstyle, he was finally accepted as the choice for her screen lover. In her 1987 memoir, This 'N That, Davis revealed that co-star Claude Rains (with whom she also shared the screen in Juarez, Mr. Skeffington, and Deception) was her favorite co-star.|$|E
60|$|The drive down, and rambles {{about the}} flower-beds, and {{visit to the}} {{tropical}} house, gave Fan great pleasure; and then Eden confessed that he always found the beauty of Kew, or at all events the flowery portion of it, a little cloying; he preferred that further part where trees grew, and the grass was longer, with an occasional weed in it, and where Nature didn't quite look as if an army of horticultural Truefitts were everlastingly clipping at her wild tresses with their scissors and rubbing pomatum and <b>brilliantine</b> on her green leaves. To that comparatively incult part they accordingly directed their steps, and found a pleasant resting-place on a green slope with great trees behind them and others but small and scattered before, and through the light foliage of which {{they could see the}} gleam of the Thames, while the plash of oars and the hum of talk and laughter from the waterway came distinctly to their ears. But just on that spot they seemed to have the Gardens to themselves, no other visitors being within sight. The day was warm and the turf dry, but for fear of moisture Eden spread his light covert coat for Fan to sit on, and then stretched himself out by her side.|$|E

40|$|A. Evidence for {{carcinogenicity}} {{to humans}} (inadequate for auramine, technical-grade; sufficíent for {{the manufacture of}} auramine) The manufacture of auramine (which also involves exposure to other chemicals) was judged to be causally {{associated with an increased}} incidence ofbladder cancer on the basis of one study dealing with experiences {{in the first half of}} the century in the UK 1. Data reported later, in two studies dealing with one group ofworkers in the Federal Republic of Germany involved in the manufacture of auramine, were judged to show increased risks of both bladder cancer and prostatic cancer; however, these workers had also been exposed to other chemicals, inc 1 uding 2 -naphthylamine (see p. 261) 2, 3. ln a study of mortality and cancer incidence among hairdressers, the hypothesis was raised that the observed excess risk of bladder cancer was associated with exposure to colouring agents present in briliantines used on men's hair.

60|$|He entered with a diffident {{sense of}} intrusion, {{conscious}} that his standing {{as a member}} might not be recognised by the keepers of the doors; in a moment, however, he realised that a rajah's escort of elephants might almost have marched through the entrance hall and vestibule without challenge. The general atmosphere of the scene suggested a blend of the railway station at Cologne, the Hotel Bristol in any European capital, and the second act in most musical comedies. A score of brilliant and <b>brilliantined</b> pages decorated the foreground, while Hebraic-looking gentlemen, wearing tartan waistcoats of the clans of their adoption, flitted restlessly between the tape machines and telephone boxes. The army of occupation had obviously established a firm footing in the hospitable premises; a kaleidoscopic pattern of uniforms, sky-blue, indigo, and bottle-green, relieved the civilian attire of the groups that clustered in lounge and card rooms and corridors. Yeovil rapidly {{came to the conclusion}} that the joys of membership were not for him. He had turned to go, after a very cursory inspection of the premises and their human occupants, when he was hailed by a young man, dressed with strenuous neatness, whom he remembered having met in past days at the houses of one or two common friends.|$|R
40|$|In 1985 the Paris metro ran an {{advertising}} campaign using {{an image of}} a young black woman dressed only in a skirt made of a fringe of yellow metro tickets. From a distance the tickets resemble bananas. The woman's hair is plastered down in a <b>brilliantined</b> Eton crop and her face is distorted by an exaggerated wide smile. The metro advertisement, framed by the caption 'Tickets Folies 2 ème Voiture le Plus Célèbre Spectacle de Paris', recalls a time in the inter-war years in Paris when Josephine Baker {{was one of the most}} celebrated 'exotic' spectacles, both on and off the music hall stage. Although Baker subsequently went on to appear in a large number of shows, re-inventing herself as a 'grande chanteuse' and although her wartime work in France's Resistance earned her the prestigious Croix de Guerre, it is this image of Baker, half-naked, dancing frenetically in a suggestively phallic girdle of bananas, which has persisted in popular cultural memory. Baker was variously figured as the modern incarnation of Baudelaire's Jeanne Duval, the 'danseuse de bananes' who brought Le Charleston and the Blackbottom to France, the 'Petite Tonkinoise', Princess Tam Tam, and theatrical grande vedette, all performed against inter-war modernism and a spectacular mise en scène of the Second French Empire which had just entered its colonial âge d'or...|$|R
6000|$|The Bumpus flat {{included}} {{the second floor}} of a small wooden house whose owner had once been evilly inspired to paint it a livid clay-yellow--as though insisting that ugliness were an essential attribute of domesticity. A bay ran up the two stories, and at the left were two narrow doorways, one for each flat. On the right the house was separated from its neighbour by a narrow interval, giving but a precarious light to the two middle rooms, the diningroom and kitchen. The very unattractiveness of such a home, however, had certain compensations for Janet, after the effort of early rising had been surmounted, felt a real relief in leaving it; a relief, too, in leaving Fillmore Street, every feature of which was indelibly fixed in her mind, opposite was the blind brick face of a warehouse, and next to that the converted dwelling house that held the shop of A. Bauer, with the familiar replica of a green ten-cent trading stamp painted above it and the somewhat ironical announcement--when boar frost whitened the pavement--that ice-cold soda was to be had within, as well as cigars and tobacco, fruit and candy. Then came a tenement, under which two enterprising Greeks by the name of Pappas--spelled Papas lower down--conducted a business called [...] "The Gentleman," [...] a tailoring, pressing, and dyeing establishment. Janet could see the <b>brilliantined</b> black heads of the two proprietors bending over their boards, and sometimes they would be lifted to smile at her as she passed. The Pappas Brothers were evidently as happy in this drab environment as they had ever been on the sunny mountain slopes of Hellas, and Janet sometimes wondered at this, for she had gathered from her education in the Charming public school that Greece was beautiful.|$|R
50|$|David Thomson wrote a {{critical}} appraisal of Mature in his book, The New Biographical Dictionary of Film:Mature is an uninhabited {{creature of the}} naive. Simple, crude and heady - like ketchup or treacle - he is a diet scorned by the knowing, but obsessive if succumbed to in error. It is too easy to dismiss Mature, for he surpasses badness. He is a strong man in a land of hundred pound weaklings, an incredible concoction of beef steak, husky voice and <b>brilliantine</b> - a barely concealed sexual advertisement for soiled goods. Remarkably, he is as much himself in the cheerfully meretricious and the pretentiously serious. Such a career has no more pattern than a large ham; it slices consistently forever. The more lurid or distasteful the art the better Mature comes across.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Hearts and Arrows were diamonds that {{surfaced in}} the mid 1980s in Japan that embodied three important design factors. The first of these factors {{was that they were}} cut to what is known in the diamond industry as [...] "ideal proportions," [...] i.e. very close to those summarized by Marcel Tolkowsky in his 1919 book, Diamond Design. Second, they were cut with very good physical and optical symmetry so that they would garner the grade of [...] "Excellent" [...] in the system used by Japanese laboratories. The third important factor was that they were cut to a very specific <b>brilliantine</b> scheme to produce the accepted hearts and arrows pattern. This faceting scheme involves prescribed lengths and ratios as well as smaller table sizes that are imperative in producing a distinctive, repeatable and gradable hearts and arrows pattern.|$|E

When Bette Davis learned about the project, she campaigned for and won the role. More than any other of her previous films, Davis became absorbed in the role, not only reading the original novel but becoming involved in details such as choosing her wardrobe personally. Consulting with designer Orry-Kelly, she suggested a drab outfit, including an ugly foulard dress for Charlotte initially, to contrast with the stylish, [...] "timeless" [...] creations that mark her later appearance on the cruise ship.The choice of Davis's leading men became important as well.

Khambatta's head had to be freshly shaved each day, then given an application of makeup to reduce glare from the hot set lights. Khambatta had no qualms about shaving her head at first, but began worrying if her hair would grow back properly. Roddenberry proposed insuring Khambatta's hair after the actress voiced her concerns, believing the price of such insurance to be negligible. Roddenberry also saw other benefits to taking out a policy:...Second, insurance would {{have the advantage of}} reassuring Khambatta and making her feel more comfortable during her role. Third and finally, if the price does turn out to be negligible, John Rothwell, our publicist, assures me that we would probably get many times the cost back in publicity about the insurance.The idea was ultimately scrapped, as it turned out such a guarantee would be highly expensive; the insurance company believed that there would be difficulty in proving that the hair grew back exactly the same as before.

5000|$|Calling Noir a “melodic genius”, The Guardian‘s Dave Simpson {{described}} the album as “a {{cross between a}} classic 1960s album and half-forgotten children's TV themes”, “rich {{in the sort of}} melodies you'd think went out with Simon and Garfunkel and Smile-era Beach Boys.” In similar vein, PopMatters’ Dan Raper {{described the}} album as “sophisticated pop music with broad appeal” that “hums with 60s pop <b>brilliantine</b> and a slightly uncomfortable childhood nostalgia”. Speaking about notable influences on the album, Raper wrote that “Jim Noir casually allows the history of pop music to inform his arrangements; luckily, he never allows them to overwhelm his natural sense of melody. Somehow, these sweet songs still sound fresh.” He further praised the album for retaining “a sunny optimism that’s difficult to resist. For that reason alone Tower of Love is worth a listen.” In his review, Allmusic’s Tim Sendra especially noted the album’s “catchy and richly constructed tunes”, predicting that listeners “will be hard-pressed to keep from walking around all day grinning like a fish once you give the album an airing. In fact, doctors should prescribe a spin of Tower of Love to chase the blues away. The only problem with the record is that it paints Noir into a corner, as {{it will be hard to}} top.” In his review, Drowned In Sound’s Dom Gourlay concluded that “although not strictly an album in that it wasn't created for the purpose of such ..., it still wipes the floor with most other albums of a similar genre released this, or indeed any other year in the last ten. … Tower Of Love is a tasty entree that merely whets the appetite for the first album proper.” ...|$|E
