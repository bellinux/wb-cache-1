40|$|The current Helias reactor is an {{extrapolation}} of the W 7 -X configuration to reactor dimensions. This paper summarizes the computational results of various activities {{to improve the}} concept of the ad-vanced stellarator reactor: Forces and stress analysis of the coil system, self-consistent computation of plasma equilibria, a concept of divertor action on the basis of magnetic islands, neoclassical transport and investigation of alpha-particle confinement, start-up scenarios of the Helias reactor using ECRH and pellet injection and confinement studies using empirical scaling laws. Keywords: stellarator reactor, modular coils, ignition 1. lntroducton The main technical component of a Helias reactor is the magnetic system consisting of 50 modular coils. The magnet system comprises 5 field periods with 10 coils per period. In comparison to a previous design [1] the magnetic field on the coils has been reduced using a trapezoidal shape of the coil cross section and by re-ducing the average field by 5 %. The winding pack is split into two parts {{in order to reduce the}} overall cur-rent density at the location of maximum magnetic field. The maximum field on the coils is now 10 T which is in the range of NbTitechnology at a temperature of 1. 8 K. Furthermore, slight modifications of the coil ge-ometry have been made to account for the necessary space for blanket and intercoil suPPort elements. Each coil is enclosed in a steel case, which is designed as a <b>box-type</b> <b>profile</b> with a central web for mechanical stif-fening (Fig. 1). * Corresponding author's e-mail: wobig @ ipp- garching. mpg. d...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We discuss X-ray line {{formation}} in dense O star winds. A random distribution of wind shocks {{is assumed to}} emit X-rays that are partially absorbed by cooler wind gas. The cool gas resides in highly compressed fragments oriented perpendicular to the radial flow direction. For fully opaque fragments, {{we find that the}} blueshifted part of X-ray line profiles remains flat-topped even after severe wind attenuation, whereas the red part shows a steep decline. These <b>box-type,</b> blueshifted <b>profiles</b> resemble recent Chandra observations of the O 3 star ζ Pup. For partially transparent fragments, the emission lines become similar to those from a homogeneous wind. Key words. stars: winds, outflows – X-rays: stars – radiative transfer 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Box-type</b> {{electron}} temperature <b>profiles</b> observed in negative central shear plasmas with electron internal transport barriers are explained {{with the help}} of a novel instability mechanism that is predicted when keeping account of the radial component of the trapped electron gradB and curvature drifts in the theory of the trapped electron mode. These radial velocity components lead to a new term in the quasi-slab radial eigenvalue equation which modifies the asymptotic behaviour in such a way that growing-decaying pairs of bounded solutions are obtained (instead of the usual magnetic shear damped solutions) if (s) over capL(Te) > 0. There are no bounded solutions if (s) over capL(Te) > 1 that must be satisfied to avoid ion Landau damping on the side-bands (omega(e,l) * is the electron diamagnetic frequency, l the toroidal mode number, 1 /qR the parallel wave vector of the side-bands and c(s) = root T-e/m(i) the sound speed) ...|$|R
40|$|By keeping {{account of}} the trapped {{electron}} del B and curvature drifts, {{it is found that}} the spatial decay of the collisionless electron drift wave is governed either by the trapped electron response or by the resonant interaction of ions with the sidebands of the primary oscillation. In the former case, pairs of spatially bounded unstable and damped solutions are obtained for negative magnetic shear (s 0 or a set of bounded unstable solutions if eta(i) < 0. The unstable modes have a radiating character and the growth rates are gamma similar to(2 n+ 1) root 1 + 2 q(2) vertical bar(s) over cap parallel to L(N) omega(e) (*) /qR vertical bar (n is the Hermite polynomial solution index, q the safety factor, (s) over cap the magnetic shear parameter, R the major radius, omega(e) (*) the electron diamagnetic frequency, L-N= 1 /partial derivative(r) ln N-e, and eta(i) =L-N/L-Ti). The sidebands are responsible for unusually large ratios Q(e) /T(e) Gamma(e), where Q(e) and Gamma(e) are the anomalous electron energy flux and the particle flux. These results may explain the <b>box-type</b> T-e <b>profile</b> observed in lower hybrid current drive reversed magnetic shear plasmas on the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute Tokamak 60 Upgrade (JT- 60 U) [H. Ninomiya and the JT- 60 U Team, Phys. Fluids B 4, 2070 (1992) ]. It is finally demonstrated that the ballooning hypothesis generally leads to conflicting requirements: it is thus hardly relevant for the electron drift branch! The "radiating" boundary condition that has formerly been imposed on the slab solution is finally discussed. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
