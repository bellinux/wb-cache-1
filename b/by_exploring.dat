In Verne's earlier works, knowledgeable heroes aim to use their skills {{to change the world}} for the better; in his later novels, by contrast, scientists and engineers often apply their knowledge toward morally reprehensible projects. The play, <b>by</b> <b>exploring</b> science in both positive and negative lights, shows Verne in transition between the two points of view.|$|E

5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: <b>by</b> <b>exploring</b> a {{question}} that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Kerry King {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the lyrics, taking a different approach from earlier recordings <b>by</b> <b>exploring</b> topics such as religion, murder, revenge and self-control. He limited the lyrics to realistic subject matter most could relate to. The band experimented, recording most of the album in C# tuning, with three songs in drop B and two others with seven-string guitars in B♭. The album's release was delayed due to the explicit cover artwork which led to alternative slip covers in some retail outlets, difficulties during audio mixing and a change of distributor for the band's record label, American.|$|E
5|$|Kepler began <b>by</b> <b>exploring</b> regular polygons {{and regular}} solids, {{including}} the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E

5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated <b>by</b> <b>exploring</b> his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as delusions and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
