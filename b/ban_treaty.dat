5|$|The Partial Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> (PTBT) is the {{abbreviated}} {{name of the}} 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water, which prohibited all test detonations of nuclear weapons except for those conducted underground. It is also abbreviated as the Limited Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> (LTBT) and Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> (NTBT), though the latter may also refer to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which succeeded the PTBT for ratifying parties.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{describes}} how a North Korean underground nuclear test on 25 May 2009 was detected {{and the source}} located by GPS satellites. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of GPS satellites for detecting nuclear explosions enhances the ability to verify compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty,</b> giving the United States more reason to ratify it.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Christy {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{scientists}} from Caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing. The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> that Christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects. He worked with Freeman Dyson on Project Orion, the design of a spacecraft propelled by atomic bombs.|$|E
25|$|Using {{a similar}} method, {{researchers}} can detect volcanic eruptions by monitoring infra-sound—sub-audible sound below 20Hz. The IMS Global Infrasound Network, originally {{set up to}} verify compliance with nuclear test <b>ban</b> <b>treaties,</b> has 60 stations {{around the world that}} work to detect and locate erupting volcanoes.|$|R
50|$|The L3 signal at a {{frequency}} of 1.38105 GHz {{is used to}} transmit data from the satellites to ground stations. This data {{is used by the}} United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection System (USNDS) to detect, locate, and report nuclear detonations (NUDETs) in the Earth's atmosphere and near space. One usage is the enforcement of nuclear test <b>ban</b> <b>treaties.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{nuclear energy}} studies, xenon {{is used in}} bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a high {{molecular}} weight and inert chemistry is desirable. A by-product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135. These isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with nuclear test <b>ban</b> <b>treaties,</b> and to confirm nuclear tests by states such as North Korea.|$|R
5|$|The {{signing of}} the Partial Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> in 1963 and the Outer Space Treaty in 1967 {{prevented}} future exploration {{of the concept of}} detonating a nuclear device on the Moon. By this time both the United States and the Soviet Union had performed several high-altitude nuclear explosions, including those of Operation Hardtack I, Operation Argus, Operation Dominic I and II, and The K Project.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bethe {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, though he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).|$|E
5|$|Caltech did not spell {{an end to}} Bacher's {{service in}} Washington. He served two terms {{as a member of}} the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from November 18, 1953, to June 30, 1955, and from December 9, 1957, to December 31, 1959. During his first term he testified on behalf of his old friend at the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing in 1954. During his second, he worked with James L. Fisk and Ernest Lawrence to examine how a Partial Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> could be monitored.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by the Department of Defense. The two physicists described in the article that nearly any measure taken by the US would be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys. Bethe {{was one of the}} primary voices in the scientific community behind the signing of the 1963 Partial Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> prohibiting further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, President Richard Nixon {{stopped at}} Loring on 3 July in Air Force One (SAM 27000) as he {{returned}} from a summit in Moscow, where he and Leonid Breshnev had signed the Threshold Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty.</b> In a speech in front of 5,000 people in the double cantilever hangar, {{he talked about the}} importance of the treaty. President and Mrs. Nixon were welcomed home by vice president Gerald R. Ford, who flew from Washington. His daughter Julie Nixon Eisenhower was also in attendance. Nixon resigned from office five weeks later.|$|E
5|$|While {{chairman}} of the AEC, Seaborg participated on the negotiating team for the Limited Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> (LTBT), in which the US, UK, and USSR agreed to ban all above-ground test detonations of nuclear weapons. Seaborg considered his contributions to {{the achievement of the}} LTBT as one of his greatest accomplishments. Despite strict rules from the Soviets about photography at the signing ceremony, Seaborg snuck a tiny camera past the Soviet guards to take a close-up photograph of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as he signed the treaty.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear weapons {{continued}} to be tested in the Cold War, especially in the earlier stages of their development. The toll on the worst-affected populations and the growth since then in understanding about the critical threat to human health posed by radioactivity {{has also been a}} prohibitive complication associated with nuclear power. Though extreme care is practiced in that industry, the potential for disaster suggested by incidents such as those at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl pose a lingering specter of public mistrust. Worldwide publicity has been intense on those disasters. Widespread support for test <b>ban</b> <b>treaties</b> has ended almost all nuclear testing in the atmosphere.|$|R

5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory {{speech at}} American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a test <b>ban</b> <b>treaty</b> with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans {{for a second}} Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.|$|E
5|$|Shoup later {{warned against}} an armed {{response}} during the Cuban Missile Crisis, noting {{how difficult it}} would be to invade the country. Still, he prepared a team of Marines to invade Cuba should it be necessary. He and the other Joint Chiefs unanimously recommended a quick airstrike to knock out the missiles once they were discovered there. Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating the implications of the Partial Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty.</b> While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended to be limited, he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E
5|$|The PTBT was a {{first of}} a series of nuclear arms control {{treaties}} in the second half of 20th century. The PTBT has been considered the stepping stone to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968, which made explicit reference to the progress provided by the PTBT. In addition to the NPT, the PTBT was followed within ten years by the Outer Space Treaty and Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967, Seabed Arms Control Treaty in 1971, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972. In 1974, the Threshold Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> prohibited underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.|$|E

At that time he was Deputy to John J. McCloy, Adviser to the President on Disarmament. In 1968, Fisher served {{as one of the}} chief U.S. negotiators of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and 59 other countries on July 1, 1968. A collection of letters from Adrian Fisher to President Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk regarding his perception and activities on arms control and disarmament is maintained by the Federation of American Scientists.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 Warren {{became the}} first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Although {{controversial}} and opposed by James Bryant Conant, Warren would speak out {{about the dangers of}} nuclear fallout from weapons testing from about 1947 onwards and upon the Castle Bravo test in 1954 his views were lent some credence, which informed opinion leading up to the Partial Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty.</b> Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962 at UCLA. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. In 1971, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to science and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Minute {{traces of}} {{plutonium}} are usually {{found in the}} human body due to the 550 atmospheric and underwater nuclear tests that have been carried out, and to a small number of major nuclear accidents. Most atmospheric and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the Limited Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> in 1963, which was signed and ratified by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and other nations. Continued atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non-treaty nations included those by China (atomic bomb test above the Gobi Desert in 1964, hydrogen bomb test in 1967, and follow-on tests), and France (tests as recently as the 1990s). Because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, plutonium-239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far.|$|E
40|$|A {{system with}} {{promising}} characteristics {{was developed for}} the detection of 131 rnXe, 1 33 rnXe' 3, 3 Xe, and I 3 'Xe metastable isotopes for treaty verification of nuclear test <b>ban</b> <b>treaties.</b> The proposed method uses high-resolution electron and gamma-ray spectrometry and coincidence timing for signal selectivity and background rejection. The system enables the identification, quantification, and determination of the provenance of the relevant xenon isotopes. X-ray fluorescence gating is used to lower the backgrounds from other sources to well below the sub-becquerel level. Using coincidence and anti-coincidence schemes among the several detectors that comprise the system, K-shell conversion electrons were clearly identified with good efficiencies and energy resolutions (about 1. 4 keV for the 30 keV K-shell fluorescence x-rays and 25 keV for the conversion electrons) ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{two things}} caused {{the machine to}} be {{delivered}} to NASA. One was that Slotnick was concerned that the physical presence of the machine on campus might attract violence {{on the part of}} student radicals. This and the requirement to do secret research with the machine led ARPA to change the machine's planned location from Urbana to NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett field in Mountain View, California, where the first (and only) quadrant was delivered in 1972 and installed in a secure environment at the Central Computer Facility in building N-233. [...] Rumor has it that simulations run on the machine made the nuclear test <b>ban</b> <b>treaties</b> possible. In 1972, when it was operational at NASA, it was 13 times faster than any other machine operating at the time.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{progress}} accelerated {{towards a}} comprehensive test <b>ban</b> <b>treaty</b> (CTBT). Following {{a series of}} international meetings on the subject, the UN General Assembly approved resolution 50/64, which appealed for states to follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect for states not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT. The technology for detecting underground tests has significantly improved since the 1950s and 1960s, with monitors detecting tests down to 1 kiloton {{with a high degree}} of confidence.|$|E
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{were first}} {{observed}} in the late 1960s by the U.S. Vela satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The United States suspected that the Soviet Union might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 UTC, the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature. Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, led by Ray Klebesadel, filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen bursts and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Most {{neptunium}} (and plutonium) now {{encountered in}} the environment is due to atmospheric nuclear explosions that took place between the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945 and the ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test <b>Ban</b> <b>Treaty</b> in 1963. The total amount of neptunium released by these explosions and the few atmospheric tests that {{have been carried out}} since 1963 is estimated to be around 2500kg. The overwhelming majority of this is composed of the long-lived isotopes 236Np and 237Np since even the moderately long-lived 235Np (half-life 396days) would have decayed to less than one-billionth (10−9) its original concentration over the intervening decades. An additional very small amount of neptunium, created by neutron irradiation of natural uranium in nuclear reactor cooling water, is released when the water is discharged into rivers or lakes. The concentration of 237Np in seawater is approximately 6.5×10−5millibecquerels per liter: this concentration is between 0.1% and 1% that of plutonium.|$|E
5000|$|The United States was a {{party to}} some of the {{earliest}} modern chemical weapons <b>ban</b> <b>treaties,</b> the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and the Washington Arms Conference Treaty of 1922 although this treaty was unsuccessful. The U.S. ratified the Geneva Protocol which banned the use of chemical and biological weapons on January 22, 1975. In 1989 and 1990, the U.S. and the Soviet Union entered an agreement to end their chemical weapons programs, including [...] "binary weapons". The United States ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention which came into force in April 1997. This banned the possession of most types of chemical weapons.(The United States and Russia possess the largest remaining chemical stockpiles among Convention members according to The Centre for Arms Control and Non-proliferation, 2014. The convention also banned chemical weapons development, and requires the destruction of existing stockpiles, precursor chemicals, production facilities and weapon delivery systems.|$|R
