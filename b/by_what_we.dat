However, by the tenth century, the Pictish kingdom was {{dominated}} <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can recognise as Gaelic culture, and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty, Cináed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin).|$|E

25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ask the Father in his name.|$|E

[...] Souter concluded that he would stand by the decisions made in Duro and Oliphant.|$|E
500|$|The {{title page}} of the {{collection}} Cathay (1915), refers to the poet [...] "Rihaku", the pronunciation in Japanese of the Tang dynasty Chinese poet, Li Bai, whose poems were much beloved in China and Japan for their technical mastery and much translated in the West because of their seeming simplicity. Alexander thinks {{this is the most}} attractive [...] of Pound's work. Chinese critic Wai-lim Yip writes of it: [...] "One can easily excommunicate Pound from the Forbidden City of Chinese studies, but it seems clear that in his dealings with Cathay, even when he is given only the barest details, he is able to get into the central concerns of the original author <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> may perhaps call a kind of clairvoyance." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{final chapter}} begins with {{examples}} of sexual dimorphism, such as [...] "the antlers of the stag, the spurs of the cock... and the gorgeous plumes found in the males of the birds of paradise", with other examples chosen from across the animal kingdom. Darwin's theory of sexual selection is explained; Beddard then states the objection that female birds must be supposed to have [...] "a highly-developed aesthetic sense" [...] to choose between similar-looking males, and worse, that females of closely related species must have [...] "immense" [...] different tastes. He concludes, though, that the question cannot be answered <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> consider improbable, but requires [...] "actual observation". He calls Poulton's arguments for sexual selection [...] "very ingenious", but writes that Wallace's two different (non-selective) explanations [...] "might both be accepted". He concludes that [...] "it {{is quite possible that}} sexual selection may have played a subordinate part" [...] in producing sexually dimorphic coloration.|$|E
500|$|The Robert Bolt play A Man For All Seasons {{focuses on}} the {{conscience}} of Catholic lawyer Thomas More in his struggle with King Henry VIII ("the loyal subject is more bounden to be loyal to his conscience than to any other thing"). George Orwell wrote his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four on the isolated island of Jura, Scotland to describe how a man (Winston Smith) attempts to develop critical conscience in a totalitarian state which watches every action {{of the people and}} manipulates their thinking with a mixture of propaganda, endless war and thought control through language control (double think and newspeak) to the point where prisoners look up to and even love their torturers. In the Ministry of Love, Winston's torturer (O'Brien) states: [...] "You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable".|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} revival {{to break away}} from the {{original}} staging and interpretation was an Australian production directed by Christopher Renshaw, starring Hayley Mills as Anna, in 1991. Renshaw pointedly ignored the printed stage directions in the script when reshaping the piece into what he called [...] "an authentic Thai experience". The production had a more sinister Siamese setting, a less elegant but more forceful Anna, and a younger King (Tony Marinyo). The attraction between Anna and the King was made explicit. Renshaw [...] "cut a few lines and lyrics, and translated others into Thai to reinforce the atmosphere of a foreign land", and all Asian roles were played by Asian actors. He also asked choreographers Lar Lubovitch and Jerome Robbins to create a [...] "spiritual" [...] ballet, for the King's entrance in Act 1, and a procession with a sacred white elephant in Act II. According to Renshaw, [...] "The reds and golds were very much inspired <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> saw at the royal palace", and set and costume elements reflected images, architecture and other designs in the palace and elsewhere in Bangkok. For example, the stage was framed by columns of elephant figures, a large emerald Buddha loomed over Act I, and hundreds of elephant images were woven into the set. Renshaw said, [...] "The elephant is regarded as a very holy creature ... they believe the spirit of Buddha often resides {{in the form of the}} elephant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Implicit or {{explicit}} {{in most of}} the early studies is that the area of the gap junction was different in structure to the surrounding membranes {{in a way that made}} it look different.

2500|$|Although {{they began}} their career as [...] "a group of art school, experimental, post punk rockers," [...] the band's quick rise to stardom, {{polished}} good looks, and {{embrace of the}} teen press, almost guaranteed disfavour from music critics. During the 1980s, Duran Duran were considered the quintessential manufactured, throw-away pop group. However, according to the Sunday Herald, [...] "To describe them, as some have, as the first boy band, misrepresents their appeal. Their weapons were never just their looks, but self-penned songs." [...] As Moby said of the band in his website diary in 2003: [...] "...they were cursed <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can call the 'Bee Gees' curse, which is: 'write amazing songs, sell tons of records, and consequently incur the wrath or disinterest of the rock obsessed critical establishment.'"
