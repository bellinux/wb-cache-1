5|$|Sienkiewicz kept a diary, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} was widely {{received}} as {{inferior to the}} first, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> noted {{that this may be}} slightly unfair.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support {{life as we know}} it. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport was}} listed in FAA records through 2011, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> noted as closed indefinitely since 2006.|$|R
50|$|<b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a tough {{lesson for}} the company, and a {{warning of the}} dangers {{inherent}} in any IPO.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to manufacture a Boneless Fish with head and fins intact, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> found to be impractical.|$|R
5|$|The global {{population}} of the species has as yet not been formally confirmed, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> officially rated {{in the range of}} 'Least Concern', according to the BirdLife International in 2004. As such, the bird could be described as common in its local habitat.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{appendix}} {{marked in}} the index, which lists the Psalms of Solomon and probably contained more apocryphal/pseudepigraphical books, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> torn {{off and the}} pages containing these books have also been lost.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the handlebars {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa. It is possible to ride such a bicycle, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found that riders experienced with normal bicycles find it very difficult to learn, if they can manage it at all.|$|E
50|$|After World War II a 9-hole {{course was}} laid out at Lochridge <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{abandoned}} between the late 1940s or the early 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The first {{airliner}} {{was delivered}} to Eastern Air Lines on 5 April 1972 <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> beaten {{in the race to}} production by McDonnell Douglas's DC-10.|$|R
50|$|In May, 2014, NamePros revived its online chat {{service for}} domain investors. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> offered a chat service previously, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> discontinued. Initial {{reception}} was positive.|$|R
5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed {{that this might be}} an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light does not matter, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> shown that they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|Dnieper delta: This {{small area}} of {{distribution}} in southern Ukraine {{was reported in}} 2005. It is now isolated by steppe from the Danube basin, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested that these areas were connected through marshlands during the last glacial maximum, when {{the level of the}} Black Sea was around 100 metres lower than today. This range may also extend to the lower basins of the Dniester and Bug rivers.|$|E
5|$|Martingales {{have many}} {{applications}} in statistics, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> remarked that its use and application {{are not as}} widespread {{as it could be}} in the field of statistics, particularly statistical inference. They have found applications in areas in probability theory such as queueing theory and Palm calculus and other fields such as economics and finance.|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} three tracks and two island platforms. The center track {{is not used}} in revenue service, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used {{regularly}} as recently as 2002.|$|R
50|$|We don`t {{know about}} the origin of the 'Rostamkela' name <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told by persons that a man named Rostam helped the people of the area become united.|$|R
50|$|Neferkheperu-her-sekheper's tomb {{was officially}} opened by Bouriant in 1883 and {{excavated}} by Daressy in 1893, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> entered before, as inscriptions {{on the ceiling}} included modern-era names and dates.|$|R
5|$|Neanderthals {{are known}} to have lived in caves around the Rock of Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was {{excavated}} at Forbes' Quarry on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised for what it was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Perl is dual {{licensed}} {{under both}} the Artistic License 1.0 and the GNU General Public License. Distributions {{are available for}} most operating systems. It is particularly prevalent on Unix and Unix-like systems, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> ported to most modern (and many obsolete) platforms. With only six reported exceptions, Perl can be compiled from source code on all POSIX-compliant, or otherwise-Unix-compatible platforms.|$|E
5|$|Scully leaves The Smoking Man {{and gives}} the disc to The Lone Gunmen to analyze, {{but it turns out}} that The Smoking Man swapped the disc for a blank one. She goes back to his office <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> emptied. Mulder informs her that this was a con and she was used to {{retrieve}} this information, but he does not understand why The Smoking Man left Scully alive. The final scene shows The Smoking Man throwing the real disc into a lake.|$|E
5000|$|Canzonetta, Op. 62a, was {{performed}} {{for the first}} time in 1911, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> written in 1906, in a different version, as Rondino der Liebenden, adapted from the original music ...|$|R
25|$|In 1949, Guthrie's {{music was}} used in the film Columbia River; Guthrie <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{commissioned}} in 1941 to provide songs for the project, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> postponed by World War II.|$|R
50|$|Labour {{had held}} {{one of the}} three seats in 1983 <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{subsequently}} lost at a by-election. Basil Woodruff, the sitting county councillor, won a seat at the expense of another Independent.|$|R
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 16 days to germinate. Rarely cultivated, Banksia scabrella flowers in 3 to 5 years from seed. Information is limited on its reliability, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> grown {{successfully}} in South Australia. It is fast-growing but ultimately untidy in habit, and would benefit from regular pruning. Some forms in the wild have a more compact habit, and are more promising for horticulture.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{contains}} {{several important}} areas—Monfragüe National Park, Sierra de Gredos Regional Park, National Hunting Reserve in Cíjara, Natural Park of the Sierra Hornachuelos and Doñana National Park—where black storks stop {{over on the}} western migration route. Pesticide use has threatened birdlife in nearby Doñana. Further south, Lake Faguibine in Mali is another stopover point <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> affected by drought in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The broad-billed parrot or raven parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) {{is a large}} extinct parrot in {{the family}} Psittaculidae. It was endemic to the Mascarene island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. It is unclear what other species it is most closely related to, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the tribe Psittaculini, along with other Mascarene parrots. It had similarities with the Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus), and may have been closely related.|$|E
50|$|The British Virgin Islands had {{formerly}} had a Legislative Council, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{dissolved in}} 1901 {{largely due to}} lack of interest, and the Territory <b>had</b> <b>been</b> governed directly as part of the Leeward Islands.|$|R
50|$|The {{remainder}} of KMP {{was sold to}} Padarn in April 2009. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> intended that the deal should occur several months earlier, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> delayed owing {{to a lack of}} funding due to the credit crunch.|$|R
50|$|The {{demand and}} {{attempts}} for constitutional reform in Hong Kong had occurred {{from time to}} time, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> an intractable problem for the Colonial Government due to the overwhelmingly majority of the Chinese population.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} executions Calcraft carried out is unrecorded, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{estimated}} at 450, of whom 35 were women, making {{him one of}} the most active of British executioners. Among his better-known victims was François Courvoisier, executed on 6 July 1840 outside Newgate Prison. Courvoisier had been valet to Lord William Russell, and had murdered his master after being caught stealing silverware from the household.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{opened up to}} wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists {{are as likely to}} be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|In {{her second}} season {{of service in}} 1846, Great Britain {{successfully}} completed two round trips to New York at an acceptable speed, but was then laid up for repairs {{to one of her}} chain drums, which showed an unexpected degree of wear. Embarking on her third passage of the season to New York, her captain made a series of navigational errors that resulted in her being run hard aground in Dundrum Bay on the northeast coast of Ireland. There was no formal inquiry <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> recently suggested that it was mainly due to the captain not having updated charts, so that he mistook the new St John's light for the Calf light on the Isle of Man.|$|E
50|$|Though {{both are}} without {{supporting}} evidence <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> noted much earlier by the grammarian Pāṇini in his celebrated sutra-style treatise on Sanskrit grammar Ashtadhyayi. The town was therefore already in existence before 600 B.C.|$|R
5000|$|General Lee was {{the only}} officer {{appointed}} to the military office, which was established in 1865 by the Confederate States Congress on 23 January 1865, [...] <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> debated as early as February 27, 1862.|$|R
50|$|Boyce had won {{the seat}} only at the 1992 general election, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{continuously}} held by Labour since 1933, usually with a large majority. As a result, Labour were clear favourites to hold at the by-election.|$|R
