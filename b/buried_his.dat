5|$|In 1663, Mu'azzam {{attacked}} Pune, {{which was}} Shivaji's base at that time. However, the Mughal army was defeated and Muazzam himself was captured. He {{spent seven years}} as a prisoner of the Marathas. After his grandfather Shah Jahan died at Agra fort, Prince Muzzam was sent to Agra by orders of his father. Muzzam <b>buried</b> <b>his</b> grandfather at Taj Mahal.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx {{developed}} a catarrh that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the bronchitis and pleurisy that killed him in London on 14 March 1883 (age 64), dying a stateless person. Family and friends in London <b>buried</b> <b>his</b> body in Highgate Cemetery (East), Highgate, London on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists (George Eliot's grave is nearby). There were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} went to penalties, Rio Ferdinand won the coin toss for Manchester United, and opted for his side {{to go first}} in the shoot-out, which would be taken at the end housing the Manchester United fans. Tevez stepped up first and sent Čech the wrong way. Ballack was next up, {{shooting}} powerfully past Van der Sar. Carrick <b>buried</b> <b>his</b> spot-kick, as did Juliano Belletti with his first touch of the game, having come on for Makélélé {{at the end of}} extra time. The first miss of the shoot-out came from Ronaldo, who characteristically stuttered in his run-up in an attempt to put Čech off, but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save.|$|E

5|$|Josephine, who was of Jewish heritage, had Earp's body cremated and {{secretly}} <b>buried</b> <b>his</b> {{remains in the}} Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one could tell them where Wyatt was buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E
5|$|The Saadian Tombs {{were built}} in the 16th century as a {{mausoleum}} to bury numerous Saadian rulers and entertainers. It was lost for many years until the French rediscovered it in 1917 using aerial photographs. The mausoleum comprises the corpses of about sixty members of the Saadi Dynasty that originated in the valley of the Draa River. Among the graves are those of Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur and his family; al-Mansur <b>buried</b> <b>his</b> mother in this dynastic necropolis in 1590 after enlarging the original square funeral structure. It is located next to the south wall of the Almohad mosque of the Kasba, in a cemetery that contains several graves of Mohammad's descendants. His own tomb, richly embellished with decorations, was modeled on the Nasrid mausoleum in Granada, Spain. The building is composed of three rooms; the best known has a roof supported by twelve columns and encloses the tomb of al-Mansur's son. The room exemplifies Islamic architecture with floral motifs, calligraphy, zellij and carrara marble, and the stele is in finely worked cedar wood and stucco. Outside the building are a garden and the graves of soldiers and servants.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Kansas Anderson {{continued}} horse trafficking, but ranchers in the area soon became aware of his operations. In May 1862 Baker issued an arrest warrant for Griffith, whom Anderson helped hide. Some local citizens suspected that the Anderson family was assisting Griffith and traveled to their house to confront William C. Anderson. After hearing their accusations against his sons, he was incensed—he found Baker's involvement particularly infuriating. The next day he traveled to the Council Grove courthouse with a gun, intending to force Baker to withdraw the warrant. As he entered the building he was restrained by a constable and fatally shot by Baker. William Anderson <b>buried</b> <b>his</b> father, and was subsequently arrested for assisting Griffith. However, he was quickly released owing to {{a problem with the}} warrant, and fled to Agnes City, fearing that he would be lynched. There he met Baker, who temporarily placated him by providing a lawyer. Anderson remained in Agnes City until he learned that Baker would not be charged, as the judge's claim of self-defense had been accepted by legal authorities. Anderson was outraged and went to Missouri with his siblings. William and Jim Anderson then traveled southwest of Kansas City, robbing travelers to support themselves.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day (26 February), police began excavating {{the section of}} the garden at Cromwell Street where Fred indicated he had <b>buried</b> <b>his</b> daughter's body. Shortly after 4 p.m., police found a human thigh bone protruding from a section of the garden Fred had insisted police need not look in. Excavating {{the section of the}} garden where Fred had indicated he had <b>buried</b> <b>his</b> daughter's body, investigators discovered a mass of jumbled human remains encased in the remnants of a bin bag and intertwined with two lengths of rope. These dismembered remains were taken to the police headquarters for further examination, where they were determined to be those of a young woman, although one kneecap and several phalange bones were missing, and her fingernails were discovered in a pile, suggesting they may have been torn from her fingers as a means of torture. Several hours later, the body was identified via dental records as being that of Heather West.|$|E
