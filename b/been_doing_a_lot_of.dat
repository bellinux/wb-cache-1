"Yeah 3x" [...] (pronounced [...] "Yeah three times" [...] or [...] "Yeah Yeah Yeah"; {{sometimes}} stylized as [...] "Yeah 3X") {{is a song}} by American {{recording artist}} Chris Brown, released as the lead single from his fourth studio album F.A.M.E. on October 25, 2010. It was written by Brown, DJ Frank E, Kevin McCall, Amber Streeter and Calvin Harris, and was produced by DJ Frank E. Brown recorded the song for his pop audience as he had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> mixtapes and urban records. [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop, Europop, and electro house song; it uses a video game-type beat and features a thick bassline and big synth chords. The song uses elements of Harris' 2009 single [...] "I'm Not Alone".|$|E
500|$|Brown {{said the}} song was {{given to him by}} DJ Frank E {{while he was in the}} studio writing songs for other artists and himself.

I’ve <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> mix-tape stuff, a lot of urban records...the pop audience didn’t really have anything to gauge from so I really wanted to give them this and I feel like 'Yeah 3x' is something different, something new and it’s just [...] positive record. It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of like when we wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record." ...|$|E

[...] McLean, the former owner, was to remain in command.

2500|$|At a {{time when}} {{producers}} were structuring Shortland Street as a soap with a culturally diverse cast, the character of Grace Kwan was created - a hard working Asian doctor. In 1994, Lynette Forday joined the cast as the part of Grace. After 3 years on the soap, Forday left the soap with Grace making her final appearance in 1997. In 2013 Forday was offered to reprise the role after 16 years off screen, to which she was happy to agree. She signed an initial [...] "Major Recurring Guest" [...] contract, which would see the character appear through to 2014. Forday described returning to the set as [...] "odd" [...] but also [...] "wonderful". Forday had considered the idea of returning to play Grace as a [...] "no-brainer" [...] and was happy to work alongside her former co worker, Michael Galvin (Dr. Chris Warner), [...] "It was very surreal ... We have <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> work together and he's just lovely. He's been very helpful and is amazing." [...] In October Television New Zealand announced Grace would be returning to the show during the month. Grace made her return on screen on 23 October 2013. Grace departed on 24 February 2014 but returns {{a couple of months}} later in May 2014 she made her last appearance 11 December 2014.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the now {{strained}} relationship between Lucky and Luke, Jackson stated: “Tony [...] and I have had some great scenes that feel like re-establishing something. Again, I did not watch the other versions of Lucky, but for me it's picking up where I left off ten years ago, but now as an adult. There {{is a lot of}} interesting chemistry going on there.” The history between Jackson and Geary helped the on-screen relationship become more dynamic. Jackson's return also saw the relationship between Lucky and Jason change. Although Lucky does not abandon the police force, the previously black-and-white cop works hand-in-hand with the mob enforcer in attempts to take down both [...] "The Balkan" [...] (Benzali) and Franco (James Franco). Lucky becomes stuck between {{the two sides of the}} law. Jackson explained to The Huffington Post in 2009: [...] "I think my instincts towards him being a detective (include) ambiguity. Growing up as Luke's son, and given Luke's ties to the mob, Lucky's seen the world from both sides. I don't think that Lucky sees it as black and white. There are shades of gray." [...] In 2010, when asked if Lucky would become more “Luke-like” now that he was back in the role, Jackson replied: “I am hoping that is where they go with it. Lucky has <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> that straight cop stuff. I think if we can show the wild side of him that resembles Luke that will be nice.” He commented in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly that he would like Lucky and Luke to work a con again, stating: [...] "Lucky feels the most free and like himself when he's doing stuff like that. They've had Luke and Lucky pitted against each other for a while, so it'd be nice to pair them up." ...|$|E
