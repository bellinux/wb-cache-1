5|$|Symbolically, the sea {{has long}} <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as a hostile and {{dangerous}} environment populated by fantastic creatures: the gigantic Leviathan of the Bible, the shark-like Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the ship-swallowing Kraken of late Norse mythology.|$|E
5|$|Birds have {{featured}} in culture and art since prehistoric times, {{when they were}} represented in early cave paintings. Some birds have <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the Māori's legendary Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. Birds were later used as symbols of power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors. With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the other main island chains of Scotland {{many of the more}} remote islands were {{abandoned}} during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since prehistoric times. These places had <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as relatively self-sufficient agricultural economies, but both island residents and outsiders later came to consider that the more remote islands lacked the essential services of a modern industrial economy.|$|E
50|$|Theories on emotion {{have focused}} on perception, {{subjective}} experience, and appraisal. Predominant theories of emotion and emotion perception include what type of emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived,</b> how emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> somatically, and at what stage of an event emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> and translated into subjective, physical experience.|$|R
50|$|This {{suggests}} that for sound to <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> at 7-8 Hz, the 7-8 Hz SPL {{would have to}} be 12.3 dB higher than the 92.0 dB SPL required at 15.5 Hz, which means that the 7-8 Hz SPL would require at least 104 dB of SPL to <b>be</b> <b>perceived.</b> For 3 Hz to <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> the SPL would need to add another 12.3 dB, or reach 116 dB of SPL, to <b>be</b> <b>perceived.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{literature}} {{has noted that}} [...] "inositol" [...] <b>is</b> sometimes <b>perceived</b> as sweet and/or salty. In general, the inositols will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as sweet due to their equat-trans-hydroxyl pairs. The muco-inositol isomer <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as both sweet and salty. It <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as salty due to its pair of diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pairs. This pair of hydroxyl groups can form a dimer with the diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pair of the hydrated sodium-ion receptor.|$|R
5|$|The {{illustrations}} {{provide insight}} into life and festivities at the Heian Palace; which sometimes consisted of {{something as simple as}} games on the lake although those might have <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> differently at the time of manufacture. Like other picture scrolls on court life such as the Genji Monogatari Emaki or the Pillow Book Emaki (Makura no Sōshi Emaki) they provide valuable information on the architectural shinden-zukuri style (particularly on interiors) which is characterized by a mixture of Tang and traditional Japanese influences.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as Muslims, Arabs, and others thought to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} Test, Bradman {{returned}} to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe bodyline was not quite the threat that had <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|In addition, male {{speakers}} who <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as gay exhibited greater breathiness and hyperarticulation of stressed syllables {{than male}} speakers who <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as heterosexual. It {{is important to}} note that speakers who are identified as gay <b>are</b> not necessarily <b>perceived</b> as feminine.|$|R
50|$|If the lag between {{consecutive}} presentations {{is prolonged}} further, ('beta' / 'optimal') motion <b>is</b> <b>perceived.</b> The line in position A <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> {{to move to}} position B. In the original experiments of Wertheimer (1912), a lag of 60 ms {{was found to be}} optimal to obtain this kind of percept. If the lag is further prolonged, two forms of partial movement can be perceived: dual movement and singular movement. In dual movement, two lines <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> that both move, but not in a continuous way (like from A to B). In singular motion, two lines <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> of which only one is moving. Finally, from a lag of around 200 ms in the original study onwards, the two lines <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> to occur in succession—first A, then B.|$|R

5|$|Madagascar has {{historically}} <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as {{being on the}} margin of mainstream African affairs despite being {{a founding member of}} the Organisation of African Unity, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the African Union. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the unconstitutional transfer of executive power to Rajoelina. Madagascar is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military. Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India.|$|E
5|$|Ole Juulson Kvale was a Minnesota congressman of the Farmer-Labor Party, and a proud Norse-American. Kvale was {{a member}} of the Norse-American Centennial Commission, which was to {{organize}} a 100th anniversary celebration of the Restauration voyage. This celebration was important to a Norse-American community that had <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as antiwar during World War I, and was attempting to display both ethnic pride and assimilation. Kvale, a Lutheran minister, was also a member of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, and in January 1925 approached the Treasury Department, seeking its support for a commemorative coin in honor of the anniversary; he was told that the Treasury would oppose it. Commemorative coins for ethnic heritage groups were unlikely to pass Congress at that time due to the controversy caused by the 1924 Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar, seen by some as Protestant propaganda.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} made {{as an attempt}} to capture the essence of The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo's live {{performances}} on film, and also as a means for both director Elfman to retire from music to work on film projects, and to serve as a transition between the group's former cabaret style and a new wave-based style. Amid negative reactions to content in the film that had <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as being offensive, the film was screened as a midnight movie, received positive notice, and developed a cult following. In 2004, the film was digitally restored and released on DVD, and in 2008, the film was colorized.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{substance}} was famously critiqued by David Hume, who held that since substance cannot <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> {{it should not}} be assumed to exist. But the claim that substance cannot <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>is</b> neither clear nor obvious, and neither is the implication obvious.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{perceived}} forms and drivers of sexual and gender based violence in post conflict settings with focus on Northern Uganda. It applied qualitative approaches primarily using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Study findings revealed that although {{all forms of}} violence <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> prevalent, physical and emotional violence <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> the most occurring. Men <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> the main perpetrators of violence. However, there were cases of men who reported to experience violence from women. Few men reported violence to authorities because it <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> stigmatizing; such men would <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as weak in a patriarchal society that perceives ideal men {{to be strong and}} less susceptible to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Early marriages are a major form of gender based violence which <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> as normal in a number of communities despite the evidence that it contributes to negative social and reproductive health outcomes. Sexual violence cases in form of rape, defilement as well as incest <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> on the rise in the sub-region. The study identified several drivers of SGBV including poverty, power imbalances in access to and control over resources, insecurity, blaming HIV infection on female partners, HIV related stigma and discrimination, alcohol and substance abuse...|$|R

Instructors who demonstrate competence, character, and/or caring <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> {{to engage in a}} variety of effective instructional communication behaviors such as argumentativeness, verbal and nonverbal immediacy, affinity seeking [...], and assertiveness and responsiveness. Moreover, credible instructors <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> low in verbal aggressiveness [...] and less likely to use behaviors that interfere with student learning.|$|R
5|$|The {{role of the}} sea {{in human}} culture has been {{important}} for centuries, as people experience the sea in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous. Human responses to the sea {{can be found in}} artforms including literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted the sea. Symbolically, the sea has <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. In the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolises the personal and the collective unconscious in dream interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{missed the}} first Test, worn out by {{constant}} cricket and the ongoing argument with the Board of Control. The English bowlers used Bodyline intermittently in the first match, to the crowd's vocal displeasure. Behind the scenes, administrators began to express concerns to each other. Yet the English tactics still did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain Monty Noble praised the English bowling. For the second Test, Bradman returned to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use Bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe Bodyline was not quite the threat that had <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness. Meanwhile, Woodfull was being encouraged to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack, not least by {{members of his own}} side such as Vic Richardson, but refused to consider doing so.|$|E
5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as a form of white music.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have often}} used the {{opposition}} between Rome and Egypt in Antony and Cleopatra to set forth defining {{characteristics of the}} various characters. While some characters are distinctly Egyptian, others are distinctly Roman, some are torn between the two, and still others attempt to remain neutral.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether students at two universities perceive social power differences {{between male and}} female business faculty. Using gender schema and social power theories, we posit that female faculty members will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> by students as having greater referent power and that male faculty members will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> by students as having greater expert, legitimate, reward and coercive power. Results of a survey involving 892 students at two universities indicate that male faculty members <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as having greater expert power, while no gender differences exist on referent, reward and coercive power. Contrary to our hypotheses, female faculty members <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as having greater legitimate power...|$|R
5|$|One {{of several}} ecclesiastical sources that deal {{specifically}} with Ragnall is an undated grant to the Cluniac priory at Paisley. Since this grant probably {{dates to the}} period after Ragnall's defeat to Áengus, it may be evidence of an attempt made by Ragnall to secure an alliance with Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204). The patrons of this priory were members of Alan's own family, a powerful kindred that had recently begun to expand its influence westwards from Renfrew, to the frontier of the Scottish realm and the fringes of Argyll. Since Bute seems to have fallen {{into the hands of}} this kindred at about the time of Ragnall's grant, it is possible that Alan took advantage of the internal conflict between the meic Somairle, and seized the island before 1200. Alternately, Alan may have received the island from Ragnall as payment for military support against Áengus, who appears to have gained the upper hand over Ragnall by 1192. Alan's expansion and influence in territories outwith the bounds of the Scottish kingdom may have <b>been</b> <b>perceived</b> as a threat by William I, King of Scots (died 1214), and may partly explain the king's construction of a royal castle at Ayr in 1195. This fortress extended Scottish royal authority into the outer Firth of Clyde region, and was probably intended to dominate not only William's peripheral barons, but also independent rulers just beyond the borders of the Scottish realm. In fact, Alan's westward expansion appears to have suddenly ceased at about 1200, and may have been a consequence of royal anxiety concerning an alliance with Ragnall.|$|E
