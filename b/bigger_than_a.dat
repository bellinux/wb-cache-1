5|$|The {{couple had}} still been in debt {{at the time of}} Blanchard's death, so to {{minimise}} her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a hydrogen-filled gas balloon (or Charlière), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because she was small and light, she was able to cut back on the amount of gas used to inflate the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.|$|E

These photons bounce off mirrors to create a beam of light; the laser.|$|E

25|$|The {{satellite}} {{was designed}} and constructed {{in less than a}} month. Sputnik 1 was a simple polished metal sphere no <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> beach ball, containing batteries powering a transmitter using 4 external communication antennae. Korolev personally managed the assembly at a hectic pace; and the satellite was placed in orbit using a rocket that had successfully launched only once before. International response to the accomplishment was electrifying, and political ramifications continued for decades. Nikita Khrushchev was pleased with this success, and encouraged launch of a more sophisticated satellite less than a month later in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 3 November.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel is}} a work of fiction set in the summer of 1977 that draws on places and {{historical}} events in India. The Patel Family's discussions of the political situation refer to the Emergency period of the mid-1970s, when Indira Gandhi's administration ruled by decree, curtailed press freedoms, and imprisoned political opponents. Pondicherry is a former French colony in India. It does have an Indian Coffee House and Botanical Gardens. The Botanical Garden had a zoo in 1977 but did not have any animals <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> deer. Munnar, the destination for the Patel family's vacation, is a small but popular hill station in Kerala. Madurai, also referenced in the novel, is a popular tourist and pilgrimage site in Tamil Nadu.|$|E

However, senior members of the party disagreed with this stance and were of the view that Moro had been drugged and tortured to utter these words. Out of this experience, Sciascia wrote an important book.|$|E
25|$|With {{the surging}} fears {{haunting}} {{the people of}} Madras, the Congress party of the state would do nothing <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> small demonstration and insisted {{to the people that}} there were no grounds for alarm. In contrast, DMK held an Anti-Hindi Conference in Trichirapalli on 17 January 1965. The conference was supported by all major opposition parties and funded by major wealthy industrialists – the industrialists who themselves feared of losing to influence of the North if Hindi were made the official language. The conference decided to hold 26 January (the fifteen anniversary of India’s republic day) as a Day of Mourning. Madras State's Chief Minister Bhakthavatchalam declared a warning that the state government would not tolerate the sanctity of the Republic day blasphemed. Hence DMK advanced the day of mourning by two days, id est. on 24 January. Although no longer a day of mourning, plans of demonstration on the 26th were still underway. DMK and its then ally, Swatantara Party had asked its members to fly black flags in their homes on that day. Bhakthavatchalam declared that such acts would be considered traitorous.|$|E

[...] Unexpected word-play is a characteristic feature of her style.

[...] Sappho's poetry often uses hyperbole, according to ancient critics [...] "because of its charm". An example is found in fragment 111, where Sappho writes that [...] "The groom approaches like Ares Much <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> big man".|$|E

In Mexican Spanish, its nickname is el tigre: 16th century Spaniards had no native word in their language for a cat smaller than a lion but <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> leopard nor had ever encountered such a creature in the Old World, and so named it after a cat whose ferocity would have only been known to them through Roman writings, popular literature during the Renaissance.|$|E
