5000|$|All the E.I to E.IV Eindeckers used a gravity {{fuel tank}} {{which had to}} be {{constantly}} filled by hand-pumping from the main fuel tank, which starting with the Fokker E.II was mounted behind the pilot; this task had to be performed up to eight times an hour. Both the rudder and elevator were aerodynamically balanced, and the type had no fixed tail surfaces. This combination rendered the Eindecker very responsive to pitch and yaw. For an inexperienced pilot, the extreme sensitivity of the elevators made level flight difficult; German ace Leutnant Kurt Wintgens, who along with Leutnant Parschau was the primary Fliegertruppe pilot responsible for bringing the first armed Fokker monoplanes into active service during {{the spring and summer of}} 1915, once stated [...] "lightning is a straight line compared with the <b>barogram</b> of the first solo". The roll response of the Eindecker, on the other hand, was poor. This is often blamed on the use of wing-warping rather than ailerons - although the monoplanes of the time, even when fitted with ailerons, often had unpredictable or unresponsive roll control due to the flexibility of their externally braced wings.|$|E

It is found that the first arriving waves are controlled by the properties of the lower atmospheric channel. Comparison of theoretical results and experimental data from large thermonuclear explosions is made in the time and frequency domains, and the following conclusions are reached: (1) The major features on <b>barograms</b> are due to dispersion; (2) superposition of several modes is needed to explain observed features; (3) scatter of data outside the range permitted by extreme atmospheric models shows the influence of winds for A 1; wind effects and higher modes are less important for A_ 2 waves.

40|$|The {{vertical}} {{distribution of the}} pressure, temperature, and density of the atmosphere varies from day to day. Thus, rates of climb on different days cannot be compared directly, but must be corrected with reference to a standard rate of diminution of air density with increasing altitude. The following problem, therefore, has to be solved. An airplane has climbed on a certain day under prevailing atmospheric conditions {{as shown by the}} barograph. How would the same airplane climb in a standard atmosphere? This problem has already been dealt with by Everling, using the monthly and yearly mean of the vertical temperature distribution. Von Mises solved the problem by arithmetical methods. Here, conditions are examined which shorten or lengthen the climbing time. In establishing the corrected <b>barogram,</b> computation seems more practical than graphical treatment. The basis of {{the answer to the question}} answered here is summed up in the remark that lift, drag, propeller thrust, and torque and engine power depend only on the density of the air and do not change with the pressure and temperature, provided that the density remains constant...|$|E

To supplement the 2100 CST sea level pressure data, significant pressures taken from station barograms for several hours preceding 2100 CST are corrected for diurnal variation, reduced to sea level, and plotted at appropriate points along lines parallel to the direction of movement of the Low. These additional pressures {{make it possible to}} show the steep pressure gradient which caused the rapid pressure rise registered on some of the station barograms. By means of synthetic virtual temperature soundings, additional heights are obtained for the 900 - and 800 -mb. charts at points where surface data are available and at the same points where <b>barogram</b> data are used on the sea level map. These additional data make it possible to show the steep geopotential gradient at upper levels corresponding to the steep pressure gradient at sea level. Geostrophic winds of 1000 knots or more are indicated by the steep gradient aloft but, by use of the equations of motion, it is found that the air does not remain {{under the influence of the}} steep gradient long enough to attain such speeds. 1...|$|E

Comparison of theoretical and experimental barograms from large thermonuclear explosions leads to the following conclusions: (1) The major features on the <b>barogram</b> {{can be explained by the}} super-position of four modes, (2) Different portions of the vertical temperature structure of the atmosphere control the relative excitation of these modes, (3) A normalized point source is sufficient to model thermonuclear explosions, (4) The observed shift in dominance of certain frequencies with yield and altitude can be explained using the empirical scaling laws derived from the direct wave near the explosion. A matrix formulation {{is used to}} derive integral expressions for the time transformed displacement fields produced by simple sources at depth in a multilayered elastic isotropic halfspace. The integrals are evaluated for their residue contribution to obtain surface wave displacements in the frequency domain. The theory includes the effect of layering and source depth for the following: (1) Rayleigh waves from an explosive source, (2) Rayleigh waves from a vertical point source, (3) Rayleigh and Love waves from a vertical strike slip fault model. The latter source also includes the effect of fault dimensions and rupture velocity. The theory presented here is the ground work for the numerical computation of theoretical seismograms for use in a later paper in which a comparison will be made between observations and theory in both the time and frequency domain.

40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} disturbances with periods {{as long as}} 14 min {{have been}} recorded by sensitive microbarographs at five stations along the Pacific coast and at a station in Alaska after the great Alaskan earthquake of March 28, 1964. The phase and group velocities of the disturbances {{are consistent with those}} so far observed in atmospheric nuclear explosions and with theoretical dispersion curves for acoustic-gravity waves. These velocities and field observation of the tectonic deformations in the epicentral region suggest that the pressure disturbances might have been caused by the rapid vertical ground displacement at the source area. Theoretical <b>barograms</b> appropriate to the Berkeley station have been constructed on the basis of reasonable estimates for the source dimension, the amount of uplift and subsidence, and the time rate of the displacement, taking the atmospheric and instrumental responses into account.

40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} {{waves from}} the Mount St Helens eruption 1980 May 18 have been clearly recorded by a sensitive microbarograph at Berkeley, California. The record shows {{three types of}} waves with different group velocities.

Synthetic <b>barograms</b> appropriate to the Berkeley station have been calculated {{on the basis of the}} dynamic response of the lower atmospheric structure, together with various assumptions of source properties. Comparisons between synthetic and observed <b>barograms</b> provide estimates for ranges of the time history of upward particle velocity at the source, source dimensions and the velocity of the source spreading over the blast zone, as well as for the average dissipation effects over the circumferential path. The results suggest that two major compression pulses on the A 1 record correlate with the arrival of pressure waves from the first (lateral) blast and second (vertical) blast, although the inferred interblast time interval is not consistent with that estimated from seismic observations...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a theory to compute seismograms and atmospheric disturbances such as ionospheric oscillations or pressure variations in a realistic spherical earth model with atmosphere. This theory is valid for a source located {{either in the}} solid earth or in the atmosphere. Solid earth and atmospheric normal modes are computed for a radiation boundary condition that models the dissipation of acoustic signals in the high atmosphere of the Earth. We show that the coupling between ground and atmosphere occurs at a set of frequencies related to fundamentals and harmonics of atmospheric modes. Spheroidal modes near these frequencies have up to 0. 04 per cent of their energy in the atmosphere, and thus may be strongly excited by atmospheric sources.

40|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} perturbations {{from the}} 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (Mw = 9. 2) were observed by sensitive microbarographs at several global stations. Among these observations, very low-frequency acoustic-gravity waves (â¼ 1. 4 â 2. 8 mHz) {{with a group}} velocity around 300 â 314 m/s and amplitudes ranging between â¼ 1 and 12 Pa can be clearly identified through data processing at four stations on the Japanese Islands and also at four International Monitoring System (IMS) stations around the Indian Ocean. Assuming several seismic source parameters for this great thrust earthquake, we produce synthetic <b>barograms</b> using a realistic thermal structure in the atmosphere up to an altitude of 220 km. For this modeling, we incorporate the source dimensions in different zones, the expanding velocity of the source region, the vertical displacements of uplift and subsidence, and their time constants. Combinations of these source parameters provide synthetic waveforms consistent with the general features of the observed low-frequency records. The results clearly indicate that the recorded waves may have been generated by large-scale coseismic uplift and subsidence of the sea bottom and associated swelling and depression of the sea surface over the source region extending for 1500 km. The uplift in the south-central zone of the Andaman-Nicobar regions may be substantially larger than in the other zones. The time constant of the coseimic vertical deformation {{is found to be}} in the range of 1. 0 â 1. 5 min, which may correspond to the time elapsed shortly before the generation of tsunami waves...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Two {{successive}} {{years of}} wind speed and direction data, from January 1973 through December 1974, have been measured and recorded at Yaquina Head, 6 km north of Newport, Oregon. Analysis {{of the data}} permitted 65 cases of strong wind to be isolated and separated into four distinct wind speed categories. With the aid of surface charts, upper air sounding, and sea level pressures from several stations, numerous meteorological events, occurring concurrently with peak winds at Yaquina Head, have been evaluated for {{a significant contribution to}} the local wind. Cyclone centers associated with strong coastal wind have been plotted and analyzed with regard to location, speed and direction of motion, sea surface pressure, and pressure change during periods of strong winds. The result of this analysis indicates that many cases of strong coastal wind measured at Yaquina Head are associated with cyclones located southwest of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The pressure change experienced by these cyclones is related to the strength of the observed wind at Yaquina Head. Likewise, the locations of these pressure centers are related to the duration of strong wind measured at Yaquina Head. The direction of motion of the cyclones and the value of the sea surface pressure {{at the center of the}} cyclones seem unrelated to local wind speed. Frontal zones associated with cases of strong wind have been evaluated with regard to type, speed, and direction of motion prior to strong surface winds. No relationship was found between these factors and the strength of the wind. The direction of the wind versus the speed of the wind was reviewed and the results were separated into several classes. The result of this classification indicated that in 73 percent of the cases the measured peak wind occurred prior to an abrupt veering of the wind. Only 21 percent of the cases lacked this wind shift. The local pressure field was examined for pressure differences which might result in a strong coastal wind flow. Station pressures from three locations were used as well as <b>barograms</b> from Newport, Oregon, in describing the pressure field. No correlation between these pressures differences and the strength of the local wind could be found. Finally, the north-south component of the geostrophic wind was calculated and compared with speed of the measured wind. No consistent agreement could be established between the measured surface wind speed and the calculated north- south component of the geostrophic wind. The lack of data west of Yaquina Head and Oregon Coast continue to present a problem for those who consider coastal winds...|$|R
40|$|Observational {{results of}} the ground {{deformations}} obtained by means of tiltmeters and extensometers at two stations in Wakayama City in Kinki District, Japan, are presented and discussed with particular emphasis on the relation to meteorological and oceanic phenomena. The ground at the Oura station inclines gradually to the north-westward and a similar tendency is also discernible at the Akibasan station. It is shown that the annual changes observed are due to the thermal deformation of the ground by the temperature change on the ground surface and that their wave lengths and mode are nearly equal {{to those of the}} daily changes, depending mainly on the local topography near the stations. Drift, that might be caused by initial disturbances on the instruments and their surroundings, lasted for several years on a record at Akibasan, which suggests that every discretion is required as to the interpretation of secular changes from conventional tiltmetric or extensometric results. From a concurrent observations by two pairs of tiltmeters of the horizontal pendulum type, it is ascertained that tiltmeters of this type may be used for observations of secular tilting motions with certain qualifications. The diurnal and semidiurnal changes observed by each pair of the two tiltmeters are affected by the atmospheric pressure and air temperature, and each behaves in a different manner, from which it is concluded that these effects have very local characteristics detectable even when the tiltmeters are placed so close to each other. This should be given due consideration in an observation of minute ground deformations and in the evaluation of tidal constituents, especially in that of the Sz constituent. An estimation of the effect of the atmospheric pressure gradient on the ground tilt is attempted as to the atmospheric tidal waves, the obtained value being about 7 " per 1 mb/km, but the direction of the ground tilt is oppose to that of the loading influence due to the barometric pressure. From the spectral structures of the tiltgram at Akibasan it is shown that the change in the periodic range from 1 to 33 days in the the ground tilt at the station is scarcely influenced by the changes of the air temperature, atmospheric pressure, its time derivative and loading of the water in the neighboring sea. It is also shown that the effect of precipitation is, on the contrary, very remarkable and that the ground tilt caused by an impulsive precipitation is tentatively represented by atÂ· exp(- f 3 t) with equal values of f 3 for the E-W and N-S components of the tilt. Corrected spectra for the disturbances are given, which suggest predominance of several oscillatory tilting motions. Comparisons of the spectral structures of the tiltmetric and extensometric records with those of the <b>barograms</b> show that the amplitude ratio of the ground tilt or strain to the pressure increases and the phase difference between them also varies slightly with the frequency. This frequency dependence of the spectral ratios can be apparently expressed as the sum of the two parts proportional directly to the change of the pressure and proportional to the time derivative of the pressure change, respectively. A tentative method for elimination of the disturbances due to the oceanic and meteorological changes from the tiltgrams is introduced. Digital filterings of the tiltgrams by several types of filters are also attempted to detect small anomalous ground tilts. There can be seen in these results that peculiar ground tilts of the magnitude of about 0. 02 " or smaller existed at the two stations shortly before and after the three local earthquakes occurred on Nov. 14, 1960, in this district. Although these phenomena {{may be related to the}} occurrence of these earthquakes, further investigations are needed to verify the relation between them...|$|R
