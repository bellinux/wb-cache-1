5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they went <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect {{the approach of the}} battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|The first {{champions of}} French {{football}} were Standard Athletic Club, who defeated The White Rovers 2–0 in Courbevoie on 6 May 1894. The initial championship match {{was held on}} 29 April but finished 2–2, so the match was replayed. Standard {{went on to win}} the French championship four more times over the next seven years before RC Roubaix took control of the league becoming the first French club to win three straight titles beginning in 1902. Following Roubaix's success, the ownership of the amateur league title began rotating <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north of France to the south of France with Marseille eventually winning the last amateur title in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Alipate {{practice}}d {{with both}} the Los Angeles Raiders and the New York Jets in 1993, but he {{failed to make the}} active rosters for either team. In 1994, Alipate was again among the Jets' final cuts {{before the start of the}} regular season, but he was offered a spot on the team's practice squad. The Jets frequently moved Alipate <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> practice squad and the active roster throughout the season. On November 14, Alipate recovered a botched punt in a 17–10 loss to the Green Bay Packers. Alipate also forced a fumble in a November 27 game against the Miami Dolphins. He finished the season with eight games played for the Jets. When active, Alipate was used mostly on special teams. He was signed to the Green Bay Packers' practice squad in January 1995. He re-signed with the Packers on February 21 and was waived on June 12, 1995.|$|E
5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, {{with the help of his}} or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E

25|$|Blake {{maintained}} a nomadic existence {{for nearly all}} {{the remainder of his}} long life. With the exception of the wartime era, he traveled <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mainland to Hawaii every year until the mid 1950s. While in Hawaii, he usually lived in a beach shack or aboard a boat; on the mainland he often lived out of his car. He typically supported himself by working as a lifeguard, an occupation he pursued into his early sixties.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for the group with gruelling schedules including spending over thirteen weeks in America filming the first series of their show and their subsequent television specials, the members often felt that the travelling <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> UK and the US was [...] "perhaps more tiring than what we were actually going out to America to do". Paul Cattermole once commented that {{the speed of the}} schedule sometimes caused a [...] "kind of dreamscape in your head", as the group often felt [...] "jetlagged and tired". On top of the filming schedules, the group often performed at high-profile pop music festivals such as Party in the Park where they performed for 100,000 fans. The intensity of the schedule would be a constant battle for the group and was going to continue to take its toll for all the years S Club 7 were together. In spite of this, the group always remained in solidarity that they were all good friends, [...] "cared for each other a lot" [...] and supported each other through difficult times in the group.|$|E

60|$|For a {{considerable}} time this single scholar constituted the school, {{and he and}} the schoolmaster walked <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> village to the little cabin every day; while the only interest that the townspeople seemed to take in them was shown by their laughing at the schoolmaster, and comparing him to a hen with one chicken. It must not be supposed {{that it was because}} the citizens did not believe in education; but, as they had been in the habit of sending their children away to school, they thought that that was the proper thing to do, and, as there never had been a school in the town, they saw no reason why there should be one then. But the school increased, and {{in less than a year}} it numbered twenty scholars.|$|E
6000|$|So <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{ground to}} the old nest in the tree Whitefoot hurried, and {{presently}} {{there was quite a}} pile of weed stalks and soft grass and strips of bark in the old nest. Mrs. Whitefoot joined Whitefoot in hunting for just the right things, but she spent more time in arranging the material. Over that old nest she made a fine high roof. Down through the lower side she cut a little round doorway just big enough for them to pass through. Unless you happened to be underneath looking up, you never would have guessed there was an entrance at all. Inside was a snug, round room, and in this she made the softest and most comfortable of beds. As it began to look more and more like a home, Whitefoot himself became as excited and eager as Mrs. Whitefoot had been from the beginning. [...] "It certainly {{is going to be a}} fine home," [...] said Whitefoot.|$|E
