As the episode ends, Bartlet is searching for a good pen, and realizes the full depth of his dependence on Mrs. Landingham.|$|E
5|$|Thinking {{that the}} Martians {{assumed that the}} dove {{was a symbol of}} war, President Dale tells Professor Donald Kessler to renegotiate with the Martians, whose {{ambassador}} is invited to address the United States Congress. At this meeting, the Martians massacre most of Congress. Donald begs the Martian Ambassador to stop, but is rendered unconscious and taken aboard their ship, where he is later shown with his body parts dismembered and his disembodied head remaining animated. General Decker tries to convince President Dale to retaliate with nuclear warfare, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> refuses.|$|E

5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the rebel}} {{soldiers}} {{had been told}} that they were attacking in order to save Diệm from a mutiny by the Presidential Guard. Only one or two officers in any given rebel unit knew the true situation. A high wall, a fence and a few guard posts, surrounded the palace grounds. The mutinous paratroopers disembarked from their transport vehicles and moved into position for an attack on the main gate. Some ran forward and others raked automatic gunfire {{at the front of the}} palace, shattering most of the windows and puncturing the walls. Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes. A rebel machine gun fired into Diệm's bedroom window from the adjacent Palais de Justice and penetrated his bed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> had arisen just a few minutes earlier.|$|E

With Brain {{navigating}} through the minefield, Snake manages to avoid most of the explosives, but the cab hits a mine and is blown in half, killing Cabbie. As the group flees on foot, Brain is killed when he steps on another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, and {{stands in the middle of}} the road, shooting at the Duke's car until he runs her down, killing her. Snake and the President reach the perimeter wall and the guards raise the President on a rope. The Duke opens fire on the wall, killing the guards and forcing Snake to dive for cover, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> shoots the Duke dead.

5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} recognised Croats as {{a minority}} native to Hungary; it has decided to implement the optional regulations of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages {{with respect to the}} Croatian language and establish a minority self-government for the Croatian minority in Hungary, guaranteeing cultural autonomy. The Croatian minority set up 127 local and 7 county self-governments in Hungary. There are concerns that Croatian minority rights in Hungary are being diminished, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of Croatia has assessed that both Croatian and Hungarian minority policies were appropriate.

25|$|In November 1960, mutinous paratroopers {{attempted}} to depose Diệm, and laid siege to Gia Long Palace. Khánh {{arrived on the}} scene and climbed over the palace wall to reach Diệm during the siege. Khánh lived close to the palace, and the plotters had tried to put him under house arrest {{at the start of the}} coup, but were unaware that he moved houses. Khánh proceeded to coordinate the loyalist defenders, along with Ky Quan Liem, the deputy director of the Civil Guard. During the standoff, Khánh met with rebel officers to keep abreast of their demands that Diệm share power. He then advised Diệm to resign due to the demands of the rebel forces and protestors outside the palace, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> refused.|$|E
25|$|After more arguing {{between the}} senior officers, {{they agreed that}} Khánh, Minh, and would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new {{civilian}} government could be formed. The trio then brought paratroopers into Saigon to end the rioting. However, the triumvirate did little else {{due to the lack}} of unity in the ruling triumvirate. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiêm and Minh. He also released many of the rioters who had forced him to back down on his powergrab and liberalised the press after more anti-government protests. U.S. military commander William Westmoreland deplored the concessions Khánh made to political opponents and began to lobby Washington to allow him to attack North Vietnam, saying that Khánh could not survive. He gained some support among Johnson's advisors, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> resisted the pressure.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>president's</b> new {{defense team}} {{was made up}} of {{one-time}} Democrat Leonard Garment, University of Texas constitutional law professor Charles Alan Wright and Nixon true believer J.

Cox made three requests: the Petersen document concerning his meeting with Nixon, Petersen's memorandum to Haldeman summarizing the same meeting and the tape of the conversation between Nixon and Dean mentioned by Petersen from the same meeting. Vorenberg added a request for all logs between <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and key aides from June 1972 to May 1973. Buzhardt said that only <b>the</b> <b>president</b> could determine what he would produce. Garment and Wright argued about executive privilege, which Wright said applied not only to presidential documents but those of his aides such as Haldeman and Ehrlichman. As for the tape of the April 15 Dean meeting, Buzhardt (falsely) suggested it was not a tape of <b>the</b> meeting <b>but</b> rather <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> later dictated tape about the meeting that was referred to.

After a series of circumstances involving Anderson's secret being revealed to his wife, the Washington press corps, and several senators, Anderson kills himself. Anderson's death turns {{the majority of the}} Senate against the President and the Majority Leader. Anderson's suicide and the exposure of the truth about Leffingwell's lies regarding his communist past set in motion a chain reaction that ends several careers and ultimately rejects Leffingwell as a nominee to become Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|In January 1863, the Army of the Potomac, {{following}} the Battle of Fredericksburg and the humiliating Mud March, suffered from rising desertions and plunging morale. Maj. Gen.

In reality, he had no power to dismiss anyone without the approval of Congress. Predictably, Burnside's purge went nowhere, and he offered President Abraham Lincoln his resignation from command of the Army of the Potomac. He even offered to resign entirely from the Army, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> persuaded him to stay, transferring him to the Western Theater, where he became commander of the Department of the Ohio. Burnside's former command, the IX Corps, was transferred to the Virginia Peninsula, a movement that prompted the Confederates to detach troops from Lee's army under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, a decision that would be consequential in the upcoming campaign.|$|E

Five of the remaining nine bids, South Korea, Qatar, Japan, Australia and United States were only for the 2022 World Cup, while all the others bid for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. However, since all of the bids for the 2018 World Cup were from European nations, and FIFA's rules dictate that countries belonging to confederations that hosted {{either of the two}} preceding tournaments are not eligible to host, all of these bids were forced to be for 2018 only. Four bids came from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), four from Europe's UEFA, and one from CONCACAF.
