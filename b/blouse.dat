5|$|Beginning with Tandy in 1948 and {{continuing}} {{into the early}} 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the current styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults {{to have their own}} casual style, instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained. Sweater or <b>blouse</b> and skirt ensembles, as well as a pageboy hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Gillies used his wife for a model, and Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe– she wears similar sweater, <b>blouse,</b> and skirt ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol which was used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, looking through a quizzing glass.|$|E

5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} of the song during the 2006 Confessions Tour was controversial. She was raised from the floor hanging on a mirrored cross wearing a red <b>blouse</b> and velvet pants, with a crown of thorns on her head. During the performance, the number 12million flashed above her on the stage's backdrop screens, along with images of African children. This was intended to detail the estimated {{number of children who}} have been orphaned by the AIDS pandemic in Africa.|$|E

All deluxe editions featured Stan leaning on a plastic mannequin, sporting a blue <b>blouse</b> along with various accessories on her hand.|$|E
5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Aguilera is chatting {{with a group}} of women. When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between them. As she continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black <b>blouse,</b> and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E

50|$|Most women wore skirts {{at or near}} knee-length, with simply-cut <b>blouses</b> or {{shirts and}} square-shouldered jackets. Popular {{magazines}} and pattern companies advised women on how to remake men's suits into smart outfits, since the men were in uniform and the cloth would otherwise sit unused. Eisenhower jackets became popular in this period. Influenced by the military, these jackets were <b>bloused</b> at the chest and fitted at the waist with a belt. The combination of neat <b>blouses</b> and sensibly tailored suits became the distinctive attire of the working woman, college girl, and young society matron.|$|R
5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (<b>blouse)</b> covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. The lower half of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E

Subsequently, Inna is shown {{from the perspective of}} the male during a boat trip; the clip ends with her hovering through the sea wearing a yellow dress. Scenes are interspersed of Inna walking on the sea coast while sporting a white and black <b>blouse.</b> She is also seen performing hand movements in front of a tree and other further footage from the party is shown.|$|E
5|$|The current uniform for Year 11 and 12 was {{introduced}} in 1966. It was designed by the senior students of 1965 and consists of a Black Watch kilt, white <b>blouse,</b> green blazer, green jumper or vest, black stockings for winter and bottle green knee-high socks for summer, and black leather lace-up shoes. Girls of Scottish origin are permitted wear the kilt pin representing their family or clan name, rather than the standard school pin. A green and Black Watch Tam o' Shanter (known as 'the Beret') was also introduced for all grades a few years earlier.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} commences with Inna wearing a pink leotard, {{following}} {{which she and}} other women practice pole dancing. Subsequently, the singer appears in black hotpants and a blonde <b>blouse</b> {{in front of a}} neon-lightened X sign in the background, flirting with one male. For the first refrain, she and her background dancers perform hand choreography. Following this, Inna and others are seen on {{what appears to be a}} runaway, with rain coming out from above; similar neon signs are shown in the background. After Yandel's cameo appearance, the video ends with Inna and her dancers further performing to the track. Cut scenes show the singer dancing and performing a slut drop in front of a wet glass surface.|$|E
5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and <b>blouse,</b> which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her dress. The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|E
5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style {{is that of a}} flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed over the next few years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and <b>blouse</b> ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E

5|$|In {{the high}} school section, {{students}} in Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 (inclusive) must wear a white short-sleeved shirt with khaki short trousers and white socks, which must cover the ankle. The four metal buttons must be worn on the two front pockets and on both shoulders. The school collar pin should be worn on the left collar. Either white, blue or black shoes with either white or black laces must be worn. Secondary 4 students wear long beige trousers with a beige shirt, similar to the male students in the college section. College girls wear a beige <b>blouse</b> and a beige skirt. The uniform for the college section was retained from the former Hwa Chong Junior College, which was designed by a Malay girl of the pioneer batch.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her <b>blouse</b> open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
5|$|Nan Chiau High School's uniform {{is closely}} linked to its {{heritage}} as a former traditional Chinese school. Originally, the school uniform was in full white with the Chinese name of the school sewed on the right chest level of the <b>blouse,</b> much similar to other institutions with Chinese heritage. Students in the senior high and pre-university section wore white shirts with dark coloured skirts, before the pre-university classes were made mandatory to be taught at junior colleges, a policy declared by the ministry of education in 1979. Nearing the 1990s, the school uniform was switched to be worn with dark coloured school pants or skirt, with dark coloured school tag was sewed {{on the left side}} of the shirt. The uniform was redesigned as an effort to preserve the school's identity along with the relocation of the campus in 2000, which integrated the original heritage of the uniform in the 1960s and the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white <b>blouse,</b> and boots, and carried her away.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and <b>blouse,</b> with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|St George's can admit up to 380 pupils annually. Upon admission, pupils are {{allocated}} a mixed ability form, {{where they}} are registered, taught Life Skills and have access to pastoral support from their tutors. For all the other lessons, the pupils are set by ability. Each year group has a progress manager with responsibility for the students in that year. Since the Education Act 2002, years 7, 8 and 9 have been grouped into Key Stage 3 and years 10 and 11 into Key Stage 4, which co-ordinates how the National Curriculum is taught. At St George's, a manager is assigned to each Key Stage for pastoral support. Before the conversion to Academy status, the school uniform consisted of a navy-blue blazer with the school emblem sewn on, a white shirt, navy-blue tie and dark-grey trousers (girls could wear plain-blue skirts) for all pupils in years 7–10; year 11 pupils could wear a dark-blue jumper, shirt and grey trousers. Since 2010, girls no longer wear ties, and must wear a revere collar <b>blouse.</b> Dark-grey trousers or a pleated dark-grey skirt are available for girls to wear; boys have dark-grey trousers. All pupils wear a blue blazer, but those in Key Stage 3 have bright blue piping on their lapels; shirts are white until Year 11, when thin blue stripes are worn.|$|E
