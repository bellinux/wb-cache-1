40|$|This study {{examines}} Chinese consumers' perceptions {{and responses to}} web banner advertising. Results suggest that just one additional <b>banner</b> <b>exposure</b> improves Chinese users' brand recall, changes their attitude toward the brand, and increases their purchase consideration. Although clickthrough {{was found to be}} a significant predictor for banner recall, {{there was no evidence that}} clickthrough affects brand recall, attitude toward the brand, or purchase consideration. Most of the findings in this study are congruent with those reported in the 1997 IAB Study. ...|$|E
40|$|Online {{marketing}} and advertising instruments—and {{the ways in}} which consumers react to them—are always evolving, which results in ongoing gaps in knowledge. This dissertation aims to fill some of these gaps by providing a greater understanding of how the Internet impacts online {{marketing and}} advertising research. The first study in this dissertation describes how <b>banner</b> <b>exposure</b> characteristics, such as the number of exposures, spacing, and delay, impact consumer memory. The findings of this study underline the importance of banner memory as <b>banner</b> <b>exposure</b> affects brand memory indirectly through banner memory. The findings also imply that massed banner scheduling is less effective than continuous banner scheduling strategy. The second study extends the first study through a comprehensive model that links banner memory and attitude to brand memory and attitude—and ultimately to purchase intention—to determine the interrelationships among banner effect variables. This study finds that despite the distinct features of it medium, banner advertising effect works similar to the hierarchy-of-effect in traditional media advertising. However, there are two notable differences: the advertising–brand memory relationship is stronger but the banner attitude–brand memory is weaker in banner advertising than in traditional media advertising. Finally, the third study investigates whether companies can use online polls for marketing research purposes. This study finds that differences in results from online polls and from traditional surveys come from sample effects and not from the survey mode. This finding implies that simple online polls have the potential to serve as market research instruments for specific, well-targeted populations...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{analytical}} approach to modeling consumer response to banner ad exposures at a sponsored content Web site that reveals significant heterogeneity in (unobservable) click proneness across consumers. The effect of repeated exposures to banner ads is negative and nonlinear, and the differential effect of each successive ad exposure is initially negative, though nonlinear, and levels off {{at higher levels}} of passive ad exposures. Further, significant correlations between session and consumer click proneness and <b>banner</b> <b>exposure</b> sensitivity suggest gains from repeated banner exposures when consumers are less click prone. For a particular number of sessions, more clicks are generated from consumers who revisit {{over a longer period}} of time, than for those with the same number of sessions in a relatively shorter timeframe. We also find that consumers are equally likely to click on banner ads placed early or late in navigation path and that exposures have a positive cumulative effect in inducing click-through in future sessions. Our results have implications for online advertising response measurement and dynamic ad placement, and may help guide advertising media placement decisions.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{exposure}} to Internet display advertising affects the subsequent browsing behavior of consumers. Using individual-level clickstream data from an automotive website, we tracked the web page selections users made {{while on the}} site and their exposures to premium placement display ads for different vehicle makes. Pages on the site were classified by {{whether or not they}} displayed information about a specific vehicle make (a “make page ” versus a “non-make page”). When a “make-page ” was viewed in the browsing path, we recorded which make the user had selected. We model each user’s make-page selections as a function of their prior <b>banner</b> ad <b>exposure</b> on the site. We capture consumer heterogeneity using a Bayesian Mixture approach. We find that banner ads served during the current browsing session did influence subsequent choices but the effects are segmented. While users in one segment (54 %) reacted positively, users in a second segment (46 %) were not influenced. If using a standard continuous approach to heterogeneity instead we would have incorrectly concluded that advertising has no effect on browsing behavior. Browsing behavior differs significantly across segments – users in the non-responsive segment have a shorter and more focused browsing history. To quantify the impact, we estimate an elasticity of browsing behavior with respect to <b>banner</b> ad <b>exposure.</b> For the positively reacting segment it is just under 0. 2...|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} a co-founder and curator of City Racing, an {{influential}} not-for-profit gallery in Kennington which gave artists like Sarah Lucas, Gillian Wearing and Fiona <b>Banner</b> early <b>exposure</b> and was later celebrated in the book, City Racing, The Life and Times of an Artist-run Gallery. The owner of White Cube gallery Jay Joplin, said when interviewed in 1994—We are indeed fortunate that artists collaborate to put on exhibitions off their own bat - Cubitt Street and City Racing are fantastic examples of a process which works very successfully, I've seen some wonderful shows at both these locations.|$|R

As a result, she took Iron Man's apparent appointment as Tony Stark's personal bodyguard as a personal insult, and was also present when Bruce Banner was exposed to the gamma radiation that would turn him into the Hulk (The same accident that resulted in Stark donning the Iron Man armor in the first place). Shortly before the heroes returned to their world, it was revealed that Liz was dying of cancer as a result of the gamma <b>exposure,</b> <b>Banner</b> being particularly affected by news of the disease to the extent that he turned back from the Hulk to embrace her as Banner after learning about her condition.|$|R
5000|$|This {{reality is}} set 50 {{years in the}} future after many of the costumed villains and criminals joined forces to kill most of the various costumed heroes, and {{subsequently}} conquer the United States. In the case of Bruce <b>Banner,</b> excessive <b>exposure</b> to gamma radiation via nuclear weapons used during the conflict render him insane and results in another incarnation of the Hulk. Banner marries his cousin Jennifer Walters and sires a progeny that possesses average human intellect, green skin and similar powers to themselves, though at lower levels. They form the [...] "Hulk gang" [...] that rule the entire west coast of the country, a domain formerly held by the Abomination until Banner killed him. Banner, along with his children and grandchildren, live in a collection of caves and trailers, forcing those that live on the west coast to pay them rent in order to be allowed to live. Banner kidnaps Logan's family and forces him to accompany Clint Barton on a cross country delivery. When Logan returns and finds that Banner killed his family, he kills the Hulk gang and attacks Banner. Banner overpowers Logan and swallows him whole; however, Logan's mutant healing factor allows his to recover and slash his way out of Banner's stomach, killing him. Logan spots Banner's grandson, Bruce, Jr. and spares him. Logan takes the boy to raise in an effort to someday help combat the various villains that still rule the country.|$|R
40|$|The {{debate about}} which media metric {{efficiently}} measures {{the effectiveness of}} a web-based advertisement, such as banners, is still alive and well. Nonetheless, the most widely used measure of effectiveness for banner advertisements is still the click-through rate. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review the measures currently used to measure effectiveness in web advertising and to empirically determine the factors that might contribute to observed variations in click-through rates based on an actual sample of advertising campaigns. The study examined the complete set of all advertising insertions of 77 customers of a large advertising agency over a one-year period. A resulting sample of 1, 258 placements was used to study the effect of <b>banner</b> formats and <b>exposure</b> levels on click-through rates using analysis of variance. Results suggest that the strongest effect on click-through rates comes from the use of trickbanners ([eta] 2 = 0. 25) and that other factors such as size of the advertisement, motion, use of and type of announcers all have a significant impact of click-through rates. Implications of these findings as well as limitations of the current study are discussed and directions for future research agendas proposed. a...|$|R
