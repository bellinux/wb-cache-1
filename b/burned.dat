5|$|The {{fires in}} Yellowstone left {{a mosaic of}} areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41percent of all the area that <b>burned.</b> Mixed fires <b>burned</b> both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or <b>burned</b> {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires <b>burned</b> for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly <b>burned.</b>|$|E

Geopyxis carbonaria fruitbodies are often found in the same post-fire stands as morels, although the former is usually more abundant.
