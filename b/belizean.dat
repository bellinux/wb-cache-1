5|$|Belize {{participated in}} twelve Summer Olympics between {{its debut in}} the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The highest number of Belizeans {{participating}} at any single Summer Games was 11 in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States. No <b>Belizean</b> has ever won a medal at the Olympics. All of the <b>Belizean</b> participants competed at the Games through wildcard slots from the International Association of Athletics Federations and the International Judo Federation.

5|$|Former UCLA student Jonathan Williams took {{advantage}} of his parents' <b>Belizean</b> citizenship to qualify on behalf of Belize's Olympic team. Taking part in the men's 400meters hurdles dash, his participation in Beijing marked his first Olympic appearance. Williams completed his event in 49.61seconds, placing fourth in a heat of seven, having been placed in Heat 1 {{in the first round}} on 15 August. Williams ran 0.02seconds faster than fifth-place finalist Kenji Narisako of Japan and 0.16seconds slower than third-place finalist Mahau Suguimati of Brazil. Overall, Williams ranked 16th out of 26 athletes in the first round. He progressed to semifinals. In doing so, Williams became the first <b>Belizean</b> athlete to advance in an Olympic event. Williams participated in Heat 2 of the semifinal round on 16 August, facing athletes that included American Kerron Clement and Jamaican Danny Mcfarlane. Williams ranked sixth in a heat of eight athletes, ahead of Suguimati by 0.52seconds but behind South African Alwyn Myburgh by 0.48seconds.

5|$|Sotomayor was {{an adjunct}} {{professor}} at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 2007. There she taught trial and appellate advocacy {{as well as a}} federal appellate court seminar. Beginning in 1999, she was also a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School in a paying, adjunct faculty position. While there she created and co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate Externship each semester from 2000 until her departure; it combined classroom, moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work. She {{became a member of the}} Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her term in 2011. In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the <b>Belizean</b> Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian Grove. On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the <b>Belizean</b> Grove after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership policy.|$|E

5|$|The town of Corozal on Belize's {{northern}} border experienced the worst {{conditions in the}} country. Trees were downed throughout the town, and minor flooding was reported. Eight thousand were displaced to shelters, though all returned home {{in less than two}} days. Throughout the entire country, the <b>Belizean</b> Ministry of Health reported no storm-related fatalities and only a few minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Former University of Belize athlete Tricia Flores participated {{on behalf}} of Belize at the Beijing Olympics as a long jumper. She was the only female to compete {{as a member of}} that year's <b>Belizean</b> delegation. Flores' {{participation}} at the Beijing Olympics marked her first appearance at any Olympic Games. Flores participated in the first qualifying heat on 18 August, where she competed against 21 athletes that included Brazil's Maurren Higa Magi, the United States' Grace Upshaw, and Sweden's Carolina Klüft.

5|$|In RAF service, the Harrier {{was used}} in close air support (CAS), reconnaissance, and other ground-attack roles. The {{flexibility}} of the Harrier led to a long-term heavy deployment in West Germany as a conventional deterrent and potential strike weapon against Soviet aggression; from camouflaged rough bases the Harrier was expected to launch attacks on advancing armour columns from East Germany. Harriers were also deployed to bases in Norway and Belize, a former British colony. No. 1 Squadron was specifically earmarked for Norwegian operations {{in the event of}} war, operating as part of Allied Forces Northern Europe. The Harrier's capabilities were necessary in the Belize deployment, as it was the only RAF combat aircraft capable of safely operating from the airport's short runway; British forces had been stationed in Belize for several years due to tensions over a Guatemalan claim to <b>Belizean</b> territory; the forces were withdrawn in 1993, two years after Guatemala recognized the independence of Belize.|$|E
25|$|Since 1996, {{international}} cyclists have dominated. Cyclists {{from the}} U.S. have won 8 Classics, Mexico and Guatemala three each, and Belize five. Two of those belong to Ernest Meighan (1997, 2001), one to Shane Vasquez (2006) {{and one to}} Giovanni Choto (2012), while Darnell Barrow became the first <b>Belizean</b> {{to get back to}} back wins for Belize since 1995. A pattern has developed of younger <b>Belizean</b> cyclists and expendable foreign ones leading the race early, dropping back into the peloton, then allowing fresher, stronger, more well-known cyclists to step forward. Most <b>Belizean</b> teams bring in foreign riders to participate, then have to defend themselves to the outraged public when a foreigner wins. But that foreign participation also introduces Belizeans to fresh talent and provides for a real test of <b>Belizean</b> cyclists' capabilities.|$|E

25|$|Sir Alan Burns, Governor of British Honduras (1934-1939), used Benque Viejo as {{an example}} of one {{challenge}} that teaching in <b>Belizean</b> schools presents: “I have heard German nuns trying to teach Maya children out of an English textbook which they had to explain in Spanish.” The solution, in higher education at least, has been to require English in the classroom. The Garifuna have enculturated the Catholic Mass and have it in their own language. As regards the Kriol language which most speak in Belize City there has been more controversy. Several Christian churches have introduced Kriol into their services and a Kriol New Testament has been produced. But the Catholic Mass, requiring approval from Roman authorities, has not been translated into Kriol. On the other hand, Catholics are deeply involved in the Kriol Council, and St. John’s College through its Belize Institute for Social Research and Action (BISRA) publishes <b>Belizean</b> Studies which carries articles on the role of Kriol and other cultures in <b>Belizean</b> Society.|$|E

25|$|After Belize {{achieved}} {{independence in}} 1981 the United Kingdom maintained a deterrent force (British Forces Belize) {{in the country}} to protect it from invasion by Guatemala (see Guatemalan claim to <b>Belizean</b> territory). During the 1980s this included a battalion and No. 1417 Flight RAF of Harriers. The main British force left in 1994, three years after Guatemala recognized <b>Belizean</b> independence, but the United Kingdom maintained a training presence via the British Army Training and Support Unit Belize (BATSUB) and 25 Flight AAC until 2011 when the last British Forces left Ladyville Barracks, with the exception of seconded advisers.|$|E
25|$|Belize Creole English or Kriol {{developed}} {{during the time of}} slavery, and historically was only spoken by former slaves. However, this ethnicity has {{become an integral part of}} the <b>Belizean</b> identity, and as a result it is now spoken by about 45% of Belizeans. <b>Belizean</b> Creole is derived mainly from English. Its substrate languages are the Native American language Miskito, and the various West African and Bantu languages brought into the country by slaves. Creoles are found all over Belize, but predominantly in urban areas such as Belize City, coastal towns and villages, and in the Belize River Valley.|$|E

The anthem, in formal English, has been memorised by generations of children, but not necessarily understood. Because Kriol is the language that binds all <b>Belizeans</b> together, regardless of the origin of their first language, Leela Vernon translated the song into Kriol in 2011 with the hope that the meaning behind the words would be better understood.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, <b>Belizeans</b> were {{concerned}} about their progress toward independence and the Guatemalan claim to the colony. The UDP were not in favour of advancing on the former issue without a substantial settlement of the latter, and this led the PUP to turn the election {{into a sort of}} referendum on that question. By their turnout (a record high) and their support for the PUP, <b>Belizeans</b> made clear their preferences and set in motion the chain of events that would lead to independence in 1981.|$|R
