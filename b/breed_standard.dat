5|$|The French Limousin <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> {{is applied}} by {{international}} breed associations in slightly different forms. These range from mandatory compliance before an animal can be recorded in a country's herd book (mainly European countries) to voluntary application in others. For example, in Belgium, application of its <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> mirrors in most detail the French use, {{and in the}} UK, compliance with its version of the Limousin <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> is required by the UK breed association's bye-laws.|$|E
5|$|The <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> {{is a set}} of {{guidelines}} which are used to ensure that the animals produced by a breeder or breeding facility conform to the specifics of the standardized breed. All registered Highland cattle must conform to it. The <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> was created in Inverness on 10 June 1885. There are four main parts to the standard: the head, the neck, the back and body, and the hair. Below is a concise list of the main points of the <b>breed</b> <b>standard.</b> A judge in a show will judge the cattle against a provided <b>breed</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the strong}} public response, the Kennel Club started rolling out new health plans. <b>Breed</b> <b>standards</b> for every <b>breed</b> went under review and show judges would be {{required}} to choose only healthy dogs.

5000|$|Dog landraces and the {{selectively}} bred dog breeds {{that follow}} <b>breed</b> <b>standards</b> vary widely {{depending on their}} origins and purpose. Landraces in dogs are defined as [...] "dog or any livestock animal has been bred without a formal registry, although their breeders may have kept written or informal pedigrees of their animals." [...] These are distinguished from dog breeds which have <b>breed</b> <b>standards,</b> <b>breed</b> clubs and registries.|$|R

5|$|There are {{a greater}} number of colours of coat present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> {{allowing}} for a variety of shades of red, sable and brindle. White markings are expected on this breed of Corgi, and one with a black coat is allowed to have tan or brindle points under conformation show rules. Merle markings are present in the breed, although this is normally restricted to blue merle. There are several disqualification criteria in the <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> for the purpose of conformation showing. This would include drop ears, a white coat, blue eyes or non-solid black noses in dogs without merle colouration.|$|E
5|$|Initially used {{mainly as}} draft animals, {{interest}} in Limousins {{as a source}} of high quality meat grew about two hundred years ago. The first Limousin herd book was then established in France in 1886 to ensure the breed's purity and improvement by only recording and breeding animals that satisfied a strictly enforced <b>breed</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the American Poultry Association <b>breed</b> <b>standards</b> for poultry, for example, {{ducks and}} geese are divided by weight, and chicken breeds are divided by size.

5|$|Members of {{the breed}} were {{originally}} used as hunting dogs, but increased in popularity {{as a show}} dog.

5|$|The Buckeye was {{admitted}} to the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection in 1904. Entrance into the Standard of Perfection signifies official certification as a breed by the Association, and thus allows Buckeyes to be entered into poultry shows and judged according to the <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> (as outlined in the Standard of Perfection).|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1930s {{there were a}} variety of spaniels in Moscow, Leningrad and Sverdlovsk that did not fit any {{specific}} spaniel <b>breed</b> <b>standard,</b> but were not yet standardised into the modern Russian Spaniel.

50|$|The <b>breed</b> <b>standards</b> {{for working}} dogs usually specify that scars, broken teeth or other damage that {{evidence}} injuries sustained during a working career (often termed â€˜honourable scars and injuries') {{are not to}} be penalized in conformation showing.

5|$|During {{the period}} July 2007 to June 2008, the French Herd Book {{comprised}} a main section (section principale in French) divided into the original Pureblood (pur sang) class and a newly created Purebred (race pure) class. The Purebred class {{was added to}} enable the recording of polled Limousins, Limousins that carried a double-muscling gene (muscle hypertrophy abbreviated to MH, or gene culard in French), and Limousins that did not comply fully with the French <b>Breed</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E
5|$|EU {{legislation}} on dehorning practices {{is expected to}} place greater pressure to breed polled cattle, which is being pursued in France by the GIE Polled Excellence group. Because no French Limousins had been identified with the polled gene, a breeding programme commenced in 2005 with polled Canadian bulls of phenotype closest to the French <b>breed</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fewer colours of coat {{appear in}} the Pembroke breed. These include red, sable, tan, fawn and black, each {{of which can be}} with or without white markings.

5|$|French breeders of polled Limousins {{claimed that}} the <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> that {{prevented}} their animals being recorded in the French Herd Book provided an unfair export advantage to foreign countries {{that do not have}} similar restrictions. The French recording ban was removed in July 2007 with the introduction of the Purebred class, but so far no polled Limousin have yet been accepted and registered as Full French.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club(AKC) and the Labrador's breed club {{have set}} the <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> to {{accommodate}} the field-bred Labrador somewhat.

However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both {{the field and the}} show ring, are becoming more unusual.|$|E
5|$|Markings have {{a strict}} standard, with {{detailed}} terminology, for showing in fancy rat pet shows. However, many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard; {{many of those}} found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal breeding perspective, which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a <b>breed</b> <b>standard</b> published by a rat fancier organisation.|$|E
