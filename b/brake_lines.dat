25|$|An {{improvement}} in form {{came at the}} Italian Grand Prix where the cars ran without wings and Goodyear brought their new G9 specification tyre. McLaren qualified on the front row and led to begin with until he slowed {{at the scene of}} an accident and was caught by Stewart, Hulme and Jo Siffert in a Lotus. A slipstreaming battle ensued; McLaren retired with an oil leak at mid-distance but Hulme went on to win. From the Canadian Grand Prix onwards, a third M7A was driven by Dan Gurney whose Anglo American Racers team – for whom Bruce McLaren had driven for three races in 1967 – had run out of funding for their own Eagle cars. Gurney retired with overheating in Canada, but Hulme and McLaren continued their success by finishing first and second respectively, albeit after their strongest challengers had all retired. Hulme was then jointly in the lead of the drivers' championship with two races to go. He ran competitively towards the beginning of the United States Grand Prix but ultimately retired via a spin, pit stops to repair damaged <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> and a gearbox output shaft failure which spun him again, this time into a crash. McLaren was sixth, Gurney fourth. Going into the final race in Mexico, Hulme retained a chance of defending his title. McLaren finished second there, but Hulme crashed out because of a broken suspension damper allowing Hill to win the drivers' championship.|$|E

However, due to the health hazard associated with its handling, it has lost favour and several alternative materials are being increasingly used.

Samples of brake linings were produced using compressive moulding in which the physical and mechanical properties of the samples were studied.

40|$|Braking of road {{vehicles}} {{can be characterized}} as an active – either wanted or unwanted reduction of the force necessary for maintaining the required speed, decreasing the speed, stopping or keeping the vehicle at a standstill. During braking the vehicle loses the acquired motion energy which is most frequently transformed (in case of wanted braking) in the brake system of the vehicle into useless heat released to the environment. Brake force can be defined as the force acting against the motion of a vehicle which is, in case of wanted braking, produced by the vehicle braking system. In case of wanted braking we usually begin with the equilibrium equation of vehicle forces.

In this work, two different sets of <b>brake</b> <b>lining,</b> i. e., new and worn lining are used to investigate its effect on squeal generation. First, modal testing is performed to determine natural frequencies of those brake linings at free-free boundary condition. Later, squeal tests are carried out using brake dynamometer and squeal frequency is measured up to 10 kHz. Several squeal results are plotted over brake operating conditions to observe the influence of different lining thickness. In addition to these, squeal mechanisms, i. e., modal coupling due to closeness of the natural frequency between drum brake components and negative damping due to negative friction-velocity slope {{that contribute to the}} squeal generation are also investigated and discussed...|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} the above, it is {{reasonable}} to ask why rubber brake hose is used at all, instead of always using braided stainless steel hose. The most typical reason is cost, but also use case. Braided stainless steel hose is typically more expensive than rubber. When the cost difference is extrapolated across hundreds or thousands of units, it is quite compelling to opt for the rubber option, especially when the use case exhibits that the operator will not need or want the additional capabilities offered by a brake system equipped with braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines.</b> It thus stands to reason that braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> are typically only seen on upmarket motor vehicles such as hot-rods and supercars, or on race-prepped vehicles such as those used in Formula One and touring car series. Braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> are a common aftermarket upgrade, purchased and installed after a vehicle is initially purchased.|$|E
