The current system in use at various <b>branches</b> of the <b>Registrar</b> General’s Department do not synchronize properly with their central database and checking for redundancy of data {{takes a lot of}} time. This paper therefore seeks to develop an automated business name reservation and registration system which will provide a conducive mean of registering business in real time. Four main phases were involved in this project, namely planning phase, analysis phase, design phase, and implementation phase. The functionalities of the system are presented by UML diagrams that consist of a use case diagram and sequence diagram. A database was created with MySQL software to manage the registration process and an interactive web component was added to enable people to make reservations. The system was finally deployed at the Registrar General’s Department of Ghana and evaluations show that it is very reliable, time saving and user friendly. It also provides extensive reporting and business intelligence...|$|R
