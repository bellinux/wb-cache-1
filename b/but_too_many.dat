Dowding, Tizard and a mathematician Patrick Blackett, another {{founding member of the}} committee, began to evolving a new system from that inherited from ADGB.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in November 1943, {{during the}} Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, American {{submarines}} were tasked with {{the rescue of}} U.S. Navy and Marine airmen downed during aircraft carrier attack operations. Submarines were often vectored to a rescue site by aircraft providing coordinates, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> layers of command slowed the cooperation considerably. Long-range naval patrol aircraft were fitted with extra radio equipment to allow direct contact with surface and underwater units. By the end of 1944, some 224 airmen had been rescued by submarine.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Kyffin Freeman, {{owner of}} the Herne Bay Argus, formed the Hampton-on-Sea Estate Association Limited in 1879 with £60,000 capital in £10 shares, but only sold 398 shares. He built a bandstand, built {{foundations}} for reading rooms and planned tennis courts, a miniature golf course, an archery green and a recreation ground. He organised a sports day with free teas and amusement rides, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> visitors arrived and {{he ran out of}} teas. With builder Thomas Richard Geelong Hoe he planned a housing estate, and a Hampton-on-Sea nameboard was put up at Herne Bay railway station in expectation of this, but then he died in 1880. The company was eventually dissolved in 1905.|$|E

25|$|Following Turkey's {{decision}} to deny any official {{use of its}} territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south. Special Operations forces from the CIA and U.S. Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in Kuwait and other Persian Gulf nations. One result of this was {{that one of the}} divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable {{to take part in the}} invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.|$|E
25|$|For the 1907–08 season, {{a new set}} of {{forwards}} {{were signed}} but goals were still hard to come by. Despite possessing a strong half back line made up of Hawkes, Fred Hawkes and Fred White, the club slumped to 18th place and made a financial loss. The following year the team recovered to ninth place, but the financial situation worsened. The forwards finally found the goal in 1909–10, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> goals were let in at the other end and the club finished 15th. The continuing financial problems caused the sale of forward pair John Smith and Thomas Quinn to Millwall. By 1910–11 gates were up, finances were being brought under control and the club challenged for the title before eventually finishing in ninth place. Optimism was in the air {{at the start of the}} 1911–12 season, but it was to finish in tragedy – popular full-back Sammy Wightman died from injuries sustained in a match against Brighton & Hove Albion, and a high wage bill, a spate of injuries and a lack of goals contributed to the club being relegated to the Southern League's Second Division.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{principal}} causes for {{the dangers of}} the streets of London, Moreton lists the abuse of alcohol specifically geneva or gin. In the Gin Era of 1720–50 very cheap liquors were sold indiscriminately, often resulting in a debauch of spirit-drinking, whose effects were seen on the streets, in the workhouses, in the growing misery of the poor and in an increase of criminality and violent acts. Moreton argues that this wicked trade will be the doom of the English nation, and it represents a real threat to the entire community: suppose a man able to maintain himself and family by his trade, {{and at the same time}} to be a Geneva drinker. This fellow first makes himself incapable of working by being continually drunk; which runs him behindhand, so that he either pawns, or neglects his work, for which reason nobody will employ him. At last, fear of arrests, his own hunger, the cries of a family for bread, his natural desire to support an irregular life, and a propense hatred to labour, turn <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> an honest tradesman into an arrant desperate rogue. And these are commonly the means that furnish us with thieves and villains in general.|$|E

500|$|Following this incident, the Royal Council {{hoped that}} other cities would imitate Burgos {{and leave the}} comuneros peacefully. [...] Valladolid, the former seat of royal power, was {{considered}} especially likely to turn, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> supporters of the king had left city politics and lost their influence. [...] It remained rebel-controlled. [...] The Admiral of Castile continued his campaign {{to try to convince}} the comuneros to return to the royal government and thereby avoid a violent suppression. [...] This attitude concealed a great shortage of funds on the royal side.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{have been}} {{critical}} of Hail to the Thief. In a 2006 interview with Spin, Yorke said: [...] "I'd maybe change the playlist. I think we had a meltdown when we put it together ... We wanted to do things quickly, and I think the songs suffered." [...] In 2008, O'Brien told Mojo he felt Radiohead should have cut the album to ten tracks and that its length had alienated some listeners. In the same interview, Colin Greenwood said he felt several songs were unfinished and that the album was [...] "more of a holding process". In 2013, Godrich told the NME: [...] "I think there's some great moments on there - <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> songs... As a whole I think it's charming {{because of the lack of}} editing. But personally it's probably my least favourite of all the albums ... It didn't really have its own direction. It was almost like a homogeny of previous work. Maybe that's its strength." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You Rock My World" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Praise was mainly {{directed at the}} song's composition, while dissatisfaction towards the song was expressed by critics because they felt that the track was not Jackson's best material. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic listed [...] "You Rock My World" [...] as being a highlight for the Invincible album. Reviewer Andrew Hamilton, also of AllMusic, stated that, [...] "If anybody other than Michael Jackson had released 'You Rock My World' with the tons of publicity and promotion it was accorded, it would have slam dunked the charts and been a multiple award winner. It sold well and got play everywhere, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> critics panned the song and the album it came from as not being good enough for an artist on Jackson's level." [...] Hamilton commented that people should [...] "give Michael credit" [...] because {{he was able to}} maintain a respectable career as a recording artist over the years of his later career.|$|E

2500|$|The King {{arranged}} {{for his mother}} to make a public apology for her accusation {{in the presence of}} the rest of the Royal Family the 12 May 1778. The scene gained a lot of attention and broke the bonds between the Gustav III and his mother. The scandal disturbed celebrations, as did an accident with the public banquet. [...] The public was invited to a great feast to celebrate the birth of the heir, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> people were let in, and the crowd panicked. Between sixty and one hundred people were trampled to death in the crowd.|$|E
2500|$|Arnold is {{well known}} for his lucid writing style, {{combining}} mathematical rigour with physical intuition, and an easy conversational style of teaching and education. His writings present a fresh, often geometric approach to traditional mathematical topics like ordinary differential equations, and his many textbooks have proved influential in the development of new areas of mathematics. The standard criticism about Arnold's pedagogy is that his books [...] "are beautiful treatments of their subjects that are appreciated by experts, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> details are omitted for students to learn the mathematics required to prove the statements that he so effortlessly justifies." [...] His defense is that his books are meant to teach the subject to [...] "those who truly wish to understand it" [...] (Chicone, 2007).|$|E
2500|$|Husk {{has been}} able to shift into {{anything}} that does not exceed her body mass. Any extra mass left when she shifts into a smaller form such as an insect or a bird is shunted into an unknown extra-dimensional space, and will return to Husk when she resumes her human form. However, she has also demonstrated an ability to take on extra mass and become heavier. [...] She has the capability to blend in with surroundings, but in order to do so, she would have to study the texture she seeks to mimic first. [...] She can husk away minor injuries, but deeper ones will stay with her. She can hold a form for about an hour before she needs to revert to her original form. She can morph repeatedly. She is not required to stay in any one form, <b>but</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> transformations can become very painful. In great stress or trauma, Paige can shed without control, revealing patchwork forms. When Paige 'husks', she sheds her clothing as well, this has the side effect of leaving her nude when she returns to her normal form.|$|E
