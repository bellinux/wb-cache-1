40|$|It is {{believed}} that <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil {{is one of the}} best legumes for mid-summer permanent pasture in the northern half of Indiana. "During the past twenty-five years <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) has played an increasingly important role as a forage legume on livestock farms in the north-eastern and north-central United States. The longevity and adaptation of this crop has warranted its use as a forage legume on soils which for reasons of drainage or fertility are unsuited to alfalfa. <b>Birdsfoot</b> trefoil has done and should do much to improve the field and quality of forage in areas and on soils where other perennial legumes formerly could not be grown. " (25, p. 1). Experimental methods of inoculating <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil have proven that when properly inoculated <b>birdsfoot</b> grows and produces well. The establishment and the primary growth of this plant, however, presents a problem. <b>Birdsfoot</b> trefoil is a legume that has great potential for nodule formation when the proper nodule forming bacteria are present. It is an established fact that <b>birdsfoot</b> will not nodulate with the strains of bacteria that initiate nodules on alfalfa, clover or soybeans. <b>Birdsfoot</b> requires its own special kind of bacteria classified as type "K" series of inoculum.

This then is the basic problem very few of the fields where <b>birdsfoot</b> has been planted for the first time have the type "K" inoculum inherent in the soil because primary establishment of the plant has been unsuccessful.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A field {{experiment}} under irrigation {{was conducted at}} the Hyslop Agronomy Farm, near Corvallis, Oregon, during the 1967 growing season to evaluate the effect of barley row spacing, nitrogen rate and placement, and weed competition {{in the year of}} seeding upon <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) seedling establishment. The effect of <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil on barley grain production was also evaluated. Three herbicides were used to measure the effects of weed competition upon <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil establishment and barley grain production. These are: Avadex BW 1. 25 lb. ai. per acre, 2, 4 -DB amine 1. 50 Ib. ai. per acre and DNBP amine 1. 50 lb. ai. per acre. The effects of nitrogen in <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil establishment and on barley grain production were studied using two systems of placement: 80 lb. N per acre broadcast and 20 lb. N per acre applied in rows spaced at 7 inches plus 60 lb. N per acre broadcast. The effects of row spacing on <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil establishment and barley grain production were determined using five systems of seeding: (1) barley seeded alone in rows spaced at 7 inches, (2) barley seeded alone in rows spaced at 14 inches, (3) barley seeded in rows spaced at 7 inches plus <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil seeded {{at the same time in}} the same row, (4) barley seeded in rows spaced at 14 inches plus <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil seeded at the same time in the same row and in row between barley, and (5) <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil seeded in rows spaced at 7 inches. It was concluded that the use of a barley companion crop to establish <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil decreases the vigor of the trefoil; however, the number of plants per foot of row was similar to the other treatments. At constant seed rate of barley, an increase in row spacing above 7 inches gave a decrease of grain yield and an increase of dry matter yield of <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil. <b>Birdsfoot</b> trefoil seeded alone gave the highest dry matter yield in the year of establishment. The trefoil did not affect the yield of barley. Application of nitrogen as urea reduced the number of plants of <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil, when this species was seeded alone or together with barley, but the yield of the forage species was not reduced. Nitrogen application of 80 pounds per acre increased barley grain yield when it was applied broadcast, but not when it was split into 20 pounds nitrogen per acre in rows at seven inches and 60 pounds nitrogen per acre broadcast. An interaction between 2, 4 -DB application and nitrogen placement was found in barley grain production, but not in <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil establishment. Also, an interaction between 2, 4 -DB application and system of seeding was found to affect yield of dry matter of <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil. 2, 4 -DB increased <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil yield and effectively controlled red root pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album L.), common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.), and shepherdspurse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medic.), but it did not influence barley grain yield and the number of plants of <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil per foot of row. DNBP had a detrimental effect on barley yield and was similar to no herbicide on <b>birdsfoot</b> trefoil dry matter yield. It provided good control of common groundsel and shepherdspurse, and gave a poor control of red root pigweed and common lambsquarter.
