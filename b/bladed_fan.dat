It was shown that in the aerodynamic characteristics, the optimal volute angle existed between 4. 8 and 7. 2 degrees, and in the characteristics of noise, {{that existed in the}} near 7. 2 degrees. The wake width of grooved <b>blade</b> <b>fan</b> became narrower than that of the ordinary <b>blade</b> <b>fan.</b> Therefore, the grooved <b>blade</b> <b>fan</b> was superior in noise characteristics to the ordinary <b>blade</b> <b>fan.</b> Using the method of predicting width of wake and the formulae to estimate the turbulent noise level which we proposed in this paper, the sound pressure level can be predicted with the accuracy of about ± 3 dB within these experiments...|$|R

50|$|The Windmill {{was built}} in 1850 and {{consists}} of five storeys built from red brick. When it was in operation the sails, which are now fixed in an easterly direction, powered three pairs of overdriven millstones. The millstones were located on the second floor. The mill had four double shuttered sails.

50|$|The tower has {{a height}} of 60 feet (18.2m) {{to the top of}} the {{brickwork}} and an overall height of 71 feet (21.6m) to the ridge of the cap.

The sails consisted of four double shuttered sails, each with 9 bays, controlled by a 9 feet (2.75m) diameter brake wheel.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{study the effects of}} blade {{thickness}} on the performances of an axial-flow fan. Two fans that differ only in the thickness of their blades were studied. The first fan was designed {{to be part of the}} cooling system of an automotive vehicle power unit and has very thin <b>blades.</b> The second <b>fan</b> has much thicker blades compatible with the rotomoulding conception process. The global performances of the fans were measured in a test bench designed according to the ISO- 5801 standard. The curve of aerodynamics characteristics (pressure head versus ow-rate) is slightly steeper for the <b>fan</b> with thick <b>blades,</b> and the nominal point is shifted towards lower flow-rates. The efficiency of the thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan</b> is lower than the efficiency of the <b>fan</b> with thin <b>blades</b> but remains high on a wider flow-rate range. The mean velocity field downstream of the rotors are very similar at nominal points with less centrifugation for the thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan.</b> The thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan</b> moreover maintains an axial exit-flow on a wider range of flow-rates. The main dierences concern local properties of the flow: Phase-averaged velocities and wall pressure fluctuations strongly differ at the nominal flow-rates. The total level of fluctuations is lower for the thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan</b> that for the thin <b>blades</b> <b>fan</b> and the spectral decomposition of the wall fluctuations and velocity signals reveal more harmonics for the thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan,</b> with less correlation between the different signals. For this kind of turbomachinery, the use of thick blades could lead to a good compromise between aerodynamic and acoustic performances, on a wider operating range...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{no visible}} moving blades in this fan. The blade is hidden inside the {{pedestal}} of the fan. In 2009 James Dyson first introduces a new {{innovation in the}} bladeless fan by adding air-multiplier technology. This Dyson air-multiplier fan generates airflow up to 55mph. [...] The fan contains a brushless electric motor and this motor rotates nine asymmetrical aligned blades that attach with a rotor. Usually, the upper frame of this fan is ring shaped. The frame is not flat; rather it is manufactured such that the edge can create a curve of a 16-degree angle slope.The air flows through the channel in the pedestal of the fan when the motor is turned on. After that, the air flows through the hollow tube. Then the air is shot out through 16-mm slits. This air flows smoothly, rather than turbulently as with a blade fan. The curvature of the inner wall of the fan creates an area of negative pressure - like an airplane wing - to draw more air into the flow, hence [...] "multiplying" [...] it. This property of the air is called inducement. Further, the air surrounding {{the edges of the}} fan also begins to flow with the direction of the breeze, or is [...] "entrained" [...] to it. Dyson claims that the air-multiplier technology increases the output of the air flowing through the tube by at least 15 times compared to the airflow put out by a traditional <b>bladed</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Aerodynamic shape {{optimization}} involves {{designing the}} most efficient shapes of bodies that move through fluids. An optimization algorithm perturbs {{the shape of an}} airfoil until it finds the shape which best exhibits a given design objective. For an inverse design technique, this objective is a prescribed aerodynamic distribution, usually the surface pressure distribution. Liebeck pressure distributions [1], for example, have been demonstrated to generate airfoils with high lift to drag ratios. When designing fans, consideration must be given not only to the shape of the <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> but also to the distance separating the <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b> This spacing is defined by the pitch/chord ratio t/l, where the pitch, t, is the distance between <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> and the chord, l, is the length of each <b>fan</b> <b>blade.</b> In this work, an inverse algorithm is developed, then used to design <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> shapes and to find the optimal blade spacing. <F 14. 3...|$|R

40|$|Vibration {{analysis}} {{is the main}} conditions monitoring techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis. This technique has its unique advantages and disadvantages associated with the monitoring and fault diagnosis of machinery. When this technique is conducted independently, {{only a portion of}} machine faults are typically diagnosed. However, practical experience has shown that this technique in a machine condition monitoring program provides useful reliable information, bringing significant cost benefits to industry. The objective of this research is to investigate the correlation between vibration analysis and fault diagnosis. This was achieved by vibration analysis and investigating different operating conditions of an experimental electromotor. The electromotor was initially run under normal operating conditions as a comparative test. A series of tests were then conducted corresponding to different operating condition. Our varieties were speed of electromotor at three levels, respectively 500, 1000 and 1500 rpm. We did three faults in our electromotor; there were misalignment, looseness and bad bearing. We coupled our electromotor to the variable <b>blade</b> <b>fan</b> and applied several load on that by changing the number of <b>blade</b> of <b>fan.</b> We have chosen 2, 6 and 10 <b>blades</b> <b>fan</b> to apply three different loads on our electromotor. Vibration data was regularly collected. Numerical data produced by vibration analysis were compared with vibration spectra in normal condition of healthy machine, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the vibration condition monitoring technique. The results from this paper have given more understanding on the dependent roles of vibration analysis in predicting and diagnosing machine faults...|$|R
