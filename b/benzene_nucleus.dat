Owing to the thermo-rheological properties of the contrast media, the primary aim of this work is to present an in vitro experimental impact study concerning {{the impact of the}} temperature level on flushing efficiency after contrast medium injection. Moreover, we report experimental data that confirms the role of needle bevel orientation. The secondary aim is to answer the following questions: Is there significant device contrast medium trapping after contrast medium injection? Is saline flushing efficient? And, finally, is it safe to inject contrast medium through an indwelled port catheter?Results: The experimental results show that in addition to hydrodynamics, temperature is a key parameter for the efficiency of device flushing after contrast medium injection. It appears that this is the case when the cavity is incompletely rinsed after three calibrated flushing volumes of 10 mL saline solution, even by using the Huber needle bevel opposite to the port exit. This leads to a potentially important trapped volume of contrast medium in the port, and consequently to the possibility of subsequent salt precipitates and long term trisubstituted <b>benzene</b> <b>nuclei</b> delivery that might impair the solute properties, which may be further injected via the power port later on. Conclusion: We thus suggest, in TIVADS patients, the use of a temporary supplementary intravenous line rather than the port to perform contrast medium injections in daily radiology routine practice.

Owing to the sulfur position, three series of compounds were developed and their activity as AMPA potentiators was characterized. In each of the developed series, potent compounds were discovered.

The alkaline solution is then separated from the insoluble oily layer, boiled in contact with air to reduce impurities, and decomposed by diluted sulphuric acid.

These salts represent {{a new group of}} organic bactericides. The results obtained in the tests with these substances upon Bacillus typhosus have demonstrated the existence of direct relationships between chemical constitution and bactericidal action within the series. The bactericidal character is directly attributable to the presence of the hexamethylenetetramine nucleus. The degree of the bactericidal action, however, is determined by the position, character, and number of the groups substituted in the <b>benzene</b> <b>nucleus.</b> By the introduction of the methyl, chlorine, bromine, iodine, cyano, and nitro groups into the <b>benzene</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the parent benzyl hexamethylenetetraminium salt, the bactericidal power of this compound was notably enhanced.

The hydrophilic ester groups act as pinning points and hold the <b>benzene</b> <b>nucleus</b> flat on the water surface. For the lower homologs BH- 5 to BH- 7, we observe that the so-called liquid expanded phase obtained at high areas per molecule transforms into the liquid condensed phase upon lateral compression. The transition is approximately first-order, with a plateau region of finite slope and a single discontinuity in the monolayer compressibility. The associated heat of transition, as calculated from the Clapeyron equation, decreases linearly with temperature and extrapolates to zero at the critical temperature Tcrit. Above Tcrit, the transition disappears and the liquid expanded phase is observed at all areas per molecule. Contrary to the phospholipid and single chain fatty acid cases, T crit is found to decrease when the chain length increases. We interpret the phase change as an order-disorder transition of the aliphatic chains from a gauche to an all-trans conformation.

40|$|Salicylate hydroxylase (salicylate 1 -monooxygenase, EC 1. 14. 13. 1) was {{purified}} {{from the}} soil yeast Trichosporon cutaneum. The enzyme contained flavin adenine dinucleotide and was monomeric, with a molecular weight of 45, 300. In addition to salicylate, the four isomeric dihydroxybenzoates having one hydroxyl adjacent to carboxyl in the <b>benzene</b> <b>nucleus</b> were oxidatively decarboxylated without formation of hydrogen peroxide. One of these isomers, gentisate, was rapidly oxidized to hydroxyquinol by the enzyme but did not serve as an effective single carbon source for T. cutaneum; however, when growing with salicylate, cells also readily utilized gentisate for growth. Hydroxyquinol 1, 2 -dioxygenase (EC 1. 13. 11 [...] ) is a newly investigated enzyme which was purified from T. cutaneum grown with 4 -hydroxybenzoate. The enzyme was red, contained ferric iron, and was specific for hydroxyquinol; catechol and pyrogallol were oxidized at less than 1 % of the rate for hydroxyquinol, and no activity could be detected against seven other catechols. The enzyme was composed of two nonidentical subunits having molecular weights of 39, 600 and 38, 200 and was apparently dimeric...|$|E
30|$|We {{investigated}} norlignan coloration with {{alkaline treatment}} {{to clarify the}} relationship between the blackening of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) heartwood and norlignans in the heartwood. Of the four main norlignans (agatharesinol, sequirin-C, sugiresinol, hydroxysugiresinol) of sugi heartwood, only sequirin-C was clearly colored with alkaline treatment (0.4 % potassium hydrogencarbonate solution, pH 8.6). Sequirin-C changed color to deep purple with alkaline treatment. The absorbance spectrum of colored sequirin-C had two peaks (450 and 525 nm) and one shoulder (626 nm). Coloration began at pH 6.2.). The spectrum of blackened sugi heartwood was similar to that of sequirin-C treated with alkali. A catechol nucleus and a double bond conjugated with a <b>benzene</b> <b>nucleus</b> play important roles in norlignan coloration with alkaline treatment. The number of hydroxyl groups is related to solubility in alkaline solution, and, therefore, whether a norlignan changes color also depends on the number of hydroxyl groups. Based on these results, we concluded that sugi heartwood turns black because sequirin-C, which is readily soluble in alkaline solution and can form a large intramolecular conjugation system when alkalized, is converted to products with a deep purple color as the heartwood is basified.|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas fluorescens {{was grown}} on mineral salts media with phenol, {{p-hydroxybenzoic}} acid, p-hydroxy-phenylacetic acid, or p-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid as sole carbon and energy source. Each compound was first hydroxylated, ortho to the hydroxyl {{group on the}} benzene ring, to give catechol, protocatechuic acid (3, 4 -dihydroxy-benzoic acid), homoprotocatechuic acid (3, 4 -dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid), and caffeic acid (3, 4 -dihydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid), respectively, as the ultimate aromatic products before cleavage of the <b>benzene</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Protocatechuic acid and caffeic acid were shown to be cleaved by ortho fission, via a 3, 4 -oxygenase mechanism, to give β-substituted cis, cis-muconic acids as the initial aliphatic products. However, catechol and homoprotocatechuic acid were cleaved by meta fission, by 2, 3 -and 4, 5 -oxygenases, respectively, to give α-hydroxy-muconic semialdehyde and α-hydroxy-γ-carboxymethyl muconic semialdehyde as initial aliphatic intermediates. Caffeic acid: 3, 4 -oxygenase, a new oxygenase, consumes 1 mole of O 2 per mole of substrate and has an optimal pH of 7. 0. The mechanism of cleavage of enzymes derepressed for substituted catechols by P. fluorescens apparently changes from ortho to meta with the increasing nephelauxetic (electron donor) effect of the side-chain substituent...|$|E
