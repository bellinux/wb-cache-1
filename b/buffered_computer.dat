40|$|Riparian buffers {{can improve}} surface water quality by {{filtering}} contaminants from runoff before they enter streams. Infiltration {{is an important}} process in riparian <b>buffers.</b> <b>Computer</b> models are often {{used to assess the}} performance of riparian buffers. Accurate prediction of infiltration by these models is dependent upon accurate estimates of infiltration parameters. Of particular interest here are Green-Ampt infiltration parameters, satiated hydraulic conductivity (Ko) and wetting front suction (hf). The objectives of this research were to (i) modify the Smith sorptivity procedure {{so that it can be}} used to estimate Green-Ampt infiltration parameters, (ii) Determine the relative closeness of Ko estimated by the inverse sorptivity and inverse Green-Ampt procedures and hf estimated by Rawls and Brakensiek (1985) to the laboratory-determined standards and (iii) Compare Ko estimates of the inverse sorptivity and inverse Green-Ampt procedures to those estimated by pedotransfer functions. This project was conducted at six sites in Nebraska, at which soil type and land use varied. The results of this study suggest that the inverse Green-Ampt procedure can be used to provide Ko estimates, even in the presence of macropores. Generally, pedotransfer function predictions did not estimate Ko well. Finally, hf as predicted by pedotransfer function was lower than laboratory-determined hf. These predicted infiltration parameters were used in the Green-Ampt infiltration equation to illustrate their effect on cumulative infiltration. Cumulative infiltration based on the inverse Green-Ampt procedure parameters resulted in the closest match to cumulative infiltration prediction from laboratory-based infiltration parameters at five of the six sites...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of a neuro-fuzzy (NF) controller to moving picture expert group (MPEG- 2) video transmission over a Bluetooth asynchronous connectionless (ACL) is presented in this paper. MPEG variable bit rate (VBR) data sources experience unpredictability, long delay, and excessive loss, due to sudden variations in bit rate. Therefore, it is practically impossible to transmit MPEG- 2 VBR video sources over a Bluetooth channel with a limited transmission speed and considerable wireless interferences without loss of data or image quality degradation. In this work, a traffic-shaping buffer is introduced before the host controller interface (HCI) of the Bluetooth protocol stack to obstruct excessive MPEG VBR data sources during the peak transmission periods. An integrated neuro-fuzzy controller monitors and reduces the burstiness of the traffic-shaper output rate to facilitate the MPEG VBR video sources {{to conform to the}} token-bucket contract before entering the Bluetooth channel. A conventional rule-based-fuzzy (RBF) controller oversees the arrival rate to the traffic-shaper to avoid saturation or starvation of the <b>buffer.</b> The <b>computer</b> simulation results demonstrate that applications of the NF and RBF schemes reduce excessive delay and data loss at the HCI as compared with conventional video transmission in Bluetooth ACL links...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A <b>computer</b> <b>buffer</b> {{is an area}} {{of memory}} used for {{temporary}} storage of data when a program or hardware device needs an uninterrupted flow of information. A buffer overflow occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer than it was intended to hold. Since buffers are created to contain a finite amount of data, the extra information- which has to go somewhere- can overflow into adjacent buffers, corrupting or overwriting the valid data held in them. In buffer overflow attacks, the extra data may contain codes designed to trigger specific actions, in effect sending new instructions to the attacked computer that could, for example, damage the user's files, change data, or disclose confidential information. This paper presents an overview of the buffer overflow attack and the countermeasures to defend that attack...|$|R

For illustration, tool paths were generated for a workpiece with two bi-cubic surface patches, connected with only position continuity. Simulations for gouge-checking and machining tests were performed. Workpiece cusp heights were measured using a coordinate measuring machine.

It is now possible to compare these predictions with measurements made with the system in active use during data-taking and to extrapolate to performance at higher luminosities. In the system events to be analyzed offline are selected by means of a hardware first-level trigger, receiving input data via dedicated paths, and of two levels of software trigger, implemented on commercially available server computers embedded in the data-acquisition system. Data of events accepted by the first-level trigger are received and <b>buffered</b> in other <b>computers</b> forming together the ReadOut Subsystem (ROS).
