5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Capturing one of {{the alien}} troops and {{conducting}} the interrogation reveals vague information about another type of alien called the Outsiders, artificially-created crystalline beings encountered aboard UFOs, that appear to serve as pilots and navigators. Dr. Vahlen then requests that XCOM capture an Outsider for study. Upon capturing {{one of the}}se, the examination reveals that the Outsiders' exotic crystalline structures behave {{in a manner similar}} to antennas, receiving a signal broadcast from a location buried underground on Earth. XCOM dispatches a team to investigate the signal; it is found to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a base that the aliens have secretly established on Earth, where experiments are performed on abducted humans.|$|E
5|$|In Zloda, Belarus, Amador {{uses the}} {{diamonds}} as payment for a proxcard {{to access the}} Todorov Building in Minsk. The team tracks her there, but Amador escapes. Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a camera in her eye, the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing {{the name of the}} hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her prosthetic eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through the eye, can kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E
25|$|Maine {{deployed}} the Guard {{in a more}} tactical manner, {{sending them}} to Augusta and Lewiston to discourage wavering employees from joining the strike. That tactic did not work, however, everywhere: workers at Pepperell Mills' plant in Biddeford and York Manufacturing's plant in Saco went out even though the guard was sent to prevent the arrival of flying squadrons rumored to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> New Bedford, Massachusetts.|$|E

25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars {{for us to see}} them while we are still looking at them, because they are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E

25|$|The {{rear-mounted}} engine made the aircraft ideal for ground-attack since fire would <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the front-bottom quarter and was {{less likely to}} hit the engine and its cooling systems. The arrangement proved to be very vulnerable to attacks from above and behind and nearly any hit on the fuselage from an attacking enemy fighter was virtually guaranteed to disable the cooling system and lead to the prompt demise of the engine and thus the aircraft. Flying at its upper altitude limits, the Airacobra was extremely vulnerable to any enemy fighter with decent high altitude performance.|$|E
25|$|After {{a series}} of raids, on 20 April, Farran was {{informed}} that Fifth Army had broken through German lines, {{and he took the}} decision to have the battalion assault the city of Reggio Emilia, which straddled Route 12. The howitzer was used to bombard the main square of the town, and Farran later discovered that the local German and Italian Fascist garrison believed the attack to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the vanguard of an American armoured division; as a result, the town was abandoned two hours after the shelling had begun. Then on 22 April, it was discovered that American troops had penetrated near the city of Bologna, causing German forces to retreat down Route 12. Positioning the partisan battalion near the Sassuolo Bridge, Farran used the howitzer, mortars and a machine gun to open fire on the traffic using the bridge, destroying a number of vehicles. The attack attracted the attention of a flight of Supermarine Spitfires, who strafed the area and inflicted more casualties. After fighting all day, Farran withdrew the battalion from the area, and after harassing more German transport columns for a further day, moved the battalion into Modena to help mop up any remaining resistance. Very soon afterwards, orders came for the operation to cease and the British troops to travel to Florence. During its time operating, the battalion had killed an estimated 300 German soldiers and destroyed twenty vehicles, as well as taking 158 prisoners of war, and had suffered 24 casualties in return.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} the United States Army became involved. On November 13, General David E. Twiggs ordered Major Samuel P. Heintzelman to lead an {{expedition}} of several hundred men to Brownsville. Though the major would be starting out from Old Camp Verde, in central Texas, many of the units placed under his command would <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> distant states or territories, such as Kansas and Virginia. Because of this, Heinztelman issued orders {{for the majority of}} his men to rendezvous with him at Fort Merrill, on the Nueces River, and the remainder to assemble at Fort McIntosh, in Laredo, before beginning the final march to Brownsville. The major left Camp Verde on November 14 and arrived in Brownsville just before midnight on December 6, a journey of 332 miles. At that time, Heintzelman had with him two batteries from the 1st Artillery, under Lieutenants Douglas Ramsay and William Montrose Graham, Jr., a company from the 2nd Cavalry, under Captain George Stoneman, and two companies from the 8th Infantry, under Captains Arthur Tracy Lee and Charles Downer Jordan. Another battery of artillery, one company of cavalry, and a few more companies of infantry was still at Laredo. During all this time, Cortina's army grew to at least 400 men and a few artillery pieces but they were not well armed individually and had little or no military training. With information collected by Mayor Stephen Powers, District Judge Edmund J. Davis, and the filibuster José María Jesús Carbajal in Matamoros, Heintzelman concluded that Cortina probably had no more than 300 to 350 men, only 100 of whom were mounted. The Texas Rangers insisted that the number was at least 600.|$|E

500|$|Around 8:30 on {{the morning}} of 11 September 2001, the Otis Air Base Operations Center {{received}} a call from the Federal Aviation Administration's Cape Cod Facility Calls Operations Center that it might be receiving a call from the North American Aerospace Defense Command's Northeast Air Defense Sector. The manager of the Cape Cod facility then called the 102d at Otis Air National Guard Base as they figured [...] "...a call [...] will <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> NEADS soon and a scramble order is likely." [...] He called the base because he figured that the pilots would appreciate the heads up. When he called the Otis operations center, the superintendent of aviation management, Mark Rose, answered. He was initially confused by the call as no identification was given. Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy was then handed the phone and alerted of the situation. On his radio, he called pilot Major Daniel Nash, the pilot who was sharing alert duty, and told him to get ready for a coming alert call. He also told him to suit up and get ready for a scramble call.|$|E

500|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of F minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of B3 to the high-note of A5. Aside from Dupri's verses, Carey's longtime background singer Trey Lorenz makes a notable impression on the song, and earned credits for providing background vocals. Lyrically, the song is written in a female perspective, where they ask the man for their number at a club. In an interview with MTV News, Carey jokingly addressed the lyrics, claiming Dupri [...] "really wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the girl, like 'can I get your number' to the guy. But in all honesty that would never be me!" [...] Aside from her signature vocals, Carey adopts a breathy rap for parts of the song, which read [...] "I got a pimp penthouse / With a sick hot tub / We can watch a flat screen / While the bubbles filling up." [...] According to Jozen Cummings from PopMatters, the lyrics and Carey's vocal switch make the song [...] "fun and comedic".|$|E

500|$|The show's sound {{production}} team had two major special effects to create for the episode: the mole creature, and Olivia's superhearing. They decided to voice the creature using Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR) [...] "because his range of actions and emotions {{was simply too}} broad for a library monster vocal set to cover". Sound editor Bruce Tanis cut [...] "creepy moans and breaths" [...] when the creature was heard but not seen, and added [...] "a layer of vicious attack growls and wounded screams" [...] for when it died. Tanis commented that the actor voicing the creature placed pieces of orange in his mouth {{in order to have}} [...] "a slobbery, sputtering voice". For Olivia's scenes with superhearing, Tanis made ordinary, far off items like phones, typewriters, and cars [...] "sound a little beefier than normal and kept them a bit more up in the mix than they usually would be," [...] as these things were not in the same room as her. The sound editors wanted to emphasize that the various sounds she hears could <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> anywhere, such as next door, or a block away, or could perhaps be all inside her head. Torv later noted in a BuddyTV interview that while shooting, she was unsure whether her newfound abilities were permanent or temporary, to which the writers replied that [...] "apparently it's just something that comes and goes". After expressing her confusion, they responded [...] "Oh that's good, Olivia's confused too".|$|E
