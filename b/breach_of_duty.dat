50|$|Mr Smallbone {{had been}} the {{managing}} director of Trustor AB, and it was claimed that in <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> fiduciary <b>duty</b> he transferred money to a company that he owned and controlled. Trustor AB applied to treat receipt of the assets of that company as {{the same as the}} assets of Mr Smallbone. It argued that Smallbone's company was a sham to help <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> it had been involved in improper acts and the interests of justice demanded the result. The case against Mr Smallbone was eventually dropped by Trustor AB as there was no <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> fiduciary <b>duty.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{constructive}} trust {{was the only}} appropriate remedy here, given {{the uniqueness of the}} property, given the fact Corona would have acquired the property but for Lac's <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> and given the virtual impossibility of accurately valuing the property. In addition, it was the only just remedy, regardless of whether it was based on <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> confidence or <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a fiduciary relationship. The remedies available under one head are those available to the other. Given a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> confidence, the finding of a fiduciary relationship was not strictly necessary.|$|R

25|$|An {{account of}} profits is another {{potential}} remedy. It is usually used where the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> was ongoing {{or when the}} gain is hard to identify.

25|$|Remedies {{will differ}} {{according}} {{to the type of}} damage or benefit. They are usually distinguished between proprietary remedies, dealing with property, and personal remedies, dealing with pecuniary (monetary) compensation. Where concurrent contractual and fiduciary relationships exist, remedies available to the plaintiff beneficiary is dependent upon the duty of care owed by the defendant and the specific <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> allowing for remedy/damages. The courts will clearly distinguish the relationship and determine the nature in which the breach occurred.|$|E
25|$|An official, who has {{intentionally}} {{committed a}} <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> which {{he ought to}} exercise {{in favor of a}} third party and therefore prejudice to such third party, is liable for any injury arising therefrom. If the breach is the result of this official's negligence, he may be held liable to compensate only in so far as the injured person is unable to obtain compensation by other means. In the case mentioned in the preceding sentence, if the injured person who may obviate the injury by making use of a legal remedy has intentionally or negligently omitted to make use of it, the official shall not be liable to compensate for the injury.|$|E
25|$|The {{duty of care}} owed by {{trustees}} and fiduciaries has its partner in the common law of negligence, and was also long recognised by courts of equity. Millett LJ, however, in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew emphasised that although recognised in equity, and applicable to fiduciaries, the duty of care is not itself a fiduciary duty, like the rule against conflicts of interest. This means that like ordinary negligence actions, the common law requirements for proving causation of loss apply, and the remedy for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> is of compensation for losses rather than restitution of gains. In Mothew this meant that a solicitor (who occupies a fiduciary position, like a trustee) who negligently told a building society that its client had no second mortgage was not liable for the loss in the property's value after the client defaulted. Mr Mothew successfully argued that Bristol & West would have granted the loan in any case, and so his advice did not cause their loss.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, a 51-year-old police constable {{attracted}} a 16-year-old girl {{to his house}} by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice. The constable was fired and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence. In 2007, an Iranian-born immigrant, Rasoul Pourak, was beaten in a cell at Pasila Police Station, Helsinki. The ill-treatment caused Pourak bruises all over his body, an open wound over his eyebrow, and a fractured skull. In addition, facial bones were broken and the victim was left permanently damaged. One guard participating in the assault was sentenced to an 80-day suspended prison sentence. In 2010, two police officers assaulted {{a man in a}} wheelchair in connection with an arrest. The police twisted the man's hands and pushed him backward causing him to break a femur. In 2013, two policemen were sentenced to 35 day fines for assault and <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> in connection with stamping on a man's head onto the asphalt thrice. According to the police, the man of Romani descent resisted, yet according to eyewitnesses, the man did not resist. The event was captured in surveillance video, which was stored but accidentally destroyed according to a third officer present. However the third officer, having seen the surveillance footage, testified that the video didn't show any resistance {{on the part of the}} Romani, but also that the assault happened out of view from the camera.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{petitions}} by {{the company}} or creditors, an administrator {{has the power to}} move a company into liquidation, carrying out an asset sale, if its attempts at rescue come to an end. If the liquidator is not an administrator, he is appointed by the court usually on the nomination of the majority of creditors. The liquidator can be removed by the same groups. Once in place, the liquidator has the power to do anything set out in sections 160, 165 and Schedule 4 for the purpose of its main duty. This includes bringing legal claims that belonged to the company. This is to realise the value of the company, and distribute the assets. Assets must always be distributed in the order of statutory priority: releasing the claims of fixed security interest holders, paying preferential creditors (the liquidator's expenses, employees and pensions, and the ring fenced fund for unsecured creditors), the floating charge holder, unsecured creditors, deferred debts, and finally shareholders. In the performance of these basic tasks, the liquidator owes its duties to the company, not individual creditors or shareholders. They can be liable for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> by exercising powers for improper purposes (e.g. not distributing money to creditors in the right order,) and may be sued additionally for negligence. As a person in a fiduciary position, he may have no conflict of interest or make secret profits. Nevertheless, liquidators (like administrators and some receivers) can generally be said to have a broad degree of discretion about the conduct of liquidation. They must realise assets to distribute to creditors, and they may attempt to maximise these by bringing new litigation, either to avoid transactions entered into by the insolvent company, or by suing the former directors.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic duty}} of the {{receiver}} was to realise value for the floating charge holder, although all preferential debts, or those with priority, {{would have to be}} paid. For other unsecured creditors, the possibility of recovering money was remote. The floating owed no duty to other creditors with regard to the timing of the appointment of a receiver, even if it could have an effect on negotiations for refinancing the business. It was accepted that a receiver had a duty to act only for the proper purpose of realising debts, and not for some ulterior motive. In Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd, a company had given floating charges to two banks (Westpac first, and First City Corp second). The directors, wishing to install a friendly figure in control asked Westpac to assign its floating charge to their friend Mr Russell, who proceeded to run the business with further losses of $500,000, and refused to pass control to First City Corp, even though they offered the company discharge of all the money owed under the first debenture. The Privy Council advised that Mr Russell, as administrative receiver, had acted for an improper purpose by refusing this deal. A further case of <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> occurred in Medforth v Blake where the administrative receiver of a pig farm ignored the former owner's advice on how to get discounts on pig food of £1000 a week. As a result, larger debts were run up. Sir Richard Scott VC held this was a breach of an equitable duty of exercising due diligence. However, a more general duty to creditors was tightly constrained, and general liability for professional negligence was denied to exist. In Silven Properties Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland a receiver of a property business failed to apply for planning permission on houses that could have significantly raised their value, and did not find tenants for the vacant properties, before selling them. It was alleged that the sales were at an undervalue, but the Court of Appeal held that the receiver's power of sale was exercisable without incurring any undue expense. Everything was subordinate to the duty to the receiver to realise a good price. In this respect, an administrator is not capable of disregarding other creditors, at least in law. One {{of the reasons for the}} partial abolition of administrative receivership was that after the receiver had performed his task of realising assets for the floating charge holder, very little value was left in the company for other creditors because it appeared to have fewer incentives to efficiently balance all creditors' interests. Ordinarily, once the receiver's work was done, the company would go into liquidation.|$|E

500|$|Negligence, Cardozo emphasized, {{derives from}} human relations, {{not in the}} abstract. Negligence that does no one harm is not a tort. It is not enough, he found, to prove {{negligence}} by the defendant and damage to the plaintiff; {{there must be a}} <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> owed to the plaintiff by the defendant. He traced the history of the law of negligence, a concept not known in medieval times, and noted that it evolved as an offshoot of the law of trespass, and one could not sue for trespass to another. Had the railroad been negligent towards Palsgraf, it might have been liable, but [...] "the consequences to be followed must first be rooted in a wrong", and there was no legal wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf. Thus, the lower courts were incorrect, and must be reversed, and the case dismissed, with Palsgraf to bear the costs of suit.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court, by a {{majority}} of five to two, decided that expert witnesses were not immune in the law of England and Wales from claims in tort or contract for matters connected with their participation in legal proceedings. This reversed a line of authority dating back 400 years. The case considered the narrow issue, namely whether preparation of a joint statement by experts was immune from suit, and the wider public policy issue of whether litigants should be able to sue experts that they had instructed for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty.</b> There was discussion about whether removing the immunity would have a [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the willingness of experts to participate in court proceedings, although judges {{on both sides of the}} decision agreed that there was no empirical evidence on the point. [...] Lord Phillips, a member of the majority, compared the situation of expert witnesses with that of advocates, on the basis that both owed duties to clients and to the court. [...] Advocates' immunity from claims in negligence had been removed in 2001 in Hall v Simons. [...] The change, he said, had not led to an increase in vexatious claims or a reduction in the performance of duties owed by advocates to the court. [...] Lord Hope, in the minority, said that experts and advocates had different functions and so disagreed with the comparison. He also pointed out that English law would now be different from Scots law on this issue.|$|E
500|$|He {{noted that}} Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons (2001) {{had said that}} a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence, only a duty to tell the truth, but he {{considered}} that to be incorrect, since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts. The expert would have {{a contract with the}} client in which he agreed to perform the duties that he owed to the court, and so there was no conflict between the two duties. In this respect, expert witnesses were more like advocates, who owed duties to client and court, than to witnesses of fact. He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons. Removing their immunity, he said, had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court, and it would be [...] "mere conjecture" [...] to assume that this would be any different for expert witnesses. Neither had vexatious claims been a problem for barristers – in any event, the present case was not vexatious and there were other hurdles, both procedural and financial, in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making unmeritorious claims against an expert. As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were [...] "immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings", he concluded that the immunity for claims for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> (but not defamation) should be abolished.|$|E

500|$|Lord Brown concurred. [...] He {{said that}} [...] "the gains to {{be derived from}} denying [...] {{immunity}} from suit for breach of that duty substantially exceed whatever loss might be thought likely to result from this", since a potential liability would lead to a [...] "sharpened awareness of the risks of pitching their initial views of the merits of their client’s case too high or too inflexibly lest these views come to expose and embarrass them at a later date." [...] He thought that this was a [...] "healthy development". It would also ensure that a client who was caused loss by an expert witness acting in [...] "an egregious manner" [...] would receive a proper remedy; he said that such cases were likely to be [...] "highly exceptional". Lord Collins, agreeing, noted that the result did not affect the position of the expert vis-a-vis the opposing litigant, where there were [...] "wider considerations of policy" [...] against allowing claims. He also remarked that the existing ability to prosecute expert witnesses for perjury or to take disciplinary proceedings against them for unprofessional conduct in preparing or presenting their evidence did not fit with the claim that a liability to their clients for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> would have a chilling effect on experts' willingness to give evidence. Lord Kerr, who also agreed with the decision, said that if [...] "an expert expresses an honestly held view, even if it differs from that which he may have originally expressed, provided it is an opinion which is tenable, he has nothing to fear from a disgruntled party." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman also {{investigated}} the affair.

In response to the concerns raised by Gillberg at the trial that a situation had arisen for him whereby [...] "he was prevented by medical ethics and research ethics from disclosing information about the participants in the study and their next-of-kin", the Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman stated that [...] "the international declarations drawn up by the World Medical Association and also the European Convention [...] do not categorise them as undertakings that can be considered to take priority over Swedish law." [...] The Parliamentary Ombudsman also stated that, [...] "it is not possible to make decisions on issues concerning confidentiality until the release of a document is requested. It follows therefore that the assurances of confidentiality cited above cannot take priority over the law as it stands or a court's application of the statutes".|$|E
