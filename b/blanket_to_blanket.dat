5000|$|In this interim period, the Nalukataq blanket is erected. The blanket, mapkuq, may be {{made from}} several walrus or bearded seal, ugruk, skins, or canvas, and sewn {{together}} in a circle or square. Outdoors a rope extends from each corner, and is pulled tightly between four wooden beams, formerly three whale bones, using block and tackle. This raises the <b>blanket</b> <b>to</b> about waist height. With or without the beams, men and women, naluaqtit ('pullers'. [...] "the springs of a centuries-old trampoline."), circle the blanket and hold rope woven around the edges, and rhythmically pull out on the <b>blanket</b> <b>to</b> throw the <b>blanket</b> dancer, nalukataqtuaq, in the air. [...] "As effective as a trampoline," [...] heights of twenty feet/six meters are estimated, and heights of 40 feet are considered possible. The minimum goal is to land back on one's feet, next to do this {{as many times as}} possible, and advanced tricks include kicks and flips.|$|R

Parents of children attending the Associated Students CSUN Children's Center were interviewed. The interviews pertained to behavior of 78 children in {{the age group of}} two through seven years. The method of feeding was significantly related to attachment at the. 03 level of probability using a chi square analysis. Data for blanket use during bottle feeding was found to be significant at the. 02 level of probability. Consistent use of the same blanket {{during the first year of}} the child's life was significant at the. 01 level of probability.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is commonly}} used in industrial waste water treatment applications {{and it is a}} combination of many biochemical and physicochemical processes. Modeling and simulation of an anaerobic digestion is very vital to identify the behavior of industrial waste water treatment plant to optimize its operations. In this research, anaerobic digestion model called ADM 1 (Anaerobic digestion model no 1) developed by IWA task group is applied to model and simulate UASB reactors. ADM 1 model comprises with dynamic state variables which represent all biological and physic chemical reactions. This model was built in simulator called Aquasim 2. 1 f (Reichert, 1998). To model UASB reactors, simplified model is proposed based on different research compartments. UASB modeled by simulator taking as three CSTR compartments named sludge bed, blanket and settler. Influent for experimented waste water plant is waste water generated from dairy plant. Experiments were conducted at waste water treatment plant (WWTP) under three volumetric flow rates 10 m 3 /d, 15 m 3 /d and 25 m 3 /d. plant is actually operates at 25 m 3 /d. Three parameters such as cumulative gas volume, pH and COD were measured. At the same volumetric flow rate WWTP was simulated with the new model and parameters such as VFA, gas composition,inhibition and biomass growth rates were obtained. By varying recycle ratio from bed <b>to</b> <b>blanket</b> and settler <b>to</b> <b>blanket,</b> appropriate recycle ratio is replaced to get best fitted model. (bed to blanket- 0. 8 and settler <b>to</b> <b>blanket</b> 0. 6). Optimization was performed under two scenarios. ie by varying volumetric flow rates and input COD level. it was found that above 30 m 3 /d UASB become unstable producing 21 % of CH 4 and 75 % of CO 2. Also it can be found that 7500 mgCOD/l can be treated at the volumetric rate of 30 m 3 /d without any instabilit...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} {{of interaction between}} impact flow ejecta blankets and pre-existing landforms such as craters, scarps, and wrinkle ridges may yield important clues as {{to the nature of}} the ejecta emplacement process. The morphology of flow ejecta blankets and the interactions of these blankets with pre-emplacement impact craters were characterized. About 80 small satellite craters on or in 3 well-expressed low ejecta parent impact craters were recognized. Interaction of the blanket with pre-existing structures was studied, and several types were described. These are: (1) infilling; (2) encroachment; (3) overflow; and (4) breaching. Examination of the overall morphology of three ejecta blankets reveals a range of thickness, from depths sufficient to completely bury craters in the 5 km diameter range in distal areas of the <b>blankets,</b> <b>to</b> very thin <b>blankets</b> which allow subtle pre-existing topography to be visible within a half the diameter of the parent crater. Radial and azimuthal symmetries appear <b>to</b> exist within the <b>blankets</b> over a range of morphologies. It also appears that there is a weak linear correlation between the diameter of craters with nearly 100 % infilling and distance from the center of the parent crater...|$|R
