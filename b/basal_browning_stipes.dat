50|$|Dicksonia lanata can {{be easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other Dicksonia species indigenous to New Zealand by its long, green or light <b>brown</b> <b>stipes</b> (the frond stalks). Dicksonia squarrosa has dark brown stipes; D. fibrosa has very short stipes.|$|R
50|$|Armillaria nabsnona is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Physalacriaceae. The species {{is found in the}} west coast of North America, Hawaii, and Japan, where it grows on {{decaying}} hardwoods, particularly species of alder. Its fruit bodies have convex to flattened orange-brown caps up to 7 cm in diameter, <b>brown</b> <b>stipes,</b> and whitish to pinkish-tan gills.|$|R
50|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} caps that are {{typically}} 4 - 8 cm wide with alternating bands {{of light and}} dark brown rings. On the cap underside are small white to pale grey pores that initially turn red when bruised before turning black; this red-staining behaviour is unique in its genus.The light to dark <b>brown</b> <b>stipe</b> measures 5 - 13 cm long by 1 - 2 cm thick.|$|R
50|$|The mushrooms, or fruiting bodies, can {{be quite}} large in size. the {{brownish}} or greyish cap measures up to 30 cm (12 in) in diameter and is covered with coarse darker brown scales. It is funnel-shaped. The underside bears soft, pale grey 'teeth' rather than gills. These are 0.5-1 cm long and brittle. The pale grey or <b>brown</b> <b>stipe</b> may reach 8 cm high and 3 cm wide, and may be narrower at the base and is sometimes eccentric.|$|R
40|$|The {{anamorphic}} fungus Synchaetomella lunatospora gen. et sp. nov. {{is described}} from a culture isolated from leaf litter in Singapore. The genus {{is characterized by}} the production of synnematous conidiomata with <b>brown</b> <b>stipes,</b> phialidic conidiogenesis with terminal and acropleurogenous conidiogenous cells, and falcate, 1 -septate conidia, aggregating in white, mucilaginous heads. Its phylogenetic relationships, inferred from the partial nuclear small ribosomal subunit (18 S) sequence, are with the coelomycetous genera Sphaerographium, Chaetomella, and Hainesia. However, the order and family affinities of this group are unclear...|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} Agaricus species, gills are free, colour {{progresses}} with age from pale-pink to a chocolate color, and spores are dark <b>brown.</b> The <b>stipe</b> {{has a clear}} annulus (ring).|$|R
50|$|Its fronds are 3 to 8 m long, borne on <b>brown</b> <b>stipes</b> which grow paler {{in color}} towards the blade, armed with 0.6 mm thorns. The rachis, like {{the top of}} the <b>stipe,</b> is light <b>brown</b> to straw-colored. The blades are oblong in shape and tripinnate, the pinnulets at the base being lobed (tripinnate-pinnatifid). Scattered tiny hairs are present on the {{underside}} (only) of the costae, costules, and some veins. Sori are {{at the edge of the}} leaf with straw-colored pseudoindusia. It most closely resembles H. melanochlaena, H. repens, and H. scandens, all of which are also large with thorny stems.|$|R
5000|$|Widow skimmers {{have large}} bulky bodies, with large head. Adults have a steely blue body area but juveniles are yellow with <b>brown</b> <b>stipes.</b> Eyes are also large and close {{together}} {{meeting in the}} middle of the head. They have three pairs of legs. Legs are black in color. They have two pairs of wings: forewings and hindwings. Wings of both sexes are marked with prominent black basal bands. They keep their wings extended over their bodies. Adult males develop broad white spots at midwing as they mature. The abdomen measures 24-32 mm.

50|$|Cyathea grevilleana is {{a species}} of tree fern endemic to Jamaica, where it grows in moist gullies and on wooded hills in both {{calcareous}} and noncalcareous soils {{at an altitude of}} 200-1200 m. The trunk of this plant is erect, about 7 m tall, and 10-15 cm in diameter. It is characteristically clothed in old <b>stipe</b> bases, <b>brown</b> scales and blackish spines. Fronds are tripinnate, dark green in colour, and up to 4 m in length. The last pinnae are sometimes separated, forming a distinctive clump around the trunk apex. The rachis is yellow-brown and almost smooth. This species has a long, dark <b>brown</b> <b>stipe</b> with a few scattered spines. Sori are produced in four to six pairs along the pinnule midvein. They are protected by pale brown indusia that are cup-like in appearance.|$|R
50|$|Xeromphalina cauticinalis is {{a species}} of agaric fungus in the family Mycenaceae. Originally {{described}} in 1838 by Elias Fries as Marasmius cauticinalis, it {{was transferred to the}} genus Xeromphalina by Robert Kühner and René Maire in 1934. It is found in North America, where it fruits in the summer and autumn singly or in groups on the seeds, needles, and sticks of conifers, and sometimes on aspen leaves. The fruit bodies have convex yellowish caps measuring 0.5 - 2.5 cm in diameter supported by a tough yellow-brown to dark <b>brown</b> <b>stipe</b> that is 3 - 8 cm long by 1-2.5 mm thick. The pale yellow gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe and are somewhat distantly spaced.

25|$|A.×gravesii can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} its parental species or {{with a number of}} the other Asplenium hybrids in the Appalachian Asplenium complex. Smaller specimens are most similar to A.pinnatifidum, but can be distinguished from that species by their <b>brown</b> <b>stipes</b> (and often rachides), a smaller number of fronds in each tuft, and by the tip of their leaves (which is pointed, but not drawn out at length as in A.pinnatifidum). A.×gravesii also has a slightly finer leaf texture, slightly sharper teeth on its leaves, and darker brown sori than A.pinnatifidum. When compared to A.bradleyi, larger A.×gravesii individuals are most similar, but the blades are not so deeply cut (A.bradleyi being wholly pinnate) nor the pinnae toothed around the edges, the rachis shows at least some traces of winging, and more of the rachis tends to be green.

40|$|Palaeomagnetic {{measurements}} {{were made on}} samples extracted from a short sequence of early Pleistocene estuarine clays, now exposed in a sea cliff near Sheringham on the north Norfolk coast, UK. On the basis of earlier palynological work, these clays had been ascribed a Pastonian (late Tiglian) age. The clays show marked changes in colour, from reddish-brown {{at the top of}} the unit, to blue-grey in the middle, and grey-brown at the base. The palaeomagnetic data vary in close association with these colour changes. The top and <b>basal</b> <b>brown</b> clays show scattered normal directions of low intensity, while the middle blue clays show strongly clustered reversed directions, of much higher intensities. Some samples taken from the boundary between the middle blue and upper red clays show upon demagnetisation a normal overprint on a stable reversed polarity. Using high-gradient magnetic extraction, magnetic concentrates have been obtained from the strongly magnetic middle blue clays. The presence of iron sulphide minerals in these concentrates was identified using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis during scanning electron microscopy. More specifically, X-ray diffraction identifies greigite as the only detectable ferrimagnetic mineral in the magnetic concentrates. Rock magnetic measurements show clear qualitative differences in the magnetic mineralogies of the three clay subunits, but absolute identification of the magnetic mineralogy of the weakly magnetic upper and <b>basal</b> <b>brown</b> clays has not yet been possible. We interpret the sequence as a primary reversed polarity record. This record is carried by the iron sulphide greigite as a chemical remanence acquired during ‘syn’-depositional reduction of iron via the decomposition of organic material in these anoxic tidal clays. Subsequently, the upper and basal subunits of the clay have been oxidised by permeation of groundwater from the adjacent coarse-grained sediments. Most of the griegite in the oxidised margins of the clay has been altered as a result, to a new, less efficient magnetic recording material which thus carries a later, scattered, low-intensity, normal overprint...|$|R

40|$|Internal stipe {{necrosis}} of cultivated button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) {{is caused}} by the bacterium Ewingella americana (Enterobacteriaceae), {{which is part of the}} endogenous bacterial population in mushroom sporocarp tissues.

Ewingella americana was isolated from 90 % of mushroom samples showing mild <b>stipe</b> <b>browning,</b> while Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. tolaasii were also isolated. Inoculation with E. americana into button mushroom sporocarps yielded typical browning symptoms which were distinguishable from those of the bacterial soft rot.
