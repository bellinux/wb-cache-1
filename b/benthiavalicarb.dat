40|$|Industrial {{adjuvants}} {{were tested}} in combination with <b>benthiavalicarb</b> plus mancozeb (Valbon 1. 6 kg/ha) {{in the field to}} investigate their efficacy on foliar late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans. The tested adjuvant-fungicide treatments for late blight control were applied 6 times at 7 -day intervals. The effect of the adjuvant-fungicide treatments on epidemic development, tuber blight and tuber yields were determined. Because of the favourable weather conditions a high disease pressure could be observed. The incidence of foliage blight was scored {{and at the end of}} the growing season the disease level was lower in plots sprayed with the Valbon-adjuvant combinations than in plots treated with only Valbon. The addition of an adjuvant had a clearly positive effect on the tuber yield although the differences were not significant. In the plots treated with Valbon 6. 9 % infected tubers were observed. The mean tuber infection of plots sprayed with the Valbon-adjuvant combinations fluctuated between 2. 3 and 15. 6 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of different fungicide combinations to control late blight and the STOP {{effect of these}} fungicide combinations for the control of foliar and tuber blight under high infection pressure was investigated. Last summer late blight development was arrested in July due to high temperatures and lasting drought. In August the weather was cloudy, rather cold {{and a lot of}} rain. These weather conditions were very favourable for late blight. Due to the heat waves of June and July the foliage started to die allready in August and P. infestans developped very fast {{in the second part of}} August. Because of that no incidence of foliage blight was scored. No significant differences in yield were observed for the different treatments applied. The combination cyazofamid + heptamethyltrisiloxaan (Ranman) + propamocarb + chlorothalonil (Tattoo C) had the highest yield. The percent diseased tubers fluctuated between 14, 9 and 45, 1 % for the different treatments tested. The amount of blighted tubers was lowest for fluazinam (Shirlan) + cymoxanil +chlorothalonil (Mixanil) and fluazinam (Shirlan) + <b>benthiavalicarb</b> + mancozeb (Valicarb) ...|$|E
40|$|Many oomycetes {{species are}} {{pathogens}} of plants, animals and humans; {{some of them}} are well studied because they cause significant economic losses in agriculture and acquaculture. The cell wall of oomycetes consists mainly of cellulose, β- (1, 3) and β- (1, 6) - glucan and in some species a small amount of chitin is also present. The biosynthesis of cellulose in oomycetes is still poorly studied and therefore misunderstood, although it’s the target of some fungicides that inhibit this process, such as carboxylic acid amides. Since 2010, single amino acid exchanges in CesA 3 protein conferring CAA resistance in Plasmopara viticola have been identified. In this work, we initially provide the first evidence of the presence of mandipropamid resistant populations of Plasmopara viticola in commercial vineyards in Italy (paper I). We continue by studying the different activity of four CAAs fungicides (<b>benthiavalicarb,</b> dimethomorph, iprovalicarb, mandipropamid) toward P. viticola resistant strains (paper II). The results show that the G 1105 S mutation affects all four CAAs, but its impact is varied. These results confirm that they are cross resistant, although many gaps in the mode of action are still present. In order to confirm our previous findings, we performed a microscopical base method to assess the sensitivity of four CAAs, and preliminary microscopical data confirmed the different activity toward the CAA-resistant and CAA-sensitive populations (chapter ten). Furthermore, we present a study (chapter eleven) in which we randomly selected samples from paper I, in order to test them using a different approach, simulating a scenario more close to the field. With this test, we were able to confirm the data presented in the paper I...|$|E
