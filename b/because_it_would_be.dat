5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make it much more difficult to detect <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E
5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart chatted on the Internet {{about how}} {{to carry out the}} operation. Schlesselman {{suggested}} using a sawed-off shotgun <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> easy to maneuver; he also said he planned to steal a gun from his father. Prior to their arrest, the men decorated their car with a Swastika and drew the numbers 88 and 14 on their hood using window chalk. Authorities believe the men may have planned to move from state to state to choose their victims. They also planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were now}} made {{to find a}} role for the {{remaining}} 19 locomotives. By now many had been relegated to hauling trains in what were once seen as remote outposts of the LMS. Often they were reduced to pulling stopping trains, empty stock trains, or even goods trains. Only one realistic mainline role was contemplated: to replace the Scottish Region A4 Class on the testing route between Edinburgh Waverley and Aberdeen. This idea was discarded largely <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> excessively problematic to train the A4 crews to operate the Coronations. With no credible role, only one option remained: in July 1964 it was resolved that the remaining 19 locomotives were to be withdrawn from 12 September.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{utilized}} in both directions, {{the capacity of}} the proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to be able to carry 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62million daily passengers, had it been built. The estimate was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It was to be built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to build that system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line was to be extended to Hoboken near the Palisades, while the Flushing Line was to be extended to Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City. Ultimately, the cost was too great, and with the Great Depression, these ideas were quickly shot down.|$|E
5|$|National {{competitions}} generally {{last one}} week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed {{the greatest number}} of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time. Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, telemetry giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.|$|E
5|$|Smith headed west, {{across the}} Ligurian Alps, towards {{southern}} France, which he knew {{had just been}} invaded by Allied troops, principally Americans, Free French and British. He and Bill were assisted along the way by Italian partisan groups and other locals. After 10 days on the road, three other Allied personnel—a Frenchman, an Austrian and a Pole—joined the trek, having met Smith and Bill at a partisan camp. The lingua franca of the group having changed to Italian, the five men hiked to the border, where they were taken in by an old farmer, Jean Batiste Chambrin, who gave them {{instructions on how to}} pass the German sentries guarding the border with France. The soldiers decided that <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too risky to try to cross all together, Smith and Bill would go first, with the Frenchman, Austrian and Pole following the next day.|$|E

25|$|In some cultures, pets or {{sporting}} {{animals are}} sometimes given names similar to human names. Other cultures, {{such as the}} Chinese, give animals nonhuman names <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> seen as offensive and disrespectful to {{the person of the}} same name.|$|E

25|$|Nude female {{swimming}} was {{not allowed}} in most schools, both for modesty reasons and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> awkward to accommodate menstruating girls.

25|$|In 1962, Sarkar {{formally}} outlined PROUT in sixteen aphorisms (see Chapter 5 of Ananda Sutram). The {{last five}} aphorisms (5:12–16) are {{commonly referred to}} as the five fundamental principles of PROUT. These five principles are deemed to be fundamental <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> difficult to get a clear understanding of PROUT without comprehending the underlying concepts of these principles, the interrelationship of the principles, and their respective areas of application.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, the {{finances}} of the Catholic University School and University were intertwined, and the rent for the Harcourt Street premises {{was a high}} £2600 per annum.

Archbishop of Dublin, Paul Cullen was adamant that it was not possible for C.U.S to close down even for a year – <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> possible that the school would never open again.|$|E

25|$|While {{teaching}} {{for a few}} weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defense authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> contrary to the doctrine of mutual assured destruction, since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.|$|E

25|$|The favored {{alternative}}, build alternative 1, {{included a}} subway running down Second Avenue from 125th Street in Harlem {{to the existing}} Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station with provisions for expansion to the Bronx and to Lower Manhattan. Second Avenue was chosen over Third Avenue, because Third Avenue {{was too close to}} the Lexington Avenue Line, as well as having significant property impacts, increased construction complexity and cost, and increased travel times resulting from slower operating speeds. Second Avenue was chosen over First Avenue, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too difficult to construct near the Queensboro Bridge, the United Nations and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Bradley {{insisted that}} 75 per {{cent of the}} {{airborne}} assault be delivered by gliders for concentration of forces. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unsupported by naval and corps artillery, Ridgway, commanding the 82nd Airborne Division, also wanted a glider assault to deliver his organic artillery. The use of gliders was planned until April 18, when tests under realistic conditions resulted in excessive accidents and destruction of many gliders. On April 28 the plan was changed; the entire assault force would be inserted by parachute drop at night in one lift, with gliders providing reinforcement during the day.|$|E
25|$|Downey Jr. was on {{probation}} {{during the winter}} of 1999 when Hanson considered him for a role in Wonder Boys. Hanson was cautious because of the actor's drug history and concerned <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a tough film shot in sequence in Pittsburgh in the winter. Downey flew to Pittsburgh and had a long dinner conversation with Hanson where they addressed his problems. The actor demonstrated a commitment to the project and Hanson hired him. Reportedly, Downey acted in a professional manner for the entire four-and-a-half month shoot but after it ended, he returned to Los Angeles and violated his parole.|$|E
