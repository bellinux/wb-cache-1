40|$|The corn crop {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops of the state, and will doubtless remain so for many years to come. It is, therefore, of importance to know something of its insect enemies and the method of treating them. From the nature of the injuries to corn, particularly on account of the difficulty of any direct examination of some forms, and the difficulty of making any exact estimate, their injuries are, I think, very generally under-estimated. Probably the most serious losses come from those working under ground, the injuries of which are to be found simply in the lessened crop, and which consequently pass unnoticed by most farmers. At times the destruction of seed in the ground by wire worms, or injury to the newly sprouted plants by <b>cut</b> <b>worms,</b> wire worms or sod worms, which necessitate replanting, attract general attention. Sometimes, also, the general destruction of the crop by the corn root worm is noted, but when any or all of these insects simply destroy undeveloped plants or parts of plants, or when there is a gradual drain upon the growth of the plant, as occurs from the presence of the root lice in corn fields, it is naturally unnoticed, and the shortage in the crops is. charged to other agents...|$|R

During present study 38 species of lepidopterous insects associated with vegetables in Aravalli Range of Rajasthan were recorded, out of 152 species of lepidopterous insects recorded from India. The families Crambidae and Noctuidae were the dominant families each represented by 8 species followed by Arctiidae having 4 species; Lycaenidae 3 species; then Nolidae, Pieridae and Sphingidae each having 2 species and least by Cosmopterigidae, Gelechiidae, Geometridae, Hesperiidae, Lymantriidae, Nymphalidae, Plutellidae, Pterophoridae and Saturniidae each having 1 species.

(The colour plates were expensive to produce and each one was glued into the book by hand.) Illustrators who produced silhouette pictures at this time include Arthur Rackham and William Heath Robinson.

Illustrators of the late 20th century to work in silhouette include Jan Pienkowski and Jan Ormerod.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{toxicity}} of seven of Allylisothiocyanate (AITC) formulations, AITC pure and in mixture with cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos, was evaluated using spray application and fumigation method against the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), the small cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae (L.) and the tobacco <b>cut</b> <b>worm,</b> Spodoptera litura Fabr. Approach: Response varied according to insect species, specific formulation and AITC application rates. Results: Fumigant {{toxicity of}} the oil based on 9 h exposure was evaluated against the three insect larvae, the diamond back moth, P. xylostella larvae were more susceptible followed by tobacco <b>cut</b> <b>worm,</b> S. litura and cabbage white, P. rapae larvae. To P. xylostella larvae, LC 50 value was 1. 5 µL L - 1 air, S. litura larvae (LC 50, 1. 8 µL L - 1 air) and P. rapae larvae (LC 50, 2. 0 µL L - 1 air). These three insect larvae were killed after 9 h exposure to a dose of 4. 3 µL L - 1 air {{of the oil}}, showed no significance difference with that of phosphine (40 µg L - 1 air) a recommended dose. On the other hand, on the spray application bioassays, mortality data counted 72 h after treatment, the P. rapae larvae were most susceptible to AITC formulations followed by S. litura larvae and P. xylostella larvae. LC 50 values, to P. xylostella larvae, HJ(A) and HJ(B) were the most potent toxicant (33 mg L - 1) and (46 mg L - 1) respectively, while the least toxic was HJ(C) (556 mg L - 1). To S. litura larvae, HJ(B) and HJ(A) were the most efficient (10 mg L - 1) and (22 mg L - 1) respectively, while HJ(D) (LC 50, 385 mg L - 1) {{was found to be}} the least toxic. The both of HJ (B) and HJ (C) had similar insecticidal activity (LC 50, 8 mg L - 1) to Pieris rapae larvae followed by HD (B) (LC 50, 22 mg L - 1) and HD (A) (LC 50, 82 mg L - 1). Conclusion/Recommendations: It was concluded that the AITC oil showed promise findings and may be a good alternative to old fumigant phosphine. The others were found efficient on the spray application bioassays but the mixture of AITC with cypermethrin especially HJ (A) and HJ (B) were found to be better than AITC mixed with chlorpyrifos and AITC pure. So they can be used in the field of crop protection as safer and potential components of an integrated pest management strategy, especially allylisothiocyanate is considered fully biodegradable, less toxic and many cruciferous vegetables daily consumed by humans...|$|R
