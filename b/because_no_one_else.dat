In general, the cooperative experienced regular problems because the administration took in more than it spent, and at times the system added too much scrip into the system via the amount issued to new members.|$|E

While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument {{on a few}} recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, [...] "He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, <b>because</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> would play like Ian". During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.|$|E

The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good thing, because it let us take control of what we needed to do.

500|$|A U.S. {{intelligence}} {{official said the}} danger of using informants was inherent but unavoidable. Intelligence agencies {{have to rely on}} unsavory individuals to penetrate terrorist groups <b>because</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> has the access. Those hazards would be neither denied nor ignored by the CIA officers. Former {{intelligence official}}s said they were deeply troubled about al-Balawi's ability to get close to so many CIA officers. A former agency case officer expressed surprise that [...] "a potential hostile" [...] was able to be in immediate proximity to a large number of CIA operatives. [...] "Why the officers would show a source all their faces, that alone was a terrible decision," [...] said one former senior CIA paramilitary operative who served in Afghanistan. Larry C. Johnson, a former CIA officer and counter-terrorism agent, said that a source supposedly as significant as al-Balawi should never have been brought inside the base, because it risked exposing him.|$|E
500|$|Some {{literary}} critics and historians argue {{that not only}} does Lady Macbeth represent an anti-mother figure in general, she also embodies {{a specific type of}} anti-mother: the witch. Critic Joanna Levin defines a witch as a woman who succumbs to Satanic force, a lust for the devil, and who, either for this reason or the desire to obtain supernatural powers, invokes (evil) spirits. English physician Edward Jorden published Briefe Discourse of a Disease Called the Suffocation of the Mother in 1603, in which he speculated that this force literally derived from the female sexual reproductive organs. <b>Because</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> had published any other studies on the susceptibility of women, especially mothers, to becoming both the witch and the bewitched (i.e. demonically possessed), Jorden's findings helped create the foundation for the views popularized during the Renaissance about the relationship between women and witchcraft. Levin refers to Marianne Hester's Lewd Women and Wicked Witches: A Study of Male Domination, in which Hester articulates a feminist interpretation of the witch as an empowered woman. Levin summarises the claim of feminist historians like Hester: the witch should be a figure celebrated for her nonconformity, defiance, and general sense of empowerment; witches challenged patriarchal authority and hierarchy, specifically [...] "threatening hegemonic sex/gender systems." [...] This view associates witchcraft — and by extension, Lady Macbeth — not with villainy and evil, but with heroism.|$|E

500|$|Marketing for {{the film}} {{included}} $20million spent by Disney for advertising as well as advertisers such as Burger King, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Payless ShoeSource paying $125million in tied promotions {{for the film}}. Marketing consultant Al Ries reflected on the promotion: [...] "This will be a killer deal. How can a kid, sitting through a one-and-a-half-hour movie with an army of recognizable toy characters, not want to own one?" [...] Despite this, Disney Consumer Products was slow to see the potential of Toy Story early on. When the Thanksgiving release date was announced in January 1995, many toy companies were accustomed to having eighteen months to two years of runway time and passed on the project. In February 1995, Disney took the idea to Toy Fair, a toy industry trade show in New York. There, a Toronto-based company with a factory based in China, Thinkway Toys, became interested. Although Thinkway was a small player in the industry, mainly producing toy banks {{in the form of}} film characters, it was able to scoop up the worldwide master license for Toy Story toys simply <b>because</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> wanted it. Walt Disney Home Video put a trailer for the film on seven million copies of the VHS re-release of Cinderella; the Disney Channel ran a television special on the making of Toy Story; Walt Disney World in Florida held a daily Toy Story parade at Disney-MGM Studios.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} witch in {{the series}} is Granny Weatherwax, who at first glance {{seems to be a}} taciturn, bitter old crone, from the small mountain country of Lancre.

The following year he joined a band and performed professionally for the first time. From 1972-'77, he attended the Villa-Lobos School of Music to study classical guitar. He went to college and got a degree in engineering in 1980, but he pursued music instead.|$|R
2500|$|The Klingons {{were created}} by screenwriter Gene L. Coon, and first {{appeared}} in the episode [...] "Errand of Mercy" [...] (1967). They were named after Lieutenant Wilbur Clingan, who served with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in the Los Angeles Police Department. In the original television series (TOS), Klingons were typically portrayed with bronze skin and facial hair suggestive of Asian people, and possessed physical abilities similar to humans (in fact, Coon's only physical description of them in his [...] "Errand of Mercy" [...] script is [...] "oriental" [...] and [...] "hard-faced"). The swarthy look of Klingon males was created with the application of shoe polish and long, thin moustaches; budget constraints limited creativity. The overall look of the aliens, played by white actors, suggested orientalism, at a time when memories of Japanese actions during World War II were still fresh. The production crew never came to an agreement on the name [...] "Klingon"; Coon was adamant about keeping the name, and it persisted <b>because</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> offered up a better name.|$|E
2500|$|Attributable to {{the level}} of {{interest}} in women who do not match the proportions of average models, plus-size models are slowly emerging in the mainstream media.

Prominent names include Ashley Graham; who is the face of popular plus-size retailer Lane Bryant, and Iskra Lawrence; who is a classified role model for lingerie and swimwear retailer Aerie. Fashion magazines are beginning to include plus-size models as well, with Sports Illustrated gaining worldwide attention when it showcased the first plus-size model on the cover of its swimsuit issue. Fashion designers are also strong supporters for embracing diversity and healthy body ideals in fashion. Christian Siriano specifically, shocked the fashion world by casting five plus-size models for his New York Fashion Week shows. Despite the box-office success of Ghostbusters, Siriano also made global headlines after he designed a gown for actress Leslie Jones, <b>because</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> would. Although a high number of plus-size models dominated the runways this year, print advertisements saw a decrease, with only 2.2% casted.|$|E
