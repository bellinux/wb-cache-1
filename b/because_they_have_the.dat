5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses {{is a pair}} of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.|$|E

25|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} are {{undifferentiated}} cells of an embryo. These cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to give rise {{to all of the}} tissues found in an adult organism. This ability allows stem cells to create any cell type, which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells. Controversy surrounds human ESC work due to the destruction of viable human embryos. Leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells, SCNT is one such method.|$|E

25|$|Event-driven {{strategies}} concern {{situations in}} which the underlying investment opportunity and risk are associated with an event. An event-driven investment strategy finds investment opportunities in corporate transactional events such as consolidations, acquisitions, recapitalizations, bankruptcies, and liquidations. Managers employing such a strategy capitalize on valuation inconsistencies in the market before or after such events, and take a position based on the predicted movement of the security or securities in question. Large institutional investors such as hedge funds {{are more likely to}} pursue event-driven investing strategies than traditional equity investors <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> expertise and resources to analyze corporate transactional events for investment opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Expressways however can be {{upgraded}} to motorway standard; these roads are colloquially {{referred to as}} gelbe Autobahn (yellow motorway) <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same technical standard as the Autobahn but they have black on yellow signs instead of the white on blue signs used on the Autobahn motorway network. These are generally high-speed arterial roads in larger cities or important roads within a federal state that do not connect to major cities, {{so that they do}} not fall under the federal budget for the Autobahn network. The federal road Bundesstraße 27 is an example where about half of its length is {{upgraded to}} a high speed motorway standard. Some of these non-Autobahn motorways do not have an actual speed limit (design speed 130km/h).|$|E

25|$|The precise {{notion of}} {{duplicated}} work relies on noticing {{that after the}} first reduction of I I is done, {{the value of the}} other I I can be determined, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same structure (and in fact they have exactly the same values), and result from a common ancestor. Such similar structures can each be assigned a label that can be tracked across reductions. If a name is assigned to the redex that produces all the resulting II terms, and then all duplicated occurrences of II can be tracked and reduced in one go. However, it is not obvious that a redex will produce the II term. Identifying the structures that are similar in different parts of a lambda term can involve a complex algorithm and can possibly have a complexity equal to the history of the reduction itself.|$|E
25|$|Blow flies – Family Calliphoridae- Flies in {{this family}} are often {{metallic}} in appearance and between 10 and 14mm in length. In addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as blue bottle fly, cluster fly, greenbottles, or black blowfly. A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented antennae. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day. Larvae have three stages of development (called instars); each stage is separated by a molting event. Worldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the Neotropics, {{and a large number}} of species in Africa and Southern Europe. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of India, Japan, Central America, and in the southern United States. The typical habitat for blow-flies are temperate to tropical areas that provide a layer of loose, damp soil and litter where larvae may thrive and pupate. The forensic importance of this fly is that it is the first insect to come in contact with carrion <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to smell death from up to ten miles (16km) away.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 2015, the Government of Jalisco {{disarmed}} {{the municipal}} police forces of Villa Purificación and Unión de Tula. Villa Purificación had 19 {{police officers and}} one police chief, while Unión de Tula had 11 police officers and one police chief. All of them were ordered to appear in court. Legally, the state government {{had the power to}} disarm municipal forces <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to grant and revoke licenses for bearing arms. Governor Sandoval explained that this non-violent procedure took three hours and was done in light of the measures proposed through Operation Jalisco and the attacks of May 1. He also explained that the state government conducted a large-scale investigation and discovered that organized crime groups had infiltrated their police ranks. Around 150 state officials participated in the disarmament. Jalisco's security commissioner Francisco Alejandro Solorio Aréchiga informed the press that they retrieved 36 rifles (20 from Villa Purificación and 16 from Unión de Tula), 46 handguns (20 from Villa Purificación and 26 from Unión de Tula), and nine vehicles (four from Villa Purificación and five from Unión de Tula). In a communiqué, the state government explained that public security duties would fall under state and federal authorities.|$|E

In 1810, Brown published Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen in which he arranged the genus into two unranked groups. B.ilicifolia was placed alone in Isostylis because of its unusual dome-shaped inflorescences.

500|$|Herpetologist Wilfred T. Neill, {{reported}} in 1950 that he unearthed a bowfin aestivating in a chamber [...] below the ground surface, [...] in diameter, [...] from a river. It was further noted that flood levels had previously reached the area, and receded. [...] It {{is not unusual}} for riverine species like bowfin to move into backwaters with flood currents, and become trapped when water levels recede. [...] While aestivation is anecdotally documented by multiple researchers, laboratory experiments have suggested instead that bowfin are physiologically incapable of surviving more than three to five days of air exposure. However, no field manipulation has been performed. Regardless of the lack of evidence confirming the bowfin's ability to aestivate, it has been noted that bowfin can survive prolonged conditions of exposure to air <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to breathe air. [...] Their gill filaments and lamellae are rigid in structure which helps prevent the lamellae from collapsing and aids gas exchange even during air exposure.|$|E

However, Bart is convinced that Walt is Sideshow Bob in disguise, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same voice. He tries several times to find proof, but fails.

However, Bart's initial instincts prove right when [...] "Walt" [...] removes his small shoes to show his long feet folded inside, revealing himself to be Sideshow Bob.
