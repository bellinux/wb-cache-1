50|$|The hellbenders' {{breeding}} season begins in late August or early- to mid-September and can continue {{as late as}} the end of November, depending on region. They exhibit no sexual dimorphism, except during the fall mating season, when males have a <b>bulging</b> <b>ring</b> around their cloacal glands. Unlike most salamanders, the hellbender performs external fertilization. Before mating, each male excavates a brood site, a saucer-shaped depression under a rock or log, with its entrance positioned out of the direct current, usually pointing downstream. The male remains in the brood site awaiting a female. When a female approaches, the male guides or drives her into his burrow and prevents her from leaving until she oviposits.|$|R
40|$|We present Chandra {{studies of}} the X-ray binary (XRB) populations in the <b>bulge</b> and <b>ring</b> regions of the ring galaxy NGC 1291. We detect 169 X-ray point sources in the galaxy, 75 in the bulge and 71 in the ring, {{utilizing}} the four available Chandra observations totaling an effective exposure of 179 ks. We report photometric properties of these sources in a point-source catalog. There are approx. 40 % of the bulge sources and approx. 25 % of the ring sources showing > 3 (sigma) long-term variability in their X-ray count rate. The X-ray colors suggest that a significant fraction of the bulge (approx. 75 %) and ring (approx. 65 %) sources are likely low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The spectra of the nuclear source indicate {{that it is a}} low-luminosity AGN with moderate obscuration; spectral variability is observed between individual observations. We construct 0. 3 - 8. 0 keV X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for the <b>bulge</b> and <b>ring</b> XRB populations, taking into account the detection incompleteness and background AGN contamination. We reach 90 % completeness limits of approx. 1. 5 x 10 (exp 37) and approx. 2. 2 x 10 (exp 37) erg/s for the <b>bulge</b> and <b>ring</b> populations, respectively. Both XLFs can be fit with a broken power-law model, and the shapes are consistent with those expected for populations dominated by LMXBs. We perform detailed population synthesis modeling of the XRB populations in NGC 1291, which suggests that the observed combined XLF is dominated by aD old LMXB population. We compare the <b>bulge</b> and <b>ring</b> XRB populations, and argue that the ring XRBs are associated with a younger stellar population than the bulge sources, based on the relative over-density of X-ray sources in the ring, the generally harder X-ray color of the ring sources, the overabundance of luminous sources in the combined XLF, and the flatter shape of the ring XLF...|$|R

40|$|We {{present results}} from MUSE {{observations}} of the nearly face-on disk galaxy NGC 7742. This galaxy hosts a spectacular nuclear ring of enhanced star formation, which is unusual {{in that it is}} hosted by a non-barred galaxy, and also because this star formation is most likely fuelled by externally accreted gas that counter-rotates with respect to its main stellar body. We use the MUSE data to derive the star-formation history (SFH) and accurately measure the stellar and ionized-gas kinematics of NGC 7742 in its nuclear, <b>bulge,</b> <b>ring,</b> and disk regions. We map the previously known gas counter-rotation well outside the ring region and deduce the presence of a slightly warped inner disk, which is inclined 6 degrees compared to the outer disk. The gas-disk inclination is well constrained from the kinematics; the derived inclination 13. 7 Â± 0. 4 degrees agrees well with that derived from photometry and from what one expects using the inverse Tully-Fisher relation. We find a prolonged SFH in the ring with stellar populations as old as 2 - 3 Gyr and an indication that the star formation triggered by the minor merger event was delayed in the disk compared to the ring. There are two separate stellar components: an old population that counter-rotates with the gas, and a young one, concentrated to the ring, that co-rotates with the gas. We recover the kinematics of the old stars from a two-component fit, and show that combining the old and young stellar populations results in the erroneous average velocity of nearly zero found from a one-component fit. The superior spatial resolution and large field of view of MUSE allow us to establish the kinematics and SFH of the nuclear ring in NGC 7742. We show further evidence that this ring has its origin in a minor merger event, possibly 2 - 3 Gyr ago. Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in A&...|$|R

40|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} and mergers are shaping and reshaping galaxies throughout the observable universe. While observations of interacting galaxies at low redshifts yield {{detailed information about}} the processes at work, observations at high redshifts suggest that {{interactions and}} mergers were much more frequent in the past. Major mergers of nearby disk galaxies form remnants that share many properties with ellipticals and are, in essence, present-day protoellipticals. There is also tantalizing evidence that minor mergers of companions may help build bulges in disk galaxies. Gas {{plays a crucial role}} in such interactions. Because of its dissipative nature, it tends to get crunched into molecular form, turning into fuel for starbursts and active nuclei. Besides the evidence for ongoing interactions, signatures of past interactions and mergers in galaxies abound: tidal tails and ripples, counterrotating disks and <b>bulges,</b> polar <b>rings,</b> systems of young globular clusters, and aging starbursts. Galaxy formation and transformation clearly is a prolonged process occurring to the present time. Overall, the currently available observational evidence points towards Hubble's morphological sequence being mainly a sequence of decreasing merger damage. Comment: 14 pages, LaTeX, 5 PS figures.

50|$|Subsequent studies (using the Hubble Space Telescope) {{show that}} the bulges of many galaxies are not devoid of dust, but rather show a varied and complex {{structure}}. This structure often looks similar to a spiral galaxy, but is much smaller. Giant spiral galaxies are typically 2-100 {{times the size of}} those spirals that exist in bulges. Where they exist, these central spirals dominate the light of the bulge in which they reside. Typically the rate at which new stars are formed in pseudobulges is similar to the rate at which stars form in disk galaxies. Sometimes <b>bulges</b> contain nuclear <b>rings</b> that are forming stars at much higher rate (per area) than is typically found in outer disks, as shown in NGC 4314 (see photo).|$|R
50|$|Several {{causes for}} the faults have been suggested, {{including}} regional stresses {{created by the}} Tharsis bulge, volcanic dikes, and crustal loading by Alba Mons itself. The faults of Ceraunius and Tantalus Fossae are roughly radial {{to the center of}} Tharsis and are likely a crustal response to the sagging weight of the Tharsis <b>bulge.</b> The faults <b>ringing</b> Alba's summit region may be due to a combination of loading from the Alba edifice and magma uplift or underplating from the underlying mantle. Some of the fractures are likely the surface expression of gigantic dike swarms radial to Tharsis. An image from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) shows a line of rimless pit craters in Cyane Fossae on the Alba's western flank (pictured right). The pits likely formed by the collapse of surface materials into open fractures created as magma intruded the subsurface rock to form dikes.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{physical}} {{conditions in the}} interstellar gas of 11 actively star-forming galaxies at z~ 2, based on integral-field spectroscopy from the ESO-VLT and HST/NICMOS imaging. We concentrate on the high H-alpha surface brightnesses, large line widths, line ratios and the clumpy nature of these galaxies. We show that photoionization calculations and emission line diagnostics imply gas pressures and densities {{that are similar to}} the most intense nearby star-forming regions at z= 0 but over much larger scales (10 - 20 kpc). A relationship between surface brightness and velocity dispersion can be explained through simple energy injection arguments and a scaling set by nearby galaxies with no free parameters. The high velocity dispersions are a natural consequence of intense star formation thus regions of high velocity dispersion are not evidence for mass concentrations such as <b>bulges</b> or <b>rings.</b> External mechanisms like cosmological gas accretion generally do not have enough energy to sustain the high velocity dispersions. In some cases, the high pressures and low gas metallicites may make it difficult to robustly distinguish between AGN ionization cones and star formation, as we show for BzK- 15504 at z= 2. 38. We construct a picture where the early stages of galaxy evolution are driven by self-gravity which powers strong turbulence until the velocity dispersion is high. Then massive, dense, gas-rich clumps collapse, triggering star formation with high efficiencies and intensities as observed. At this stage, the intense star formation is likely self-regulated by the mechanical energy output of massive stars. Comment: ApJ accepted main journal, 21 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} light {{curve of}} a microlensing event provides only two {{constraints on the}} six unknown parameters of the lens. We show that narrow{band photometry during a microlensing event of a giant star can in addition determine the angular radius of the Einstein ring and the proper motion of the lens. This possibility results {{from the fact that}} the extended atmospheres of giants emit the cores of resonant lines primarily from a narrow ring (limb brightening). The radius of the emission ring can be determined to a precision of 20 % by detailed spectroscopic observations of the source after the lensing event has ended. A considerable fraction of the clump giants in the <b>bulge</b> have a <b>ring</b> radius> 1012 cm, within the range of Einstein radii for sub-solar mass lenses.

The I-alpha image reveals bright emission-line regions associated with the Seyfert nucleus {{and an inner ring}} of intense star formation. The forbidden O III 5007 -A image shows that the high-excitation gas is elongated perpendicularly to the direction of the bar, and reveals a bright compact object at about 40 arcsec NE of the nucleus which is undetectable in the broadband images. This object is interpreted as a dwarf young H II galaxy.

According to the special requirement of high reliability, long life of wind power bearing, the current manufacturing defects {{of it has been}} analyzed, such as flange, pits, fish-tail, folding, and comparing with its current manufacturing method, which is called ring rolling, therefore, a new method called rolling and bulging-matching techniques is proposed, as wind power bearing ring should be released stress after rolling, then sized through bulging and once again to stress.

40|$|We {{have studied}} stellar and gaseous {{kinematics}} {{as well as}} stellar population properties {{in the center of}} the early-type barred galaxy NGC 4245 by means of integral-field spectroscopy. We have found a chemically distinct compact core, more metal-rich by a factor of 2. 5 than the <b>bulge,</b> and a <b>ring</b> of young stars with the radius of 300 pc. Current star formation proceeds in this ring; its location corresponds to the inner Lindblad resonance of the large-scale bar. The mean age of stars in the chemically distinct core is significantly younger than the estimate by Sarzi et al. (2005) for the very center, within R= 0. 25 ", made with the HST spectroscopy data. We conclude that the `chemically distinct core' is in fact an ancient ultra-compact star forming ring with radius less than 100 pc which marks perhaps the past position of the inner Lindblad resonance. In general, the pattern of star formation history in the center of this early-type gas-poor galaxy confirms the predictions of dynamical models for the secular evolution of a stellar-gaseous disk under the influence of a bar.

40|$|The author gives {{a summary}} of the conference proceedings. The conference began with the {{presentation}} of the basic data sets on pairs, groups, and interacting galaxies with the latter being further discussed with respect to both global properties and properties of the galactic nuclei. Then followed the theory, modelling and interpretation using analytic techniques, simulations and general modelling for spirals and ellipticals, starbursts and active galactic nuclei. Before the conference the author wrote down the three questions concerning pairs, groups and interacting galaxies that he hoped would be answered at the meeting: (1) How do they form, including the role of initial conditions, the importance of subclustering, the evolution of groups to compact groups, and the fate of compact groups; (2) How do they evolve, including issues such as relevant timescales, the role of halos and the problem of overmerging, the triggering and enhancement of star formation and activity in the galactic nuclei, and the relative importance of dwarf versus giant encounters; and (3) Are they important, including the frequency of pairs and interactions, whether merging and interactions are very important aspects of the life of a normal galaxy at formation, during its evolution, in forming bars, shells, <b>rings,</b> <b>bulges,</b> etc., and in the formation and evolution of active galaxies?

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of galactic disk formation and evolution in 'realistic' LambdaCDM haloes with idealized baryonic initial conditions. We add rotating spheres of hot gas at z= 1. 3 to two fully cosmological dark-matter-only halo (re) simulations. The gas cools according to an artificial and adjustable cooling function to form a rotationally supported galaxy. The simulations evolve in the full cosmological context until z= 0. We vary the angular momentum and density profiles of the initial gas sphere, the cooling time and {{the orientation of the}} angular momentum vector to study the effects on the evolution of the disk. The final disks show realistic structural and kinematic properties. The slower the cooling/accretion processes, the higher the kinematic disk-to-bulge ratio D/B of the resulting system. We find that the initial orientation of the gas angular momentum with respect to the halo has a major effect on the resulting D/B. The most stable systems result from orientations parallel to the halo minor axis, but the sign of the spin can have a strong effect. Despite the spherical and coherently rotating initial gas distribution, the orientation of the central disk and of the outer gas components and the relative angle between the components can all change by more than 90 degrees over several billion years. Disks can form from initial conditions oriented parallel to the major axis, but there is often strong misalignment between inner and outer material. The more the orientation of the baryonic angular momentum changes during the evolution, the lower the final D/B. The behaviour varies strongly from halo to halo. Even our simple initial conditions can lead to strong bars, dominant <b>bulges,</b> massive, misaligned <b>rings</b> and counter-rotating components. We discuss how our results may relate to the failure or success of fully cosmological disk formation simulations. (abridged) Comment: 25 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
