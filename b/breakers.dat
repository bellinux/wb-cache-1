40|$|Circuit <b>breaker</b> is an {{important}} interrupting device in power system network. It usually has a lifetime about 20 to 40 years. During <b>breaker's</b> service time, maintenance and inspection are imperative duties to achieve its reliable operation. To automate the diagnostic practice for circuit <b>breaker</b> operation and reduce the utility company's workload, Wavelet based analysis software of circuit <b>breaker</b> operation is developed here. Combined with circuit <b>breaker</b> monitoring system, the analysis software processes the original circuit <b>breaker</b> information, speeds up the analysis time and provides stable and consistent evaluation for the circuit <b>breaker</b> operation...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new sensor for power {{monitoring}} that measures current flow in a circuit <b>breaker</b> without permanent {{modification of the}} <b>breaker</b> panel or the circuit <b>breaker</b> itself. The sensor consists of three parts: an inductive pickup for sensing current from the <b>breaker</b> face, an inductive link designed to transmit power through the steel <b>breaker</b> panel door, and a passive, balanced JFET modulator circuit for transmitting information through the inductive link. The demodulated <b>breaker</b> current signal is available outside of the <b>breaker</b> panel door. This sensor provides a solution for low-cost, non-intrusive retrofit of any circuit <b>breaker</b> panel for centralized power monitoring.

50|$|A <b>breaker</b> boy was a coal-mining {{worker in}} the United States and United Kingdom whose job was to {{separate}} impurities from coal by hand in a coal <b>breaker.</b> Although <b>breaker</b> boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as <b>breaker</b> boys. The use of <b>breaker</b> boys began in the mid-1860s.

In contrast to the circular shape of a cypher, competing crews can face each other in this line formation, challenge each other, and execute their burns (a move intended to humiliate the opponent, i.e. crotch grabbing).|$|E
