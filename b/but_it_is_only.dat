5|$|The {{earliest}} known sketch (№ 236) {{is made in}} graphite and {{is located}} in the Carl Larsson museum in Sundborn. It was dated by Karl Axel Arvidsson to a time shortly after the visit to Copenhagen in 1910. In July, Larsson started to paint a large version, which was finished in January 1911, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> preserved in a photograph. It is based on the early sketch but it presents a richer set of figures in the foreground. The early version was put on display in Nationalmuseum without receiving any official comments. There was no formal order and no official contest had been declared, and the initiative was only Larsson's.|$|E
5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer {{out from behind a}} wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E

At first she planned to starve herself to death in her husband's tomb, but she was seduced by a soldier guarding crucified corpses, and when one of these was stolen she offered the corpse of her husband as a replacement (110–112).|$|E
25|$|Diseases of the {{gallbladder}} {{have affected}} humans since antiquity, with gallstones {{found in the}} mummy of Princess Amenen of Thebes dating to 1500 BCE.

The existence of the gallbladder has been noted since the 5th century, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> relatively recently that the function and the diseases of the gallbladder has been documented, particularly in the last two centuries.|$|E
25|$|The monsoon of South Asia {{is among}} several {{geographically}} distributed global monsoons. It affects the Indian subcontinent, {{where it is}} one of the oldest and most anticipated weather phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from June through September, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> partly understood and notoriously difficult to predict. Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin, process, strength, variability, distribution, and general vagaries of the monsoon, but understanding and predictability are still evolving.|$|E

25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of migration from Ireland is recorded since early Medieval times, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> possible to quantify it from around 1700: since then between 9 and 10 million people born in Ireland have emigrated. This {{is more than}} the population of Ireland at its historical peak in the 1840s of 8.5 million. The poorest of them went to Great Britain, especially Liverpool; those who could afford it went further, including almost 5 million to the United States.|$|E
25|$|When {{dentures}} {{no longer}} fit well, the correct action {{is to seek}} follow-up care. Using denture adhesive may improve the fit, but it tends to work better when {{only a small amount}} is used as covering the denture fitting surface in adhesive makes it stay in less well. Adhesives may compensate for gradual loosening of a denture, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> a temporary solution; it does not solve the problem. Fortunately, dentures can often be relined with relining materials to restore the proper fit, and this process costs less than creation of new dentures. Overall, a well-made denture should last about 5 years or more.|$|E

He is {{all set to}} deny everything, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> Arabella, {{having only}} made it {{a few hundred yards}} instead of to Godalming. Micky, having warmed to Arabella, and moved by Paige's story of her accident, not to mention fear of his getting hurt too when Rudi returns, offers to take Arabella home in Rudi's favourite car, thereby setting Paige free. Justin gives Paige some money to get on her way, but by now he wants an escape from his own life. He persuades Paige to take him with her. They leave together, and the play ends just as Rudi's gangsters are trying to force their way through the door to a surprised Derek and Dee.|$|E

25|$|While {{there is}} no {{prohibition}} {{in the area of}} the didgeridoo's origin, such restrictions have been applied by other Indigenous communities. The didgeridoo was introduced to the Kimberleys almost a century ago <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> in the last decade that Aboriginal men have shown adverse reactions to women playing the instrument and prohibitions are especially evident in the South East of Australia. The belief that women are prohibited from playing is widespread among non-Aboriginal people and is also common among Aboriginal communities in Southern Australia; some ethnomusicologists believe that the dissemination of the Taboo belief and other misconceptions is a result of commercial agendas and marketing. Tourists generally rely on shop employees for information when purchasing a didgeridoo. Additionally, the majority of commercial didgeridoo recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non-Aboriginals playing a New Age style of music with liner notes promoting the instrument's spirituality which misleads consumers about the didgeridoo's secular role in traditional Aboriginal culture.|$|E
25|$|For a while, {{the dinner}} party {{proceeds}} smoothly. Inexperienced {{in the ways}} of the aristocracy, Myshkin is deeply impressed by the elegance and good humour of the company, unsuspicious of its superficiality. It turns out that one of those present—Ivan Petrovich—is a relative of his beloved benefactor Pavlishchev, and the Prince becomes extraordinarily enthusiastic. But when Ivan Petrovich mentions that Pavlishchev ended by giving up everything and going over to the Roman Church, Myshkin is horrified. He launches unexpectedly into a tirade against Catholicism, claiming that it preaches the Antichrist and in its quest for political supremacy has given birth to Atheism. Everyone present is shocked and several attempts are made to stop or divert him, but he only becomes more animated. At the height of his fervor, he begins waving his arms about and knocks over the priceless Chinese vase, smashing it to pieces. There is a lull as Myshkin emerges from his profound astonishment and the general horror turns to amusement and concern for his health; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> temporary, and he soon begins another spontaneous discourse, this time {{on the subject of the}} aristocracy in Russia, once again becoming oblivious to all attempts to quell his ardour. The speech is only brought to an end by the onset of an epileptic seizure: Aglaya, deeply distressed, catches him in her arms as he falls. He is taken home, having left a decidedly negative impression on the guests.|$|E

500|$|At one time, the Wolf {{lake was}} {{connected}} to Lake Michigan by a creek running through Hammond on the Indiana side, but the creek has long since been blocked by development. On the Illinois side, Wolf Lake empties into Indian Creek, which feeds into the Calumet River. [...] The Illinois and Indiana are separated by State Line Road, which is a road elsewhere along the border, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> represented by a rock-and-gravel dike that passes through the lake.

500|$|Adam Serwer from Mother Jones said, [...] "Django, {{like many}} Tarantino films, {{also has been}} criticized as cartoonishly violent, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> so when Django is killing slave owners and overseers.

This, if nothing else, puts Django in the running for Tarantino's best film, {{the first one in}} which he discovers violence as horror rather than just spectacle. When Schultz turns his head away from a slave being torn apart by dogs, Django explains to Calvin Candie—the plantation owner played by Leo DiCaprio—that Schultz just isn't used to Americans." ...|$|E
