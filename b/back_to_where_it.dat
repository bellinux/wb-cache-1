500|$|Sometime later, Amy and Rory are {{visited by}} River, {{shortly after the}} events of [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] in River's timeline. When Amy {{explains}} that she had recently witnessed the Doctor's death, River reveals that the Doctor lied {{when he said he}} told her his name; instead he had said [...] "Look into my eye". The Doctor had asked the Teselecta to masquerade as him at Lake Silencio, and the Doctor and his TARDIS had been miniaturised within it. Elsewhere, the Doctor takes Dorium's head <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was stored and explains that his perceived death will enable him to be forgotten as he had been getting [...] "too big" [...] and drawing too much attention. As the Doctor leaves, Dorium warns of the prophecies that still await him and the question which Dorium calls out after him: [...] "Doctor who?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, after a {{four-year}} disappearance, the Joker was revived (and revised) by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams. Beginning with Batman #251's [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", the character {{returns to his}} roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman. This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character. O'Neil said his idea was [...] "simply to take it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> started. I went to the DC library and {{read some of the}} early stories. I tried {{to get a sense of}} what Kane and Finger were after." [...] O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the idea of the Joker being legally insane, to explain why the character is sent to Arkham Asylum (introduced by O'Neil in 1974 as Arkham Hospital) instead of to prison. Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} release of the Quake II engine, Epic Games had {{unveiled}} its own Unreal Engine. The Unreal Engine was more realistic than Quake II and was better suited to producing open spaces—3D Realms had been struggling to render the Nevada desert. Soon after E3, a programmer suggested that they make the switch. After discussions, the developers unanimously agreed to the change, which would mean scrapping much of their work so far, including significant changes 3D Realms had made to the Quake Engine. In June 1998, 14 months after the Quake II announcement, 3D Realms made the switch announcement. Broussard said that the game would not be [...] "significantly delayed" [...] by the switch, but that the project would be <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was at E3 [...] "within a month to six weeks". Broussard also said that no content seen in the E3 trailer would be lost. Chris Hargrove, one of the game's programmers at the time, confided that the change amounted to a complete reboot of the project.|$|E
500|$|Thau explained, [...] "I {{worked on}} Ladyhawke and that's how I really met Dick [...] and Tom Mankiewicz. I {{used to hear}} those {{wonderful}} stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about Superman and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'". Donner commented, [...] "There are a few shots where Chris 's costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> should be." [...] Thau {{wanted to make the}} film shorter: [...] "I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem [...] when they're flying around. I also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action… It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn't want to take [...] out [...] the poem." [...] It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing [...] "bare bones" [...] editions of Superman II, Superman III, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray. Also available (with other films) is the nine-disc [...] "Christopher Reeve Superman Collection" [...] and the 14-disc [...] "Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Dorothy Hobson has {{discussed}} {{the use of}} older female characters in British soap opera {{as a means of}} providing comedy. She compares Ethel and Dot's function in EastEnders to the trio of Ena Sharples, Minnie Caldwell and Martha Longhurst from Coronation Street with regard to providing humour. She has noted that following Ethel's retirement from the serial, the production team at EastEnders attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel's friendship by introducing a number of [...] "'friends' to fulfill the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series." [...] An example of this was the character Lilly Mattock (Barbara Keogh) who appeared between 1998 and 1999. [...] The author goes on to note that Ethel's role in Dot's narrative was difficult to replace because [...] "far from being complete stereotypes, their relationships depend on them being long-standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce. For the characters to 'work', {{there is a need for}} unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other's lives. They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience." [...] Brown has spoken about the [...] "wonderful rapport" [...] she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel. She added, [...] "I do miss Ethel, it was great with Dot and Ethel. They did try and stop us working together at one time, but the producer changed and it all went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> started." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Loria took control, {{he let it}} {{be known}} that Brochu's low-budget approach—or as he called it, [...] "business as usual"—was over. [...] He promised to rebuild the Expos with [...] "a winning {{attitude}} and winning players" [...] in an effort to bring the team <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> had been only six years earlier. To that end, he drafted a new partnership agreement that gave him the right to call for cash investments in exchange for team equity—an option that had been unavailable to Brochu. Most of the minority partners, though, continued to treat their participation as a public-relations gesture and remained uninterested in investing additional money. When Loria issued a cash call in May 2000, the only other partners to increase their contributions were Coutu, Loblaw, and Stephen Bronfman. [...] Rather than contribute more money, the minority partners proposed trading Guererro. [...] Loria instantly vetoed this suggestion.|$|E

[...] Bill stepped back and sent a beautiful long pass to 'Stan' Wells. [...] The pigskin came sailing through the air on a perfect line, Wells grabbed it and ran for a touchdown. [...] Instantly the small Michigan rooting contingent rose as one man and cheered until their voices failed. [...] Then Umpire Crowell asked for the ball. [...] It was handed him, and he walked <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> had been put in play and told the Michiganders to start anew.
