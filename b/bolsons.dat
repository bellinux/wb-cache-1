Mr. Jones requested that we determine water budgets in both the Igneous and parts of West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifer. METHODS: To determine the water budgets in the Culberson County GCD area, we used the GAM for the Igneous {{and parts of the}} West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifers and ran a standard transient calibration-verification model run, which includes the years 1980 to 1999. The portions of the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifer included in the GAM are Wildhorse Flat, Michigan Flat, Ryan Flat, and Lobo Flat and are locally referred to as being part of the Salt Basin Bolson aquifer. In this report, to avoid confusion with other parts of the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifer, we refer to the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifer modeled in this GAM as the Salt Basin Bolson aquifer. The pumpage that we used in the model run was that which was developed for the transient calibration/verification run, which represents the best estimate of historic pumpage. PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS: • See Beach and others (2004) for assumptions and limitations of the GAM for the Igneous and West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifers. • The mean absolute error (a measure of the difference between simulated and actual water levels during model calibration) in the entire GAM for the period of 1990 to 2000 is 64 feet, or four percent of the range of measured water levels (Beach and others, 2004). • The model includes three layers, representing the Salt Basin Bolson aquife...|$|E
40|$|Mr. Jones {{requested}} a Groundwater Availability Model (GAM) run using the GAM for the Igneous {{and parts of}} the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifers. Mr. Jones requested that we evaluate the impact of pumpage on water levels in the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifer. METHODS: To determine the impacts of pumping on water levels in the Culberson County GCD, we used the GAM for the Igneous {{and parts of the}} West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifers and increased pumpage to the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifer incrementally, essentially providing a “sensitivity analysis ” of water levels to pumpage. The portions of the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifer included the GAM are Wildhorse Flat, Michigan Flat, Ryan Flat, and Lobo Flat and are locally referred to as being part of the Salt Basin Bolson aquifer. To avoid confusion with other parts of the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifer, we refer to the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifer in this GAM as the Salt Basin Bolson aquifer in this report. The baseline pumpage that we used in the predictive runs was the year 2000 estimated historic pumpage from the transient calibration/verification run. This year was the last of the historic pumpage estimates and therefore was considered to be the most accurate recent pumpage estimate for the model area. The year 2000 baseline pumpage was repeated for each year in the predictive model runs. We added an additional zero to two acre-feet per acre per year in all of Culberson County to this baseline pumpage for our predictive model runs. It {{is important to note that}} many model cells in the Salt Basin Bolson aquifers contained significant pumpage in the 2000 historic pumpage estimate. When creating uniform pumpage rates for the predictive runs, we only changed the pumpage in a model cell if the existing pumpage was less than the desired uniform pumpage rate. For those cells with higher rates of pumping in the baseline 2000 pumpage data set than what was desired in the model run, the existing pumpage was used. In these model runs, only the Salt Basin Bolson aquifer was evaluated. This was done for two reasons. First, most of the Igneous aquifer in Culberson County began the predictiv...|$|E

40|$|The Hueco and Mesilla <b>Bolsons</b> {{are part}} of the intramountain basins of the Rio Grande Rift system. These <b>bolsons</b> are the primary source of {{groundwater}} for the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez metropolitan area and contain faults that show evidence of repeated earthquakes during the Quaternary. The region is also associated with has low-level (M 3 ̆c 4) seismicity. The collection and analysis of precision gravity data, coupled with information from water wells, multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) studies and previously published seismic reflection lines, have been used to examine the structure and faulting within these bolson. This study reveals that the Hueco and Mesilla <b>Bolsons</b> are very different structurally. The southern Mesilla Bolson contains about 500 m of sediment. Faults are difficult to trace and have less than 50 - 100 m of displacement across them. The southernmost bolson contains numerous Tertiary intrusions and the thickness of Cretaceous bedrock appears to decrease from south to north, possibly delineating the edge of Laramide age deformation within the bolson. The northern Hueco Bolson contains 1800 to 2500 m of basin fill. Displacement along the East Franklin Mountains fault (EFMF), a fault with evidence for repeated earthquakes within the past 64, 000 years, is about 1500 m, and displacement on intrabasin faults is 200 - 300 m. Several intrabasin faults appear to control the saline to freshwater contact within the bolson. The EFMF may extend over 30 km south of the end of its mapped trace {{at the end of the}} Franklin Mountains and a number of intrabasin faults also extend south into the urbanized regions of the study area. The EFMF and other basin structures appear to be offset or disrupted at the speculated edge of Laramide deformation that lies beneath the bolson. Horizontal Gradient Methods (HGM) were applied to the gravity data and were successful for tracing faults and older Laramide features within the Hueco Bolson beneath the urbanized regions of the cities. HGM were not as successful at tracing faults within the Mesilla Bolson, however they were helpful for tracing the subsurface extent of igneous intrusions including the Mt. Cristo Rey, River, Three Sisters, and the Westerner outcrops. Some of these features appear linked at depth by a series of dikes and faults. MASW data were used to determine the average shear wave velocity in the upper 30 m (Vs 30) at ∼ 70 sites within the Hueco Bolson. These observations were combined with similar data collected previously in Juarez to produce regional velocity and site classification maps. The results show low velocities are found close to the river within fluvial deposits with higher velocities close to the Franklin Mountains where bedrock is close to the surface and higher velocities in upland regions of northeast El Paso were soils appear to be more highly cemented. These data will be used in conjunction with information on bolson geometries to model the expected effects of strong ground motion from earthquakes in the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez region. ...|$|E
40|$|We ran the {{groundwater}} availability {{model for the}} Igneous {{and parts of the}} West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> aquifers for a 60 -year predictive simulation using a specified baseline pumpage (the 2000 estimated historic pumpage from the original model) and average recharge rates. The results of this model run indicate that water levels decline significantly in the Salt Basin Bolson Aquifer throughout much of the model area. These water level declines are the greatest in southern Culberson County, presumably around an area of higher pumpage in the baseline pumpage data set. The model results also indicate that water levels in the underlying Igneous Aquifer also decline in this area, due to the upward movement of groundwater in response to this same pumpage stress. In addition, declines were observed in the Igneous Aquifer around the town of Alpine. An area of significant recovery was observed in Jeff Davis County west of the town of Fort Davis, presumably in response to the recovery after a large amount of pumpage that occurred during the historic transient calibration-verification model run.

In the northwest Hueco bolson (basin), in west Texas, and in the southern Tularosa and Mesilla <b>bolsons</b> of New Mexico, sets of longitudinal depressions join to form large closed linear troughs. In the Hueco and Tularosa <b>bolsons</b> the lengths of these features can be up to 30 km (19 mi) long, and widths can be 1, 200 m (4000 ft) or greater. The troughs have subtle but significant topographic expression when viewed on aerial photos and from the air, and are marked by lines of vegetation concentrated at their lowest elevation. They are asymmetric in cross section. The large linear troughs have been interpreted and mapped as a series of intrabasin westward tilted fault blocks, with age of most recent movement within the last 0. 5 m. y. Speculation about the origin of these troughs has included faulting, subsidence, and paleo stream channels. More than one process is involved. The investigations in this study indicate that in addition to apparent faulting, adjustments including piping, and fissure collapse, have been and are now taking place {{along the length of the}} troughs. Those adjustments act to offset the effects of aeolian processes, preserving the troughs over time as areas of depression. Several minable sand and gavel deposits have been located within these troughs. Field evidence indicates that these deposits were in place prior to deformation. The pattern of growth and development of El Paso over the last 50 years has been toward the east, into the Hueco basin. There has been more recent encroachment further east, and also west of the Franklin Mountains. Aeolian transport of sediments is the dominant recent geomorphologic process shaping the three basins in question andhas been for some time in the past, but troughs in these basins have remained unfilled over time. It was important in this study from an engineering geology standpoint of construction development, to identify the mechanisms acting to maintain the topographic expression of the troughs in the basin...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{presents}} hydraulic {{evidence for}} the interbasin circulation of ground water through carbonate rocks of Paleozoic age at the Nevada Test Site. An integral part of this evidence is the discovery that aquifers in alluvium and tuff, formerly {{thought to be the}} principal aquifers at the Test Site, are semiperched above a thick tuffaceous aquiclude that separates them from the carbonate rocks. This paper is based on one of the studies being made by the GeologicalSurvey for the Atomic Energy Commission. These studies seek to evaluatethe risk that may arise if ground water should be contaminated as a resultof underground nuclear detonations at the Test Site. In summary, the movement of ground water in the valley fill and the tuffs beneath the <b>bolsons</b> of the Nevada Test Site is vertically downward into the Paleozoic carbonate rocks. The ground water moves laterally in the carbonate rocks beneath all three basins toward discharge areas, presumably to the southwest. Ground-water flow beneath some intermontane basins differs significantly from the usual picture of flow down the axis of an intermontane valley to a spill point at one end or flow to discharge areas within the basin, such as playas or springs...|$|E
40|$|The Groundwater Availability Model (GAM) for the Igneous {{and parts}} of the West Texas <b>Bolsons</b> (Salt Basin) {{aquifers}} was used to estimate drawdowns over a fifty year time period in Jeff Davis and Presidio counties when pumping at the year 2000 rates. Drawdowns for average and drought-of-record recharge conditions were also compared. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this modeling study. • The use of drought-of-record recharge has negligible impact on the results of the modeling in the Salt Basin aquifer when compared to the use of average recharge. This is because the GAM assumes that the Salt Basin aquifer receives no direct recharge from precipitation; therefore, drought-of-record recharge has virtually no effect on water levels in this aquifer. • The use of drought-of-record recharge has minimal impact on the results of the modeling in the Igneous aquifer when compared to the use of average recharge. The difference in water levels and drawdowns between the average and drought-of-record recharge runs was less than ten feet for most of the area, except {{in the heart of the}} Davis Mountains where there is no pumpage in the model. • Drawdowns in the Salt Basin aquifer were much higher in Jeff Davis County than in Presidio County. This is because of pumpage in Culberson County which impacted water levels in the northern portion of the Salt Basin aquifer in Jef...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater {{represents}} an important supply source for municipal and irrigation uses in Far West Texas. The City of El Paso receives about 50 {{percent of its}} municipal water supply from surface water and 50 percent from local groundwater. Groundwater pumping in El Paso is from the Hueco <b>Bolson</b> and the Mesilla <b>Bolson.</b> Historic groundwater pumping in the Texas portion of the Mesilla <b>Bolson</b> has not resulted in significant changes in groundwater levels or groundwater quality in existing wells. ^ Historic pumping in the Hueco <b>Bolson</b> has resulted in lowered groundwater levels and brackish groundwater intrusion. The groundwater level declines {{have resulted in the}} intrusion of brackish groundwater into areas that historically pumped fresh groundwater. A 1979 assessment concluded that El Paso would deplete fresh groundwater in the Hueco <b>Bolson</b> by 2030 if groundwater pumping continued to increase. Partly {{as a result of the}} 1979 assessment, El Paso reduced its groundwater pumping from the Hueco <b>Bolson</b> by increasing surface water diversions from the Rio Grande, increasing conservation efforts, and increasing reclaimed water use. As a result, groundwater levels in many parts of the Hueco <b>Bolson</b> have stabilized. ^ Brackish groundwater intrusion remains an issue, and is being addressed with a brackish groundwater desalination plant, currently under construction. The new wells and existing wells that will supply this desalination plant will also assist in the management of brackish groundwater intrusion by intercepting the brackish groundwater before it can flow towards existing fresh groundwater wells. ^ The 2006 Far West Texas Regional Water Plan contemplates a groundwater transfer project to meet increasing demands in El Paso County beginning about 2030, mostly from the Dell City area in Hudspeth County, Texas. Groundwater management in the Dell City area is governed by a groundwater conservation district that has established limits on groundwater pumping based on existing and historic uses. Groundwater pumping for irrigation began in the Dell City area in 1948, and groundwater levels have been essentially stable for since the 1980 s. Future planning for a groundwater transfer project will require a detailed understanding of the hydrogeology of the groundwater in the Dell City area. ...|$|R
