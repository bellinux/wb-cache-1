25|$|Dive {{lights are}} {{critical}} safety equipment, {{as it is}} dark inside caves. Each diver generally carries a primary light, {{and at least one}} backup light. A minimum of three lights is recommended. The primary light should last the planned duration of the dive, as should the <b>backup</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
25|$|New grilles and four-segmented {{taillights}} {{highlighted the}} facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side {{rear view mirror}} and <b>backup</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lights: Each cave diver {{should have}} at least three {{independent}} sources of light. One is considered the primary and is intended for general use during the dive. The others are considered <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> and may be lower powered as they are not intended for exploration. Each light must have an expected burn time of at least the planned duration of the dive. If any diver loses light function so that they have fewer than three working lights, protocol requires that the dive is turned for all members of the dive team and exit started immediately.|$|E

5|$|The Mystic Seaport Light {{is subject}} to United States Coast Guard {{regulations}} to become operational, {{and because it is}} a full-sized replica of a lighthouse, requirements include supervisory schedules and installation of an emergency, <b>backup</b> <b>light.</b> This was not a financial priority for Mystic Seaport in 1967 and it was not made a fully functional lighthouse.|$|R
50|$|Most jurisdictions {{mandate that}} people with disabilities must have unassisted use of the station. This is {{resolved}} with elevators, taking {{a number of people}} from street level to the unpaid ticketing area, and then from the paid area to the platform. In addition, there will be stringent requirements for emergencies, with <b>backup</b> <b>lighting,</b> emergency exits and alarm systems installed and maintained. Stations are a critical part of the evacuation route for passengers escaping from a disabled or troubled train.|$|R
25|$|The 1965 Chevrolet Chevy II and Nova were {{updated with}} cleaner {{front-end}} styling {{courtesy of a}} fresh full-width grille with new integrated headlight bezels. Parking lights moved down to the deep-section bumper, and sedans gained a new roofline. Taillight and <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> were restyled, as was the rear cove. The 1965 Chevy II came in entry-level 100 form or as the posher Nova 400, each in three body styles. The Nova Super Sport came as a Sport Coupe only, and its production dipped to just 9,100 cars. Super Sports had a new brushed-chrome console with floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission or Powerglide automatic, but a column-mounted three-speed manual remained standard. Bucket seats wore textured vinyl trim, and the dashboard held ammeter, oil pressure, and temperature gauges.|$|E
2500|$|Divers {{engaging}} in penetration diving are conventionally taught to carry three lights - a primary light and two <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> - thereby virtually eliminating {{the risk of}} completely losing light inside the wreck. [...] Nonetheless, total loss of visibility due to a silt-out remains a risk.|$|E
2500|$|The Eighty Eight {{was given}} a mild {{facelift}} in 1990, eschewing the former chromed grille for a body-colored fascia with four slots and the Oldsmobile Rocket logo. [...] In the rear, new taillights and <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> extended across the body; once again, chrome trim was deleted. Minor revisions were also made to the interior. Part of the door panel was revised and 1990 also offered new cloth for the seats. The Pillow Cushion seats on the Brougham were deleted. A revised armrest console was also added, this one provided more room. As an option was a revised electronic climate control system. A new choice of alloy wheels was an option.|$|E
50|$|Play was {{interrupted}} for 34 minutes {{because of a}} 22-minute partial power outage. Emergency generators provided <b>backup</b> <b>lighting.</b> The fire department (NOFD) rescued people from elevator seven, but other elevators {{were brought to the}} ground uneventfully. Attendees used double the usual amount of data for their cell phones. AT&T reported 78 gigabytes (GB) downloaded from 8 to 9 PM, about double from the peak the year before. NFL chief security officer Jeffrey Miller attributed fans' calmness to their preoccupation with their electronics.|$|R
2500|$|If the freediver is {{penetrating}} the cave {{so far that}} surface light is lost, proper navigation and passage recognition is vital along with a <b>backup</b> dive <b>light.</b>|$|R
25|$|Changes {{were again}} modest: Five smaller front fender vents {{replaced}} the three larger ones, and flat-finish rockers sans ribbing conferred a lower, less chunky appearance. New {{was a single}} <b>backup</b> <b>light,</b> mounted above the license plate. The previous models' wheel covers gave way to slotted six-inch Rally wheels with chrome beauty rings and lug nuts concealed behind chrome caps. Interior alterations were modest and included revised upholstery, and the handbrake moved from beneath the dash to between the seats. The convertible's optional hardtop was offered with a black vinyl cover, which was a fad among all cars at the time.|$|R
2500|$|The LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, {{moving the}} turn signal {{indicators}} {{to the front}} bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. Interestingly, the front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> and different trim. [...] The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. [...] Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was [...] "1970-something" [...] meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The 1972 {{model year}} VAM models {{incorporated}} the same engineering revisions and upgrades of the U.S. market AMC-built counterparts. Engines {{were the same}} as the year before with a one-barrel 145hp 232 as standard on the sedans and automatic wagon and the two-barrel 155hp version for the manual wagon. All featured a front sway bar as standard equipment. The 1972 models also included a new plastic grille with a revised hood latch, along with a new tail light design with larger <b>backup</b> <b>lights,</b> a new optional wheel cover design, a third AM radio model (shared with the VAM Javelin), and new interior door panels with a wood imitation rectangular portion. This was also {{the first year of the}} seatbelt warning buzzer located above the light and wiper knobs. The Camioneta Rambler American featured the Chrysler-built TorqueFlite A904 automatic transmission, replacing the previous Borg-Warner [...] "Shift-Command" [...] units.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 models {{received}} a facelift. Large wraparound taillamps {{went into a}} new rear end with standard <b>backup</b> <b>lights.</b> [...] "What you'll see inside," [...] claimed the sales brochure for the 1967 Chevelle, [...] "will probably bring on a severe compulsion to go driving." [...] Front disc brakes were available on all models, and a new dual master cylinder brake system incorporated a warning light. [...] Chevrolet also added 14" [...] wheels and a three speed automatic transmission to their line of transmissions. New safety equipment became standard, including a collapsible steering column. The SS396 continued as its own series with both sport coupe and convertible body styles. The 375-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 was dropped from the options list {{until late in the}} model year and returned with 612 being sold. Seven transmissions were available: two manual three-speeds, two manual four-speeds, an overdrive three-speed, and two automatics. The manual-shift feature of the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was featured. Options included Superlift air shock absorbers, Strato-ease headrests, and special instrumentation.|$|E
50|$|Dual {{lighting}} {{is a system}} in which a structure is equipped with white strobes for daytime use, and red lights for nighttime use. In urban areas, these are commonly preferred since it usually exempts a structure from the requirement of having to be painted. One advantage to the dual system is that when the uppermost red lights fail, the lighting switches onto its <b>backup</b> <b>lighting</b> system, which uses the white strobes (at its night intensity) for nighttime. In the United States and Canada, red incandescent beacons are slowly being withdrawn from service and being replaced with red strobes or red LEDs.|$|R
5000|$|In modern usage {{the plural}} form [...] "candelabra" [...] is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} singular sense, with the true singular form [...] "candelabrum" [...] becoming rare. Likewise, [...] "candelabra" [...] and [...] "candelabras" [...] are preferred over [...] "candelabrums" [...] as the plural form.Although the electrification of indoor lighting has relegated candleholders {{to the status of}} <b>backup</b> <b>light</b> sources in most homes and other buildings, interior designers continue to model light fixtures and lighting accessories after candelabra and candlesticks. Accordingly, the term [...] "candelabra" [...] has entered common use as a collective term for small-based incandescent light bulbs used in chandeliers and other lighting fixtures made for decoration as well as lighting.|$|R
5000|$|The 1956 through 1958 A8 Checkers {{featured}} single headlights, 1953 Chevrolet taillights, and a thick, single-bar grille. In 1958, quad headlights became {{legal in}} the U.S., and Checkers featured the quad headlights {{from that time}} forward, along with a new egg-crate grille insert. Parking lights were housed in each {{far side of the}} grille insert. Taillights were also changed to the familiar vertical chrome strip housing dual red lenses. Early models also featured a single separate bumper-mounted <b>backup</b> <b>light.</b> Another change between the A8 and later models is the rear window. Originally flat in the A8 with a thicker [...] "C" [...] pillar, the rear window on later models wrapped around a thinner roof-line, affording improved all-around visibility.|$|R
2500|$|Standard {{convenience}} equipment {{included a}} two-tone padded dashboard with a three-pod instrument cluster, electric windshield wipers and washers, a 200km/h speedometer, side marker lights, four-way hazard lights, antitheft steering column locking mechanism, base steering wheel, brake system warning light, AM radio {{with a single}} in-dash speaker, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, locking glove box with [...] "RAMBLER" [...] emblem on the door, padded sunvisors, day/night rearview mirror, cardboard-type sound-absorbing and heat-isolating headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, flip-open rear side vents, full carpeting, driver's side rubber floor mat sewed to the carpet, front bench seat with split folding backs on two-door sedan or with a fixed back on the four-door, bench rear seat, two-point front seatbelts, dual rear ashtrays, front and rear side armrests, vinyl-cloth upholstery on seats and side door panels, aluminum grille, <b>backup</b> <b>lights,</b> steel wheels with center hubcaps, dual [...] "232 SIX" [...] rear quarter panel emblems, dual [...] "bulleye" [...] emblems on the lower corner of the rear side vents, script [...] "American" [...] emblems on both front fenders, capital-lettered [...] "RAMBLER" [...] rectangular emblem between the right taillight and the gas filler, non-locking gas cap, manual driver's side remote mirror, and radio antenna.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 Caprice {{received}} a restyling with more rounded body lines and revised grilles and taillights, optional front fender corner lamps which illuminated with the headlamps, {{as well as}} a revised instrument panel with round instruments and a new steering wheel. Taillight lenses were all red as the <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> were relocated into the rear bumper, unlike in the lesser full-size models that had their backup lamps {{in the center of the}} taillights. A dual-master brake cylinder was now included, while front disc brakes were optional. Other new options included a stereo 8-track tape player, power door locks, and a fiber optic exterior light monitoring system. The same seating selections continued as before with revisions to trim patterns plus the new addition of all-vinyl upholstery as a no-cost option for conventional and Strato bench seats in sedans and coupes. Engines and transmission offerings were carried over from the previous year. The exception was the optional [...] Turbo Jet V8 was no longer listed, leaving the [...] 427 as the top engine. The three-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission that previously only available with the [...] and [...] V8s was now optional with the [...] Turbo Fire V8. As with all 1967 cars sold in the U.S., Caprices featured occupant protection safety features that included an energy-absorbing steering column, soft or recessed interior control knobs, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, small block engine {{displacement}} increased from [...] to , though output remained the same. All other engines and transmission choices remained unchanged {{from the previous}} year, though the L30 base engine was now the ZQ3 and the L79 motor was redesignated the L46. All cars featured [...] steel wheels (increased from 7inches). Tire size remained the same, although {{this was the first}} year for optional white lettered tires and the last for red striped tires. Carried over from the previous year were seven available rear axle ratios ranging from 2.73 to 4.56. Standard ratio remained 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. The optional Positraction rear axle, mandated on many engine/gearbox combinations, was installed on more than 95% of the cars. [...] "Stingray" [...] script nameplates appeared on front fenders, now one word, in contrast to the “Sting Ray” name used previously. Exterior door handles were redesigned so the finger plate would actuate the door, eliminating the separate release button. <b>Backup</b> <b>lights</b> were integrated into the inboard taillights, headlight washers were added, and front grilles were made all black. Side mounted exhausts and front fender vent trim were options for this year only. On the inside, revised door panels provided additional shoulder room in the C3's tighter cabin and headrests became standard. Steering wheel diameter was reduced from 16 to 15inches to permit easier entry and exit, the ignition switch was moved from the dash to the steering column, and map pockets were added to the dash area in front of the passenger seat. Accounting for 57% of the cars, coupes with their removable roof panels, began a trend of outselling roadsters. An extended production cycle due to a labor dispute increased '69 volume. This was the last year for the L88 engine and the only year for the ZL1 option, which offered an all-aluminum [...] big-block engine listed at [...] Rare options: ZL1 aluminum block (2), J56 heavy-duty brakes (115), L88 engine (116), L89 aluminum heads (390).|$|E
2500|$|The 1970 Javelins {{featured}} a new front-end design {{with a wide}} [...] "twin-venturi" [...] front grille incorporating the headlamps and a longer hood. It also had a new rear end with full-width taillamps and a single center-mounted <b>backup</b> <b>light.</b> This was a one-year-only design. Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. The exterior rear view mirror {{featured a}} new [...] "aero" [...] design {{and in some cases}} matched the car's body color. The three [...] "Big Bad" [...] exterior paints continued to be optional on the 1970 Javelins, but they now came with regular chrome bumpers. Underneath the restyle was a new front suspension featuring ball joints, upper and lower control arms, coil springs, and shock absorbers above the upper control arms, as well as trailing struts on the lower control arms.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999: For the {{beginning}} of this model year, the DOHC 3.5 L [...] "Shortstar" [...] engine was standard in the top-line GLS and optional on mid-level GL and base GX models. Early GLS models could be ordered with the 3.8L instead of the standard (for GLS) 3.5 L, but later on the 3.8 L was phased out and the 3.5 L became standard on all models. Decklids now wore a small Oldsmobile badge. In the previous model year, there was a complaint that some people couldn't tell that Intrigues were Oldsmobiles. If you look closely, you can read 'Oldsmobile' molded in the <b>backup</b> <b>light</b> lens in the taillight housing on all model years. All models now got a thicker, leather-wrapped steering wheel. New to the option list was GM's OnStar emergency/communications system. Integrated rear radio antenna was standard this year and after.|$|R
2500|$|American Motors 1970 AMX {{advertising}} headlined, [...] "We {{made the}} AMX look tougher {{this year because}} it's tougher this year". They were mildly facelifted resembling the first two model years, but the changes were different {{enough to be a}} separate design for 1970. Featured was a new front end design with a longer hood that had a “power blister” with two large openings. These were a functional cold ram-air induction system with the popular [...] "Go Package" [...] available with the 360 and 390 engines. The new grille was flush and full-width incorporating the headlamps. The revised rear end also featured full-width taillamps and a single center mounted <b>backup</b> <b>light.</b> Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. Riding on the same wheelbase [...] as before, the changes increased the AMX's overall body length by about two inches (51 millimeters) to [...]|$|R
50|$|There {{was a small}} {{redesign}} on taillights {{with the}} <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> in the lower section. This was {{the last year for}} the 131.5 in wheelbase chassis for the New Yorker.|$|E
50|$|Small snoopy loops {{made from}} bicycle inner tubes {{are used to}} prevent <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> clipped to a dive harness from dangling, and large loops from car tubes are used to stow hoses against sling or sidemount cylinders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>lights</b> are {{generally}} clipped {{to the shoulder}} D-rings and held against the shoulder straps by rubber bands cut from bicycle inner tubes. Other methods are possible, but the inner tubes work and are easily replaced when they wear out.|$|E
50|$|In 1969 {{the light}} was {{electrified}} and connected to mains electricity, with a 120 V battery bank as <b>backup.</b> The current <b>light</b> source is a 120 V, 1000 W, quartz halogen lamp.|$|R
50|$|The airport {{served as}} a {{satellite}} of nearby McChord Field during World War II, and commercial aviation history at the Olympia Airport extends to the 1920s. The airport now supports large business jets, cargo aircraft, military helicopters and has a <b>backup</b> runway <b>lighting</b> system for uninterrupted operations. Olympia Airport also has an Instrument Landing System and backup power system for operations during bad weather or low visibility.|$|R

50|$|The body {{featured}} a full 12-volt electrical system. It supplied power to concealed four-beam headlights, parking/marker lights, brake lights, <b>backup</b> <b>lights,</b> electric windshield wipers, a single-speed heater blower, and a radio/public address system. With this equipment, the Boilermaker Special III {{was capable of}} day or night operation on most improved roads, including highways.|$|E
2500|$|The 1956 Bel Air {{received}} a face-lift {{with a more}} conventional full-width grille, pleasing those customers who didn't favor the Ferrari-inspired '55 front end. Distinctive two-tone bodyside treatments and graceful front and rear wheel openings completed the [...] "speedline" [...] restyling. Single housings incorporated the taillight, stoplight, and <b>backup</b> <b>light,</b> and the left one held the gas filler - an idea popularized on Cadillacs. Among the seven Bel Air models was a new Sport Sedan, a pillarless four-door hardtop that looked handsome with all the windows rolled down and allowed easy entry into the back seat. Production exceeded 103,000, compared to 128,000 two-door hardtops. Shapely two-door Nomad wagons topped the price chart at $2,608, but now carried the same interior and rear-wheel sheetmetal as other Bel Airs, lacking the original's unique trim. Only 7,886 were built. The least costly Bel Air, at $2,025, was the two-door sedan. Seatbelts, shoulder harnesses, and a padded dashboard were available, and full-size cars could even get the hot Corvette 225-horsepower engine. In 1956 sales material there was an optional rain-sensing automatic top, which was first seen on the 1951 LaSabre concept car. However, {{it is believed that}} it was never installed on a car. Popular Mechanics reported only 7.4% of owners in their survey ordered seat belts.|$|R
5000|$|For 1966, the 390-cubic-inch V8's {{power was}} {{increased}} to [...] The larger 428-cubic-inch (7.0 L) V-8 became optional, rated at 345 gross horsepower (257.4 kW) {{and providing a}} notable improvement in 0-60 acceleration to about 9 seconds.

A flatter hood, re-shaped front fenders, new headlight buckets, new egg crate grille with large Thunderbird emblem, new bumper guards, a single bumper bar, and painted roll pan replaced the previous two model year's two-piece front bumper. The rear taillights were revised, now a 3 piece unit going the full width across the rear, the <b>backup</b> <b>light</b> now located in the center section replaced the formerly rear roll pan mounted lamps. A new Town Hardtop model was offered, featured a roof with blind quarter panels for a more 'formal' look (at the cost of rear visibility). The Landau {{was replaced by the}} blind quarter formal roofed Town Landau, which retained the previous model's padded roof and landau S-bars. It became by far the best-selling model, accounting for 35,105 of the 1966 model's 69,176 sales. The transmission used on early build 390 V8 equipped T-Birds was the Cruise-O-Matic MX, however late build 390 and all 428 V8 equipped T-Birds had the new C6 3 speed automatic installed.|$|R
