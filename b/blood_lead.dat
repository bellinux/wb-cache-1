5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
5|$|High <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> {{levels in}} adults are also {{associated}} with decreases in cognitive performance and with psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. It {{was found in a}} large group of current and former inorganic lead workers in Korea that <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels in the range of 20–50μg/dL were correlated with neuro-cognitive defects. Increases in <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels from about 50 to about 100μg/dL in adults {{have been found to be}} associated with persistent, and possibly permanent, impairment of central nervous system function.|$|E
5|$|In adults, <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels {{steadily}} {{increase with}} increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and {{may be more likely}} to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E

5000|$|An 8 {{year old}} {{message in a}} bottle, written in <b>blood,</b> <b>leads</b> Detective Carl Morck and his {{assistant}} Assad {{to a series of}} child abductions from religious communities throughout Denmark. The majority of these abductions have not been reported for some reason, {{and some of them are}} suspected to have ended in murder.|$|R
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{in young children}} {{has been linked to}} learning disabilities, and children with <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> concentrations greater than 10μg/dL are in danger of developmental disabilities. Increased <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> level in children has been correlated with decreases in intelligence, nonverbal reasoning, short-term memory, attention, reading and arithmetic ability, fine motor skills, emotional regulation, and social engagement.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels lower than 5μg/dL. <b>Blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels. Between the <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E
5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> level {{can lead}} to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able {{to pass through the}} placenta and into breast milk, and <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|Visceral {{fat cells}} will release their {{metabolic}} by-products in the portal circulation, where the <b>blood</b> <b>leads</b> {{straight to the}} liver. Thus, the excess of triglycerides and fatty acids created by the visceral fat cells will go into the liver and accumulate there. In the liver, most {{of it will be}} stored as fat. This concept is known as 'lipotoxicity'.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} known for many years that the eating of leaded paint is the prime cause of lead {{poisoning}} and elevated <b>blood</b> <b>leads</b> of children living in deteriorated housing. Recently, there has been speculation that children may eat dirt and dust contaminated with lead exhausted from cars and that this amount of ingested lead is sufficient to contribute significantly to the childhood lead problem...|$|R
5000|$|The {{damage to}} small <b>blood</b> vessels <b>leads</b> to a microangiopathy, {{which can cause}} {{one or more of}} the following: ...|$|R
5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. <b>Blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned leaded gasoline additives, <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization {{state that}} a <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> level of 10μg/dL or above {{is a cause}} for concern; however, lead may impair {{development}} and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, {{and there is no}} known safe exposure level. Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels higher than 10μg/dL.|$|E
5000|$|An overactive Renin-angiotensin system {{leads to}} {{vasoconstriction}} {{and retention of}} sodium and water. The increase in <b>blood</b> volume <b>leads</b> to hypertension.|$|R
50|$|Another {{common cause}} is after heart surgery, when incompletely drained <b>blood</b> can <b>lead</b> to an {{inflammatory}} response that causes exudative pleural fluid.|$|R
5000|$|In {{emergency}} situations, care {{is directed}} at stopping blood loss, maintaining plasma volume, correcting disorders in coagulation induced by cirrhosis, and appropriate use of antibiotics such as quinolones or ceftriaxone. Blood volume resuscitation should be done promptly and with caution. The goal should be hemodynamic stability and hemoglobin of over 8 g/dl. Resuscitation of all lost <b>blood</b> <b>leads</b> to increase in portal pressure leading to more bleeding. Volume resuscitation can also worsen ascites and increase portal pressure. (AASLD guidelines) ...|$|R
5|$|The levels found {{today in}} {{most people are}} orders of {{magnitude}} greater than those of pre-industrial society. Due to reductions of lead in products and the workplace, acute lead poisoning is rare in most countries today, but low level lead exposure is still common. It {{was not until the}} second half of the 20th century that subclinical lead exposure became understood to be a problem. During the end of the 20th century, the <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels deemed acceptable steadily declined. <b>Blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels once considered safe are now considered hazardous, with no known safe threshold.|$|E
5|$|The main tool in {{diagnosing}} {{and assessing}} {{the severity of}} lead poisoning is laboratory analysis of the <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> level (BLL).|$|E
5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>lead</b> {{concentrations}} in poisoning victims {{have ranged from}} 30->80µg/dL in children exposed to lead paint in older houses, 77–104µg/dL in persons working with pottery glazes, 90–137µg/dL in individuals consuming contaminated herbal medicines, 109–139µg/dL in indoor shooting range instructors and as high as 330µg/dL in those drinking fruit juices from glazed earthenware containers.|$|E
25|$|Hypersplenism and pancytopenia, {{the rapid}} and {{premature}} destruction of <b>blood</b> cells, <b>leads</b> to anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (with {{an increased risk}} of infection and bleeding).|$|R
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} of pituitary apoplexy {{are related to}} the increased pressure in and around the pituitary gland. The most common symptom, in over 95% of cases, is a sudden-onset headache located behind the eyes or around the temples. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Occasionally, the presence of <b>blood</b> <b>leads</b> to irritation of the lining of the brain, which may cause neck rigidity and intolerance to bright light, as well as a decreased level of consciousness. This occurs in 24% of cases.|$|R
50|$|Hyper{{prothrombin}}emia is a {{state of}} high of prothrombin levels in the <b>blood</b> which <b>leads</b> to hypercoagulability. An example of a genetic cause includes the mutation prothrombin G20210A.|$|R
5|$|Exposure to lead {{can occur}} by {{contaminated}} air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Children are {{at greater risk}} as {{they are more likely to}} put objects in their mouth such as those that contain lead paint and absorb a greater proportion of the lead that they eat. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> level. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> for adults at 10µg/dl (10µg/100 g) and for children at 5µg/dl. Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Lead affects {{both the}} male and female {{reproductive}} systems. In men, when <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels exceed 40μg/dL, sperm count is reduced and changes occur in volume of sperm, their motility, and their morphology.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{commonly}} incorporated into herbal remedies such as Indian Ayurvedic preparations and remedies of Chinese origin. There are also risks of elevated <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels caused by folk remedies like azarcon and greta, which each contain about 95% lead.|$|E
50|$|At birth, {{when the}} infant {{breathes}} {{for the first}} time, there is {{a decrease in the}} resistance in the pulmonary vasculature, which causes the pressure in the left atrium to increase relative to the pressure in the right atrium. This leads to the closure of the foramen ovale, which is then referred to as the fossa ovalis. Additionally, the increase in the concentration of oxygen in the <b>blood</b> <b>leads</b> to a decrease in prostaglandins, causing closure of the ductus arteriosus. These closures prevent blood from bypassing pulmonary circulation, and therefore allow the neonate's blood to become oxygenated in the newly operational lungs.|$|R

A badly injured Vandal manages to crawl out of the core, at which point it is revealed that Vandal is a female, Karrie Norton. She tries to radio for help, leaving an audio log relating what has happened. The game ends with Radikov telling Le Guin that the Necromorph outbreak was a success. Back at the core, a trail of <b>blood</b> <b>leads</b> off-screen, with only Vandal's helmet remaining; her fate is unknown.|$|R
30|$|Prolongations in {{measured}} latency parameters were {{corrected by}} the different concentrates with variable efficacies (rFVIIa≥aPCC>PCC). Addition of aPCC and rFVIIa to the spiked <b>blood</b> samples <b>leads</b> to overcorrection of PT, aPTT and CT-EXTEM.|$|R
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
5|$|The current {{reference}} range for acceptable <b>blood</b> <b>lead</b> concentrations in healthy persons without excessive exposure to environmental {{sources of lead}} is less than 5µg/dL for children. It was less than 25µg/dL for adults. Previous to 2012 the value for children was 10 (µg/dl). The current biological exposure index (a level {{that should not be}} exceeded) for lead-exposed workers in the U.S. is 30µg/dL in a random blood specimen.|$|E
50|$|Serious danger {{regarding}} allergies {{can begin}} when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The former can be indicated through wheezing and cyanosis. Poor <b>blood</b> circulation <b>leads</b> to a weak pulse, pale skin and fainting.|$|R
