But PSG requires heavy equiped and patient constrained method. This paper describes an up-to-date method to estimate long-term sleep quality and reliable sleep parameters through non-invasive and unconstrained method. We developed a bed type sensor which is implemented by a pneumatic pressure transducer, air-mattress and <b>balancing</b> <b>tube.</b> It provides a patient with comfort to sleep and bring a relief from psychological stress caused by PSG. We separates ballistocardiac signal, respiration signal, snoring signal and a body movement from pneumatic pressure signal. The ballistic heart rate (B-HR) and ballistic heart rate variability (B-HRV) extracted from ballistocardiac signal is compared with heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) calculated from standard electrocardiography (ECG). And respiration signal and snoring signal is compared with flow-pressure meter. A body movement signal is compared with position sensor. We test two patients for three month and calculate the reliability of each signals. The correlation of HR and B-HR is 98. 1 %. HRV and B-HRV is 95. 3 %. And the correlation of respiration is 98. 6 %, snoring is 96. 3 %. These parameters are useful to sleep stage estimation and sleep apnea detection. And we introduce the indices which reflect a relation between daily psychophysiological stress and sleep patterns from the test of long-term monitoring. The indices are compared with list of questions that reflect a daily life stress with ten degrees. The proposed sleep monitoring system can not replace a standard PSG with Rechtschanffen and Kales (R-K) method as a sleep staging method. However, the new method is better {{of the fact that it}} does not physically restrain the patient and does not induce psychological stress. Also, it can be applied in long-term sleep monitoring system. I...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Dönel hareket yapan sistemler, dengesiz yük olması durumunda dönmenin etkisi altında merkezkaç kuvvetine maruz kalırlar. Dengesizlik hali merkezkaç kuvvetlerinin etkisi ile çoğu zaman istenmeyen titreşimlere neden olur. Bu titreşimler ve merkezkaç kuvveti, gürültü ve enerji kaybı olarak kendini gösterirken, dönen sistemlerin yataklarının aşınmasına neden olmakta, sistemin çalışma ömrünü ve performansını azaltmaktadır. Tüm bunları kontrol etmek, düşük enerji tüketimi sağlayıp ürün kalitesini arttırmak ve dengesizliğin kabul edilebilir sınırları aşmamasını sağlamak için titreşim seviyelerinin kontrol altında tutulması için şarttır. Titreşimleri oluşturan en önemli parametrelerden biri olan dönel sistemlerdeki dengesizlik etkisi, turbo makinalarda, çamaşır makinalarında, makina tezgâhlarında ve elektrik motorlarında büyük önem taşır. Bu tez çalışmasında, makinalarda dengesizlik problemi ele alınmış, genel olarak dengeleme yöntemleri hakkında bilgi toplanmış ve tez konusu olan sıvı halkalı sistemlerle pasif dengeleme hakkında kapsamlı bir literatür araştırması yapılmış, sıvı dengeleme halkaları ile dengeleme yapan sistemlerin çalışma prensibi incelenmiştir. Ardından, klasik dengeleme yöntemleri ve sıvı halkalı sistemlerle pasif dengeleme konularında teorik bilgiler derlenmiş ve sunulmuştur. Söz konusu sıvı halkalı sistemlerin bir modelinin ortaya konması, analiz yönteminin geliştirilmesi ve sistemin {{optimize}} edilebilmesi için gerekli araçların geliştirilmesi amaçlanmıştır. Sıvılı dengeleme sistemleri, dönel bir sistemin üzerine yerleştirilen, ona bağlı olarak hareket eden, içi belli bir hacimsel oranda sıvı ile doldurulmuş olan halkanın içerisindeki sıvının, merkezkaç kuvveti etkisiyle dengesizliğin aksi yönünde konumlanması prensibi ile çalışan sistemlerdir. Halka içerisinde yer alan sıvı, sistemin dönme merkezini referans alarak konumlanır ve dengesizliğin karşı tarafında konumlanan sıvının meydana getirdiği merkezkaç kuvveti, dengesizliğin sebep olduğu merkezkaç kuvvetinin bir kısmını kompanse eder. Sıvı halkalı sistemlerle pasif dengeleme, genellikle ilgilenilen frekans aralığında rijid olarak davranan, ancak izolasyon veya askı sistemleri nedeni ile makinanın çalışma hızının sistemin ilk doğal frekansının üzerinde olduğu durumlarda etkin olmaktadır. Bir başka deyişle, dengesizlikten kaynaklanan kuvvet ile deplasman cinsinden oluşan titreşimler arasında 180 o’lik bir faz farkı oluştuğu durumlarda sıvı halkalı dengeleme sistemleri kullanılabilmektedir. Belirtilen bu kısıta bağlı kalınmak üzere bu tez kapsamında sıvı dengeleme halkalarının tek ve çok katmanlı modelleri MATLAB ortamında oluşturulmuş ve bu modeller doğrultusunda bir analiz yöntemi geliştirilmiştir. Bu modellerde kullanılan temel yaklaşım, verilen bir dengesizlik ortamında halka veya halkalar içerisinde bulunan sıvının halka veya halkalar içinde nasıl konumlanacağının ve sıvının ters yönde yaratacağı dengeleme kuvvetlerinin belirlenmesidir. Bu prensibe dayanarak sistemin dengeleme kapasitesini belirlemek xiv mümkündür ve verilen bir dengesizlik durumu için sistemi optimize edecek araçlar bu tez kapsamında geliştirilmiştir. Dengeleme halkası tasarımında etkin olan parametreler ortaya konmuş, oluşturulan modeller kullanılarak sayısal simülasyonlar gerçekleştirilmiş, yapılan analizler ve optimizasyonlar çerçevesinde sonuçlar karşılaştırılmıştır. Sıvı halkalı dengeleme sistemi dengesizliği azaltmak için kullanılabilir ve bu sistemin görevini yapabilmesi için makinada net olarak bir miktar dengesizlik veya eksentrisite olması şarttır. Verilen bir titreşim seviyesi (eksantrisite) durumunda sıvının halka veya halkalar içindeki konumu iteratif bir yöntemle belirlenmiştir. Ancak, gerçek uygulamalarda titreşim seviyesi değil, sistemdeki olası dengesizlik miktarı bilinmekte ve pasif dengeleme sisteminin de bu koşulda analiz edilmesi gerekmektedir. Bu durum, analizler sırasında iterasyon döngüsü içinde başka bir iterasyon döngüsünü gerektirmektedir. Geliştirilen analiz yöntemi bu koşulda da sıvının konumunu ve pasif dengeleme sonucu titreşim seviyesinin ne kadar azaltılabileceğini belirleyebilmektedir. Rotating {{systems are}} exposed to centrifugal forces {{in the presence of}} an unbalance mass. This unbalanced state of machines often results in undesirable due to unbalanced centrifugal forces. Vibrations and unbalanced centrifugal forces usually lead to noise and energy loss, also causing bearings to wear down, and reducing the operating life and performance of the system. In order to ensure low energy consumption and high product quality, it is necessary to control the vibration levels and this in turn requires keeping the level of unbalance within an acceptable range. Unbalance in rotating systems, which appears to be the root cause of vibration, is of vital importance in turbomachinery, washing machines, machining tools, and electric motors. This thesis addresses the problem of vibration in rotating machinery and the use of liquid ring balancing systems to reduce vibrations by passive means, aiming to provide a model for liquid ring balancing systems, and to develop analysis methods in addition to tools for optimization of the liquid ring systems. General information has been gathered on balancing methods and an extensive literature survey has been conducted on passive balancing with emphasis on the use of liquid ring systems, which {{is the subject of this}} thesis. These are followed by theoretical information about conventional balancing methods and passive balancing systems using liquid rings. The operation of the liquid ring balancing systems is based on the fact that liquid in a partially-filled tube mounted on a rotating system, is self-aligned in a direction opposite to the unbalance under the effect of centrifugal forces. As such, the system behaves like a counter mass and in order for the system to function properly, it is required that the ratio of the volume of the liquid to that of the tube must be smaller than one. Furthermore, the liquid ring balancing systems are effective at frequencies higher than the natural frequency of the system. The liquid inside the <b>balancing</b> <b>tube</b> is positioned relative to the centre of rotation of the system. Thus, the centrifugal force caused by the liquid positioned on the opposite side of the unbalance compensates some of the centrifugal force caused by the unbalance itself. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the inner surface of the liquid to be vertically aligned and for the liquid to self-position itself. As its name implies, a liquid ring balancing system has a hollow ring partially filled with fluid which can be fresh water, salty water, oil, glycerine and liquid mercury etc. Although, liquid mercury may appear to be the best candidate due to its high density, liquid mercury is known to be extremely hazardous and should not be used if there is a risk of leakage. Another candidate, oil, is not preferred either in some applications as it may cause contamination. Salty water is usually the preferred option because of the relatively higher density. The liquid ring balancing system acts as a counter mass, positions the centre of mass of the liquid to the opposite side of the unbalance, thus reducing the net unbalance in the rotating system. The amount and distribution of the liquid is determined by rotating speed and the internal structure of the balancer. Passive balancing using liquid ring systems are efficient when the rotational speed of the machine is greater than the first natural frequency of the system. In other words, liquid ring balancers can be used in cases where there is a phase difference of 180 o between the forces caused by the unbalance and vibrations expressed in terms of displacement. Adhering to this constraint a model has been created for liquid ring balancers and an analysis method has been developed in accordance with this model. The basic approach adopted in this model is to determine the orientation of the liquid within the layer(s) and the balancing forces created by the liquid on the opposite side of the unbalance. It is then possible to estimate the balancing capacity of the system based on this principle and tools that will make it possible to optimize the system for a specific unbalance condition have been developed within the context of this thesis. The orientation(s) of the liquid within the layer(s) for a given vibration level (eccentricity) is/are determined using an iterative approach. However, in practice, it is the amount of unbalance in the system that is known, and not the vibration level, hence the passive balancing system should be analysed accordingly. This requires that another iteration to be used within the main iteration loop. The analysis method developed in this thesis is capable of estimating the orientation of the liquid and the amount of possible reduction in vibration levels when a passive balancing system is used. This allows estimating the balancing capacity of a given liquid balancing system. The tools developed in this thesis can also be used to optimize the balancing system for a specific unbalance condition. A computer code is developed in MATLAB to analyse the performance of singlelayer and multi-layer liquid/hydraulic balancers. The method and the tools developed in this thesis are then used to investigate the performance of a liquid balancing system installed on a sample machine, i. e. a washing machine. The effects of various parameters on the balancing capability of the liquid ring balancing systems are investigated. From optimisation point of view, the parameters considered in this investigation are the number of layers, the volumetric ratio, density of the liquid, geometric properties of the ring section and the mass of the liquid inside the balancer. The results obtained from the analyses presented in this thesis suggest that (i) the volumetric ratio of a balancing ring is one of the most important parameter in passive balancing. Neither a very low nor a very high value of volumetric ratio can yield efficient balancing. Volumetric ratio being about 50 % appears to be optimum (ii) A liquid ring balancer with a single layer cannot yield high balancing efficiency, (iii) Multi-layered balancing rings provide better balancing capacity when the same amount of balancing liquid is used, (iv) Using more number of layers in liquid balancing increases the balancing efficiency, (v) Using more liquid mass can yield better balancing, but doing so brings its own disadvantages. Results also confirm that it is not possible to remove unbalance completely by using liquid balancing rings. In other words, for the liquid balancing system to function, it is necessary that there must be some unbalance or eccentricity in the machine. This means that the unbalance can be reduced, but it cannot be eliminated by using liquid balancing rings. It should also be stated here that the analysis method developed within the scope of this thesis can be used for preliminary design of single-layer or multi-layer passive balancing rings for rotating mechanical systems. Although the liquid ring balancing systems are very effective in reducing the centrifugal force of the unbalance mass in steady state, it may increase the unbalance in transient state. Provisions such as orifices and obstructions can be made inside the tube for preventing unfavourable motions that may be caused by the liquid ring balancing systems. There are balancing systems comprising liquid balancing rings and spherical balls inside the liquid. It is recommended that the method developed within this thesis can be extended for such systems. Similarly, as a future work, a model can be developed for a system which consists of liquid balancing ring and a rotating mass inside the balancing liquid. In this thesis, it is assumed that during the steady state operation of a machine, the rotational speed of the system is high enough so that the acceleration experienced by the liquid is large compared to the gravitational acceleration. As a result, gravitation acceleration is ignored in the analyses here. However, it recommended that gravitational acceleration should be included in the analyses if the rotational speed is low or if the transient behaviour of the balancer is of interest during run-up. Finally, as another future work, it is recommended that to test a test rig should be developed for experimental investigation of liquid balancers as well as for validation of theoretical/numerical predictions.

When enzymatic peritonitis developed, laparoscopic abdominal drainage was carried out with 5 drains for _ peritoneal lavage (65. 5 %). The efficiency of medical measures was evaluated from the course and outcome of the disease. The authors analyzed 14 -day mortality, the clinical and morphological regression of pancreonecrosis, the incidenceof local complications (acute fluid accumulations (AFA), and the incidence of infected pancreonecrosis (IPN). Results. According to {{the severity of the}} underlying condition, the patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 (SAPS 9; mean score 12. 5 ± 1. 8) comprised 158 (31. 6 %) patients. The baseline condition of patients was determined by the involvement extent of the pancreas and retroperitoneal fat. In Groups 1 and 2, mortality was 7. 1 and 19. 0 %, respectively (p= 0. 000). Overall mortality was 10. 9 %. Cessation and regression of tissue necrotic changes in the pancreas and retroperitoneal fat were observed in 49. 7 % of cases in Group 1 and only in 12. 7 % in Group 2 (p= 0. 000). AFA was diagnosed in 43. 2 % of patients in Group 1 and in 68. 4 % in Group 2 (p= 0. 000). Adequate intestinal stimulation, nutritional support, and antibacterial therapy caused a mortality reduction in SPN irrespective of the SAPS severity. The abortive course of SPN was more frequently recorded in both groups when balanced multicomponent infusion therapy was performed in the first 24 hours of the disease. Regression of necrosis was also seen in the use of clinically effective gastrointestinal tract (GIT) stimulation, medical sedation, blockade of the secretory function of the gland, and antibacterial therapy in Group 1, and during adequate prolonged epidural anesthesia in Group 2. AFA was less frequently observed in the use of somatostatin analogues in Group 1 and complex infusion therapy and during adequate nutritional support only in Group 2.

The BBTV has been fitted with pipes of varying roughness. The roughness of smooth PĆ pipes was artificially altered using methods similar to those of Nikuradse. This has enabled the accumulation of flow data in laminar and turbulent flow in pipes that are both hydraulically smooth and rough Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids have been used for the tests. The data have been subjected to analysis using various theories and scaling laws. The strengths and problems associated with each approach are discussed and It is concluded that roughness does {{have a significant effect on}} Newtonian as well as non-Newtonlan flow...|$|R
25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and <b>balance.</b> The top <b>tube</b> connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliography. The {{rheology}} {{and flow}} behaviour of high concentration backfill tailings are investigated using a modified <b>Balance</b> Beam <b>Tube</b> Viscometer. The viscometer {{is capable of}} producing reliable data using a computer based data acquisition system and three different tube diameters. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the rheology of backfill tailings in order to predict friction head losses. The backfill tailings were prepared into four different particle size distributions each with a different maximum particle size. Each particle size distribution was tested over a range of high concentrations in the viscometer. The rheology of the lower concentration backfill tailings was successfully characterized using the yield-pseudoplastic model. It has been found that at high concentrations rheological characterization is impossible because the laminar flow region of the pseudo-shear diagram varies with tube diameter. This anomalous behaviour in the form of diameter dependence has been recorded in the literature. The results of high concentration tests on backfill tailings are investigated using the following theories to establish and account for the cause of the anomalous behaviour: Effective slip analysis - corrects the measured data for effective slip. Dense-Phase Model - based on the sliding friction between solid particles and the tube wall. Wall Effect - based on a reduction of in situ concentration due to a wall effect. Boundary-Layer Effect - corrects for the effect of a boundary-layer of liquid at the wall. Modified Friction Factors - takes into account the hydrodynamic lubrication between the solid particles and the tube wall. The existence of a thin layer of liquid at the wall is credible but not yet proven. The anomalous behaviour is linked to this layer. However a suitable method for correcting the measured data has not yet been established...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Edward Hutchinson & Ervin Fodor ### Abstract It {{is often}} useful to {{concentrate}} and purify the pleomorphic, enveloped virions of influenza viruses prior to analysis. This protocol describes a standard method for purifying ‘spherical’ influenza virions, {{the most common}} morphology of laboratory-adapted strains, by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous density gradient. The protocol, which takes around eight hours to complete, is designed for virions shed into the growth media of infected cells, and would also be suitable for concentrating virions from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs. Two different density gradients are described: a conventional gradient of sucrose and a gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep™ density gradient medium). A high degree of virion purity can be achieved, but small quantities of contaminants will remain. These can be removed by an optional haemadsorption-elution (HAd) step, which takes an additional one and half hours. This allows extremely efficient removal of the original contaminants, but introduces other, distinct contaminants at low levels. ### Materials Consumables required: 1. 0. 45 μm syringe filters - 50 ml syringes - 50 ml plastic tubes - 15 ml plastic tubes – optional - Thickwall tubes for the SW 28 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 25 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 355642) - Thinwall tubes for the SW 41 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 14 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 331372) - 5 ml syringe and needle (21 G or similar) - 1. 5 ml tubes - Standard plasticware, pipettes, permanent marker pen Reagents required: 1. 10 × NTC solution (1 M NaCl, 0. 2 M Tris-HCl pH 7. 4, 50 mM CaCl 2) - sucrose or OptiPrep™ density gradient medium (Sigma; D 1556) - sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - ddH 2 O - adult chicken blood cells in Alsever’s (TCS Biosciences; FB 010) – optional ### Equipment 1. Rotating wheel – optional - Refrigerator - 37 °C water bath - Benchtop centrifuge with refrigeration (e. g. a Rotanta 460 R, Hettich Lab Technology) - Mass balance - Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) - Beckman Coulter SW 28 swinging bucket rotor - Beckman Coulter SW 41 swinging bucket rotor - Aspiration vessel suitable for infectious material (e. g. an Integra Vacusafe; optional) - - 80 °C freezer ### Procedure 1. Prepare solutions in advance and store in the refrigerator – all should be used cold. Prepare: - a. 1 × NTC solution (from 10 × stock). - b. Working dilutions for the density gradient. If using sucrose, make 50 ml aliquots of 30, 40, 50 and 60 % solutions (w/v) by adding the required mass of sucrose to 5 ml 10 × NTC and topping up with ddH 2 O. Mix on a rotating wheel until dissolved, then pass through an 0. 45 μm syringe filter into a clean 50 ml tube. Mix equal amounts of these solutions in additional tubes to produce 35, 45 and 55 % solutions (w/v). If using OptiPrep™, follow a similar procedure to prepare a 10 – 40 % (w/v) series of iodixanol solutions in NTC (OptiPrep™ is 60 % iodixanol, so 12 ml solutions at 10, 20, 30 and 40 % should contain 1. 2 ml 10 × NTC and 2, 4, 6 and 8 ml OptiPrep™, respectively. Intermediate concentrations (15, 25 and 35 %) can be prepared by mixing, as above.) - c. To prepare a step gradient, layer 1. 5 ml {{of each of the}} seven solutions into a thinwall tube. Starting with the most concentrated solution, use a pipette to slowly add layers, 0. 75 ml at a time, taking care not to mix layers (the interfaces of different concentrations should remain visible). Gradients can be prepared in advance and stored at 4 °C (some mixing by diffusion is acceptable); if prepared during the purification this should be done during the first ultracentrifugation step. If only one gradient is required a balance can be quickly prepared by mixing 5. 25 ml of the most and least concentrated solutions, or using 10. 5 ml of the middle concentration. - d. If performing HAd, prepare chicken blood. To prevent lysis, blood should be centrifuged at no more than 1, 250 g (around 2, 500 rpm if using 15 ml tubes in a benchtop centrifuge, depending on the rotor) at 10 °C; although it should be kept cold it should not be put directly on ice. On receipt cells should be rinsed twice in chilled PBS. Comparison of the cell pellet to liquid in another tube should be used to estimate the volume of cells, and the pellet resuspended in PBS to 20 % packed cell volume (pcv) for storage in the refrigerator. If haemolysis occurs during storage the cells should be rinsed again in PBS and resuspended in an appropriate volume. When about to begin purification, pre-warm an aliquot of PBS to 37 °C. - Prepare virus to be concentrated. A maximum of 150 ml of virus-containing medium can be prepared without prior HAd. This can be obtained from six 175 cm 2 tissue culture flasks which have been seeded with a suitable cell line (e. g. Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells), infected when sub-confluent with an influenza virus at a low multiplicity of infection, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for approximately 48 h. - When the virus is ready to harvest, extensive cytopathic effect will be apparent by microscopy. Transfer the media to six 50 ml tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at approximately 2000 g (around 4, 000 rpm, depending on the rotor) to pellet cellular debris. - Transfer the supernatant to six (thickwall) tubes and place in the buckets of an SW 28 rotor. Weigh the buckets (with the lids on) and transfer media between them as necessary to balance. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at 18, 000 g (10, 000 rpm) in an SW 28 rotor to further pellet cellular debris. Retain 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - If extremely high purity is required (and chicken red blood cell contaminants are not problematic) perform HAd as described in steps (3) – (9). Otherwise, proceed to step (10). - Optional. Transfer supernatants to six clean, chilled 50 ml tubes and add 325 μl of chicken red blood cells (20 % pcv) to each tube. Mix by gentle inversion and refrigerate for 30 min, inverting regularly. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend all pellet in a single aliquot of 10 ml chilled PBS – to do so, sequentially rinse each tube with the same 5 ml aliquot of PBS, repeat with a second 5 ml aliquot, and pool both aliquots a single 15 ml tube. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml chilled PBS (some agglutination of cells is likely to be apparent). Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml 37 °C PBS, transfer to a clean, room-temperature 50 ml tube and increase the volume to 20 ml with 37 °C PBS. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min, mixing regularly by gentle inversion. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C), and take 100 μl of the supernatant for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Prepare two thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol. Gently layer the supernatant onto the 5 ml cushion, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Add 20 ml PBS or water to the second <b>tube</b> to <b>balance.</b> Place the <b>tubes</b> in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volume of the <b>balance</b> <b>tube</b> as necessary. Proceed to step (11). - If HAd was not performed, prepare 6 thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol in each. Gently layer the supernatants onto the 5 ml cushions, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 28 rotor at 4 °C for 90 min at 112, 000 g (25, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatants, taking care not to disturb the pellet (which may not be visible). When nearing the bottom of the tube, run the aspiration pipette around the meniscus and tilt away from the pellet to remove the supernatant. Add 50 μl chilled 1 × NTC to each tube (or around 500 μl to the single tube if HAd was used) and resuspend by pipetting up and down. Pool the suspension and layer gently onto the top of a density gradient (see 1. c, above) taking care not to mix the layers. Place the gradient <b>tube</b> and a <b>balance</b> <b>tube</b> into SW 41 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 150 min at 209, 000 g (35, 000 rpm). Afterwards, the virions should be visible as a ‘milky’ band of material at around 40 % sucrose or 30 % iodixanol. Hold the tube against a dark background and use a pen to mark the position of the meniscus and of the virions. Secure the tube and, using a 5 ml syringe and needle, carefully pierce the side of the tube a few millimetres below the virions. While moving the needle tip gently forwards and backwards, withdraw around 1 cm height of the gradient (1 – 2 ml), including the band of virions. Eject the contents of the syringe into a new thinwall tube containing 9 ml chilled 1 × NTC, and rinse out the syringe once in this solution. Place the <b>tube</b> and a <b>balance</b> <b>tube</b> in SW 41 rotor buckets weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 60 min at 154, 000 g (30, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet. Add around 80 μl chilled 1 ×NTC and resuspend by pipetting; this should give around 150 μl of a milky solution of purified virions. Reserve around 10 % for analysis, and store the rest in a 1. 5 ml tube at - 80 °C. ### Timing - 1. Solution preparation. When convenient. - 2. Generation of virus. Two days. - 3. Harvesting and clarification. 40 min. - 4. Transfer, balance and clarification. 50 min. - 5 – 9. HAd (optional). 90 min. - 10. Layering onto cushions. 15 min. - 11. Ultracentrifugation. 120 min. - 12. Ultracentrifugation. 180 min. - 13. Ultracentrifugation. 80 min. Approximate time for purifications (steps 3 – 13) : 8 hours without HAd, 9 and a half hours with HAd. ### Troubleshooting - Growth of virus can be assessed before beginning by microscopic examination of cells (step 3). If no cytopathic effect is visible it is unlikely that there will be enough virus to purify. - With the volumes described, concentrated virus should be visible in steps 12 and 13 (though a dark background may be necessary in step 12, and the band may be faint). Additional bands may appear in step 12 depending on the mixing of the gradient steps and on the morphology of the virus; for most applications the major band can be harvested, but if this is ambiguous the entire gradient can be harvested in aliquots from the top (step 13 is then not required). - Samples taken throughout the purification can help to identify problems. A number of assays can be used to detect virions, including plaque assay (to detect fully infectious virions – typically recovery of infectious material is around 10 – 30 %) and SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining (to assess purity). If chicken blood is being used a quick assay for the presence of virions (whether infectious or not) can be performed while other steps are being carried out using a modified haemagglutination (HA) assay. In a 96 -well round-bottomed dish add 50 μl PBS to 11 of the 12 columns, leaving the first column empty (a multi-channel pipette is helpful throughout this assay). In the first column add 100 μl of sample or PBS (up to eight samples per dish; material from the final step in the purification should only be used if heavily diluted beforehand), and perform twofold serial dilutions of this by transferring 50 μl into the second column, mixing, changing pipette tip and repeating across the dish. Then add 50 μl chicken red blood cells (at 1 % pcv) to each well, mix and leave to stand, preferably at 4 °C. For each sample the last dilution in which the blood cells agglutinate and cannot settle {{to the bottom of the}} well contains one haemagglutinating unit (HAU). Note that, as this is a modification of the standard assay, the HAU values here are useful only for relative measures and should not be compared to other experiments. Note also that the assay is rather insensitive to low concentrations of virus. Typical end-points are 1 / 128 for the input material (in 120 ml) and 1 / 512 after HAd (in 20 ml – i. e. around 2 / 3 recovery of material). ### Anticipated Results The method described should result in a thousand-fold decrease in volume with, typically, a 10 – 30 % recovery of infectious material (plaque-forming units). As some virus will be inactivated during purification the physical recovery of material is likely to be better than this. Electron microscopy shows that virions generally remain intact during purification (see Fig 1 b of ref (1) and Fig 1 b of ref (2)). Purification without HAd is sufficient to remove the majority of contaminating material, as can be seen by SDS-PAGE and silver staining in Fig 1 a of ref (1) and Fig 1 a of ref (2), and this is likely to be sufficient for the majority of applications. However, as shown in Fig 3 b of ref (2) low levels of contaminants are still present when material is purified in this way. These contaminants can be excluded by HAd, as shown in Fig 3 c of ref (2), though this method introduces additional contaminants derived from chicken red blood cells. Readers interested in the presence of specific protein contaminants after purification with and without HAd are referred to the supplementary data of ref (2). ### References 1. Hutchinson, E.

40|$|We {{suggest a}} new model for the {{structure}} of a magnetic field embedded high β turbulent plasma, based on the popular notion that the magnetic field will tend to separate into individual flux tubes. We point out that interactions between the flux tubes will be dominated by coherent effects stemming from the turbulent wakes created as the fluid streams by the flux <b>tubes.</b> <b>Balancing</b> the attraction caused by shielding effects with turbulent diffusion we find that flux tubes have typical radii comparable to the local Mach number squared times the large scale eddy length, are arranged in a one dimensional fractal pattern, have a radius of curvature comparable to the largest scale eddies in the turbulence, and have an internal magnetic pressure comparable to the ambient pressure. When the average magnetic energy density is much less than the turbulent energy density the radius, internal magnetic field and curvature scale of the flux tubes will be smaller than these estimates. Realistic resistivity does not alter the macroscopic properties of the fluid or the large scale magnetic field. In either case we show that the Sweet-Parker reconnection rate is much faster than an eddy turnover time. Realistic stellar plasmas are expected to either be in the ideal limit (e. g. the solar photosphere) or the resistive limit (most of the solar convection zone). All current numerical simulations of three dimensional MHD turbulence are in the viscous regime and are inapplicable to stars or accretion disks. Comment: 50 pages, aastex, astro-ph/yymmnn...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} approach for estimating fraction dose absorbed in humans {{has been developed}} based on a macroscopic mass balance that incorporates membrane permeability and solubility considerations. The macroscopic mass balance approach (MMBA) is a flow model approach that utilizes fundamental mass transfer theory for estimating the extent of absorption for passively as well as nonpassively absorbed drugs. The mass <b>balance</b> on a <b>tube</b> with steady input and a wall flux of J w = P w C b results in the following expression for fraction dose absorbed, F : F = 2 An ∫ 0 1 C * b dz * where the absorption number, An = L/R · P w / v z >;, L and R are the intestinal length and radius, P w is the unbiased drug wall permeability, 〈 v z 〉 is the axial fluid velocity, C * b = C b /C o and is the dimension-less bulk or lumen drug concentration, C b and C o are the bulk and initial drug concentrations, respectively, and z * is the fractional intestinal length and is equal to z/L. Three theoretical cases are considered: (I) C o ≤ S, C m ≤ S, (II) C o > S, C m ≤ S, and (III) C o > S, C m > S, where S is the drug solubility and C m is the outlet drug concentration. Solving the general steady-state mass balance result for fraction dose absorbed using the mixing tank (MT) and complete radial mixing (CRM) models results in the expressions for the fraction dose absorbed in humans. Two previously published empirical correlations for estimating fraction dose absorbed in humans are discussed and shown to follow as special cases of this {{theoretical approach}}. The MMBA is also applied to amoxicillin, a commonly prescribed orally absorbed β-lactam antibiotic for several doses. The parameters used in the correlation were determined from in situ or in vitro experiments along with a calculated system scaling parameter. The fraction dose absorbed calculated using the MMBA is compared to human amoxicillin pharmacokinetic results from the literature with initial doses approximated to be both above and below its solubility. The results of the MMBA correlation are discussed {{with respect to the}} nonpassive absorption mechanism and solubility limitation of amoxicillin. The MMBA is shown to be a fundamental, theoretically based model for estimating fraction dose absorbed in humans from in situ and in vitro parameters from which previously published empirical correlations follow as special cases...|$|R
