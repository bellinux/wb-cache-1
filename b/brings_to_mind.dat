25|$|Less {{than eight}} months after {{breaking}} ground, the Empire Center's first stores opened in October 2001. Local officials estimated the complex would generate about $3.2 {{million a year in}} sales tax revenue for the city, and as many as 3,500 local jobs. Within a year of completion, the Empire Center was helping the city to post healthy growth in sales tax revenues despite a down economy. Alone, the Empire mall generated close to $800,000 in sales tax revenues {{in the second quarter of}} 2002.

25|$|The Cross of Sacrifice is {{considered}} one of the great pieces of war-related art. Its enduring popularity, historian Allen Frantzen says, is because it is both simple and expressive, its abstraction reflecting the modernity people valued after the war. Fabian Ware argued that its greatness was because its symbolism is so purposefully vague: To some, it is a Christian cross; to others, the stone is irrelevant and the sword itself is the cross; and to others, the artwork symbolizes those who sacrificed their lives to the sword. The theme of sacrifice is commonly seen in the piece. Jeroen Geurst points out that Lutyens' War Stone unsettlingly <b>brings</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> images of soldiers sacrificed on the altar of war, while Blomfield's cross speaks about self-sacrifice and the saving grace of Jesus Christ's sacrifice.|$|E

There are {{those who think that}} they are related to the rokurokubi, and since the rokurokubi of legends are frequently female, they are sometimes pointed out as examples of male rokurokubi. The length of its neck has been exaggerated over the passage of eras, and in the late Edo period, it has become standard for its neck to be long and thin, and for its face to have three eyes. In many kusazōshi that had a theme on yōkai, they are also {{depicted as}} having a characteristic long neck, and from having an appearance with such impact, they almost always appear as the chief yōkai.|$|E

5000|$|Chaiken and Baldwin's 1981 {{study on}} self-perception theory dealt with {{environmental}} attitudes. Each participant {{was identified as}} having well or poorly defined prior attitudes toward being an environmentalist or conservationist. Participants then completed one of two versions of a questionnaire designed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> either past pro-ecology behaviors or past anti-ecology behaviors. For example, questions such as [...] "Have you ever recycled?" [...] call <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the times an individual has recycled, emphasizing their engagement in environmentalist behavior. On the other hand, questions like [...] "Do you always recycle?" [...] <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> all the times an individual did not recycle something, emphasizing a lack of environmentalist behavior. Afterward, participants' attitudes toward being an environmentalist/conservationist were re-measured. Those with strong initial/prior attitudes toward the environment were not really affected by the salient manipulation. Those with weak prior attitudes, however, were affected. At the end, those in the pro-ecology condition ("Have you ever recycled?") reported themselves as being much more pro-environment {{than those in the}} anti-ecology condition ("Do you always recycle?"). <b>Bringing</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> certain past behaviors affected what people believed their attitudes to be.|$|R

The gift that his family {{possesses}} {{is the ability to}} [...] "unmake" [...] things, but his gift seems to manifest very late, and he is unable to control it. Later he seems to strike down his pet dog, and then destroy an entire hillside with his power. He decides the death was his fault, and horrified by the thought of his power out of control, demands that he be blindfolded. Orrec's battles with his power and its potential to destroy have been described {{as an example of a}} person's confrontation with their own shadow, a common theme in Le Guin's writing. The blindfold initially brings him some peace. Unable to see the real world, he lives within the stories that Melle has told him, Eventually he begins to retell the stories to his mother, and to add to them himself. When Melle asks to see his face without the blindfold one last time, he realizes he couldn't have hurt her, and feels the [...] "dry fury of impotent regret." [...] After his mother's death he descends into grief and rage, which he eventually emerges from with Gry's assistance. At Gry's suggestion he begins to remove his blindfold to read the books his mother writes for him. Orrec comes to realizes that his father has unintentionally tricked him into believing in his wild gift, so as to protect his domain. He confronts his father [...] Orrec eventually realizes that he prefers [...] "making" [...] to unmaking. Gry and he get married, and leave the Uplands. Scholar Sandra Lindow has pointed out that Orrec's name is similar to [...] "auric", meaning [...] "related to hearing", and that it <b>brings</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the word [...] "oracle", describing his discovery of his power to create and perform. Orrec's emotional journey during his blindfoldment has been compared to that of the biblical character Jonah, as well as to that of Max in the Maurice Sendak children's picture book Where the Wild Things Are.|$|E
