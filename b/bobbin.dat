5|$|At the tapered {{rear end}} of the stomach and {{projecting}} slightly into the hindgut is the prostyle, a backward-pointing cone of feces and mucus, which is rotated by further cilia so it acts as a <b>bobbin,</b> winding the mucus string onto itself. Before the mucus string reaches the prostyle, the acidity of the stomach makes the mucus less sticky and frees particles from it.|$|E
5|$|The 18th-century caricaturist and satirical poet John Collier, {{who used}} the {{pseudonym}} Tim Bobbins, was born in Urmston in 1708. A self-styled Lancashire Hogarth, his first and most famous work, A View of the Lancashire Dialect, or, Tummus and Mary, appeared in 1746, the earliest significant piece of published Lancashire dialect. A local public house, The Tim <b>Bobbin,</b> is named after him.|$|E
60|$|He {{took his}} place in one of many long rows of machines. Before him, above a bin filled with small <b>bobbins,</b> were large <b>bobbins</b> {{revolving}} rapidly. Upon these he wound the jute-twine of the small <b>bobbins.</b> The work was simple. All that was required was celerity. The small <b>bobbins</b> were emptied so rapidly, and {{there were so many}} large <b>bobbins</b> that did the emptying, that there were no idle moments.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bobbins</b> {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} West Yorkshire town of Tackleford, England and focused on the lives of the staff of the fictional City Limit magazine. The webcomic won a few awards, and <b>Bobbins</b> {{discontinuation}} in 2002 was followed by the start of Scary Go Round, which shares most of <b>Bobbins</b> cast.|$|R
50|$|In the two-step {{braiding}} process, the <b>bobbins</b> move continuously without stopping. They move on {{the track}} plate through the complete structure and around the standing ends, such that the movements of <b>bobbins</b> are faster {{when compared to the}} four-step braiding process. The <b>bobbins</b> can move only in two directions, so the process is called the two-step braiding process.|$|R
25|$|The {{transverse}} {{shuttle is}} a method to drive a <b>bobbin</b> on a sewing machine so as to create the lockstitch technique. Transverse shuttles carry the <b>bobbin</b> in a boat-shaped shuttle, and reciprocate the shuttle along a straight horizontal shaft. As the earliest of <b>bobbin</b> drivers, the transverse shuttle was patented by Elias Howe on September 10, 1846.|$|E
25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical spinning frame and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in hand spinning. It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles have to run. As the yarn leaves the front rollers it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the <b>bobbin.</b> The <b>bobbin</b> is carried on a lifter plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the <b>bobbin</b> which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the spun yarn. A felt or cloth washer is placed between the lifter plate and <b>bobbin</b> to retard the revolving <b>bobbin</b> and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the <b>bobbin.</b> When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed doffing and is done manually on this machine.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the <b>bobbin</b> fits. The revolving tube and <b>bobbin</b> impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the <b>bobbin.</b> The speed of the <b>bobbin</b> causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the <b>bobbin</b> moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, new {{installments}} of <b>Bobbins</b> {{began to}} appear on Fridays, interleaved with the Bad Machinery strip (which publishes Monday through Thursday). The new episodes were apparently taking place around 1998, [...] "retconned" [...] into the early <b>Bobbins</b> run, and prominently featured Amy, whose older version was important to the Bad Machinery storyline in progress which involved time travel and alternate realities. More new <b>Bobbins</b> comics have been published since, including a run beginning in December in between storylines of Bad Machinery. Some are [...] "Bobbins NOW" [...] strips, featuring the present-day versions of <b>Bobbins</b> characters.|$|R
25|$|When skeining from wheel spun yarn, the <b>bobbin</b> {{can either}} {{be removed from the}} wheel and placed on a kate, or skeined {{directly}} from the wheel. If the <b>bobbin</b> is left on the wheel the tension on the drive band must be lessened in order to allow the <b>bobbin</b> to turn freely. Yarn spun on spindles {{can either be}} left on the spindle, or slipped onto a dowel for plying. The spindle or dowel is either placed in a lazy kate, or even a bowl to keep the spindle in one place while winding off the yarn.|$|E

25|$|Creeling {{involved}} {{replacing the}} rovings bobbins {{in a section}} of the mule without stopping the mule. On very coarse counts a <b>bobbin</b> lasted two days but on fine count it could last for 3 weeks. To creel, the creeler stood behind the mule, he placed new bobbins on the shelf above the creel. As the <b>bobbin</b> ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new <b>bobbin</b> onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|E
50|$|T. Wildman & Sons were an English {{company and}} {{specialists in the}} {{manufacture}} of <b>bobbins</b> for the textile industry. They manufactured all kinds of shielded ring <b>bobbins</b> (twist and weft), tubes and pirns. The firm was established in 1859.|$|R
40|$|In a study {{aimed at}} {{improving}} {{the reliability of the}} Norwegian bottom sampling trawl, comparative fishing between standard <b>bobbins</b> gear and rockhopper ground gear were carried out in the Barents Sea. The catch ratios bobbins/ rockhopper (B/R) for cod and haddock show a higher efficiency for rockhopper than for <b>bobbins,</b> especially for small fish. The catch ratio B/R for cod varied by time of day. Rockhopper seemed to have a higher efficiency compared to <b>bobbins</b> during daytime. The same trend was not found for haddock. These experiments confirm earlier experiments that rockhoppper is more effective than <b>bobbins</b> gear in catching fish close to the bottom. This is particulary true for small cod...|$|R

25|$|Anodized {{aluminium}} {{flat wire}} may be used, providing an insulating oxide layer {{more resistant to}} dielectric breakdown than enamel coatings on other voice coil wire. This creates lightweight, low-inductance voice coils, ideally suited to use in small, extended range speakers. The principal power limitation on such coils is the thermal softening point of the adhesives which bond the wire to the <b>bobbin,</b> or the <b>bobbin</b> to the spider and coil.|$|E

50|$|Children were {{employed}} in the mills as spinners, sweepers and doffers, with girls usually starting as spinners and boys as doffers and sweepers. When the <b>bobbins</b> on the spinning frames were full, the machinery stopped. The doffers would swarm into the mill and, as quickly as possible, change all the <b>bobbins,</b> after which the machinery would be restarted and the doffers were free to amuse themselves until the next change-over. On the newer and taller frames, the doffers often had to climb to reach the <b>bobbins.</b>|$|R
25|$|A rotary hook is a <b>bobbin</b> driver design used in {{lockstitch}} {{sewing machines}} of the 19th and 20th century and beyond. It triumphed over competing designs {{because it could}} run at higher speeds with less vibration. Rotary hook machines hold their <b>bobbin</b> stationary, and continuously rotate the thread hook around it. The rotary hook was co-invented by American cabinetmaker Allen B. Wilson and Nathaniel Wheeler in 1851. U.S. Patent # 8,296 was issued to Wilson on August 12, 1851.|$|E

50|$|For {{automation}} in link spinning/winding {{there is}} the so-called “in-line steamer”. The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch. In this case the heat setting process happens in between the ring spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring spinning frame has finished spinning, the loaded <b>bobbins</b> are transported into the in-line steamer. Those <b>bobbins</b> are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the <b>bobbins</b> are transported on to the winding machine where they are re-wound onto a cross-wound package.|$|R
50|$|Leavitt did not confine {{himself to}} the design of firearms. On August 18, 1842 he was granted a patent (number 2755) for a 'Mode of Securing <b>Bobbins</b> in Shuttles for Weaving'. Leavitt's patent for an {{innovation}} for <b>bobbins</b> used in power looms demonstrated that the inventor had his eye on another emerging New England industry. It was an industry in which Leavitt had more than passing interest: his father Benning owned a Chicopee factory that produced <b>bobbins.</b> There is no indication whether Leavitt's patent for textile manufacturing was more successful than his firearm patents.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the loom}} starts, the filler <b>bobbins</b> wind the filler yarn {{in a circle}} through the warp yarns. As soon as the <b>bobbins</b> pass, the loom crisscrosses each pair of {{adjacent}} warp yarns to trap the filler yarn between them. This weaving process continues at a high speed as {{the lower end of}} the jacket is slowly drawn down through the loom, and the <b>bobbins</b> continue to wrap the filler yarns around the circumference of the jacket in a tight spiral. The woven jacket is wound flat on a take-up reel.|$|R
