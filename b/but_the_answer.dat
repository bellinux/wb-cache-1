2500|$|The {{answer to}} the first {{question}} is , as is correctly shown by the [...] "simple" [...] solutions. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to the second question is now different: the conditional probability the car is behind door 1 or door 2 given the host has opened door 3 (the door on the right) is [...] This is because Monty's preference for rightmost doors means that he opens door 3 if the car is behind door 1 (which it is originally with probability [...] ) or if the car is behind door 2 (also originally with probability [...] ). For this variation, the two questions yield different answers. However, as long as the initial probability the car is behind each door is , it is never to the contestant's disadvantage to switch, as the conditional probability of winning by switching is always at least [...] (Morgan et al. 1991) ...|$|E
2500|$|Following this conference, he sailed for Italy, {{anchoring}} in Livorno on 19 November. On arrival, {{a dispute}} arose between the admiral {{and the local}} authorities over the priority of saluting. Dilkes claimed {{the right to be}} saluted first by the castle, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> came that this honour was only offered to admirals or vice-admirals. Rear-admiral Dilkes had to be content with this answer, and as a conciliatory gesture he was invited to a public dinner on shore on 1 December. Returning to his flagship after this meal he caught a chill, followed by a fever, from which he died on 12 December 1707. His death coming so soon after his dispute with the grand-ducal court led to rumours that he had been poisoned; John Campbell, for example, writing that his fever was [...] "caused, as most people imagined, by an Italian dinner." [...] These rumours have been dismissed as groundless.|$|E

5000|$|The {{definition}} of NP-easy uses a Turing reduction {{rather than a}} many-one reduction because <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to problem Y are only TRUE or FALSE, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to problem X can be more general.

2500|$|While Milankovitch forcing {{predicts that}} cyclic {{changes in the}} Earth's orbital {{elements}} can be expressed in the glaciation record, additional explanations are necessary to explain which cycles are observed to be most important in the timing of glacial–interglacial periods. In particular, during the last 800,000 years, the dominant period of glacial–interglacial oscillation has been 100,000 years, which corresponds to changes in Earth's orbital eccentricity and orbital inclination. Yet this {{is by far the}} weakest of the three frequencies predicted by Milankovitch. During the period 3.0–0.8 million years ago, the dominant pattern of glaciation corresponded to the 41,000-year period of changes in Earth's obliquity (tilt of the axis). The reasons for dominance of one frequency versus another are poorly understood and an active area of current research, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> probably relates to some form of resonance in the Earth's climate system. [...] Recent work suggests that the 100K year cycle dominates due to increased southern-pole sea-ice increasing total solar reflectivity.|$|E
2500|$|Elements of the braid group [...] can be {{represented}} more concretely by matrices. One classical such representation is Burau representation, where the matrix entries are single variable Laurent polynomials. It had been a long-standing question whether Burau representation was faithful, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> {{turned out to be}} negative for [...] More generally, it was a major open problem whether braid groups were linear. In 1990, Ruth Lawrence described a family of more general [...] "Lawrence representations" [...] depending on several parameters. In 1996, C. Nayak and Frank Wilczek posited that in analogy to projective representations of , the projective representations of the braid group have a physical meaning for certain quasiparticles in the fractional quantum hall effect. Around 2001 Stephen Bigelow and Daan Krammer independently proved that all braid groups are linear. Their work used the Lawrence–Krammer representation of dimension [...] depending on the variables [...] and [...] By suitably specializing these variables, the braid group [...] may be realized as a subgroup of the general linear group over the complex numbers.|$|E
2500|$|Sumner {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} remove the word [...] "white" [...] from naturalization laws. [...] He introduced bills to that effect in 1868 and 1869, but neither came to a vote. [...] On July 2, 1870, Sumner moved to amend a pending bill {{in a way that}} would strike the word [...] "white" [...] wherever in all Congressional acts pertaining to naturalization of immigrants. [...] On July 4, 1870, he said: [...] "Senators undertake to disturb us... by reminding us of the possibility of large numbers swarming from China; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to all this is very obvious and very simple. If the Chinese come here, they will come for citizenship or merely for labor. [...] If they come for citizenship, then in this desire do they give a pledge of loyalty to our institutions; and where is the peril in such vows? [...] They are peaceful and industrious; how can their citizenship be the occasion of solicitude?" [...] He accused legislators promoting anti-Chinese legislation of betraying the principles of the Declaration of Independence: [...] "Worse than any heathen or pagan abroad are those in our midst who are false to our institutions." [...] Sumner's bill failed, and from 1870 to 1943, and in some cases as late as 1952, Chinese and other Asians were ineligible for naturalized U.S. citizenship.|$|E
