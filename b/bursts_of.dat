5|$|Historically, storms of such {{magnitude}} {{and with such}} high wind velocities have not lasted more than four or five hours. The Great Lakes storm, however, raged for more than 16hours, with an average speed of 60mph (100km/h), and frequent <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> more than 70mph (110km/h). It crippled traffic on the lakes and throughout the Great Lakes basin region.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{woodpeckers}} such as Dryocopus have a fast, direct form of flight, but {{the majority}} of species have a typical undulating flight pattern consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed by a swooping glide. Many birds in the Melanerpes genus have distinctive, rowing wing-strokes while the piculets engage in short <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> rapid direct flight.|$|E

5|$|The {{conditions}} on Sunday, 29 November were extremely unsettled. There were {{a series of}} thunderstorm cells that formed {{early in the morning}} — despite it being more common for thunderstorms to form in the late afternoon in the south-east Queensland region. These storms, which had periodic <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> severe lightning, cleared quickly.|$|E
5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E
5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.|$|E

5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|As long {{as winter}} food is available, both {{the male and}} female will remain in the {{territory}} throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.|$|E
5|$|Harry confronts monsters in {{each area}} with both melee weapons and firearms. An {{ordinary}} man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting. His inexperience in handling firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often unsteady. A portable radio collected {{early in the game}} alerts Harry to the presence of nearby creatures with <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> static.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin {{detected}} <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> {{radio signals}} coming from Jupiter at 22.2MHz. The period of these bursts matched {{the rotation of}} the planet, and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{spend much}} of their time resting and are {{inactive}} for about 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E
5|$|River otters swim by quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, {{alternate}} hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, or {{body and}} tail dorsoventral undulation. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than the limbs, {{is used for}} stability while swimming and for short <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> rapid propulsion. While swimming at the surface, the dorsal portion of the river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and eyes, is exposed above water. It must remain in motion to maintain its position at the surface.|$|E

5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron storage ring. This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> {{energy in the form}} of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the Fiji parrotfinch is fast and undulating with rapid wingbeats, and {{frequent}} calling. It tends to fly fairly high, landing in the tree tops, then descending to seek food. Its call is a high, thin seep or peep, {{similar to those of}} other parrotfinches such as blue-faced and red-throated, and is often repeated in <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> varying length. The song is a long whistled double note similar to, but less urgent, than that of the orange-breasted myzomela, a Fijian endemic honeyeater.|$|E
5|$|The system {{originated}} {{out of an}} upper-level low {{just west}} of the Canary Islands on September28. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> convection. While remaining non-tropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest. On October3, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (460mi, 740km) southwest of São Miguel Island in the Azores. Early on October4, convection increased as the surface low organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression.|$|E

5|$|The wettest {{conditions}} {{persist in}} the high Alps and in the Ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> rain from time to time. Precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer. Autumn is the driest season, winter receives less precipitation than summer, yet the weather patterns in Switzerland {{are not in a}} stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods.|$|E
5|$|Tiger sharks {{have a large}} upper lobe, {{which allows}} for slow {{cruising}} and sudden <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> speed. The tiger shark {{must be able to}} twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.|$|E
5|$|Townsend, the founder, songwriter, and {{frontman}} {{of extreme}} metal band Strapping Young Lad and progressive metal group The Devin Townsend Band, dissolved both bands in 2006 {{to spend time}} with his family and avoid the burnout of touring and interviewing. After a period of self-discovery and a year-long break from songwriting, Townsend began work on a four-album series to clarify his identity as a musician. Ki includes themes of self-control and sobriety, and is musically subtler than much of the artist's previous work, consisting of ambient rock music interlaced with tentative <b>bursts</b> <b>of</b> heavy metal.|$|E
