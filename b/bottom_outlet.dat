40|$|When a dam is {{constructed}} on the rivers, it causes the sediments {{settle in the}} reservoir. Therefore, the initial storage of the reservoir would reduce and it will have negative effects on {{the operation of the}} reservoir. Considering the importance of this issue, different methods for control of sedimentation and maintenance of dams are used. These methods include: watershed management, dredging, density current venting and flushing. In flushing methods, the previously deposited sediment would be flushed from the reservoir by opening of the outlets. In the pressure flushing the amount of the flushed sediments depend on many parameters such as water depth on the <b>bottom</b> <b>outlets,</b> discharge released through <b>bottom</b> <b>outlets,</b> the size of the outlets, the geometry of the reservoir, the size and the kind of the deposited of the sediments in the reservoir.

40|$|ABSTRACT] Effective {{sediment}} {{control is}} required for the Bai-shi dam on the Dai-Ling-He River in China. The <b>bottom</b> <b>outlets</b> have been designed to discharge the sediment from the reservoir during floods using the two alternative gate operation methods: (a) venting density current and (b) drawdown-flushing. Using venting density current rule, the high concentration sediment can be discharged through the <b>bottom</b> <b>outlets.</b> Using drawdown-flushing rule, riverine flow runs on the reservoir bed and can flush out the sediment from the reservoir. This study presents numerical simulations using a two-dimensional mudflow model and a quasi-three dimensional flow and sediment transport model to predict the behavior of the sediment in the reservoir under the different gate operation rules...|$|R

30|$|Finally, the top <b>outlet</b> and all <b>bottom</b> <b>outlets</b> were opened, {{and cell}} lysates were {{retrieved}} through the <b>bottom</b> <b>outlets,</b> {{with the assistance}} of negative pressure, which was generated by an external syringe pump. The square cell lysate collecting chamber (1.5  mm in side length, 1  mm in depth and 2.25 µL in volume) was specially designed to be much larger than the cell trapping chamber. Each lysate collecting chamber covered 100 cell trapping chambers. By controlling the initial cell density, we realized that each lysate collecting chamber contains cell lysates from a few cells (<  4). As long as the ratio between EGFR-mutated and normal cells was more than 1 : 3, the mutated sequence could be detected by the Sanger’s sequencing method [32]. It meant that we could sequence all cells (<  4) from a chamber, which contained at least 1 EGFR-expressed cell, to detect if any specific mutation exists in EGFR-expressed cells.|$|R
