5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> information about the division between lines.|$|E

The rate of depurination (300 purine residues per genome per generation) is too high in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery, hence a possibility of an adaptive response cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{symmetry}} <b>breaking</b> <b>for</b> {{constraint satisfaction}} problems (CSPs) has attracted considerable attention. Various general schemes {{have been proposed}} to eliminate symmetries. In general, these schemes may take exponential space or time to eliminate all the symmetries. We identify several classes of CSPs that encompass many practical problems and <b>for</b> which symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>for</b> various forms of value or variable interchangeability is tractable using dedicated search procedures. We also show the limits of efficient symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>for</b> such dominance-detection schemes by proving intractability results for some classes of CSPs. ...|$|R

The episode was also released online before its original American broadcast. The episode was viewed by an estimated 11.44 million viewers and {{received a}} 3.8 rating/10 share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, making it the highest-rated NBC drama series premiere in four years and the third highest new drama debut of the 2011–12 television season. Despite this, viewership {{between the first and second}} half-hour dropped, significantly. The episode received positive reviews from critics and was named among the best pilots of the aforesaid television season.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak was {{appointed}} state Secretary of Education on October 5, 2005, by Governor Ed Rendell, following {{the resignation of}} former Secretary Francis Barnes. He was considered highly regarded by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers involved in education issues. During his Pennsylvania State Senate confirmation hearing in December 2005, Zahorchak said he supported the state's $44million Educational Improvement Tax Credit, which provides tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> businesses that support public education programs and private school scholarships. Zahorchak also said he believed basic education should be the state's primary fiscal educational investment, rather than special education or higher education. The Pennsylvania State Senate Education Committee unanimously approved Zahorchak during his confirmation hearing on December 13, 2005, and the full senate unanimously confirmed him on February 7, 2006.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

5|$|P Associates {{received}} {{final approval}} from the city zoning board and the historical commission in August 1999, but continued to seek more financing, which {{it was able to}} secure from Corus Bank of Chicago in September 2001. To develop the tower, now called The St. James, P Associates formed the St. James Associates Joint Venture with Clark Realty Capital LLC and Lend Lease Real Estate Investments, which represented an undisclosed client. With financial backing from its partners and tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> new residential construction passed in 2000, construction began on November 28, 2001. BACE Construction (Philadelphia based) was awarded the construction of the project. Philadelphia had not seen any residential high-rise development since the 1980s, and The St. James {{was one of the first}} to begin construction in the city, preceded only by the 16-story Residences at the Dockside, which broke ground in 2000. It became the largest residential building in the city.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{voted on}} {{multiple}} occasions in 2007—2012 to block measures {{that would have}} eliminated or reduced tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil and gas producers. For example, in January 2007, he voted against the Energy Independence and Security Act, which supporters said would have rescinded $14 billion in tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil and gas drillers. In February 2008, he voted against the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act, which supporters said would have eliminated $18 billion in tax benefits for oil companies and substituted tax credits for wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. In May 2008, he voted against the Energy Improvement and Extension Act, which supporters said contained provisions to cut tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil companies and to expand tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> alternative energies like solar and geothermal power, biodiesel fuels, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In July 2010, he voted against the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2009, which would have removed federal caps on oil companies' liability for oil spills, and would have cut certain tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil companies. In February 2011, he voted against a measure to reinstate royalties assessed for oil drilled when oil prices are high. In March, April, and May 2011, he voted against measures {{that would have allowed}} consideration of legislation to eliminate tax <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil companies and promote production and use of alternative energy sources.|$|E
