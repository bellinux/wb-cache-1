50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} to producing VCSELs, {{in contrast to}} the production process of edge-emitting lasers. Edge-emitters cannot be tested {{until the end of the}} production process. If the edge-emitter does not function properly, whether due to <b>bad</b> <b>contacts</b> or poor material growth quality, the production time and the processing materials have been wasted. VCSELs however, can be tested at several stages throughout the process to check for material quality and processing issues. For instance, if the vias, the electrical connections between layers of a circuit, have not been completely cleared of dielectric material during the etch, an interim testing process will flag that the top metal layer is not making contact to the initial metal layer. Additionally, because VCSELs emit the beam perpendicular to the active region of the laser as opposed to parallel as with an edge emitter, tens of thousands of VCSELs can be processed simultaneously on a three-inch gallium arsenide wafer. Furthermore, even though the VCSEL production process is more labor and material intensive, the yield can be controlled to a more predictable outcome.|$|R

The question of how invariant chain can bind to all MHC class II proteins is central to understanding these processes. We have employed molecular modeling to predict the structure of class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) -MHC protein complexes and to ask whether the predicted mode of association could be general across all MHC class II proteins. CLIP fits identically into the MHC class II alleles HLA-DR 3, I-Ak, I-Au, and I-Ad, with a consistent pattern of hydrogen bonds, contacts, and hydrophobic burial and without <b>bad</b> <b>contacts.</b> Our model predicts the burial of CLIP residues Met- 91 and Met- 99 in the deep P 1 and P 9 anchor pockets and other detailed interactions, which we have compared with available data.

The detected signal includes information from {{a greater proportion of}} the muscle of interest than conventional clinical EMG. However, recording with many electrodes simultaneously often implies bad-contacts, which introduce large power-line interference in the corresponding channels, and short-circuits that cause nearzero single differential signals when using gel.

Since it is not possible to protect against this fast thermal run-away, one has to limit the current to a level that is small enough so that a burn-through cannot occur. Prompt quenching of the joint, and quenching due to heat propagation through the bus and through the helium are considered.

Experiments were performed in temperature range 77 - 300 K and frequency range 0. 5 - 5000 Hz with multiterminal devices. The measured noise has been recognized as resistance noise that consists of background 1 /f noise and components generated by several thermally activated noise sources of different activation energies. The total noise has been composed of the contributions generated in resistive layer and in resistive/conductive layers interface. These noise sources are non-uniformly distributed in the resistor volume. Noise intensity of new resistive layers has been described by noise parameter, C bulk. Pb/Cd-free layers occurred to be noisier than their Pb-containing counterparts, however the remove of Pb and Cd from resistive composition is hardly responsible for the increase of the noise. In case of RuO 2 layers noise increases most likely due to larger grain size of RuO 2 powder used to prepare resistive pastes. The information about the quality of resistive-to-conductive layers interface occurred to be stored in the values of noise parameter C int.

A disadvantage of thermocouple thermometry, EM interference, is almost entirely eliminated by application of absorbing ferrite beads around the probe leads. We investigated the effect of remaining disturbance on the temperature decay after power-off, both experimentally in phantoms and in the clinic, and with numerical simulations. Probe and tissue characteristics influence the response time tau dist of the decay of the disturbance. In our clinical practice a normal pulse sequence is 50 s power-on, 10 s power-off: a response time longer than the power-off time results in a deflection of the temperature course at the start.

Using data from the Strategic National Arts Alumni Project (SNAAP), a series of chi-squared and means comparisons analyses were done to compare whether or not respondents provided an answer to three different open-ended questions throughout the survey.

40|$|As part of {{the project}} CarboTherm the Transient-Hot-Bridge (THB) method was used {{for the first time in}} order to measure the {{transverse}} thermal conductivity of fibrereinforced plastics. The sensors were laminated into the specimens. Measurements were also conducted on specimen-halves, in between which a sensor was clamped. The applicability of the THB-method on fibre-reinforced plastics was intended to be verified using the Guarded-Hot-Plate as well as the Laser-Flash method. Following this, the effects of different fibre volume fractions, laminate lay-ups, fibre types (glas-, PAN- and pitchfibres) as well as temperatures on the transverse thermal conductivity of fibre-reinforced plastics were to be investigated. During the first THB-measurements the measurment- and evaluation-software displayed the error message <b>Bad</b> Thermal <b>Contact</b> for almost all specimens. Experiences of the Physikalisch-Technische-Bundesanstalt, that provides the THB-equipment, suggested that a <b>bad</b> thermal <b>contact</b> between the sensors and the respective specimens were triggering the error message. Subsequently, the focus of this work drifted towards the assessment of causes and patching of the error message. Neither a digital-microscopical analysis on cross-sectional polishs of a specimen, with the sensor laminated within it’s lay-up, nor a quantification of the surface topography of the specimen-halves, in between which the sensor was clamped, provided any evidence for the presence of a <b>bad</b> thermal <b>contact</b> in the physical sense. An analysis of the source code of the THB-software revealed that a rigid bar was responsible for the reoccurring error message. Due to it’s constant ratio, with respect to the measurement time, the bar was misplaced for specimens with elevated values of thermal diffusivity and therefore falsely triggered the error message. The definition of the bar was improved whilst taking into account the thermal diffusivity of CFRPs. The modification of the source code was then verified on a reference material. By conducting a parameter study an ideal electric current intensity for measuring the thermal conductivity of the present CFRPs using the THB-method was determined. In addition, it was found that the measurement time has no impact on the result of the THB-measurement as long as the relevant range of measurement is covered. A comparison of the limited number of specimens suggests that the THB-method is indeed applicable on fibre-reinforced plastics. However, the value of the transverse thermal conductivity varies depending on whether the sensor is laminated into the specimen or clamped in between specimen-halves...|$|R

In Europe for example, they are called double or triple adaptors, and transform a one socket into a multiple socket. This has the advantage of connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6A 250V, 10A 250V, or 16A 250V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, if we have an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16A 250V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them. In the past, these adaptors were made from ceramic, Bakelite or other fire resistant plastics, but nowadays they are made from various available plastics that can be safely used in electrical devices (such as PA6, PVC, PP).
