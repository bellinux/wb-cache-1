40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we propose a pattern {{adaptive}} keypad interface for in-vehicle information system. The keypad interface recommends the estimated input sequence to fit the user’s preference based on individual model of operation pattern. Pattern (shape) of <b>button</b> <b>switches</b> corresponding to the estimated input sequence is actively reformed. <b>Button</b> <b>switches</b> are displayed tactilely and visually. Finger image is shown on the monitor in real-time in order to guide input operation on the tactile input device. To confirm the effect of the keypad interface, experiments are performed comparing with a touch screen on which pattern (shape) of <b>buttons</b> <b>switch</b> is unchanged. Index terms: Pattern adaptive, re-formable keypad, vehicle user-interface design, tactile input device. I...|$|R

5000|$|As {{with other}} shooter {{games on the}} system (such as Red Steel), the Wii remote is used to aim/shoot, while the nunchuk's control stick is used to move around. The Z button is used to jump/dash while the C button is used to lock-on to nearest enemy. The B button on the remote shoots the weapon on hand, and the minus <b>button</b> <b>switched</b> between weapons. Pressing the A button goes into melee mode, drawing your mobile suit's melee weapon. Swinging the remote {{vertically}} and horizontally attacks.Along with the shooter element, you also fight alongside up to two AI-controlled allies. Pressing the [...] "1" [...] <b>button</b> <b>switches</b> between nine different squad formations.|$|R
50|$|The {{push-button}} {{light switch}} has two buttons that alternatively close {{and open the}} contacts. Pushing the raised button opens or closes the contacts and pops out the previously depressed button so the process can be reversed.

5000|$|From 1933, {{the number}} of {{available}} voltage and current ranges in Universal Avometers was doubled by incorporating a dual sensitivity movement circuit. [...] The higher sensitivity was selected by a push <b>button</b> <b>switch</b> marked ÷2 (Divide by two) signifying that the pointer indication should be halved. For the Model 8, this feature was not used but the push button was retained for reversing the direction of deflection of the moving coil.|$|E

50|$|When {{electric}} headlights {{were introduced}} in 1915, the magneto was upgraded to supply enough power for the lights and horn. In {{the early years of}} Model T production, all Ts were started with a hand crank. Most cars sold after 1919 were equipped with an electric starter, which was engaged by a small round foot-operated <b>button</b> <b>switch</b> on the floor. In keeping with the goal of ultimate reliability and simplicity, the trembler coil and magneto ignition system was retained even after the car became equipped with a generator and larger battery for electric starting and lighting.|$|E
5000|$|The Kel-Lite was a highly-durable, weather- and {{shock-resistant}} flashlight (UK: torch), made {{of heavy}} 6061-T6 aluminium (commonly known as [...] "aircraft aluminium"). {{it was developed}} in 1968 by Donald Keller, a Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff, who had tired {{of the lack of}} durability of the generically available, cheap metal flashlights of the day. It was later (1973) redesigned by Norm Nelson into the modern version with a battery charger, adjustable lens, baton lights, push <b>button</b> <b>switch,</b> and in three sizes (DKL (D-Cell Kel-Lite), MKL (Medium Head Kel-Lite), SKL (Small Head Kel-Lite)), and penlight versions. The company merged in 1983 with Streamlight. Kel-Lite had manufacturing capability and Streamlight a marketing team.|$|E
5000|$|The S-5 was {{powered by}} a [...] Argus {{water-cooled}} engine turning a propeller Sikorsky designed and built himself. The fabric covering the wooden wings was tightened with pure alcohol and glue mixed with boiling water while the fuselage structure was left exposed. Instead of separate levers to control the elevator and ailerons as in his previous aircraft, Sikorsky designed a single control lever with a wheel allowing control of pitch and roll. This [...] "control column" [...] included a <b>button</b> <b>switch</b> to momentarily deactivate the ignition thereby controlling engine power. The S-5 was also built with reversed rudder controls because it better suited Sikorsky's tactility of the machine.|$|E

5000|$|A {{gravity knife}} is a knife with a blade {{contained}} in its handle, and which opens its blade {{by the force}} of inertia or gravity. [...] As the gravity knife requires gravity or spinning motion to propel the blade out of the handle, it differs fundamentally from the switchblade, which opens its spring-propelled blade automatically upon the push of a <b>button,</b> <b>switch,</b> or fulcrum lever. The main purpose of this opening method is that it allows opening and closing to be done one handed, in situations where the other hand is occupied. A major historical use has been in issue to parachutists to cut off their parachutes when tangled in a tree or in similar situations.|$|E
5000|$|Superimposed {{schedules}} {{of reinforcement}} are {{a type of}} compound schedule that evolved from the initial work on simple schedules of reinforcement by B.F. Skinner and his colleagues (Skinner and Ferster, 1957). They demonstrated that reinforcers could be delivered on schedules, and further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules. Rather than a reinforcer, such as food or water, being delivered every time {{as a consequence of}} some behavior, a reinforcer could be delivered after more than one instance of the behavior. For example, a pigeon may be required to peck a <b>button</b> <b>switch</b> ten times before food appears. This is a [...] "ratio schedule". Also, a reinforcer could be delivered after an interval of time passed following a target behavior. An example is a rat that is given a food pellet immediately following the first response that occurs after two minutes has elapsed since the last lever press. This is called an [...] "interval schedule".|$|E

The compression ratio was increased from 7:1 to 7.5:1 giving the special [...] over the standard 150's [...] The introduction of the 125 Special brought with it a further compression ratio increase up to 8:1 producing [...] over the [...] of the standard Li 125. The 125 Special along with the SX150 and SX200 featured a larger 20 mm Dell'Orto carburetor over the 18 mm carburetor found on the 150 Special. Although the 150 Special had a higher top speed the tuning improvements along with a new gearbox, which would later {{wind up in the}} DL/GP range of scooters, gave the 125 Special an advantage in acceleration. Between 1965 and 1969 a total of 29,841 Li 125 Specials were produced and were only available in light blue metallic (paint available from Lechler, code 8061) with white internals (petrol tank, air intake box, tool box, mudguard) and grey rubber trim. There were changes to the 125 Special during its 5 years of production the first of which was a change from a white <b>button</b> <b>switch</b> to black buttons sometime during 1966.|$|E

5000|$|In {{building}} the laboratory analogy of social traps, Brechner introduced {{the concept of}} [...] "superimposed schedules of reinforcement". Skinner and Ferster (1957) had demonstrated that reinforcers could be delivered on schedules (schedule of reinforcement), and further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules. Rather than a reinforcer, such as food or water, being delivered every time {{as a consequence of}} some behavior, a reinforcer could be delivered after more than one instance of the behavior. For example, a pigeon may be required to peck a <b>button</b> <b>switch</b> five times before food is made available to the pigeon. This is called a [...] "ratio schedule". Also, a reinforcer could be delivered after an interval of time passed following a target behavior. An example is a rat that is given a food pellet one minute after the rat pressed a lever. This is called an [...] "interval schedule". In addition, ratio schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable number of behaviors by the individual organism. Likewise, interval schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable intervals of time following a single response by the organism. Individual behaviors tend to generate response rates that differ based upon how the reinforcement schedule is created. Much subsequent research in many labs examined the effects on behaviors of scheduling reinforcers.|$|E
5000|$|NeWS {{included}} several libraries of user interface elements (widgets), themselves written in NeWS. These widgets ran {{all of their}} behaviour in the NeWS interpreter, and only required communications to an outside program (or more NeWS code) when the widget demanded it. For example, a toggle button's display routine can query the button's state (pressed or not) and change its display accordingly. The button's PostScript code can also react to mouse clicks by changing its state from [...] "pressed" [...] to [...] "not pressed" [...] and vice versa. All this can happen in the windowing server without interaction with the client program, and only when the mouse is released on the button will an event be sent off for handling. This was more sophisticated than the X Window System server model, which can only report [...] "mouse was pushed down here", [...] "mouse is now here", [...] "mouse was released here" [...] events to a client, which then has {{to figure out if}} the event is in the <b>button,</b> <b>switch</b> the state, and finally instruct the server to display the new state. If client and server are not on the same machine, these interactions must travel over the network, which results in a delay in responding.|$|E
40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in Memory & Cognition It has been proposed that a procedural-based classification system mediates the learning of informationintegration categories, whereas a hypothesis-testing system mediates the learning of rule-based categories. Ashby, Ell and Waldron (2003) provided support for this claim by showing that a <b>button</b> <b>switch</b> introduced during classification transfer adversely affected information-integration but not rule-based performance. Nosofsky, Stanton and Zaki (2005) showed that increasing “cognitive complexity ” can lead to <b>button</b> <b>switch</b> costs on rule-based performance. They argue that “cognitive complexity”, and not the existence of separable classification systems, accounts for Ashby et al’s empirical dissociation. The present study shows that experimental manipulations that increase “cognitive complexity ” often have dissociable effects on information-integration and rule-based classification that are predicted a priori from the processing characteristics associated with the procedural-based and hypothesis-testing systems. These results suggest that manipulations of “cognitive complexity ” can be dissociated, suggesting that “cognitive complexity ” in not a unitary construct that affects a single psychological process.
