40|$|AbstractConsidering {{the problem}} existed in {{open-loop}} identification method {{and the characters}} of sintering process such as time-delay, nonlinear and uncertainty, a closed-loop identification method of sintering process with part of the inputs controlled is proposed for <b>burn-through</b> <b>point</b> (BTP) control in this paper. Based on the mechanism analysis of the sintering process, two kinds of identification experiment situations have been discussed and an unbiased multiple input/output and auto-regressive with external predictive model of BTP for sintering process is established by adopting the closed-loop identification method to describe the dynamic characteristics of the sintering process. Results of industrial experiment show that the model obtained by closed-loop identification method has smaller predictive error and higher precision compared with that obtained by open-loop identification method...|$|E
40|$|Sintering is {{a complex}} {{industrial}} process that applies heat to fine particles of iron ore and other materials to produce sinter, a solidified porous material used in blast furnaces. The sintering process needs to be carefully adjusted, so that the combustion zone reaches {{the bottom of the}} material just before the discharge end. This is known as the burnthrough point. Many different parameters need to be finely tuned, including the speed and the quantities of the materials mixed. However, in order to achieve good results, sintering control requires precise feedback to adjust these parameters. This work presents a sensor to monitor the sintering <b>burn-through</b> <b>point</b> based on infrared thermography. The proposed procedure is based on the acquisition of infrared images {{at the end of the}} sintering process. At this position, infrared images contain the cross-section temperatures of the mixture. The objective of this work is to process this information to extract relevant features about the sintering process. The proposed procedure is based on four steps: key frame detection, region of interest detection, segmentation and feature extraction. The results indicate that the proposed procedure is very robust and reliable, providing features that can be used effectively to control the sintering process...|$|E
