His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the Occident and the Orient, although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the social Darwinist paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the Western civilisation. In the analysis of his findings, Weber maintained that Calvinist (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had had a major impact on the social innovation and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the rationalism of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and <b>bureaucratisation</b> of government administration and economic enterprise.

2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the attempted coup in 1965, {{the political situation}} was uncertain, but the Suharto's New Order found much popular support from groups wanting a separation from Indonesia's problems since its independence. The 'generation of 66' (Angkatan 66) epitomised talk of {{a new group of}} young leaders and new intellectual thought. Following Indonesia's communal and political conflicts, and its economic collapse and social breakdown of the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, [...] the [...] "New Order" [...] was committed to achieving and maintaining political order, economic development, and the removal of mass participation in the political process.

2500|$|In June 1941, {{a hostile}} review of The Managerial Revolution by Socialist Workers Party loyalist Joseph Hansen in the SWP's {{theoretical}} magazine accused Burnham of having lifted the central ideas {{of his book}} [...] "without acknowledging the source" [...] from the Italian Bruno Rizzi and his 1939 book La <b>Bureaucratisation</b> du Monde. Despite certain similarities, {{there is no evidence}} Burnham knew of this book beyond Leon Trotsky's brief references to it. Burnham was likely influenced by Rizzi negatively and secondhand, as Trotsky mentioned Rizzi's ideas in his debates with Burnham. Burnham's arguments stemmed partly from the idea of bureaucratic collectivism first introduced to Trotskyism by Yvan Craipeau, but in Burnham's case from a conservative Machiavellian rather than a Marxist viewpoint. This important philosophical difference, explored in greater detail in The Machiavellians, made Burnham's theory distinct from the similar concepts that had been developing in Trotskyist circles in the 1930s.|$|E

Fears arose that it could turn into the KGB of India.

The main controversy which has plagued R in recent years is over <b>bureaucratisation</b> of the system with allegations about favouritism in promotions, corruption, ego clashes, no financial accountability, inter-departmental rivalry etc. R also suffers from ethnic imbalances in the officer level. Noted security analyst and former Additional Secretary B.

50|$|By 1966, {{there were}} few senior leaders in China that {{questioned}} {{the need for a}} widespread reform to combat the growing problems of corruption and <b>bureaucratisation</b> within the Party and the government. With the goal of reforming the government to be more efficient and true to the Communist ideal, Liu himself chaired the enlarged Politburo meeting that officially began the Cultural Revolution. However, Liu and his political allies quickly lost control of the Cultural Revolution soon after it was called, as Mao used the movement to monopolize political power and to destroy his perceived enemies.|$|E
50|$|The French rail policy, {{once put}} in place, had its deficiencies, but one {{certainly}} cannot {{consider it a}} failure, and other powers attempting to encourage rail developments adopted {{many aspects of the}} French railway laws. The <b>bureaucratisation</b> and influence of special interests associated with all governments, even those of corporations, also negatively affected the French railways.

5000|$|In several works, {{including}} an essay written from jail and published posthumously by her last companion, Paul Levi (publication of which precipitated his expulsion from the Third International), titled The Russian Revolution, Luxemburg sharply criticized some Bolshevik policies, {{such as their}} suppression of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, {{their support for the}} partition of old feudal estates to peasant communes, and their policy of supporting the purported right of all national peoples to [...] "self-determination."

As a Marxist, Luxemburg said that the strategic (geopolitical) mistakes of the Bolsheviks would create great dangers for the Russian Revolution, such as the <b>bureaucratisation</b> that would arise to administrate the over-sized country that was Bolshevik Russia. In defence of the expedients of revolutionary practice, in [...] "Left-Wing" [...] Communism: An Infantile Disorder, Lenin criticised the political and ideologic points of anti-Bolshevik critics who claimed ideologically correct stances that were to the left of Lenin.|$|E
50|$|Land is the {{predominant}} focus of Western property law, particularly Australian property law. Legal developments {{in this field}} outweigh the development of other forms of property law, this is primarily due to the high value of land in comparison {{to other forms of}} property, such as chattels.Each state in Australia has a different regime for the regulation and <b>bureaucratisation</b> of land. It is a largely statute based area of the law but can still be influenced by the common law and principles that originate from Australia's history as a colony of the United Kingdom, where land and estate law developed through the ambit of feudalism.Property law is enabling in that it creates a system for evidencing, recognizing and transferring title to land, facilitating its use as an economic instrument. Other legal instruments in property law that facilitate the private and commercial dealing of land include the mortgage, lease, covenant and easement.|$|E
5000|$|Miller {{says that}} one of the {{defining}} characteristics of power in modern history has been the rationalisation and <b>bureaucratisation</b> of law. Legal codification, or at least debates over the merits of legal codification, became an almost global phenomenon in the nineteenth century as state power was centralised. In particular, the rationalisation of criminal law standardised not just the concept of crime, but was adopted as the means to eliminate the [...] "deviant" [...] as a threat to a modern, uniform, moral standard. In this, the religious establishment began to play a new role in defining [...] "evil" [...] in which threats to the political or social norm became as dangerous as threats to religious orthodoxy. Thus, political speech {{became one of the most}} likely activities to be criminalised. The freedom of association and to meet may also be criminalised if the purpose is to express oppositional political views.|$|E

5000|$|Identifying {{himself as}} a revolutionary, he didn't fight in the Second World War, because he {{believed}} that the National Liberation Front was working in favour of the self-exiled Greek government, in order to liberate the Greek middle class. In 1942, he met Cornelius Castoriadis and adopted his opinion on the <b>bureaucratisation</b> of the Communist Parties. Based on these positions, he quit Troskyism in 1947. Along with his comrades, Agis Stinas, Dimosthenis Voursoukis, Makris, Krokos, Castoriadis et al., he believed in the principles of defeatism and of revolutionary internationalism, by promoting an autonomous, self-organised society and asking for the alliance among all of the fighting soldiers. Due to this position, Tamtakos and his comrades were persecuted by the German occupiers, the Chites (Greek right-wing collaborators of the occupiers) and the Communists. He managed to escape assassination efforts by OPLA quite a few times [...] while he used several identities and nicknames during the period of the ideological cleansing.|$|E
5000|$|According to Vlasov {{the ritual}} of baptism and mass {{conversion}} undergone by Vladimir in 988 was never repeated again in the following centuries, and mastery of Christian teachings was never accomplished on the popular level even within {{the start of the}} twentieth century. According to him, a nominal, superficial identification with Christianity was possible with the superimposition of a Christianised agrarian calendar ("Christian-Easter-Whitsunday") over the indigenous complex of festivals, [...] "Koliada-Yarilo-Kupala". The analysis of the Christianised agrarian and ritual calendar, combined with data from popular astronomy, leads to determine that the Julian calendar associated with the Orthodox Church was adopted by Russian peasants between the sixteenth and seventeenth century. It was by this period that much of the Russian population became officially part of the Orthodox Church and therefore nominally Christians. This occurred as an effect of a broader complex of phenomena which Russia underwent by the fifteenth century, that is to say radical changes towards a centralisation of state power, which involved urbanisation, <b>bureaucratisation</b> and the consolidation of serfdom of the peasantry.|$|E

50|$|The present {{decision-making}} {{system of}} the European Union is different from a classic parliamentary democracy, tested and proven by history. In a normal parliamentary system, part of the MPs support the government and part support the opposition. In the European Parliament, this arrangement has been missing. Here, only one single alternative is being promoted, and those who dare think about a different option are labelled as enemies of European integration... There {{is also a great}} distance (not only in a geographical sense) between citizens and Union representatives, which is much greater than is the case inside the member countries. This distance is often described as the democratic deficit, the loss of democratic accountability, the decision-making of the unelected - but selected - ones, as <b>bureaucratisation</b> of decision-making etc. The proposals to change the current state of affairs - included in the rejected European Constitution or in the not much different Lisbon Treaty - would make this defect even worse. Since there is no European demos - and no European nation - this defect cannot be solved by strengthening the role of the European Parliament, either.|$|E
50|$|WWF {{has called}} for radical reform of the fire service, which has been weakened, since 1981, by {{political}} interference in recruitment and promotion, <b>bureaucratisation,</b> the removal of fire-fighting responsibilities from the forestry service and abolition of the dasokommando, which is a Greek specialised fire-fighting unit. According to Konstantinos Liarikos, environmental programme director of WWF, part of the existing fire service needs to be especially dedicated to forest fire-fighting, and emphasis should be on suppression rather than prevention: the cost of hiring an Erickson Air-Crane Helitanker fire-fighting helicopter is 800,000 euros a season, and {{is equivalent to the}} cost of hiring 800 seasonal fire-fighters, which WWF claims would be more effective. In addition, citizen awareness programmes are needed to educated suburban residents about fire prevention and fire-fighting. For example, the connection of electric pumps to swimming pools to help residents to use water for dousing fires. Planting fire-resistant tree species in gardens, such as bay laurel, poplar, acacia and oak, can also help save homes. In 2007, fires spread more slowly in rural areas of the Peloponnese where a farming population kept areas well-managed and clear of grass.|$|E

[...] "One does find early expressions of such perspectives in (William) Morris and the Socialist Party of Great Britain (the SPGB), then again around the events of 1905, with the growing concern at the <b>bureaucratisation</b> and de-radicalisation of international socialism". Morris established the Socialist League in December 1884, which was encouraged by Friedrich Engels and Eleanor Marx. As the leading figure in the organization Morris embarked on a relentless series of speeches and talks on street corners, in working men's clubs and lecture theatres across England and Scotland. From 1887, anarchists began to outnumber socialists in the Socialist League. The 3rd Annual Conference of the League, held in London on 29 May 1887 marked the change, with {{a majority of the}} 24 branch delegates voting in favor of an anarchist-sponsored resolution declaring that [...] "This conference endorses the policy of abstention from parliamentary action, hitherto pursued by the League, and sees no sufficient reason for altering it."
