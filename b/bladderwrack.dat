50|$|The {{fifteen-spined stickleback}} {{is native to}} coastal waters in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean where it lives among <b>bladderwrack</b> and eel grass.|$|E
50|$|Fucus radicans is morphologically {{similar to}} <b>bladderwrack</b> (Fucus vesiculosus) which is dichotomously branched, and has brown {{leathery}} fronds known as thalli with a prominent midrib and globular air bladders. The main {{differences between the}} two are that plants of F. radicans are smaller and more bushy than F. vesiculosus and have narrower thalli. <b>Bladderwrack</b> is common on the foreshore {{on both sides of the}} temperate North Atlantic and the subarctic. F. radicans is endemic to the Baltic Sea, where it grows alongside F. vesiculosus.|$|E
50|$|Fucus gardneri is {{a species}} of seaweed, a brown alga living on the {{littoral}} shore of the Pacific coasts of North America. It has the common names of rockweed and <b>bladderwrack.</b>|$|E
5000|$|F. lumbricalis {{is also an}} {{important}} habitat-forming seaweed, forming underwater [...] "belts" [...] often just below those of <b>bladderwrack.</b> These belts provide spawning habitat for many fish species, and for this reason some governments place regulations on the harvesting of this seaweed.|$|E
50|$|Fucoidan is a sulfated {{polysaccharide}} (MW: average 20,000) found {{mainly in}} various species of brown algae and brown seaweed such as mozuku, kombu, <b>bladderwrack,</b> wakame, and hijiki (variant forms of fucoidan {{have also been}} found in animal species, including the sea cucumber). Fucoidan is used as an ingredient in some dietary supplement products.|$|E
50|$|Fucus vesiculosus, {{known by}} the common name bladder wrack or <b>bladderwrack,</b> is a seaweed found on the coasts of the North Sea, the western Baltic Sea, and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, also {{known by the}} common names black tang, rockweed, bladder fucus, sea oak, black tany, cut weed, dyers fucus, red fucus, and rock wrack. It was the {{original}} source of iodine, discovered in 1811, and was used extensively to treat goitre, a swelling of the thyroid gland related to iodine deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fifteen-spined stickleback}} is a solitary fish and a {{predator}} that lurks among concealing vegetation ready {{to pounce on}} plankton and fish fry which drift too close. Breeding takes place in May and June among <b>bladderwrack,</b> the male building a nest out of bits of seaweed. He then guards the eggs and fans them with his fins until they hatch. He continues {{to care for the}} fry until they have absorbed the contents of their egg yolks and can feed for themselves. It is thought that the adult females die after spawning.|$|E
50|$|Seaweed, {{particularly}} <b>bladderwrack,</b> kelp or laminaria, can {{be either}} applied to the soil as a mulch (although it will tend to break down very quickly) or {{can be added to}} the compost heap, where it is an excellent activator. A perhaps less serious potential problem with seaweed is its salt content. While it is unlikely to add sufficient seaweed to seriously upset the balances of salt in the soil, it is not liked by worms, who will not live in it. It can be hosed down before adding to the soil to reduce the salt content, or left to be desalinated by rainwater. Rinsing seaweed is risky as valuable alginates are potentially lost to runoff.|$|E
50|$|Being {{intermediate}} between sea {{and fresh}} water, the Baltic Sea, {{and especially the}} Gulf of Bothnia, has a low biodiversity and supports {{only a small number}} of plant and animal species that have been able to adapt to this level of salinity. Those that are present tend to be smaller than in their main habitats, be those marine or freshwater biomes. <b>Bladderwrack</b> (F. vesiculosus) has a wide distribution and is present in quantities in the Baltic Sea where it lives side by side with the very similar F. radicans. Studies to find their evolutionary relationship using chloroplast (RuBisCO gene) or mitochondrial DNA (intergenic spacer) sequence markers have been inconclusive. Genetic analysis using microsatellite markers (short DNA sequences) suggests that a divergence between the two species occurred between 125 and 2475 years ago with a posterior distribution peak at around 400 years ago. This means the species would have diverged more recently than the transition of the Baltic Sea from a marine environment to its present brackish state. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that F. radicans is found nowhere else other than the Baltic.|$|E
40|$|Silver is {{commonly}} used in clothes, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products as well as water refinement products these days. With the increased usage of silver there is an increased risk {{that the amount of}} silver in nature raises and that it affects ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems have shown {{to be sensitive to the}} toxic effects of the silver. The <b>bladderwrack</b> (Fucus vesiculosus) is one of the most important species in the Baltic Sea and is of major importance for the survival of other species. The purpose of the study is to increase the knowledge of colloidal silver toxic effects on the <b>bladderwrack.</b> This study measures the stress level and leakage of pigment of the <b>bladderwrack</b> which has been exposed to different levels of colloidal silver. The study was conducted at Askö laboratory during the period 19 / 4 to 25 / 4 - 2017. The results show that colloidal silver has a significant stressful effect on <b>bladderwrack,</b> especially at the higher levels. During a period of three days, significant values of the higher concentration, was found over three consecutive measurement events. Thereafter the <b>bladderwrack</b> recovers. A second study of two and a half days shows two significant values in succession, with a subsequent weak rejuvenation at higher levels. The study also shows that the stress level varies over time. Measures on the water that the bladderwrak laid in during the stress measurements showed that the <b>bladderwrack</b> released more dye, the higher the concentration of colloidal silver to which they were exposed. Despite the low sample size, the <b>bladderwrack</b> shows signs of stress but after multiple test corrections the values ​​were not significant. The Baltic Sea has aggravating factors such as slow water exchange, low salinity and a lot of pollution. Resistance is low. The <b>bladderwrack</b> is a structurally important species in the Baltic Sea ecosystem. If larger colloidal silver is released due to increased use, there is a risk that the <b>bladderwrack</b> may be stressed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Rates of estrogen-dependent cancers {{are among}} the highest in Western {{countries}} and lower in the East. These variations may be attributable to differences in dietary exposures such as higher seaweed consumption among Asian populations. The edible brown kelp, Fucus vesiculosus (<b>bladderwrack),</b> as well as other brown kelp species, lower plasma cholesterol levels. Since cholesterol is a precursor to sex hormone biosynthesis, kelp consumption may alter circulating sex hormone levels and menstrual cycling patterns. In particular, dietary kelp may be beneficial to women with or at high risk for estrogen-dependent diseases. To test this, <b>bladderwrack</b> was administered to three pre-menopausal women with abnormal menstrual cycling patterns and/or menstrual-related disease histories. Case Presentation Intake of <b>bladderwrack</b> was associated with significant increases in menstrual cycle lengths, ranging from an increase of 5. 5 to 14 days. In addition, hormone measurements ascertained for one woman revealed significant anti-estrogenic and progestagenic effects following kelp administration. Mean baseline 17 β-estradiol levels were reduced from 626 ± 91 to 164 ± 30 pg/ml (P = 0. 04) following 700 mg/d, which decreased further to 92. 5. 0 ± 3. 5 pg/ml (P = 0. 03) with the 1. 4 g/d dose. Mean baseline progesterone levels rose from 0. 58 ± 0. 14 to 8. 4 ± 2. 6 ng/ml with the 700 mg/d dose (P = 0. 1), which increased further to 16. 8 ± 0. 7 ng/ml with the 1. 4 g/d dose (P = 0. 002). Conclusions These pilot data suggest that dietary <b>bladderwrack</b> may prolong the length of the menstrual cycle and exert anti-estrogenic effects in pre-menopausal women. Further, these studies also suggest that seaweed may be another important dietary component apart from soy that is responsible for the reduced risk of estrogen-related cancers observed in Japanese populations. However, these studies will need to be performed in well-controlled clinical trials to confirm these preliminary findings. </p...|$|E

40|$|Overfishing and {{eutrophication}} affects {{coastal communities}} worldwide, leading to dwindling fish stocks and deteriorated habitats. Hence, attempts to rebuild overfished stocks to past fish productivities need {{to account for}} functional relations between habitat types and fish performance. Here we quantify resource availability, foraging performance and anti-predator behaviour of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to assess {{the costs and benefits}} associated with different coastal habitats. In the laboratory, Atlantic cod foraged more efficiently in sand habitats compared to the structurally more complex habitats of eelgrass (Zostera marina) and the canopy forming <b>bladderwrack</b> (Fucus vesicolosus). Presence of chemical cues from a cannibal reduced Atlantic cod consumption rates in all habitats, but most pronounced in the sand habitat. Field observations in the three habitats showed highest resource density in the <b>bladderwrack</b> habitat and lowest in the sand habitat, irrespective of season. Habitat profitability, calculated by combining data from field estimates of prey density and experimental quantifications of foraging performance, revealed the <b>bladderwrack</b> habitat most profitable independent of season. The difference in profitability between the complex habitats was relatively small, suggesting that Atlantic cod in the field contributed to drive habitat profitability towards equalization. The results strengthen the view that the ongoing loss of seagrass and macroalgae habitats may have significant ramifications for juvenile Atlantic cod performance, which ultimately may lower the productivity of entire stocks. Consequently, future and ongoing rebuilding of commercial fish stocks should revise the expectations of stock productivity (and hence harvesting intensity) accordingly...|$|E
40|$|The {{last century}} {{has seen the}} north east coast of England heavily aected by {{anthropogenic}} activities, none more notable than the coal mining industry, and the millions of tonnes of colliery waste estimated to have been dumped every year. Since {{the decline of the}} industry and subsequent remedial work carried out by the Turning the Tide Partnership, investigation of the coastline has been minimal. The purpose of this investigation is to consider the industrial forcing of the natural ecosystem which exists along the north east coast of England, and analyse the impacts of remediation in accelerating the recovery of the area from a state of economic exploitation, to natural habitat and environmental resource. Giusti et al. (1999) conducted a study which collected heavy metal data from the shell and tissue material of Mytilus edulis (the blue mussel) at five coastal locations along the north east of England, during the early stages of remediation (December 1997). A second study (Giusti, 2001) monitored the heavy metal contamination of Fucus vesiculosus (<b>bladderwrack)</b> along the coast during the same period. This investigation has provided comparative heavy metal data to these baselines, allowing assessments of the level of recovery to be made, while highlighting current areas of concern and the implications of post-remediation activity. The concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cd were determined in both the soft tissue and shell material of the blue mussel and common limpet (Patella vulgata) at several sites between Whitburn and the Tees estuary. <b>Bladderwrack</b> is included as a sensitive short term indicator of water based heavy metal contamination. Although the investigation finds that the long term metal contamination of the coastline has decreased, a change in the spatial pattern of pollution is observed, manifested by an increase in metal concentrations at the Tees estuary site of Bran Sands. The mobilisation and transport of offshore sediment is discussed as a possible causal factor. High levels of iron and manganese are recorded in all three indicators, suggesting an aqueous source. These high values include a 9 -fold increase in iron contamination of <b>bladderwrack</b> (to ∼ 9, 000 mg kg- 1), and a 12 -fold increase of manganese in <b>bladderwrack</b> at Roker estuary (to ∼ 1, 600 mg kg- 1). Subsequently, tentative links are drawn to the pumping of treated minewater into the sea at Horden and Dawdon...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the production of}} ERM®-CD 200, a powdered <b>bladderwrack</b> material (Fucus vesiculosus) certified for the mass {{fraction of the total}} content of As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se and Zn. The material was produced following ISO Guide 34 : 2009. Approximately 60 kg of brown algae seaweed (<b>bladderwrack,</b> Fucus vesiculosus) was collected in Galway (Ireland) and processed at IRMM (Belgium) to produce a certified reference material (CRM) of seaweed powder. The produced vials containing the processed seaweed were carefully capped, sealed and stored for further certification studies. Between-unit homogeneity was quantified as well as stability during dispatch and storage in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006. Within-unit homogeneity was also quantified to determine the minimum sample intake. The material was characterised by an inter-laboratory comparison among laboratories of demonstrated competence and adhering to ISO/IEC 17025. Technically invalid results were removed but no outlier was eliminated on statistical grounds only. Uncertainties of the certified values were calculated in compliance with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) including uncertainty contribution related to possible heterogeneity and instability of the material {{as well as to the}} characterisation. The material is intended for the quality control and assessment of method performance. As any reference material, it can also be used for control charts or validation studies. The CRM is available in amber glass vials containing approximately 5 g of dried powder, placed in aluminized polythene sachet closed under a nitrogen atmosphere. The minimum amount of sample to be used is 200 mg. The CRM was accepted as European Reference Material (ERM®) after peer evaluation by the partners of the European Reference Materials consortium.

Parasite control in aquaculture is over reliant on a limited range of treatments {{which tend to be}} low in efficacy, toxic to hosts and have negative consequences on human health and the environment. Here, we tested 22 botanical treatments alongside five controls against Gyrodactylus turnbulli (Harris 1986), in vitro and in vivo, infecting guppies (Poecilia reticulata Peters 1859). Survival of detached parasites was significantly reduced by all treatments with cajuput oil, bay rum oil, <b>bladderwrack,</b> octanoic acid, pine tree oil and barberry killing worms instantly. In vivo, cajuput oil applied with emulsifier was as effective as a licensed livestock dewormer, Levamisole, which is not routinely prescribed for use in fish; hence, cajuput can be considered for further research to replace Levamisole in UK research laboratories as well as in ornamental aquaculture...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{evaluated}} {{performance of}} species distribu-tion models for predictive mapping, and how models {{can be used}} to integrate human pressures into ecological and economic assessments. A selection of 77 biological vari-ables (species, groups of species, and measures of biodi-versity) across the Baltic Sea were modeled. Differences among methods, areas, predictor, and response variables were evaluated. Several methods successfully predicted abundance and occurrence of vegetation, invertebrates, fish, and functional aspects of biodiversity. Depth and substrate were among the most important predictors. Models incorporating water clarity were used to predict increasing cover of the brown alga <b>bladderwrack</b> Fucus vesiculosus and increasing reproduction area of perch Perca fluviatilis, but decreasing reproduction areas for pikeperch Sander lucioperca following successful imple-mentation of the Baltic Sea Action Plan. Despite variability in estimated non-market benefits among countries, such changes were highly valued by citizens in the three Baltic countries investigated.

30|$|Different {{frameworks}} {{have been}} suggested to motivate citizen observers. Reddy et al. ([2010 a]) presented a recruitment framework for identifying potential participants for data collections, and Juong-Sik and Hoh ([2010]) discussed an incentive mechanism for stimulating participatory sensing applications. Micro-payments as an incentive mechanism are explored by Reddy et al. ([2010 b]). We used a simple motivation mechanism in which users received notifications about the algae situation and reminders to contribute to observations. In the future, more efforts are needed to recruit suitable observers and to motivate them to continue making observations. Sunyoung et al. ([2011]) suggest that creating a successful citizen sensing application requires the application to be designed together with various stakeholders and ensuring that the gathered data can be put to use. Currently, {{as part of the}} MARMONI EU Life+ project ([URL] representatives of non-governmental organizations and school teachers are trained to make algae (cyanobacterial bloom and <b>bladderwrack</b> occurrence) and Secchi depth observations.

40|$|Abstract Background Owing {{to their}} roles in tissue remodelling in health and disease, several studies have {{reported}} investigations on plant extracts as inhibitors of proteinases and as anti-oxidants. Methods The anti-ageing and anti-oxidant properties of 23 plant extracts (from 21 plant species) were assessed as anti-elastase and anti-collagenase activities and in selected anti-oxidant assays along with phenolic content. Results Anti-elastase activities were observed for nine of the extracts with inhibitory activity in the following order: white tea (~ 89 %), cleavers (~ 58 %), burdock root (~ 51 %), <b>bladderwrack</b> (~ 50 %), anise and angelica (~ 32 %). Anti-collagenase activities were exhibited by sixteen plants of which the highest activity was seen in white tea (~ 87 %), green tea (~ 47 %), rose tincture (~ 41 %), and lavender (~ 31 %). Nine plant extracts had activities against both elastase (E) and collagenase (C) and were ranked {{in the order of}} white tea (E: 89 %, C: 87 %) > <b>bladderwrack</b> (E: 50 %, C: 25 %) > cleavers (E: 58 %, C: 7 %) > rose tincture (E: 22 %, C: 41 %) > green tea (E: 10 %: C: 47 %) > rose aqueous (E: 24 %, C: 26 %) > angelica (E: 32 %, C: 17 %) > anise (E: 32 %, C: 6 %) > pomegranate (E: 15 %, C: 11 %). Total phenolic content varied between 0. 05 and 0. 26 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) /mL with the exception of white tea (0. 77 mg GAE/mL). For anti-oxidant assessment, the Trolox equivalent anti-oxidant capacity (TEAC) assay revealed activity for all extracts. White tea had the highest activity equivalent to ~ 21 μM Trolox for a 6. 25 μg aliquot. In addition, seven extracts exhibited activities = 10 μM Trolox with witch hazel (6. 25 μg = 13 μM Trolox) and rose aqueous (6. 25 μg = 10 μM Trolox) showing very high activities at low concentrations. A high activity for white tea was also found in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay in which it exhibited ~ 88 % inhibition of reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium. High activities were also observed for green tea (86. 41 %), rose tincture (82. 77 %), witch hazel (82. 05 %) and rose aqueous (73. 86 %). Conclusion From a panel of twenty three plant extracts, some one dozen exhibit high or satisfactory anti-collagenase or anti-elastase activities, with nine having inhibitory activity against both enzymes. These included white tea which was found to have very high phenolic content, along with high TEAC and SOD activities. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Baltic Sea is {{considered}} an ecological marginal environment, where both marine and freshwater species struggle to adapt to its ever changing conditions. Fucus vesiculosus (<b>bladderwrack)</b> is commonly seen as the foundation species in the Baltic Sea, {{as it is the}} only large perennial macroalgae, forming vast belts down to a depth of about 10 meters. The salinity gradient results in an increasing salinity stress for all marine organisms. This is commonly seen in many species as a reduction in size. What was previously described as a low salinity induced dwarf morph of F. vesiculosus was recently proved to be a separate species, when genetic tools were used. This new species, Fucus radicans (narrow wrack) might be the first endemic species to the Baltic Sea, having separated from its mother species F. vesiculosus as recent as 400 years ago. Fucus radicans is only found in the Bothnian Sea and around the Estonian island Saaremaa. The Swedish/Finnish populations have a surprisingly high level of clonality. As much as up to 80 % of the individuals on the Swedish side are clones, dominated by one female clone that has been found over a range of 550 km. In spite of this ability to asexual propagation, we do not find F. radicans further south than Öregrund in Sweden, and even further north in Finland. I attempt to find out why...|$|E

Although this enzyme constitutes a plausible target in treatment of advanced cancer, {{there are few}} known LDH-A inhibitors. Study Design: In this work, we utilized a high-throughput enzyme micro-array format to screen and evaluate > 900 commonly used medicinal plant extracts (0. 00001 -. 5 mg/ml) for capacity to inhibit activity of recombinant full length human LDHA; EC. 1. 1. 1. 27. Methodology: The protein sequence of purified enzyme was confirmed using 1 D gel electrophoresis- MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, enzyme activity was validated by oxidation of NADH (500 μM) and kinetic inhibition established {{in the presence of}} a known inhibitor (Oxalic Acid). Results: Of the natural extracts tested, the lowest IC 50 s [< 0. 001 mg/ml] were obtained by: Chinese Gallnut (Melaphis chinensis gallnut), <b>Bladderwrack</b> (Fucus vesiculosus), Kelp (Laminaria Japonica) and Babul (Acacia Arabica). Forty-six additional herbs contained significant LDH-A inhibitory properties with IC 50 s [< 0. 07 mg/ml], some of which have common names of Arjun, Pipsissewa, Cinnamon, Pink Rose Buds/ Petals, Wintergreen, Cat’s Claw, Witch Hazel Root and Rhodiola Root. Conclusion: These findings reflect relative potency by rank of commonly used herbs and plants that contain human LDH-A inhibitory properties.

40|$|Multiple {{global and}} local {{stressors}} threaten {{populations of the}} <b>bladderwrack</b> Fucus vesiculosus (Phaeophyceae). Baltic F. vesiculosus populations presumably have a lower genetic diversity compared to other populations. I investigated the adaptive potential under multifactorial environmental change in F. vesiculosus germlings. Effects of warming and acidification were crossed during one year at the two levels “present” and “future” (according to the year 2110) at the “Kiel Outdoor Benthocosms” by applying delta-treatments. Effects of warming varied with season while acidification showed generally weak effects. The two factors “ocean acidification and warming” (OAW) and nutrients were crossed showing that nutrient enrichment mitigated heat stress. Germlings previously treated under the OAW x nutrient experiment were subsequently exposed to a simulated hypoxic upwelling. Sensitivity to hypoxia was enhanced by the previous OAW conditions. Difference {{in the performance of}} genetically different sibling groups and diversity level were observed indicating an increased adaptive potential at higher genetic diversity. Different sibling groups were analysed under multiple factors to test correlations of genotypic sensitivities. Sensitivity towards warming, acidification and nutrient enrichment correlated positively while sensitivities towards OAW and hypoxia showed a negative correlation demonstrating that genotypes previously selected under OAW are sensitive to hypoxic upwelling. In a literature review, responses of marine organisms to climate change were analysed through different levels of biological organisation showing that climate change has different effects on each single level of biological organisation. This study highlights that global change research requires an upscaling approach with regard to multiple factors, seasons, natural fluctuations, different developmental stages and levels of biological organisation {{in the light of the}} adaptive potential...|$|E
40|$|The Baltic Sea is a {{brackish}} semi-enclosed water volume with {{a pronounced}} latitudinal gradient in salinity and temperature. Climate change projections for the Baltic Sea ecosystem include; increased water temperatures, increased eutrophication, increased occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms and a probable change in salinity. Higher water temperature {{will increase the}} metabolic rate {{of plants and animals}} which, together with eutrophication, will benefit fast growing, filamentous algae and thereby cause a reduction in the population of the important species <b>bladderwrack</b> (Fucus vesiculosus). The coast around the Baltic Sea is heavily exploited by humans, especially the sheltered, shallow areas where shore meadows are usually found. Since human structures and buildings will also be affected by a sea level rise, there might be an intensified conflict between human interests and conservation of coastal habitats in the future. Terrestrial shoreline habitats in the Baltic Sea show large geographic differences but species rich shore meadows are present everywhere along the coastline. The Baltic Sea region is {{under the influence of the}} last ice age with isostatic rebound still causing land uplift in the northern and central parts of the area. Climate change is constantly moving the equilibrium line between isostatic rebound and sea level rise northwards. Since many species in shoreline ecosystems depend on that new land continuously rise from the sea the composition of species will likely change radically due to rising sea levels. Further, a decrease in sea ice cover together with increased wind speeds during winter might enhance the ice scouring and disturbance in coastal habitats in the northern Baltic Sea. At the same time the management (grazing and hey making) of shore meadows along the Baltic shoreline has almost stopped which has decreased the diversity of plants and insects. The lack of management together with climate change and further fragmentation of valuable habitats will probably produce ecosystems that in the future will be dominated by relatively few generalist species.

40|$|Although {{conditions}} for aquaculture in Uganda and East-Africa are favourable, production remains low. One {{of the primary}} limitations to aquaculture development {{in the region is}} the lack of economical aquafeeds produced from local raw materials. In this thesis, four experiments were conducted to contribute to the solution of this problem: 1) Defining the optimum experimental design in fish growth studies (i. e., the number of fish and replication level of treatments) and the best statistical methods to analyse the results. Variance estimates from 24 growth studies were similar, hence experiments set in triplicates and with n of 50 - 100 are recommended for all fish growth studies. A mixed model ANOVA is suitable for analyzing dose response data. 2) Studying the effects of dietary lipid oxidation on farmed fish. The results suggest that lipid oxidation does not affect the growth of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in ponds where they have access to plankton rich in vitamin E. 3) Comparing the effects of the commonly used ethoxyquin (EQ) and novel antioxidants in aquafeeds, rosemary oil (RM; Rosmarinus officinalis) and <b>bladderwrack</b> (BW; Fucus vesiculosus), on farmed fish and their efficacy in preventing oxidation of fish oil. The results suggest that RM can be as effective in preventing oxidation of oils as EQ. Moreover, RM appears to promote better growth than does either EQ or BW. 4) Testing locally available ingredients as alternative protein sources to replace fish meal in aquafeeds. The results suggest that the meal made from the freshwater shrimp Caridina nilotica, a by-catch from pelagic fisheries, is economically viable replacement ingredient for Rastrineobola argentea fishmeal currently used in aquafeeds. The results of these experiments provide useful information for the future development of aquaculture in Uganda and in other parts of East-Africa.

Further, the Habitats Directive (HD) calls for the protection of important habitats and species (many of which are marine) and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive for sustainability in the use of resources and human activities at sea and by the coasts. To efficiently protect important marine habitats and communities, we need knowledge on their spatial distribution. Ecological knowledge is also needed to assess the status of the marine areas by involving biological indicators, as required by the WFD and the MSFD; knowledge on how biota changes with human-induced pressures is essential, but to reliably assess change, we need also to know how biotic communities vary over natural environmental gradients. This is especially important in sea areas such as the Baltic Sea, where the natural environmental gradients create substantial differences in biota between areas. In this thesis, I studied the variation occurring in macroalgal communities across the environmental gradients of the northern Baltic Sea, including eutrophication induced changes. The aim was to produce knowledge to support the reliable use of macroalgae as indicators of ecological status of the marine areas and to test practical metrics that could potentially be used in status assessments. Further, the aim was to develop a methodology for mapping the HD Annex I habitat reefs, using the best available data on geology and bathymetry. The results showed that the large-scale variation in the macroalgal community composition of the northern Baltic Sea is largely driven by salinity and exposure. Exposure is important also on smaller spatial scales, affecting species occurrence, community structure and depth penetration of algae. Consequently, the natural variability complicates the use of macroalgae as indicators of human-induced changes. Of the studied indicators, the number of perennial algal species, the perennial cover, the fraction of annual algae, and the lower limit of occurrence of red and brown perennial algae showed potential as usable indicators of ecological status. However, the cumulated cover of algae, commonly used as an indicator in the fully marine environments, showed low responses to eutrophication in the area. Although the mere occurrence of perennial algae did not show clear indicator potential, a distinct discrepancy in the occurrence of <b>bladderwrack,</b> Fucus vesiculosus, was found between two areas with differing eutrophication history, the Bothnian Sea and the Archipelago Sea. The absence of Fucus from many potential sites in the outer Archipelago Sea is likely due to its inability to recover from its disappearance from the area 30 - 40 years ago, highlighting the importance of past events in macroalgal occurrence. The methodology presented for mapping the potential distribution and the ecological value of reefs showed, that relatively high accuracy in mapping can be achieved by combining existing available data, and the maps produced serve as valuable background information for more detailed surveys. Taken together, the results of the theses contribute significantly to the knowledge on macroalgal communities of the northern Baltic Sea that can be directly applied in various management contexts...|$|E
40|$|Herbivory is an {{important}} biotic factor affecting algal biomass, abundance, and distribution. Especially in marine habitats, herbivores often consume 50 - 100 % of the macroalgal production. Algae are not only passive player in this interac-tion but have evolved a variety of strategies to cope with herbivory. One strat-egy is the production of chemical metabolites that function as defense against consumers. These metabolites can either be continuously present at bioactive concentrations (constitutive defense), or be produced ‘on demand’, i. e. when appropriate cues indicate presence of consumers (inducible defense). Ecologi-cal theory postulates that inducible defense should be favoured when the de-fense incurs costs to algal fitness, when the presence of herbivores is variable or when increased chemical variability enhances its effectiveness. In vascular plants, the occurrence and mechanisms of inducible defense are well documented. However, the prevalence of defense induction, the cues triggering in-duction, the interactions with other factors like stress, and the temporal dynam-ics of defense induction in macroalgae are generally not well understood. This thesis investigated the prevalence of defense induction {{and the nature of}} the inducing cues in the macroalgal species Fucus serratus, Fucus evanescens (Phaeophyceae), Delesseria sanguinea, Phyllophora pseudoceranoides, and Furcellaria lumbricalis (Rhodophyta) (Chapter I). These species are widely dis-tributed perennial seaweeds of the western Baltic and represent important habi-tats for many associated species. Also, the efficiency of two proposed induction cues, direct grazing and waterborne cues, were investigated. All tested red algae, D. sanguinea, P. pseudoceranoides and F. lumbricalis, in-duced defense in response to direct grazing. The brown algae F. evanescens and F. serratus also showed induced effects but these were not always signifi-cant in different types of feeding assays. This study supports recent findings that defense regulation in marine macroalgae is a rather common phenomenon, especially in the Baltic Sea. My further experiments focused on the <b>bladderwrack</b> Fucus vesiculosus. Its populations in the Baltic have declined strongly from the 1970 s. This decline has been attributed to eutrophication leading to light limited conditions and associated changes in competitive interactions and grazing pressure. However, these statements are based on observational data without support of experi-mental evidence. This study demonstrated that F. vesiculosus in the Kiel Fjord is already light limited in 2 m water depth and its lethal depth limit lies between 4 - 6 m depth (Chapter II). Epibionts enhance the negative effect of reduced light conditions. The reduced depth distribution and consequently the massive biomass loss of the Fucus-population in the Baltic may be enhanced by the det-rimental effects of herbivores which stresses the ecological importance of algal resistance to consumption. Algal physiology and alga-herbivore interactions can be affected by abiotic factors. However, the interactions of environmental stress and defense, in particu-lar defense induction, have not been assessed so far. Climatic models predict a water temperature increase of ca. 4 °C for the Baltic. This would lead to water temperatures comparable to those at Fucus’ southern distribution limit. They can, thus, be expected to represent a physiological stress for Fucus. To assess the interactive effects of reduced light and increased temperatures on the de-fensive performance of F. vesiculosus, I conducted a two-factorial experiment, which showed that reduced light conditions reduced growth rates significantly but had no effect on inducible defense at ambient temperatures (15 °C), and that the predicted summer warming suppressed induced defensive responses completely. This study is one of the first that shows that abiotic stress can affect alga-herbivore interactions and therefore indirectly macroalgal population dy-namics. The coevolution of algal defense and herbivore tolerance of the defenses can result in high species specificities of the interactions. Temporal dynamics of induction and relaxation of defense may therefore be tuned the typical activity patterns of locally important herbivore species. This project identified the tempo-ral dynamics of antifeeding defense regulation in a marine macroalga, F. vesiculosus in response to its main consumer, the isopod Idotea baltica. Time lag of induction and relaxation of induced feeding resistance were assessed. F. vesiculosus induced defense 10 days after the onset of grazing by the isopod Idotea baltica. Defenses were relaxed within 2 - 4 days after cessation of grazing. Thus, defense seems to be deployed sparingly and only induced in longer periods of high grazing pressure to avoid substantial loss of tissue. This thesis gives new insights in the prevalence and the variability of induced resistance and its interactions with other biotic and abiotic factors, a study field which this thesis has started to examine. Also, I present a possible scenario what effects the predicted climate changes may have on the interactions of F. vesiculosus and its consumer I. baltica and how these changes may consequently affect the Fucus-populations in the Baltic...|$|E
