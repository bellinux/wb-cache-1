40|$|AbstractThe {{manufacturing}} process of large crankshafts {{is affected by}} undesirable <b>bending</b> of the <b>shaft</b> blank at the heating and heat treatment stages, {{as well as at}} the forging step. In line elimination of the <b>shaft</b> blank <b>bending</b> is a time consuming and expensive operation. Identification of reasons of the <b>shaft</b> <b>bending</b> and identification of possibilities of avoiding this bending is an important theoretical and practical problem. In previous works, the Authors developed the finite element model and applied this model to optimization of the forging process and to predict microstructure evolution. The model was extended to predict <b>bending</b> of <b>shaft</b> and applied in the present work to simulate the influence of various parameters of forging on <b>shaft</b> <b>bending.</b> The work is devoted to further extension of the model by including deformation of the crankshaft during heat treatment after forging. The model estimates the contribution of the elastic-plastic deformation, including thermal expansion and dilatometric effect due to transformations, on the deformation and <b>bending</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> This process generates also residual stresses. The aim of the paper was to simulate phenomena occurring during heat treatment. A program based on the finite element method was developed to solve the three-dimensional thermal and mechanical problems. Shaft material model was developed and the elastic-plastic characteristics were implemented in the FE code. Heat exchange with the cooling medium and the dependence of thermal properties on temperature and heat of phase transformations were accounted for in a solution of the thermal problem. Dilatometric tests were performed to supply data for identification of the phase transformation model during cooling. The results of calculations of <b>bending</b> of <b>shaft</b> during the process of heat treatment, as well as the distribution of residual stresses and strains are presented in the paper. The calculations were performed for several modes of the heat treatment. Parameters affecting <b>bending</b> of the <b>shaft</b> were identified...|$|R

Simulation results for the blade <b>bending</b> and <b>shaft</b> torsional vibration are studied using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the JTFA. The FFT spectra showed little information on the nonlinear dynamic interaction between the blade <b>bending</b> and the <b>shaft</b> torsional vibration; and thus cannot {{be used as a}} tool for monitoring the blade vibration by looking into the shaft torsional vibration signal. In contrast, the JTFA in the form of Wigner Ville Distribution (WVD) has given more useful information and reflected the dynamic interaction between different vibration modes on one side and between the blade vibration and the shaft torsional vibration on the other side.

The set-up natural frequencies and mode shapes are found using the ANSYS finite element package. The blades and shaft lateral and torsional vibration are monitored using blades strain-gages, bearing accelerometers and shaft torsional strain-gages stations. The {{results showed that}} the shaft torsional vibration measurement represents the blade(s) vibration more closely than the bearing accelerometers. In particular, the blades vibration at low frequencies corresponding to the blades <b>bending</b> and <b>shaft</b> torsional coupled modes is closely represented by the shaft torsional vibration signals.

The coupled equations of motion are linearized based on the small deformation theory for the blade <b>bending</b> and <b>shaft</b> torsional deformation to enable calculation of the system {{natural frequencies}} for various combinations of system parameters. The obtained coupled eignvalue system is ready for use as a reference for comparison for larger size finite element simulations and for the use as a fast check on natural frequencies for the coupled blade <b>bending</b> and <b>shaft</b> torsional vibrations in the design and diagnostics processes.

40|$|A {{flexible}} deflection sensor for elastic shaft {{with the}} capability of measuring the amplitude and direction of bending is introduced in this paper. A thin force sensing resistors (FSR) film is taken as its basic material, which is sandwiched by an elastomer layer and {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) with detecting electrode grids. Two fix rings are used to fix the three thin components perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the flexible shaft. When the <b>shaft</b> <b>bends</b> under forces, the fix rings will generate a normal pressure on FSR, which will cause the change of the resistance. Therefore, the amplitude of bending can be got based on the value of resistance. The electrode grid on the PCB is divided into four detection areas used to estimate the distribution of normal pressure on the FSR; thus the <b>bending</b> direction of <b>shaft</b> can also be obtained. Test results of a prototype (140 [*]mm in length) show that the amplitude of deflection can reach 30 [*]mm and the sensitivities of sensor are 40. 37, 32. 8, 37. 77, and 39. 47 [*]mV/mm in the four directions, respectively.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>shaft</b> <b>bending</b> on the coupling vibration of rotor-blades system is nonignorable. Therefore, this paper analyzed the {{influence of}} <b>shaft</b> <b>bending</b> on the coupling vibration of rotor-blades system. The vibration mode function of shaft under elastic supporting condition was also derived to ensure accuracy of the model as well. The influence {{of the number of}} blades, the position of disk, and the support stiffness of shaft on critical speed of system was analyzed. The numerical results show that there were two categories of coupling mode shapes which belong to a set where the blade’s first two modes predominate in the system: shaft-blade (SB) mode and interblade (BB) mode due to the coupling between blade and shaft. The BB mode was of repeated frequencies of (Nb- 2) multiplicity for number blades, and the SB mode was of repeated frequencies of (2) multiplicity for number blades. What is more, with the increase of the number of blades, natural frequency of rotor was decreasing linearly, that of BB mode was constant, and that of SB mode was increasing linearly. Natural frequency of BB mode was not affected while that of rotor and SB mode was affected (changed symmetrically with the center of shaft) by the position of disk.

40|$|The role of {{the shaft}} in the golf swing {{has been the subject}} of {{scientific}} debate for many years but there is little consensus regarding the effects of altering <b>shaft</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness. The aim of this thesis was to determine and explain the effects of changes in shaft stiffness on body kinematics, shaft strain and key performance indicators including club head speed, impact location on the club face and launch conditions. For this purpose, three clubs matched in all properties but <b>shaft</b> <b>bending</b> stiffness (l-flex (217 cpm), r-flex (245 cpm) and x-flex (272 cpm)) were instrumented with strain gauges. In an initial study, seventeen male golfers (handicap 1. 8 ± 1. 9) tested these clubs, but no shaft effects on body kinematics, club head speed and ball launch conditions were identified. A follow-up study involved twenty skilled players (handicap 0. 3 ± 1. 7), testing only the l- and x-flex clubs. Two optical motion capture systems were used to determine wrist angular kinematics, club head presentation and the ball's impact location on the club face. There was an effect of shaft stiffness on ball and club head speed, both of which increased by 0. 7 % for the l-flex club (p = 0. 008 and < 0. 001, respectively). Two factors contributed to these increases: (i) a faster recovery of the l-flex shaft from lag to lead bending just before impact (p < 0. 001); (ii) an increase of 0. 5 % in angular velocity of the grip of the l-flex club at impact (p = 0. 005). A difference in angular wrist kinematics between the two clubs was identified for two swing events and may have contributed to the increase in angular velocity. The face angle (p = 0. 176) and the ball's impact location (p = 0. 907 and p = 0. 774) were unaffected by changes in shaft stiffness. Decreases in shaft stiffness were associated with significantly more <b>shaft</b> <b>bending</b> at the transition from backswing to downswing (p < 0. 001), but the amount of lead bending at impact was found to be largely unaffected by shaft stiffness. The test protocol from the follow-up study was repeated using a golf robot, confirming the results for ball speed and wrist kinematics if the impact speed was set to replicate the mean club head speed achieved by the human players. Results from this thesis contradict the conventional view that reducing shaft stiffness leads to an increase in lead bending at impact and, consequently, to an increase in ball launch angle. Overall, these results suggest that it is unlikely that changes in overall shaft stiffness in themselves have a marked effect on driving performance.
