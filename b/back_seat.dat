Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to Latonia Race Track, the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks.|$|E

Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing DeSimone had deliberately left the car overnight he {{decided to try to}} move it to allow the delivery through.

But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the <b>back</b> <b>seat,</b> Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
5|$|Spottiswoode {{tried to}} {{innovate}} {{in the action}} scenes. Since the director felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the remote-controlled car, which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put the steering wheel on the <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing {{a member of the}} public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water.|$|E
40|$|On 1 January 1990, the {{presence}} of seat belts on the <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of new (imported) passenger cars was stipulated by law and on 1 April 1992 the use of rear seat belts when present was made compulsory. This report contains: a) the annual survey conducted since 1989 into {{the presence}} and use of both seat belts {{on the front and}} <b>back</b> <b>seats,</b> and of child restraint systems on the rear seats of cars; and b) an evaluation study into the effect of the introduction of the law on the use of seat belts on the <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of cars. The most important results are as follows: (1) From the year 1991 to 1992, a large increase in the percentage of seat belt use on <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> when a seat belt was present; on city roads from 15 % to 31 %, on rural roads from 12 to 37 %. The percentage is still low; (2) As regards the front seat in the given period, the percentage increased from 62 % to 66 % in built-up areas and on rural roads no significant change was found, around 80 %; (3) More than 90 % of the drivers and back-seat passengers knew about the law on rear-seat belt use; (4) About 80 % of the persons interviewed have seen publicity regarding seat belts on television; (5) Around 50 % of drivers and back-seat passengers said they 'forgot' to use their seat belts; and (6) around 70 % of the persons interviewed would like an automatic signal to tell them when the seat belt was not used. It was concluded that the possibilities for increasing the use of seat belts in front and <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> of cars are great. Recommendations were given regarding information campaigns, police enforcement, social coercion and technical provisions...|$|R

5|$|The Five {{was among}} the myriad of {{subjects}} Tchaikovsky discussed with his benefactress, Nadezhda von Meck. By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of fortification. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took a <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to his official duties {{as a professor of}} chemistry.|$|E

As he and Megan eat in the restaurant, Megan expresses her {{frustration}} at having her needs and desires take a <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> to Don's. The discussion escalates into a fight, during which Megan makes a hurtful remark about Don's mother, and Don storms out and drives off without her. Don returns sometime later and begins to worry when he can't find Megan. He spends hours looking for and waiting for her, calling Peggy (the {{other side of the}} conversation from {{the first part of the}} episode) as well as Megan's mother in Montreal.|$|E

Pretending to have come across the disorientated officer purely by chance, Diamond and Johnny drop Ross off at his home. Later, Williams is brought before the hijackers' wealthy ringleader, Miles (Ferdy Mayne), who warns her not to betray the gang to the authorities.|$|E
