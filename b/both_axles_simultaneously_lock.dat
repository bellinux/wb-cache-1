5000|$|When a Torsen {{differential}} is employed, the slower-moving wheel always receives more torque {{than the}} faster-moving wheel. The Torsen T-2R RaceMaster {{is the only}} Torsen to have a preload clutch. So, even if a wheel is airborne, torque {{is applied to the}} other side. If one wheel were raised in the air, the regular Torsen units would act like an open differential, and no torque would be transferred to the other wheel. This is where the parking brake [...] "trick" [...] can help out. If the parking brake is applied, assuming that the parking brake applies even resistance to each side, then the drag to the airborne side is [...] "multiplied" [...] through the differential, and TBR times the drag torque is applied to the other side. So, the ground side would see (TBR X drag torque) minus drag torque, and that may restore motion either forward or in reverse. In Hummer/HMMWV applications, there are both front and rear Torsen differentials, so the use of the main brakes will operate this [...] "trick" [...] on <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> <b>simultaneously.</b>|$|R
25|$|Elsewhere, signals {{controlling}} sidings {{were controlled}} by keys which <b>simultaneously</b> <b>locked</b> or unlocked the point levers. Thus {{there was no}} point rodding.|$|R
500|$|VTT: Vanaja tandem-telillä; [...] "Vanaja driven tandem"; lorry with a tandem {{of which}} <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> are driven (6×4) ...|$|R
5000|$|Check {{weighing}} <b>both</b> <b>axle</b> {{weights and}} gross vehicle weights. This helps to stop axle overloading and possible heavy fines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Both</b> <b>axles</b> were rigid, {{featuring}} semi-elliptic springs. The steering-axles {{were located}} at the extremes, decreasing the transmission of road shocks to the driver's hands.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} of the range had leaf springs on <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b> Brakes were hydraulic /air brakes (SM6) and compressed air brakes (SM7 and SM8).|$|R
50|$|Power {{door locks}} (also known as {{electric}} door locks or central locking) allow the driver or front passenger to <b>simultaneously</b> <b>lock</b> or unlock {{all the doors}} of an automobile or truck, by pressing a button or flipping a switch.|$|R
50|$|The car’s braking {{technology}} features four-wheel EDS (electronic {{differential locks}} on <b>both</b> <b>axles)</b> and XDS (expanded electronic differential lock), the ESC electronic stability programme and the multi-collision brake.|$|R
5000|$|The {{truck had}} a single-disc {{manually-operated}} clutch. [...] The suspension {{was made of}} leaf springs on <b>both</b> <b>axles,</b> with hydraulic dampers. The steering was a recirculating ball type.|$|R
50|$|In heavy trucks tandem {{refers to}} two closely spaced axles. Legally {{defined by the}} {{distance}} between the axles (up to 2.5 m in the European Union, 40-96 inches in the United States), mechanically there are many configurations. Either or <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> may be powered, and often interact with each other. In the United States <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> are typically powered and equalized, in the European Union one axle is typically unpowered, and can often be adjusted to load, and even raised off the ground, turning a tandem into a single-axle.|$|R
50|$|The truck has an {{independent}} front suspension with coil springs and wishbones. At the rear it mounts a beam axle with leaf springs instead of the coil springs used by the similarly designed Super Goélette. It has telescopic dampers on <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b> The transmission is a rear-wheel drive system with a fully synchronised 4-speed gearbox. The drivetain has a double universal joint on the normal chassis and a triple universal joint with relay shaft on the long and extra long. Brakes are drums on <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b> The steering system is a gammer worm and roller.|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} design, an M4, or Mid-engine, Four-wheel-drive layout {{places the}} {{internal combustion engine}} {{in the middle of the}} vehicle, between <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> and drives all four road wheels.|$|R
50|$|Two {{independent}} diesel-mechanical drive units, e.g. from MAN, run {{either on}} diesel fuel or Biodiesel from rape seed oil, each drive <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> {{on one of}} the two bogies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Both</b> <b>axles</b> were rigid, {{equipped}} with semi-elliptic springs. The steering-axles {{were designed to}} minimise transmission of road shocks to the driver. The steering column was inclined backwards unlike the vertical shaft on many of its contemporaries.|$|R
50|$|The 5-speed {{transmission}} is fully synchronised. The vehicle is also {{equipped with a}} two-speed reduction gear. <b>Both</b> <b>axles</b> are driven and equipped with lockable differentials. The suspension consists of longitudinally mounted leaf springs and two-way acting telescopic shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|As {{development}} was heavily focused on reducing weight and increasing structural strength, the body construction uses {{a combination of}} carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP), high-tensile steel and aluminium. The suspension received air springs at <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> that are adjustable with electronic shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were 2 <b>axle</b> {{machines with}} <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> {{powered by a}} Poyaud (SSCM) diesel engine via a Voith hydraulic transmission. Locomotives were later re-engined (1997) with lower emission RVI engines; when re-engined locomotives received the green SNCF Fret livery.|$|R
50|$|The 14 was a larger-engined {{and longer}} {{version of the}} 9/21 with the engine now made by Henry Meadows, but {{probably}} to the Dorman design used previously. The gearbox now had four speeds. The suspension used half-elliptic springs on <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Both</b> <b>axles</b> (one driving per {{coach at}} the inner end) were fitted {{directly}} to the chassis rather than being mounted on bogies, leading to a rather rough ride especially over pointwork, because of this the units were generally less popular with passengers.|$|R
500|$|No. 163 was {{equipped}} with two [...] NEBB GLM1303 motors, one on each bogie that powered <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b> This caused problems because the monomotor required the wheels to be ground regularly to avoid uneven driving, {{but this was not}} discovered until 1941. It weighed [...]|$|R
5000|$|The wheel size is 7.5-20" [...] {{and each}} wheel {{is held in}} place with ten nuts. <b>Both</b> <b>axles</b> on the bogie are fitted with double wheels as {{standard}} other than on the K-44ST, which made do with single wheels on the non-driven rearmost axle.|$|R
2500|$|When a four-wheeled vehicle has torque {{supplied}} to <b>both</b> <b>axles,</b> this {{is described as}} [...] "all-wheel drive" [...] (AWD). However, [...] "four-wheel drive" [...] typically refers {{to a set of}} specific components and functions, and/or intended offroad application, which generally complies with modern use of the terminology.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the engine}} {{there is a}} dry {{single-plate}} clutch and six-speed gearbox that was made by ZF. The vehicle {{is equipped with a}} two-step reduction gear that doubles the number of gears. <b>Both</b> <b>axles</b> are rigid and driven and equipped with air S cam drum brakes.|$|R
50|$|The four-wheel {{independent}} suspension featured a double wish-bone layout {{at the front}} and trailing arms at the rear. <b>Both</b> <b>axles</b> comprised rigid sub frames that gave the car unmatched ride quality and road holding for the time, even on its narrow tires (factory-mounted Michelin ZX 145SR15).|$|R
5000|$|No. 163 was {{equipped}} with two [...] NEBB GLM1303 motors, one on each bogie that powered <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b> This caused problems because the monomotor required the wheels to be ground regularly to avoid uneven driving, {{but this was not}} discovered until 1941. It weighed 13.44 t.|$|R

50|$|In 1982, Mini 4WD was {{produced}} by Tamiya. These toys were battery-powered vehicles that ran {{on a pair of}} AA battery and featured four-wheel drive. They were driven by a single motor that turned <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b> Of the first vehicles were a Ford Truck and a Chevrolet Truck.|$|R
25|$|The key {{constraint}} in {{this approach}} was that it had limited traction because of the single driver. These locomotives were equally characterized by <b>both</b> <b>axles,</b> powered or unpowered, being of equal size. Even though the locomotive had the 2-2-0 designation, the leading axle was unpowered and not a lead truck.|$|R
50|$|Gearboxes are six/seven speed dual-clutch automatic, six speed {{manual and}} CVT (the latter only {{available}} in a liquefied petroleum gas version sold in South Korea). Suspension is made of Pseudo McPherson struts on front and a semi rigid axle on rear, with an optional active suspension system. Brakes are discs on <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
25|$|The trains {{feature a}} {{hydraulic}} transmission, supplied by Voith {{which is a}} three-speed type, with integral hydrodynamic braking (rated at 750kW short term, 420kW continuous). These trains are the only diesel-powered high-speed trains {{in the world with}} diesel-hydraulic transmission. One bogie per coach is powered, with <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> driven. Total vehicle weight is 278 tonnes.|$|R
2500|$|... "A1A-B+B" [...] {{means there}} are three trucks. The first truck has three axles, with the center one unpowered. A pair of two-axle trucks, each with <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> powered, are {{connected}} by a span bolster under {{the rear of the}} unit. The only example to date of this arrangement was a single experimental EMD SDP45.|$|R
50|$|A monomotor is a train design where {{a single}} {{traction}} motor powers {{two or three}} axles in the same bogie. Conventional bogie design involves either having one motor for each axle, or having one or more axles unpowered. The monomotor design causes the motor to give <b>both</b> <b>axles</b> {{the same number of}} revolutions per minute.|$|R
50|$|The chassis was a tubular {{spaceframe}} {{based on}} the Dino 246, but was stretched for a 2550.20 mm wheelbase {{to make room for}} the second row of seats. The suspension was fully independent, with double wishbones, anti-roll bars, coaxial telescopic shock absorbers and coil springs on <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b> Niki Lauda helped set up the chassis.|$|R
50|$|The rear tandem beam {{assembly}} was {{a center}} pivot type, with <b>axles</b> on <b>both</b> {{ends of the}} beam. A dual tire wheel was {{on both ends of}} <b>both</b> <b>axles,</b> with a beam on each side there were also 4 wheels per axle line. Twenty-four 8.25x15” tires on demountable rims were used, two on each wheel.|$|R

50|$|The {{cars in the}} Biturbo {{family were}} of unibody steel construction, with a {{conventional}} layout of front-longitudinally mounted engine and gearbox. Suspension was of the MacPherson strut type upfront and semi-trailing arms at the rear, with coil springs, double-acting dampers and anti-roll bars on <b>both</b> <b>axles.</b> The differential and rear suspension arms were supported by a subframe.|$|R
