The algorithm involves the detection of the periodicity of the body’s accelerations, and the detected periods are then fused to form an estimate of exercise rate.

40|$|Recently, {{microwave}} communication {{networks have}} been shown to be valuable tools for rainfall monitoring, based on the well-known Power-Law which relates rain-rate to attenuation in microwave frequencies. However, once precipitation other than pure rain exists (e. g., snow), the Power-Law relation is no longer accurate. In this paper we propose a model which relates the induced attenuation to rain, snow, and sleet. Based on this model we propose estimating the total accumulated precipitation, regardless of the precipitation type, using measurements from multiple microwave links. Our technique takes advantage of the commercial communication networks, need for redundancy, which dictates the use of multiple microwave links at the same area.

40|$|Titanium is a {{material}} that exhibits many desirable properties including {{a very high}} strength to weight ratio and corrosive resistance. However, the specific properties of any components depend upon the microstructure of the material, which varies by the manufacturing process. This means it is often necessary to analyse the microstructure when designing new processes or performing quality assurance on manufactured parts. For Ti 6 Al 4 V, grain size analysis is typically performed manually by expert material scientists as the complicated microstructure of the material means that, to the authors knowledge, no existing software reliably identifies the grain boundaries. This manual process is time consuming and offers low repeatability due to human error and subjectivity.

The results of applying this technique are evaluated by comparing the measurements obtained by different analysis methods. <b>By</b> <b>using</b> <b>measurements</b> <b>from</b> a complete manual segmentation as a benchmark we explore {{the reliability of the}} current manual estimations of grain size and contrast this with improvements offered by our approach...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} problem of {{estimating}} the state of a system with perspective outputs, whose state is known to satisfy a set of quadratic constraints. We construct a dynamical system that produces an estimate of the state that satis£es the constraints and is “most compatible ” with the dynamics, {{in the sense that it}} requires the least amount of noise energy to explain the measured output. We apply these results to the estimation of position and orientation of a controlled rigid body, using measurements from a charged-coupled-device (CCD) camera attached to the body. The main contribution of this work is the inclusion of state constraints in the minimum-energy formulation. In the context of our application, these constraints allow us to avoid singularities that previous minimum-energy controllers encountered. The results are validated experimentally <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>measurements</b> <b>from</b> a CCD camera mounted on a mobile robot to estimate its position and orientation.

40|$|Successful {{and high}} {{precision}} localization {{is an important}} feature for autonomous vehicles in an urban environment. GPS solutions are not good {{on their own and}} laser, sonar and radar are often used as complementary sensors. Localization with these sensors requires the use of techniques grouped under the acronym SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping). These techniques work by comparing the current sensor inputs to either an incrementally built or known map, also adding the information to the map. Most of the SLAM techniques assume the environment to be static, which means that dynamics and clutter in the environment might cause SLAM to fail. To ob-tain a more robust algorithm, the dynamics need to be dealt with. This study seeks a solution where measurements from different points in time can be used in pairwise comparisons to detect non-static content in the mapped area. Parked cars could for example be detected at a parking lot <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>measurements</b> <b>from</b> several different days. The method successfully detects most non-static objects in the different test datasets from the sensor.

The OMNI database has been used for observations of the solar wind and the Geotail satellite for magnetospheric measurements. In addition, the event was modelled by the GUMICS- 4 MHD simulation. The simulation of the PCB location was in a rather good agreement with the experimental estimates at the EISCAT longitude. During the first three substorm expansion phases, neither the local observations nor the global simulation showed any poleward motions of the PCB, even though the electrojets intensified. Rapid poleward motions of the PCB took place only in the early recovery phases of the substorms. Hence, in these cases the nightside reconnection rate was locally higher in the recovery phase than in the expansion phase. In addition, we suggest that the IMF B z component correlated with the nightside tail inclination angle and the PCB location with about a 17 -min delay from the bow shock. By taking the delay into account, the IMF northward turnings were associated with dipolarizations of the magnetotail and poleward motions of the PCB in the recovery phase.

Studies have suggested that most of this transport is carried out either by tropical convection over the South Asian monsoon region or by extratropical convection over southern China. <b>By</b> <b>using</b> <b>measurements</b> <b>from</b> the newly available National Aeronautics and Space Administration Aura Microwave Limb Sounder, along with observations from the Aqua and Tropical Rainfall-Measuring Mission satellites, we establish that the TP provides the main pathway for cross-tropopause transport in this region. Tropospheric moist convection driven by elevated surface heating over the TP is deeper and detrains more water vapor, CO, and ice at the tropopause than over the monsoon area. Warmer tropopause temperatures and slower-falling, smaller cirrus cloud particles in less saturated ambient air at the tropopause also allow more water vapor to travel into the lower stratosphere over the TP, effectively short-circuiting the slower ascent of water vapor across the cold tropical tropopause over the monsoon area. Air that is high in water vapor and CO over the Asian monsoon/TP region enters the lower stratosphere primarily over the TP, and it is then transported toward the Asian monsoon area and disperses into the large-scale upward motion of the global stratospheric circulation. Thus, hydration of the global stratosphere could be especially sensitive to changes of convection over the TP...|$|E

Recall from Section ‘Platoon dispersion theory in transportation engineering’ that existing models for platoon dispersion assume that vehicle speeds from an upstream point to a downstream point are unchanged. These speeds are then used to derive σ (which is used to derive Smoothing Factor R in Equation 2), that subsequently determines dispersion phenomena. Anomalies in the dispersion phenomena naturally provide an ideal foundation for detecting Sybil attacks in theory. However, in practice, vehicle do not travel with constant speed and speed can vary widely between vehicles.
