40|$|This Guide to the {{international}} <b>banking</b> <b>statistics</b> is intended to serve two main purposes: firstly, to provide reporting countries with definitions and guidelines for the reporting of data; secondly, to give {{a detailed account of}} current country practices regarding the coverage and disaggregation of the reported data. The Guide describes two statistical systems, the locational <b>banking</b> <b>statistics</b> and the consolidated <b>banking</b> <b>statistics.</b> It replaces the previous issue (July 2000) and includes numerous changes and updates to the tables on countries' reporting practices. The locational <b>banking</b> <b>statistics,</b> which are described in Part I, gather quarterly data on international financial claims and liabilities of bank offices resident in the reporting countries broken down by currency, sector and country of residence of counterparty, and by nationality of reporting banks. In this system, both domestic and foreign-owned banking offices in the reporting countries record their positions on a gross (unconsolidated) basis, including those vis-à-vis own affiliates, which is consistent with the principles of national accounts, balance of payments and external debt statistics. The statistics were introduced with a breakdown by major individual currencies and a partial sectoral and geographical breakdown {{at the beginning of the}} 1970 s to provide information on the development and growth of the eurocurrency markets. In the subsequent years, the issue of recycling oil-related surpluses and the accompanying rise in international indebtedness shifted the emphasis in favour of a more detailed geographical breakdown and of flow data. The outbreak of the debt crisis in the early 1980 s stimulated further efforts to refine both the geographical coverage of the data and the estimates of exchange rate adjusted flows. In the early 1990 s, strong interest arose in making use of these statistics to improve the coverage and accuracy of the recording of balance of payments transactions. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990 s the locational <b>banking</b> <b>statistics</b> became an important component of the Joint BIS-IMF-OECD-World Bank Statistics on External Debt, which were developed in response to requests for dissemination of more timely external debt indicators. The consolidated <b>banking</b> <b>statistics,</b> which are described in Part II, collect quarterly data on banks' international financial claims broken down by remaining maturity and sector of borrower. In addition, they include information on exposures by country of immediate borrower and on the reallocation of claims (ie risk transfers) to the country of ultimate risk. The latter is defined as the country where the guarantor of a claim resides. The data mainly cover claims reported by domestic bank head offices, including the exposures of their foreign affiliates, and are collected on a worldwide consolidated basis with inter-office positions being netted out. The statistics also provide separate data on international claims of foreign bank offices whose head offices are located outside the reporting countries on an unconsolidated basis. The statistics were introduced as a semiannual reporting exercise in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s to provide information on the country risk exposures of major individual nationality banking groups to developing countries. Following the financial crises in emerging economies in the late 1990 s, the consolidated <b>banking</b> <b>statistics</b> were enhanced to include complete country coverage of banks' on-balance sheet exposures, separate country data on an ultimate risk basis and a move to a quarterly reporting frequency. In response to recommendations of a working group of the CGFS, and in order to maintain the consolidated <b>banking</b> <b>statistics</b> as a key source of public information on international financial market developments, it is planned to improve the measurement of commercial banks' consolidated country risk exposures on an ultimate risk basis. Consequently, the statistics will, as from end- 2004, cover more detailed and comprehensive data on country risk exposures inclusive of derivatives and other off-balance sheet positions. Part III of this Guide provides a glossary of terms used in the locational and consolidated <b>banking</b> <b>statistics,</b> while part IV contains a list of international organisations (Appendix 1) and official monetary authorities (Appendix 2). Beginning in 1998, the BIS has invited a number of additional countries, in particular from emerging markets, to participate in {{the international}} <b>banking</b> <b>statistics.</b> This is intended to further increase the global coverage of the statistics. So far, 12 economies have joined the locational (Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Guernsey, India, Isle of Man, Jersey, Panama, Portugal, Taiwan (China) and Turkey) and nine have joined the consolidated (Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, Taiwan (China), and Turkey) <b>banking</b> <b>statistics,</b> with more countries expected to be included in the near future. The Guide has been prepared with the assistance of the central banks or official authorities contributing to the two sets of international <b>banking</b> <b>statistics.</b> The BIS is grateful to all these institutions for their cooperation and valuable advice in its preparation. ...|$|E
40|$|Summary Over the years, the Committee on the Global Financial System {{has been}} the {{designated}} central bank oversight body for the BIS international <b>banking</b> <b>statistics.</b> A guiding presumption of the Committee is that the statistics should be updated {{from time to time}} so as to ensure that they remain a key source of public information on international financial market developments. As a result, the Committee has supported initiatives such as the triennial survey of global derivatives markets (first conducted in 1995). The Committee has also provided impetus for improvements in existing BIS international <b>banking</b> <b>statistics,</b> for example more timely assembly and release of data, a move to quarterly frequency for the consolidated statistics and the compilation of "ultimate risk basis" statistics in the consolidated statistics. Against this background, in autumn 1999 the Committee established a working group with the task of examining the desirability of modifying the BIS <b>banking</b> <b>statistics,</b> most notably so as to capture derivatives exposures, which had expanded in recent years to constitute a significant proportion of banks’ total cross-border exposures, and enhance details in the statistics as requested by some official sector users. ...|$|E

Full details are provided on the new approach to calculating transactions and growth rates and the conceptual advantages of this approach. The new framework should provide users with a more detailed, clearer and easily accessible picture of the underlying financing activity through the banking sector in Ireland. Several uses of the data are also explored in the paper, including a more refined sectoral approach to the analysis of credit flows to the real economy, rather than the broad private-sector credit (PSC) approach that was frequently used in the past. Recent developments in household and corporate deposits are also discussed. One of the main advantages of the new Money and <b>Banking</b> <b>Statistics</b> is the direct comparability with similar measures for the euro area. This allows for the credit boom and subsequent downturn witnessed in Ireland in the past decade to be meaningfully placed in a wider context...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis of 2008 took root in the advanced countries, its shocks spread through the emerging economies, reflecting the increasingly interconnected global financial system. This paper develops an empirical methodology to test the contagion effect at the country level using bilateral data on bank claims between countries. It measures the direct and indirect exposures of emerging economies to crisis countries and tests whether these matter for capital outflows from emerging economies. The paper measures these exposures to the crisis-affected countries by using bilateral foreign claims sourced from Bank for International Settlements (i) consolidated <b>banking</b> <b>statistics</b> foreign claims on immediate counterparty and ultimate risk bases and (ii) locational <b>banking</b> <b>statistics</b> cross-border total claims. Findings show that emerging market economies more exposed directly or indirectly to banks in the crisis-affected countries suffered more capital outflows during {{the global financial}} crisis...|$|E
