50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Albanian economy in January-February 1997 {{in the wake of the}} implosion of the Ponzi pyramid banking schemes promoted by the government, increasing insurgency in early March led to the Police and Republican Guard deserting en masse because it became clear they were unlikely to be paid, leaving their armouries unlocked, which were promptly looted by parties unknown, believed to mostly have been the local crime bodies and self-appointed militias: many of the weapons eventually surfaced in the ethnic fighting in Kosovo. The resulting anarchy led a number of nations to use military forces to evacuate citizens, culminating in the UN authorising Operation Alba ("Daybreak"), a short-term military stabilisation force led by the Italian Army, tasked with facilitating the repatriation of foreigners and laying the foundations for another International Organisation to undertake the longer-term restabilisation. The political debate eventually settled in Europe within the body responsible for the defence diplomatic coordination of the Continent, the Council of the Western European Union. In a 2-hour meeting which convened at 1400 hrs on 2 May 1997, the WEU Council decided on the immediate establishment of the Multinational Advisory Police Element, sending a pathfinder officer, a Norwegian Police Colonel, the same evening.The Italian force in Operation Alba predicated the Command structure of MAPE passing into the Italian Carabinieri, General Pietro Pistolese, previously commanding the Genoa region, bringing his team with him. Four phases followed, assessment, reconstruction, support of the Albanian Police control during the Kosovo Crisis, and finally <b>build-down</b> and handback in early 2001, which was somewhat accelerated ahead of the transfer of the WEU's operational responsibilities to the Council of the EU on 30 June 2001. The reconstruction principally involved the reconstruction of the Judicial system and the training of Police, but the Finance section also accommodated economic specialists acting as the principal feedback into the correction of the Judicial system. The Command Team later formed the core of the European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah from 2005 onwards.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the usefulness of}} Gafchromic MD- 55 film (Nuclear Associates, Inc.) for measuring the radiation doses on the radiotherapy of laryngeal cancers. Since larynx has thin wedge-shaped structure in anterior neck adjacent to airway, the radiation doses to the lesion may be diminished because of build-up and <b>build-down.</b> So, the dose has been measured with conventional measuring systems such as thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD). However, {{it was not possible}} to evaluate the dose distribution correctly using TLD, because it is impossible to float a TLD chip in an air cavity. In this study, we employed Gafchromic MD- 55 film as a dosimeter, for it can be set on the area of interest and with a measurability of dose range of 3 to 100 Gy, though it has no energy dependency. And this radiometer is composition near the soft tissue of the human body. The dose distributions to larynx were investigated with this film using neck phantom under each radiation beam energy of 4, 6 and 10 MV x-rays. Our neck phantom is made from acrylic resin and simulates a normal larynx on the basis of image information of computed tomography (CT). Moreover we observed secondary build-up and <b>build-down</b> curves in tissue in the vicinity of air cavities, especially at 10 MV x-rays. These findings suggest that patients with TI-T 2 glottic cancers with anterior commissure invasion may receive more effective treatment with 4 MV x-rays rather than with 6 MV and 10 MV x-rays. Tl声門癌に対して放射線治療を単独で行うのは確立している方法である｡しかし,頚部は解剖学的に複雑であり,前方に薄いⅤ字形で,喉頭が気道に隣接している構造を持つので,病巣への線量はbuild-upとbuild-downの影響による線量低下が生じることが考えられる｡すなわち,放射線エネルギーの選択が喉頭癌の局所的制御に影響を及ぼすと言える｡この影響は,より高い放射線エネルギーでは,それに伴いより強く起きるということが基礎実験にて報告されている｡また,それらの線量測定は,熱ルミネセンス線量計(TLD) のような従来の測定システムで測定されていた｡しかし,空気空洞へTLD を単体 で浮かせ線量を正確に測定し評価を行うのは困難である｡本研究において,我々は Gafchromic MD- 55 film (Nuclear Associates, Inc.) を使用し測定した｡ Gafchromic MD- 55 film は,フィルムタイプ線量計でありエネルギー依存性がなく, 3 ～ 100 Gyを測定可能であり,アクリル製頸部ファントムの空気組織境界面及び,空洞部に線量計を容易に精度良く配置することが可能である｡また,この線量計は人体の軟部組織に近い組成である｡そこで, 4, 6 および 10 MVの各エネルギーでこの線量計を用いてエネルギーの違いによる,頸部ファントムを用いて喉頭の線量評価を行った｡その結果,我々は,特に放射線エネルギー 10 MVで頸部ファントムにおける,前部組織-組織空洞境界面-空洞部の一連したbuild-upおよびbuild-downを線量計で評価することができた｡これらの研究の結果､前交連浸潤を有するT 1 -T 2 に相当する声門癌患者は,放射線エネルギー 6 MVおよび 10 MVではなく, 4 MVを用いることによって,より効果的な放射線治療を行えると推測できる...|$|E
40|$|History {{has turned}} full circle {{since the end}} of the cold war and {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union. Today, the United States and Russia are cooperating in areas which were ridden with conflict in not-too-distant a past. One of these areas is the strategic arms control. Two agreements have so far been signed to reduce drastically the strategic arsenals of the two sides: the START I treaty, which is currently being implemented; and the START II agreement, which is yet to be ratified. If START II was also ratified, by 2000 or 2003, the United States and Russia would reduce by 70 per cent the strategic weapons they possessed in 1992. This strategic <b>build-down</b> has occurred as a direct consequence of the end of the cold war confrontation. However, the strategic weapons potential of the two sides even after the implementation of the two START agreements would be formidable enough to destroy the world more than once. In the radically transformed global strategic landscape that exists today, the only cold war role nuclear weapons still retain is that of war-prevention. And nuclear weapons can play this role at levels which are far below those included in START I and II. Nuclear weapons cannot be disinvented. Nations still consider them as useful instruments of national security. The goal of nuclear disarmament can be achieved in a world with a single central authority, and not in a world of anarchy. Thus, the question arises: if nuclear weapons cannot be eliminated, and if they cannot be retained at the present levels, what should be their lowest limit in the United States and Russia? START I and II, once implemented, would improve strategic stability between the two countries and help them maintain a credible and stable nuclear deterrence. This was what the entire negotiating process leading to the two treaties also aimed at. The same purpose can be served in a much better way if strategic nuclear weapons are further reduced drastically to the minimum possible level. This level of forces, which is possible to achieve under present circumstances, will ensure minimum deterrence. It is possible that the United States and Russia reduce their strategic arsenals to 200 weapons each provided they are joined by three other nuclear weapon states [...] China, France and Britain. Mere reductions, however, are not enough. They have to be complemented by measures which ensure nuclear security, check nuclear proliferation and, above all, neutralise nuclear weapons...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} timing scheme {{has been}} conceived for {{operation of a}} scanning satellite-borne rain-measuring radar system. The scheme allows a real-time-generated solution, which is required for auto targeting. The current timing scheme used in radar satellites involves pre-computing a solution that allows the instrument to catch all transmitted pulses without transmitting and receiving at the same time. Satellite altitude requires many pulses in flight at any time, and the timing solution to prevent transmit and receive operations from colliding is usually found iteratively. The proposed satellite has {{a large number of}} scanning beams each with a different range to target and few pulses per beam. Furthermore, the satellite will be self-targeting, so the selection of which beams are used will change from sweep to sweep. The proposed timing solution guarantees no echo collisions, can be generated using simple FPGA-based hardware in real time, and can be mathematically shown to deliver the maximum number of pulses per second, given the timing constraints. The timing solution is computed every sweep, and consists of three phases: (1) a build-up phase, (2) a feedback phase, and (3) a <b>build-down</b> phase. Before the build-up phase can begin, the beams to be transmitted are sorted in numerical order. The numerical order of the beams is also the order from shortest range to longest range. Sorting the list guarantees no pulse collisions. The build-up phase begins by transmitting the first pulse from the first beam on the list. Transmission of this pulse starts a delay counter, which stores the beam number and the time delay {{to the beginning of the}} receive window for that beam. The timing generator waits just long enough to complete the transmit pulse plus one receive window, then sends out the second pulse. The second pulse starts a second delay counter, which stores its beam number and time delay. This process continues until an output from the first timer indicates there is less than one transmit pulse width until the start of the next receive event. This blocks future transmit pulses in the build-up phase. The feedback phase begins with the first timer paying off and starting the first receive window. When the first receive window is complete, the timing generator transmits the next beam from the list. When the second timer pays off, the second receive event is started. Following the second receive event, the timing generator will transmit the next beam on the list and start an additional timer. The timers work in a circular buffer fashion so there only need to be enough to cover the maximum number of echoes in flight...|$|E
