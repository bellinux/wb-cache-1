50|$|The use of cans by craft brewers in the US {{has doubled}} since 2012, with over 500 {{companies}} using cans to package their beverages.

50|$|Since the 2000s, {{a number}} of brewers and outlets have been {{introducing}} a variation on keg dispense. Keykegs deliver the product under gas pressure, but it is internally held in plastic bag, rather like a wine box, so that the gas {{does not affect the}} <b>beer.</b> Keykeg <b>beer</b> <b>can</b> also be naturally carbonated, and lightly filtered, removing some of the objections to the older keg format. Nonetheless, it retains much of the advantage in terms of shelf life of the older keg format.|$|R

5000|$|Felinfoel Brewery Company, {{located at}} Llanelli, Wales, {{became the first}} brewery outside the United States to sell <b>canned</b> <b>beer,</b> {{and it was also}} a success.

50|$|Found {{in places}} frequented by drinkers, a large <b>beer</b> <b>can</b> pyramid {{was often a}} {{monument}} to the local party scene. Inspired by films such as National Lampoon's Animal House during the heyday of party culture, <b>beer</b> <b>can</b> pyramids were most frequently seen during the late 1970s, the 1980s, and the early 1990s, and could often be found in fraternity houses, dorms, and other collegiate locations throughout the US, and other places where <b>canned</b> <b>beer</b> was consumed in volume.|$|R

50|$|The Viennese have {{a special}} {{expression}} for the <b>canned</b> <b>beer,</b> 16er-Blech (16-plate), mainly for the Ottakringer Helles. The expression, 16er-Hüs'n, is also used for both the bottled and the <b>canned</b> <b>beer.</b> These are references to {{the origin of the}} beer in the 16th district of Vienna.

5000|$|<b>Beer</b> <b>can</b> pyramids {{are built}} as empty <b>beer</b> <b>cans</b> became available, slowly growing {{as the night}} (or week or month) wears on. In most cases, though, it is a {{temporary}} structure, eventually giving way to the inevitable clean-up or accidental destruction. The impermanence of the structure lends itself to easily removing it from wherever it has grown; combined with the great ease of creating a structure of relatively impressive size, <b>beer</b> <b>can</b> pyramids remain popular today, especially when one considers it is often easier to contribute an empty <b>beer</b> <b>can</b> to the beeramid {{than it is to}} deposit the can in the appropriate recycling receptacle.|$|R

50|$|This {{is a list}} of {{articles}} and categories dealing with beer by region, including breweries and brewing in general. Beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage, and is the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea. It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage. A brewery is a dedicated building for the making of <b>beer,</b> though <b>beer</b> <b>can</b> be made at home, and has been for much of beer's history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. The diversity of size in breweries is matched by the diversity of processes, degrees of automation, and kinds of beer produced in breweries. A brewery is typically divided into distinct sections, with each section reserved for one part of the brewing process.|$|R

50|$|World War II {{temporarily}} stopped this innovation until 1952. By this point, most breweries {{were using}} flat top cans instead. From the 1950s to the 1960s, all <b>beer</b> <b>can</b> were composed from {{three pieces of}} metal. Two-piece cans hit the market in 1974. Throughout the years, innovative ideas and development slowly changed the <b>beer</b> <b>can</b> in{{to what it is}} today.

50|$|In the 1980s the {{production}} of mineral water moved to the Tuborg site in Hellerup.
