5|$|As with {{obesity in}} adults, many factors {{contribute}} to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Changing diet and decreasing physical activity {{are believed to be}} the two most important causes for the recent increase in the incidence of child obesity. Because childhood obesity often persists into adulthood and is associated with numerous chronic illnesses, children who are obese are often tested for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver. Treatments used in children are primarily lifestyle interventions and behavioral techniques, although efforts to increase activity in children have had little success. In the United States, medications are not FDA approved for use in this age group. Multi-component <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> interventions that include changes to dietary and physical activity may reduce BMI in the short term in children aged 6 to 11 years, although the benefits are small and quality of evidence is low.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization {{considers}} smoking bans to have {{an influence}} to reduce demand for tobacco by creating an environment where smoking becomes increasingly more difficult and to help shift social norms away from the acceptance of smoking in everyday life. Along with tax measures, cessation measures, and education, smoking bans are viewed by public health experts as {{an important element in}} reducing smoking rates and promoting positive health outcomes. When effectively implemented they are seen as an important element of policy to support <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> in favour of a healthy lifestyle.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the health}} {{benefits}} of physical activity and other health <b>behaviour</b> <b>changes</b> are well understood for patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) less is known about the most effective interventions for facilitating such <b>behaviour</b> <b>changes</b> within this population. Understanding the motives for patients with PAD to engage in lifestyle changes may be essential to developing more effective and multi-disciplinary approaches to treatment. A pilot study has been established that incorporates psychological sessions involving principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI) and psycho-education to improve the capacity for patients with PAD to facilitate and maintain positive health behaviours, such as engaging in physical activity, medical compliance, dietary improvement and smoking cessation. The impact of these changes on an individual's quality of life will also be assessed, whereby the aim is to identify the elements of a behavioural intervention that are effective in increasing health <b>behaviour</b> <b>changes</b> that may be applied to other populations of patients with chronic illness...|$|R
40|$|Background: The use of motivational {{interviewing}} (MI) {{for changing}} unhealthy behaviour for muskuloskeletal patients {{forces us to}} find methods for its effectiveness evaluation. One of the solutions could be the transtheoretical model (TTM). It is a stagebased theory of <b>behaviour</b> <b>changes.</b> Movement through the stages is hypothesized {{to be caused by}} the processes of change, decisional balance and temptation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find out how TTM can show health <b>behaviour</b> <b>changes</b> for patients with musculoskeletal disorders. Methods: One to four MI sessions has been successfully applied for 35 patients with musculoskeletal disorders during their rehabilitation treatment period. TTM’s Readiness to Change Questionnaire was used to evaluate <b>behaviour</b> <b>changes</b> at the beginning and at the end of MI treatment. Findings: There were 6 patients at precontemplation, 19 at contemplation and 10 at action stages at the beginning of MI sessions. Results showed that 11 patients stayed at contemplation stage and 9 were already at action stage already changing their behavior, but 3 patients moved from precontemplation to contemplation stage, 3 patients moved from precontemplation to action stage and 8 patients moved from contemplation to action stage after MI interventions. Conclusions and recommendations: MI sessions seem to be effective in changing health behaviour for patients with musculoskeletal disorders.

40|$|Introduction: Fasting during Ramadan {{provides}} an opportunistic setting for smoking cessation intervention. Smokers find {{it easy to}} cease smoking during Ramadan due to the religion, cultural and environmental influences. This study aims to determine the <b>changes</b> in smoking <b>behaviour</b> during Ramadan among Malay Muslim male students who were current smokers. Methods: This is cross sectional study using self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the socio demographic characteristics and two main relevant religious perceptions on smoking (i. e. ‘Is smoking ‘haram’ and ‘Does smoking invalidate your fasting’). Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) questionnaire was used to evaluate smoking behaviour before and during Ramadan. The total FTND scores and the percentages according to FTDN items, before Ramadan and during Ramadan were compared to determine good or poor smoking <b>behaviour</b> <b>changes.</b> Results: The overall FTND scores and the percentage according to its items were significantly reduced. There were significant association between smoking <b>behaviour</b> <b>changes</b> during Ramadan and household income, nicotine dependence and perception that smoking is ‘haram’. The percentage of good smoking <b>behaviour</b> <b>changes</b> was higher among those with higher income, high nicotine dependence and those who are not aware that smoking is ‘haram’.

2500|$|Researchers Caitlin Buon and Tony Buon have {{suggested}} that attempts to profile ‘the bully’ have been damaging [...] They state that the [...] "bully" [...] profile is that ‘the bully’ is always aware {{of what they are}} doing, deliberately sets out to harm their ‘victims’, targets a particular individual or type of person and has some kind of underlying personality flaw, insecurity or disorder. But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. Tony Buon and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating [...] interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions [...] and [...] emotional competencies and cannot be transformed if externalization and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal [...] interactions.|$|E
