5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a compromise between increasing <b>bending</b> <b>strength</b> and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved <b>bending</b> <b>strength,</b> but weaker buckling strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve buckling strength, namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones and the large articular joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more {{pronounced}} zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore {{power of the}} temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong {{as that of a}} lion. There seems to be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine <b>bending</b> <b>strength</b> (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodons gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.|$|E

Whereas Horner assumed that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were separate in time, in 2010 Donald M. Henderson considered it possible that at least their descendants or ancestors were overlapping or sympatric and thus would have competed for food sources unless there had been niche partitioning. The skull of Achelousaurus was more than twice as strong than that of Einiosaurus in its <b>bending</b> <b>strength</b> and torsion resistance. This might have indicated a difference in diet to avoid competition. The bite strength of Achelousaurus, measured as an ultimate tensile strength, was 30.5newtonsper squaremeter (N/m²) at the maxillary tooth row and 18N/m² at the beak.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the cranial {{measurements}} and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than the gray wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than the gray wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger {{than those of the}} gray wolf, and the dire wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater <b>bending</b> <b>strength</b> than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than the gray wolf, and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Ecologic {{building}} {{materials such as}} adobe bricks have become of greater economic importance in recent years. In the present work, the addition of selected materials to improve the compressive and <b>bending</b> <b>strengths</b> of adobe bricks was tested. The raw material (loam UD) was analyzed for its mineralogical and chemical composition. The loam studied consisted of quartz, feldspar, and the clay minerals chlorite, vermiculite, illite, and kaolinite. Prerequisites for using this loam for brick making were its grain-size distribution {{and the absence of}} expandable clay minerals. To optimize the compressive and <b>bending</b> <b>strengths</b> of the adobe bricks, seven natural and ‘eco-friendly’ synthetic additives were admixed with the raw material and homogenized. From this material, small adobe bricks and bars were made. One series of bricks and bars was made without additives but instead was coated with a hydrophobic impregnation cream. The bricks were stored for up to 20 days at 100 and 75 % relative humidity (RH). After 1, 5, and 20 days, the compressive and <b>bending</b> <b>strengths</b> were measured to identify the critical humidity level for brick strength. The compressive and <b>bending</b> <b>strengths</b> of loam UD at dry conditions without additives showed values of 9 N/mm 2 and 4. 8 N/mm 2, respectively. With some of the additives, the strength improved by up to 30 %. The greatest increases in strength were achieved by mixing the loam with Acronal S 650. Finely ground trass and diatomite also increased the dry strength. After storage at high levels of RH, these mixtures lost> 50 % strength. In contrast, the loam mixed with blast-furnace slag has a small initial strength but showed the smallest decreases in strength after exposure to high levels of RH...|$|R
