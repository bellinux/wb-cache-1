40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of dredging intensity on the physical and biological recovery times of the seabed following marine aggregate dredging. Two areas of seabed, previously subject to, respectively, relatively high and lower levels of dredging intensity, were identified on the Hastings Shingle Bank. Two reference areas were also selected for comparative purposes. All four sites were monitored annually over the period 2001 – 2004, using a combination of acoustic, video and grab sampling techniques. Since the site was last dredged in 1996, this was intended to provide a sequence of data 5 – 8 years after cessation of dredging. However, an unexpected resumption of dredging within the high intensity site, during 2002 and 2003, allowed an additional assessment of the immediate effects and aftermath of renewed dredging at the seabed. The early stages of recovery could then be assessed after dredging ceased in 2003. Results from both dredged sites provide a useful insight into the early and latter stages of physical and biological recovery. A comparison of recent and historic dredge track features provided evidence of track erosion. However, tracks were still visible 8 years after the cessation of dredging. Within the high dredging intensity site, recolonisation was relatively rapid after the cessation of dredging in 2003. Rather than indicating a full recovery, we suggest that this initial ‘colonization community’ may enter a transition phase before eventually reaching equilibrium. This hypothesis is supported by results from the low intensity site, where biological recovery was judged to have taken 7 years. Further monitoring is needed in order to test this. An alternative explanation is that the rapid recovery may be explained by the settlement of large numbers of Sabellaria spinulosa. As the resumption of dredging within the high intensity site limited our assessment of longer-term recovery it is not yet possible to assume that a 7 -year <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> will be applicable to other, more intensively dredged areas at this or more distant locations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT 12 This paper {{deals with}} the 20 -year (1988 - 2008) record of macroinvertebrate {{sampling}} from the UK’s 13 Acid Waters Monitoring Network. At 12 of the 22 sites a significant temporal trend in the 14 macroinvertebrate community is now evident. Indices of acidification suggest <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> at 15 five of the 11 streams sites and at five of the lakes. All 10 sites indicating <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> from 16 acidification also showed an increase in acid-neutralising capacity (ANC), although a further seven 17 sites showed chemical (ANC) recovery but no evident <b>biological</b> <b>recovery.</b> On a site-by-site basis 18 eight (four streams and four lakes) of the 20 sites investigated had significant relationships between 19 biotic indices of acidification and chemical measures of acidity, the latter explaining between 30 % 20 and 72 % of the biotic variation. Thus, the match between chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> is 21 incomplete, with <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> lagging improvements in chemistry, modest community changes 22 and most sites still showing signs of acid stress. The sluggish <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> may be ascribed to 23 aspects of the chemical environment that are still deleterious and/or to ecological inertia in the 24 reassembly of an acid-sensitive fauna. 2...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundFacial {{hypoesthesia}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} troublesome complaints in the management of facial bone fractures. However, there is a lack of literature on facial sensory recovery after facial trauma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the facial sensory <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> for facial bone fractures using Neurometer. MethodsSixty-three patients who underwent open reduction of zygomatic and blowout fractures between December 2013 and July 2015 were included in the study. The facial sensory status of the patients was repeatedly examined preoperatively and postoperatively by Neurometer current perception threshold (CPT) until the results were normalized. ResultsAmong the 63 subjects, 30 patients had normal Neurometer results preoperatively and postoperatively. According to fracture types, 17 patients with blowout fracture had a median <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> of 0. 25 months. Twelve patients with zygomatic fracture had a median <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> of 1. 00 month. Four patients with both fracture types had a median <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> of 0. 625 months. The median <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> of all 33 patients was 0. 25 months. There was no statistically significant difference in the sensory <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> between types and subgroups of zygomatic and blowout fractures. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in the sensory <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> according to Neurometer results and the patients' own subjective reports.

40|$|Objective. To {{measure the}} impact of {{different}} <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) during classical resistance training (RT) modalities Background. Resistance training was introduced into rehabilitation programs to improve the efficiency of traditional training. The impact of different RT modalities on muscular performance is well known but the <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> between successive RT sets recommended in the literature varied between 30 s and 5 min. Method. Twenty one healthy subjects were tested while performing a classical RT paradigm: 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 75 % of 1 -RM, with <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> of 30, 60, 90 and 120 s. Results. A <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> of 30 or 60 s did not allow a return of SBP and HR to resting values. A progressive drift of the values was observed in the successive rests {{as well as in}} the successive efforts. A <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> longer than 60 s (90 and 120 s) allowed a return of SBP and HR to resting values. Conclusions. A <b>recovery</b> <b>period</b> of 90 s or more between successive classical RT sets is recommended in order to avoid excessive SBP and HR elevation. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors.

To date, {{the fate of}} these modified forms of ZEN {{has not yet been}} elucidated in animals. In order to investigate whether ZEN conjugates contribute to the total ZEN exposure of an individual, ZEN (10 µg/kg b. w.) and equimolar amounts of two of its plant metabolites (ZEN- 14 -O-β-glucoside, ZEN- 16 -O-β-glucoside) and of one fungal metabolite (ZEN- 14 -sulfate) were orally administered to four pigs as a single bolus using a repeated measures design. The concentrations of ZEN, its modified forms and its mammalian metabolites ZEN- 14 -glucuronide, α-zearalenol (α-ZEL) and α-ZEL- 14 -glucuronide in excreta were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) based methods. The <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> of ZEN in urine was 26 % ± 10 %, the total <b>biological</b> <b>recovery</b> in excreta was 40 % ± 8 %. Intact ZEN- 14 -sulfate, ZEN- 14 -O-β-glucoside and ZEN- 16 -O-β-glucoside were neither detected in urine nor in feces. After ZEN- 14 -sulfate application, 19 % ± 5 % of the administered dose was recovered in urine. In feces, no ZEN metabolites were detected. The total <b>biological</b> <b>recoveries</b> of ZEN- 14 -O-β-glucoside and ZEN- 16 -O-β-glucoside in the form of their metabolites in urine were 19 % ± 11 % and 13 % ± 7 %, respectively.

We therefore prospectively assessed whether duration of depressive episodes and recoveries is correlated within subjects and across episodes, and whether duration of subsequent depressive episodes and recoveries increases or decreases over time. Methods: From a sample of 267 depressed primary care patients enrolled in a RCT, we identified 279 depressive episodes and 455 <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> during a 3 -year follow-up. We correlated durations of depressive episodes and of recovery within subjects, and compared within subjects the duration of first depressive episodes after index depression with second and third episodes, and similarly with <b>recovery</b> <b>periods.</b> Results: No significant correlations were found between duration of depressive episodes or between <b>recovery</b> <b>periods</b> within subjects (Rs ranging from − 0. 17 to 0. 08; all Ps > 0. 05). Median duration of first and second depressive episodes was 11 (IQR 6 - 19) and 9 weeks (IQR 5 - 14).

The food web was highly interconnected and reticulate, especially in years when species richness was low, and subsidized by external inputs of detritus. Among the primary consumers, generalist herbivore– detritivores maintained feeding links with the scant algal resources, which appeared insufficient to support viable populations of specialist grazers. Together, these characteristics, which are shared with many other acidified freshwaters, are likely to make the community dynamically stable and resistant to invasions of potential new colonists, thereby slowing the pace of future <b>biological</b> <b>recovery...</b>|$|R
