50|$|Deramore Park was {{the home}} to Collegians (and of Methodist College from 1919 until the school {{purchased}} Pirrie Park from Harland & Wolff in 1932). Deramore Park was <b>bequested</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> {{for the use of}} the former pupils of Methody for its life by Mr C W Neill in 1941. A special board of trustees exists today in the name of C W Neill, and its consent was required for the merger in 1999, to allow the continued use of Deramore Park by the new club.|$|R
500|$|While {{the birth}} {{certificates}} and wills of Roman citizens {{had to be}} written in Latin until the 220s, in the legal opinion of Ulpian (ca. 215), fideicommissa (<b>bequests</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust)</b> were not limited to Latin or even Greek, but could also be created in [...] "Punic, Gaulish or any other" [...] language. Originally, a testator's fideicommissum placed the heir under a moral rather than legal obligation, and Ulpian asserted that [...] "any kind of speech contains the obligation of its words, provided that each party understands the other's language himself or through accurate interpreters". The jurist Gaius distinguished between verbal contracts that derived their validity from formulaic utterance in Latin, and obligations expressing a mutual understanding of the ius gentium {{regardless of whether the}} parties were Roman or not.|$|R
5000|$|By his will, dated 31 December 1840, Chantrey (who had no children) {{left his}} whole residuary {{personal}} estate after the decease {{or on the}} second marriage of his widow (less certain specified annuities and <b>bequests)</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> {{for the president and}} trustees of the Royal Academy (or in the event of its dissolution to such society as might take its place), the income to be devoted to the encouragement of British painting and sculpture, by [...] "the purchase of works of fine art of the highest merit ... that can be obtained." [...] The funds might be allowed to accumulate for not more than five years; works by British or foreign artists, dead or living, might be acquired, so long as such works were entirely executed within Great Britain, the artists having been in residence there during the execution and completion. The prices to be paid were to be [...] "liberal," [...] and no sympathy for an artist or his family was to influence the selection or the purchase of works, which were to be acquired solely on the ground of intrinsic merit. No commission or orders might be given: the works must be finished before purchase. Conditions were made as to the exhibition of the works, in the confident expectation that the government or the country would provide a suitable gallery for their display; and an annual sum of £300 and £50 was to be paid to the president and the secretary of the Royal Academy respectively, for the discharge of their duties in carrying out the provisions of the will.|$|R
25|$|From 1814, Keats had two <b>bequests,</b> held <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> for {{him until}} his 21st birthday: £800 willed by his {{grandfather}} John Jennings (about £50,000 in today's money) and {{a portion of}} his mother's legacy, £8000 (about £500,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children. It seems he was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware. William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely did know and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not. The money would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.|$|R
