Tail docking to the correct length will reduce the amount of staining in the breech area due to urine and fecal matter. Pizzle dropping is a procedure that severs the connective tissue between the penis and the body. Not only does it reduce the incidence of relentless pizzle rot in sheep, but it decreases the amount of urine staining on the belly of the sheep. This procedure can greatly reduce the occurrence of flystrike on the <b>belly</b> <b>area.</b> Mulesing is an animal husbandry procedure that has currently faced much opposition throughout its practice. Large scissors are used to cut off the backs of the sheep's thigh region. This procedure is usually carried out by untrained farmers without the use of any analgesia. It flattens out the wrinkles around the breech of the sheep, reducing the places where moisture collects affecting the skin of the sheep resulting in liquid protein exudate which is attractive to Lucilia cuprina. Mulesing also increases the amount of bare skin around the vulva during the healing process, reducing urine staining and amount of flystrike. This procedure does cause pain, but since it is considered the most effective method to prevent breech strike, it is seemingly justifiable. Mulesing is as effective as breeding sheep for less wrinkle (score 2) which are resistant to flystrike. Mulesing is a good prevention until breeding can remove the need for the operation in flystrike prevention ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Glutaraldehyde-treated bioprosthetic {{heart valves}} are {{commonly}} used for replacement of diseased heart valves. However, calcification and wear limit their durability, {{and the development of}} new and improved bioprosthetic valve designs is needed and must be evaluated in a reliable animal model. We studied glutaraldehyde-treated valves 6 months after implantation to evaluate bioprosthetic valve complications in the mitral position in juvenile pigs. Materials The study material comprised eight, 5 -month old, 60 -kg pigs. All pigs received a size 27, glutaraldehyde-treated, stented, Carpentier-Edwards S. A. V. mitral valve prosthesis. After six months, echocardiography was performed, and the valves explanted for gross examination, high resolution X-ray, and histological evaluation. Results Five pigs survived the follow-up period. Preexplant echocardiography revealed a median peak and mean velocity of 1. 61 m/s (range: 1. 17 - 2. 00) and 1. 20 (SD = ± 0. 25), respectively, and a median peak and mean pressure difference of 10. 42 mmHg (range: 5. 83 - 16. 55) and 6. 51 mmHg (SD = ± 2. 57), respectively. Gross examination showed minor thrombotic depositions at two commissures in two valves and at all three commissures in three valves. High resolution X-ray imaging revealed different degrees of calcification in all explanted valves, primarily in the commissural and <b>belly</b> <b>areas.</b> In all valves, histological evaluation demonstrated various degrees of fibrous sheath formation, limited immunological infiltration, and no overgrowth of host endothelium. Conclusions Bioprosthetic glutaraldehyde-treated mitral valves can be implanted into the mitral position in pigs and function after 6 months. Echocardiographic data, calcification, and histological examinations were comparable to results obtained in sheep models and human demonstrating the suitability of the porcine model. </p...|$|R

RESULTS: Ocular and non-ocular paralysis of superior oblique muscle <b>belly</b> maximum cross-sectional <b>area</b> were 4. 52 ± 1. 49, 8. 80 ± 1. 42 mm 2,respectively.

5000|$|Usually sleeveless, {{and having}} a simple style design. It is {{normally}} waist length, ending {{at the top of}} the skirt. Typically worn alone with a bra underneath. This style top is worn by most American school squads as it is very modest and meets most dress codes, with midriff exposure limited to bare lower backs and an inch of frontal skin while the arms are raised. The sleeveless shell, if worn alone, will normally leave the arms and shoulders open. A properly fitted shell top is essential in making the uniform look flattering for everyone on the cheer squad. A shell that is properly sized and fitted will leave enough room around the arm openings for movement, eliminating fabric rubbing against the underarms. Additionally, if the shell is sized with the correct measurements, the bottom of the hem should be long enough to meet the top of the skirt while standing stationary. These tops can be highly customized from very ordinary to highly detailed designs. Certain cut-outs in sections of the garment are an option, as are varying hemlines for the bottom of the top. For instance, instead of a straight hem along the bottom of the top, some squads will choose a [...] "cut-up V" [...] hem, which leaves an upside down [...] "V" [...] notch open along the front, leaving slight midriff exposed at the <b>belly</b> button <b>area.</b> This style is selected to allow for an additional color stripe along the bottom hem of the shell.|$|R
