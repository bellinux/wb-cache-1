40|$|Despite their {{strategic}} importance firm’s motivations to extend brands have received only modest attentions by marketing scholars. We use multiple events duration models {{to examine the}} timing of launching <b>brand</b> <b>extensions.</b> We provide a theoretical framework of <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> based on the real option framework. Using a real option framework allows us to make a parallel comparison between firms launching <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> with an agent exercising a call option in a financial market. Specifically, we consider the timing of extensions as an opportunistic behaviour to cope with uncertainty, competition, and lack of financial resources. By using 428 pharmaceutical brands that were extended in the period 1973 - 2005, we demonstrate the use of several different variant of Cox models to deal with multiple extensions within the same brand (Andersen-Gill model, Marginal model, and two Conditional models). Our results show that firms launch <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> in response to increase in competition pressure, uncertainty concerning their expectation on firms’ stock prices, and lack of financial resources...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{investigate}} the empirical generalizability of Aaker and Keller’s model of how consumers evaluate <b>brand</b> <b>extensions.</b> Various replications have reported different results. Using a comprehensive data set containing {{the data from}} the original study and seven replications conducted around the world, the authors undertake a secondary analysis to understand what generalizations emerge. The study has implications for the understanding of how <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> are evaluated and how empirical generalizations are made. For <b>brand</b> <b>extensions,</b> Aaker and Keller’s model hypothesizes that evaluations of <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> are based {{on the quality of the}} original brand, the fit between the parent and extension categories, and the interaction of the two. The authors find support for this full model despite published results, including Aaker and Keller’s own, that support only some of the hypotheses. The authors find evidence that the level of contribution of each of these components varies by brand and culture. With respect to empirical generalizations, the key implication is that it is premature to make firm conclusions about theory on the basis of only one study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} consumers’ perceptions and attitudes when evaluating <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> in relation to the original brand within a South African context. Furthermore, this study examines how consumers perceive the overall quality and similarity/fit of the <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> (Nike camera, Nike socks, and Nike golf balls) in relation to the original brand (Nike athletic shoes) and how these perceptions influence their attitudes towards the extensions. In order to get these insights, the study surveyed 147 undergraduate and postgraduate students from the University of the Western Cape across all faculties. A non-probability convenience sampling method was used to access respondents. To collect data, qualitative and quantitative methods were employed using a questionnaire which consisted of open-ended and closed-ended questions in the form of free associations technique and 5 -point Likert scales. The data gathered was analysed by means of descriptive statistics and Spearman correlation coefficient. The findings indicate two key aspects. First, respondents only perceived Nike socks’ overall quality to be congruent to the original brand (Nike athletic shoes). Second, respondents only perceived Nike socks to be strongly similar to the original brand (Nike athletic shoes). Despite this, respondents had a favourable attitude towards all the <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> irrespective of whether they perceived the overall quality of the extensions to be congruent to the original brand or not, and whether they perceived the extensions to be similar to the original brand or not. These factors did not influence respondents’ attitudes towards the extensions negatively. The research therefore proposes that the perceived overall quality of the <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> will be congruent to that of the original brand and that the attitude towards the <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> will be favourable only when there is a perceived similarity/fit between the <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> and the original brand...|$|R
5|$|As {{recognized}} by the WWE, the inaugural champion was The Fabulous Moolah, who won the title on September 18, 1956, which {{at that time was}} the NWA World Women's Championship (which still exists today). While she was still champion, it became the WWF Women's Championship in 1984. In May 2002, after the WWF was renamed to WWE, the championship became the WWE Women's Championship. At the start of the <b>brand</b> <b>extension</b> that began in March 2002, the Women's Championship was defended on any brand until it became exclusive to Raw in September that year. It was the only women's championship in the WWE until SmackDown created the WWE Divas Championship as a counterpart title in July 2008. The titles switched brands in April 2009. On September 19, 2010, at Night of Champions, the Women's Championship was unified with the WWE Divas Championship, retiring the Women's Championship.|$|E

The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and the lawyer Stein Øxseth. Sunde would own 92% of the company through his shipping company Larvik Scandi Line, while Andersen and Øxseth would own 4% each. The company would be a <b>brand</b> <b>extension</b> of Sunde's shipping company Color Line. The company aimed at a 15–20% market share, with 1.4 million passengers annually. It was the first low-cost airline in Norway. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend. Color Air made an agreement with the British airline Air Foyle HeavyLift to operate a fleet of Boeing 737-300 aircraft.|$|E

The event was created in 1998 as an In Your House event in February of that year and in 2000 was made an annual pay-per-view event for WWE. After the <b>brand</b> <b>extension,</b> the event was made exclusive to the SmackDown brand in 2004, being produced every February. In April 2007, following WrestleMania 23, brand-exclusive pay-per-view events ceased being held, {{with the last of}} which being the SmackDown-exclusive No Way Out 2007.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{reciprocal}} effects of media <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> on attitudes towards media parent brand. The {{results indicate that}} the evaluation by audiences of a brand with high credibility is enhanced {{as a result of the}} introduction of an extension with good fit, but diluted when an extension with poor fit is introduced; contrary results are found in the case of a brand with low credibility. Attitudes towards the parent brand are more positive amongst audiences who are already in possession of the brand product, than amongst those who are not. Finally, this study finds that attitudes towards the media parent brand are more positive in those cases where the parent brand is perceived as being more dominant in the market, than in those cases where it is perceived as being less dominant. This study makes four primary contributions to the study of <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> by advancing our knowledge regarding: (i) the issue of the reciprocal effect of media <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> on attitudes towards media parent brand; and (ii) the effects of brand ownership; (iii) the effects of brand dominance on the impact of the effects of the fit; and (iv) the above effects in the context of brand-extended websites.

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that reactions to <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> {{are influenced by}} the fit between the parent <b>brand</b> and the <b>extension</b> product category. The normative nature of this effect is limited because assessments of <b>brand</b> <b>extensions</b> are typically obtained in the absence of competition. The boundaries of prior research are investigated by testing whether the fit-extension relationship generalizes to scenarios that include relatively more or less familiar competitor brands. Support is found for this relationship in noncompetitive scenarios but is diminished by competitors' relative brand familiarity. Perceived risk mediates the effects of fit in noncompetitive settings and competitor brand familiarity in competitive settings. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R

After {{suffering}} an ankle injury in the summer, however, she was sidelined for the following three months. This interrupted not only her recent venture into wrestling, but also an on-screen romance with Jeff Hardy and budding storyline with Team Xtreme. As she rehabilitated, she kept herself visible by co-hosting Excess on TNN. After returning in autumn, Stratus appeared at Survivor Series where she won the WWF Women's Championship {{for the first time}} in a six-pack challenge. Stratus was next involved in a feud with Jazz over the Women's Championship, where she retained the championship at the Royal Rumble, but dropped the championship to Jazz two weeks later on the February 4, 2002 episode of Raw. Stratus then attempted to regain the title for several months, including competing in a triple threat match at WrestleMania X8 against Lita and Jazz in her hometown of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but failed to win the match. While chasing after the Women's Championship, Stratus won the WWE Hardcore Championship on May 6, pinning Crash Holly after Bubba Ray Dudley hit him over the head with a trash can. She lost the title to Steven Richards soon afterward however, due to the stipulation that the belt was to be defended 24/7 as long as there was a referee present.
