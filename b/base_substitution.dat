40|$|Duplex DNA {{fragments}} differing by single <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> can {{be separated}} by electrophoresis in denaturing gradient polyacrylamide gels, but only substitutions in a restricted {{part of the}} molecule lead to a separation (1). In an effort to circumvent this problem, we demonstrated that the melting properties and electrophoretic behavior of a 135 base pair DNA fragment containing a beta-globin promoter are changed by attaching a GC-rich sequence, called a 'GC-clamp' (2). We predicted that these changes should {{make it possible to}} resolve most, if not all, single <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> within fragments attached to the clamp. To test this possibility we examined the effect of several different single <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> on the electrophoretic behavior of the beta-globin promoter fragment in denaturing gradient gels. We find that the GC-clamp allows the separation of fragments containing substitutions throughout the promoter fragment. Many of these substitutions do not lead to a separation when the fragment is not attached to the clamp. Theoretical calculations and analysis {{of a large number of}} different mutations indicate that approximately 95 % of all possible single <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> should be separable when attached to a GC-clamp...|$|R

40|$|Attempts {{were made}} to apply atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) imaging to the detection and mapping of the sites of <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> in DNA molecules. In essence, DNA fragments to be examined for possible <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> were mixed with {{an equal amount of}} a corresponding DNA standard and subjected to heat denaturation and subsequent annealing. The reassociated DNA was incubated with MutS protein, a protein that recognizes and binds to mismatched base pairs in duplex DNA. Bound MutS protein molecules were then detected by AFM and their positions along the DNA molecules were determined by calculating the distance from one of the DNA termini, which had been tagged with a biotin–avidin complex. <b>Base</b> <b>substitutions</b> present in DNA molecules > 1 kb were effectively detected by this procedure, and the positions determined were in good agreement with the actual mutation sites.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the DNA sequence changes in 487 spontaneous mutations in the N-terminal {{part of the}} lacI gene in mutH, mutL, and mutS strains of Escherichia coli. These strains display elevated spontaneous mutation rates because of a deficiency {{in the process of}} postreplicative mismatch correction. As a consequence the mutational spectra reveal the nature of spontaneous DNA replication errors. The spectra consist of <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> (75 %) and single-base deletions (25 %). Among the <b>base</b> <b>substitutions,</b> transitions (both A. T [...] G. C and G. C [...] A. T) are strongly favored over transversions (96 % versus 4 %). Large site-to-site differences are observed among identical <b>base</b> <b>substitutions,</b> presumably reflecting the modulating effects of neighboring bases. The single-base-deletion spectrum is dominated by a large hotspot at a run of adjacent identical base pairs, implying a Streisinger-slippage mechanism.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> in the IS 1 sequence affect {{the length of}} the nucleotide sequence which is duplicated during IS 1 -mediated co-integration. IS 1 K, an IS 1 variant present in the Escherichia coli chromosome, has seven <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> in its sequence as compared with that of IS 1 R derived from the plasmid R 100. All substitutions are located in the internal region of IS 1 K. We have constructed plasmids containing IS 1 R, IS 1 K and hybrids between them: one contains four <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> causing an amino acid substitution in the insA gene and the other has three substitutions producing an amino acid substitution in the insB gene. We have isolated co-integrate plasmids formed by each IS 1 and analysed nucleotide sequences of the target sites duplicated at the co-integration junctions. The results show that IS 1 K generates duplications of 8 or 14 bp as well as 9 bp, while IS 1 R exclusively generates the 9 -bp duplications. Both hybrid IS 1 s also create 8 - or 7 -bp target duplications in addition to 9 -bp duplications. These results indicate that the <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> in either insA or insB are sufficient for the occurrence of unusual target duplications, suggesting that both genes are involved in the target duplication...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of customers' stock-out <b>based</b> <b>substitution</b> on the product {{availability}} and the channel efficiency of a dual-channel supply chain, which consists of a supplier distributing a single product to customers through both its wholly owned direct channel and an independent retailer. The supplier and its retailer, {{with the objective of}} optimizing their own profit, simultaneously choose their own base-stock level to satisfy the stochastic demand from the customers whose channel preferences are heterogeneous and may be affected by each channel's product availability. The customers dynamically substitute between the two channels {{in the event of a}} stock-out. The result shows that the effect of the stock-out <b>based</b> <b>substitution</b> may increase or decrease the efficiency of a decentralized supply chain. It is found that while the integrated supplier-retailer may consolidate the base-stock levels to benefit from stock-out <b>based</b> <b>substitution,</b> the independent supplier and retailer are more inattentive to customers' stock-out <b>based</b> <b>substitution.</b> Thus, the competitive base-stock levels of the decentralized dual-channel supply chain rarely agree with the system optimal levels. Various contracts are examined to shed light on channel coordination mechanisms. In addition, it is shown that the channel efficiency of the dual-channel distribution can be improved by the emergence of Stackelberg leadership from either the supplier or the retailer.

The mutation is heterozygous meaning that it only occurs in one allele. A single <b>base</b> <b>substitution</b> in the 11th coding region of the gene PTCH2 changes an adenine to guanine.

50|$|Senecoff et al. (1987) {{investigated}} how nucleotide substitutions {{within the}} FRT affected {{the efficacy of}} the FLP-mediated recombination. The authors induced base substitutions in either {{one or both of the}} FRT sites and tested the concentration of FLP required to observe site-specific recombinations. Every <b>base</b> <b>substitution</b> was performed on each of the thirteen nucleotides within the FRT site (example G to A, T, and C). First, the authors showed that most mutations within the FRT sequence cause minimal effects if present within only one of the two sites. If mutations occurred within both sites, the efficiency of FLP is dramatically reduced. Second, the authors provided data for which nucleotides are most crucial for the binding of FLP and efficacy of the site-specific recombination. If the first nucleotide in both FRT sites is substituted to a cytosine (G to C), the third nucleotide is substituted for a thymine (A to T), or the seventh nucleotide is substituted for an adenosine (G to A), then {{the efficacy of the}} FLP-mediated site-specific recombination is reduced more than 100-fold. While a <b>base</b> <b>substitution</b> of any of the aforementioned nucleotides in only one of the FRT sites led to a ten-fold, ten-fold, and five-fold reduction of efficacy, respectively.|$|E

40|$|We have {{synthesized}} {{triple helix}} forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) that target a psoralen (pso) interstrand crosslink {{to a specific}} chromosomal site in mammalian cells. Mutagenesis of the targeted crosslinks results in <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> and deletions. Identification of the gene products involved in mutation formation is important for developing practical applications of pso-TFOs, and may be informative about the metabolism of other interstrand crosslinks. We have studied mutagenesis of a pso-TFO genomic crosslink in repair proficient and deficient cells. Deficiencies in non homologous end joining and mismatch repair do not influence mutation patterns. In contrast, the frequency of <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> {{is dependent on the}} activity of ERCC 1 /XPF and polymerase ζ, but independent of other nucleotide excision repair (NER) or transcription coupled repair (TCR) genes. In NER/TCR deficient cells the frequency of deletions rises, indicating that in wild-type cells NER/TCR functions divert pso-TFO crosslinks from processes that result in deletions. We conclude that targeted pso-TFO crosslinks can enter genetically distinct mutational routes that resolve to <b>base</b> <b>substitutions</b> or deletions...|$|R

50|$|Over {{and over}} again, DNA strands will bend and attach to oligos. Polymerases will {{synthesize}} a new strand {{to create a}} double stranded segment, {{and that will be}} denatured so that all of the DNA strands in one area are from a single source (clonal amplification). Clonal amplification is important for quality control purposes. If a strand is found to have an odd sequence, then scientists can check the reverse strand {{to make sure that it}} has the complement of the same oddity. The forward and reverse strands act as checks to guard against artifacts. Because Illumina sequencing uses polymerases, <b>base</b> <b>substitution</b> errors have been observed, especially at the 3’ end. Paired end reads combined with cluster generation can confirm an error took place. The reverse and forward strands should be complementary to each other, all reverse reads should match each other, and all forward reads should match each other. If a read is not similar enough to its counterparts (with which it should be a clone), an error may have occurred. A minimum threshold of 97% similarity has been used in some labs’ analyses.|$|E
