25|$|On {{the day of}} the duel, Zaretsky gets {{several more}} chances to prevent the duel from happening. Because dueling was {{forbidden}} in the Russian Empire, duels were always held at dawn. Zaretsky urges Lensky to get ready shortly after 6o'clock in the morning (chapter 6, stanza XXIII), while the sun only rises at 20 past 8, because he expects Onegin to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>time.</b> However, Onegin oversleeps (chapter 6, stanza XXIV), and arrives on the scene more than an hour late. According to the dueling codex, if a duelist arrives more than 15 minutes late, he automatically forfeits the duel. Lensky and Zaretsky have been waiting all that time (chapter 6, stanza XXVI), even though it was Zaretsky's duty to proclaim Lensky as winner and take him home.|$|E

He later said, [...] "The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about. I didn't really care about the team, I cared about the money and that it was going to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>time</b> and that I was going to be able to further my career and get to feed my family." ...|$|E
