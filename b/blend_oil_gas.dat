40|$|The Bio Diesel Fuel (BDF) is {{anticipated}} as the sustainable renewable energy. Also, {{they are expected}} to solve the global warming. Especially, Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) which is made by transesterification of vegetable oil and methanol is expected, since it has good engine performance and low exhaust emissions. On the other hand, bio butanol is also expected recently, but Fatty Acid Butyl Ester (FABE) which made by butanol is scarcely studied. Therefore, this study was made on the use of FABE as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. In this paper, FABE was made from rapeseed oil and butanol, and then it was <b>blended</b> with <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> in order to improve the properties of its. FABE mixing ratio was selected 5 % in volume because BDF is allowed blending up to 5 % in Japan. In addition, blended 10 % was also selected to declare the influence of FABE. Then the density and kinematic viscosity of FABE and <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> <b>blended</b> fuels were measured. It can be seen that the <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> addition can improve the properties of FABE. Finally, FABE blended fuels were burned in a conventional 320 -cc diesel engine. It was found that FABE 5 % and FABE 10 % had different trends. Although the particle matter (PM) in the exhaust gas of FABE 5 % was confirmed to be reduced from the <b>gas</b> <b>oil,</b> nitrogen oxides were increased. Conversely, PM of FABE 10 % was increased from the <b>gas</b> <b>oil,</b> but nitrogen oxides were slightly decreased. Moreover, the brake specific fuel consumption of FABE 5 % was higher than <b>gas</b> <b>oil,</b> but FABE 10 % was slightly lower than <b>gas</b> <b>oil...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nowadays in Europe {{the demand}} for diesel fuel is continu-ously growing, while {{the demand for}} {{gasoline}} decreases slightly. Currently, the biodiesel is the biofuel which is <b>blended</b> into the <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> with the highest amount in case of Diesel engines, which can be produced from different, even waste-derived triglycer-ides (with transesterification with alcohol). Due to the adverse properties of biodiesel the storage stability of biodiesel/diesel blends has to be examined in detail. In our experimental work we investigated {{the changes in the}} qualities of biodiesels produced from vegetable oil which con-tained various waste cooking oil (waste-derived component) share (10, 30, 50 %), and its 7 and 10 % <b>blends</b> with <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> in case of long-term (more than 130 weeks) storage. We found that with increasing the proportion of used cooking oil in the vegetable oil used as raw material for biodiesel, the oxidation reactions took place in a greater degree. Biodiesel made from vegetable oils containing 10 % used cooking oil was the most applicable for blending; in case of using higher proportion it is very necessary to use a further amount of antioxidant additives to minimize the degradation...|$|R

The fatty acid ratios of EAEPO, HEBO, and the three kinds of <b>blended</b> <b>oils</b> were very similar (0. 27 [*]:[*] 1. 03 [*]:[*] 0. 96, 0. 27 [*]:[*] 1. 08 [*]:[*] 1. 16, 0. 27 [*]:[*] 0. 65 [*]:[*] 0. 8, 0. 27 [*]:[*] 0. 6 [*]:[*] 0. 84, and 0. 27 [*]:[*] 0. 61 [*]:[*] 0. 79, resp.).

There was a rapid increase in the PV and p-AV of EAEPO and HEBO after heating for only 1 [*]h, whereas the other three <b>blended</b> <b>oils</b> showed a rapid increase after heating for 2 [*]h or 6 [*]h. Despite the highest trans-fatty acid content found for HEBO, this content was relatively low and remained low up to a heating time of 8 [*]h. It was found that after heating, a fatty acid ratio relatively close to its ideal value (0. 27 [*]:[*] 0. 48 [*]:[*] 0. 49) was maintained by EAEPO, which indicates that EAEPO is tolerant to heat treatment and is suitable for maintaining a healthy diet...|$|R
