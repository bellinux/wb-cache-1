50|$|Gelatin Microparticles are polymer microparticles {{constructed}} of gelatin. Gelatin, a <b>bipolymer,</b> is produced through the hydrolysis of collagen. Gelatin, {{along with its}} more familiar uses, is widely used {{for the production of}} microparticles due to its efficiency in forming gels as well as its biodegradability as a particle. Gelatin can be manipulated to form a stable matrix for biologically reactive compounds, allowing for the incorporation and protection against enzymatic degradation. Gelatin Microparticles are versatile particles and are easily loadable for the use within drug systems and alongside growth factors post-synthesis. Gelatin microparticles also allow for the biochemically controlled release of drug particles, growth factors, and other biological molecules.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: EPM-graft-methyl {{methacrylate}} and acrylonitrile (EPM-g-MAN) was synthesized by {{graft copolymerization}} of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and acrylonitrile (AN) onto ethylene–propylene <b>bipolymer</b> (EPM) {{using the method}} of suspension polymerization. A novel engineering plastic with high impact strength, AEMS, which shows excellent resistance to weatherability and yellow discoloration and aging properties, were prepared by blending EPM-g-MAN with styrene–acrylonitrile (SAN) resin. The influence of the suspension grafting copolymerization technologies, including monomer ratios, EPM ratios, initiator content on monomer conversion ratio, grafting ratio, grafting efficiency, and the impact strength of AEMS, were investigated. The result showed that the optimized reaction conditions were obtained when the mass ratio of AN/MMA-AN(fAN) was 15 wt%, the mass ratio of EPM/(EPMþMMA-AN) was 60 wt%, and the mass ratio of BPO/(EPMþMMA-AN) was 0. 6 wt%. When the EPM/ AEMS mass ratio was 25 wt%, the notched Izod impact strength of AEMS reached 55. 9 kJ/m 2. DSC and DMA analysis showed that the compatibility o...|$|E

Tensile and {{photodegradation}} {{behavior of}} poly(butylene succinate) /titanium dioxide nanoparticles (PBS/TiO 2) composite films were investigated over {{a range of}} filler content 0 - 10 wt%. The surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles was treated using propionic acid (C 3 H 6 O 2) and n-hexylamine (C 6 H 15 N) order to disperse them into the <b>bipolymer</b> matrices. The nanocomposite materials were prepared by solvent evaporation technique and compression molding machine. All samples {{with a wide range}} of filler addition exhibit the translucency. The surface morphology showed that a uniform dispersion of filler in the matrix existed when the nanoparticles content was less than 5 wt%. The results indicated that the percentage of weight loss of the nanocomposite films was higher than the neat PBS owing to UVA and UVC irradiation. Functionalized TiO 2 nanoparticles existing on the surface area suppressed photodegradation of the inner and backside of film specimens. The biopolymer films can easily be degraded by photocatalytic oxidation of TiO 2 under UV irradiation. The introduction of modified TiO 2 into PBS matrix improved the tensile modulus of the nanocomposites...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{determination}} of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA) {{based on the}} <b>bipolymers</b> of polyluminol and poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) has been successfully performed. The <b>bipolymers</b> can be easily deposited on electrode surface by electropolymerization of luminol and 3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene in acidic aqueous solution by repeatedly cyclic voltammetry. The film formation is dependent on their electro-oxidation potential so that two electropolymerized procedures were applied to avoid the disorder of polymer chains. Polyluminol was performed in the potential range of 0. 2 – 0. 9 V while poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) was performed in the potential range of 0. 3 – 1. 2 V. It was found surface-confined and stable in various scan rate and different pH conditions. The calculated surface coverage (Γ) was 6. 72 × 10 − 9 mol cm− 2. AA, DA, and UA were simultaneously determined by this electrode at + 0. 16 V, + 0. 31 V, and 0. 43 V, respectively. Compared with bare electrode, the <b>bipolymers</b> modified electrode exhibits lower over-potential and higher current response. It also shows more higher current response to AA, DA, and UA as compared with polyluminol and poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) modified electrodes.

40|$|Urea Amperometric {{biosensor}} {{was obtained}} {{on the base}} of nanostructured polypyrrole (PPy) and poly ortho-phenylenediamine (POPDA). The optimal conditions for monomer electropolymerization were determined. The effect of supporting electrolyte and number of deposition cycles on the OPDA and Py electropolymerization were studied. It was proved that POPDA and PPy were affected by pH changes and responded to the ammonium, product of urease catalyzed reaction. SEM images of the modified Pt/PPy electrode were presented. The cycle voltammograms and chrono amperometric curves of Pt/POPDA/urease and Pt/PPy/urease electrodes were studied. A good linear relationship was observed for Pt/POPDA/urease electrode in a concentration range from 6. 7 to 54 mM urea. For Pt/PPy/urease elec-trode the linear relation in the range from 0. 02 to 0. 16 mM urea was determined. The entrapped carbon nanotubes (CNT) in PPy film and the <b>bipolymer</b> layers were prepared for construction of Pt/PPy/CNT/urease, Pt/POPDA/PPy/urease and Pt/PPy/POPDA/urease biosensors. Obviously, the addition of POPDA to the composition of the two biosensors (Pt/PPy/POPDA/urease and Pt/POPDA/PPy/urease) reduced their sensitivity to urea. Pt/РPy/CNT/urease and Pt/РPy/ urease biosensors were 173 and 138 times more sensitive to urea than biosensor without PPy (Pt/POPDA/urease bio-sensor). It was found, that the performance of Pt/PPy/CNT/urease electrode was the best from the five obtained biosen-sors: linear range of urea concentrations—from 0. 02 to 0. 16 mM; sensitivity— 15. 22 µA/mM and detection limit— 0. 005 mM urea...|$|E
40|$|Ankara : The Department of Physics and the Institute of Engineering and Sciences of Bilkent University, 2010. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2010. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 92 - 96. Recent {{developments in}} nanoscience and nanotechnology have {{given rise to}} the discovery of hybrid nanostructured multi-component materials that serve several tasks all at once. A very important and rapidly growing field of these materials is the development of highly efficient fluorophores to meet the urgent demand of low-energy consuming, high-quality light emitters for future solid-state lighting applications. Such hybrid nanomaterials are entailed to exhibit extraordinary optoelectronic properties compared to the bulk case of their single components such as enhanced quantum efficiency, tunable multi-color emission, and reduction of multiple processing steps. Herein, to address these requirements, we propose and demonstrate novel design-based complex nanomaterials in hybrid multi-shell architectures for high-efficiency light generation. These requirements are made possible by using the concept of hybrid core-shell-… nanostructures comprising at least two units, including hybrid metalcore/dielectric-shell nanoparticles furnished with an outer shell of semiconductor nanocrystals for enhanced emission and different conjugated polymers forming a single multi-polymer nanoparticle and emitting simultaneously at different wavelengths. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we developed and demonstrated Au-silica core/shell nanoparticles that successfully assemble CdTe nanocrystals right on their silica shells for enhanced plasmonexciton interactions, while solving the common problems of lacking control in dielectric spacing and limited film thickness typically encountered in such plasmon-coupled nanocrystals. Here we present the synthesis and characterization results of this new set of multi-shell decorated nanoparticle composites with a tunable dielectric spacing thickness of silica shell precisely controlled by synthesis to optimize plasmon-exciton interactions for enhanced emission. Experimental data obtained from steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements together with extensive computational analysis clearly verify the strong plasmon-exciton interactions in these designbased multi-shell nanocomposites. In the second part, we construct bi-polymer nanoparticle systems in various architectures of core/shells, for each of which thorough investigations of the non-radiative energy transfer mechanisms are made. Here we present the synthesis and characterization results of these core/shell bi-polymer nanoassemblies. The flexibility of designing such <b>bipolymer</b> nanostructures allows for the optimization of maximum energy transfer efficiency. This concept of complex hybrid nanostructures for high-efficiency light generation opens up new paths for optoelectronic devices and nanophotonics applications including those in solid-state lighting.
