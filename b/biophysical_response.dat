Observations show that strong near-inertial internal waves were generated by the rapidly changing wind stress and the near-inertial energy was dissipated quickly across the thermocline. The strong turbulent mixing associated with the near-inertial baroclinic shear instability occurred with maximum eddy diffusivity above 3. 2 × 10 − 4 m 2 s− 1, and the surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration after the storm increased by 22. 2 %.

40|$|Habitat {{restoration}} {{is employed}} by biologists and managers {{to improve the}} natural functionality and value of aquatic resources. Systems suffer impairment from many sources, including excessive fine sediment, which negatively affects substrate composition, channel morphology, aquatic invertebrate habitat, and fish reproduction and recruitment. Primary objectives included monitoring the <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> to sediment abatement in the Big Manistee River watershed. Secondary objectives included (1) placing the <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> to the restoration {{in the context of}} a much larger watershed plan, (2) quantifying seasonal mottled sculpin movement and habitat use in Sickle Creek for 1 -year, and (3) determining habitat variables which may predict mottled sculpin distribution in Sickle Creek. Many sampling techniques were used to quantify metrics related to sediment, macroinvertebrates, and fish. Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags were used to determine mottled sculpin seasonal movements. Efforts were often successful in (1) preventing input of sediment, and (2) flushing accumulated sediment from study reaches. Where a positive response in substrate was observed, there was (1) an increase in macroinvertebrate abundance (avg. 218 - 330 individuals/m 2 in Sickle Creek (1 st order tributary), and 514 - 975 individuals/m 2 in Bear vii Creek (4 th-order tributary)), (2) increased abundance of sensitive taxa (Baetidae), and (3) appearance of additional sensitive taxa (Ueonidae, seven others) from the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera orders. The fish community showed a positive response, based on community metrics including richness, diversity, evenness, and similarity. Pronounced changes in Sickle Creek included the virtual disappearance of creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans), and northern redbelly dace (Phoxinus eos), and increased abundance of key taxa (Chinook salmon, O. tshawytscha). Many taxa exhibited upstream longitudinal distribution shifts, especially mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi). Mottled sculpin seasonal movements were larger than previous estimates (up to 839 m, mean 107 ± 26 m); distribution was linked to depth of fine sediment and percent medium and large wood. Bear Creek exhibited subtle changes, though we did observe increased CPUE for recreationally important fish taxa including rainbow and brown trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Salmo trutta). In conclusion, Sickle Creek responded more rapidly to restoration than Bear Creek, although in both, positive and statistically significant changes were observed...|$|E

Recently, however, dam removal has emerged as a strategy for addressing aging, obsolete infrastructure and more than 1, 100 dams have been removed since the 1970 s. However, only 130 of these removals had any ecological or geomorphic assessments, and fewer than half of those included before- and after-removal (BAR) studies. In addition, this growing, but limited collection of dam-removal studies is limited to distinct landscape settings. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the landscape context of existing and removed dams and assessed the <b>biophysical</b> <b>responses</b> to dam removal for 63 BAR studies. The highest concentration of removed dams was in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, and most have been removed from 3 rd and 4 th order streams, in low-elevation (< 500 m) and low-slope (< 5 %) watersheds that have small to moderate upstream watershed areas (10 - 1000 km 2) with a low risk of habitat degradation. Many of the BAR-studied removals also have these characteristics, suggesting that our understanding of responses to dam removals is based on a limited range of landscape settings, which limits predictive capacity in other environmental settings. <b>Biophysical</b> <b>responses</b> to dam removal varied by landscape cluster, indicating that landscape features are likely to affect <b>biophysical</b> <b>responses</b> to dam removal.

Here, we examine how cellular biophysical changes that occur immediately after growth factor depletion promote adaptation to reduced nutrient uptake. After growth factor withdrawal, nutrient uptake decreases, leading to apoptosis. Bcl-xL expression prevents cell death, with autophagy facilitating long-term cell survival. However, autophagy induction is slow relative to the reduction of nutrient uptake, suggesting that cells must engage additional adaptive mechanisms to respond initially to growth factor depletion. We describe an acute <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> to growth factor withdrawal, characterized by a simultaneous decrease in cell volume and increase in cell density, which occurs before autophagy initiation and is observed in both FL 5. 12 Bcl-xL cells depleted of IL- 3 and primary CD 8 + T cells depleted of IL- 2 that are differentiating toward memory cells.

The Alpert–Stein Factor Separation Methodology (FS) {{method has}} been {{utilized}} {{in the study}} of the <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> to changes in the environment to assess the relative contribution of different atmospheric factors to the biological system. In this chapter we will discuss crop simulation and land surface model-based assessments of the sensitivity to past and future changes in climatic conditions: increasing CO 2, soil moisture, temperature and radiative conditions, and crop management procedures (irrigation). FS is applied to discern specific contributions to plant responses by single variables or combinations of environmental conditions. Our FS analysis has shown that it is important to understand that biological responses are inherently dependent on multiple variables in the natural world and should not be limited to assessments of single specific parameters.

Results: We report {{for the first time}} the formation of an unprecedented circular structure at the cell surface that takes its origin at a single punctuate source and propagates in a concentric manner to reach a diameter of 2 - 3 mu m at least, thus significantly greater than a bud scar.

Due {{to differences in}} the densities of water and the various macromolecules which compose cells, changes in cellular composition are reflected by changes in cell density. Previously, methods have been described for measuring density at the single-cell level using suspended microchannel resonators by weighing the same cell in fluids of different densities. Here we describe a high-throughput version of this approach, in which cells are weighed sequentially in three cantilevers containing fluids of different densities. The system design and operation are described, measurement uncertainty is characterized, and single-cell density measurements are compared to those obtained using existing techniques. As a demonstration, we use the system to characterize the <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> of CD 8 ' T cells during activation.

40|$|Colonic epithelia from rats {{infected}} with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis have been studied under short circuit conditions {{and in response to}} challenge with worm antigen. Challenge from the serosal but not the mucosal side with antigen caused a transient increase in inwardly directed short circuit current. No effects were observed in comparable tissues from noninfected animals. Simultaneous measurements of short circuit current and of the fluxes of sodium or chloride ions showed there was an increase in electrogenic chloride secretion and an inhibition of electroneutral sodium chloride absorption, associated with antigen challenge. This result, together with the inhibitory effects of piretanide on the response to antigen challenge, indicate that chloride ions are a major carrier of the short circuit current response. However, the equivalence of the <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> to ion fluxes was not established, there being an excess of chloride secretion. The mast cell stabilizing agent, FPL 52694, significantly inhibited the current responses to antigen, while cromoglycate and doxantrazole were ineffective.

Anti-rat IgE produced qualitatively similar responses to antigen in both normal and sensitized colonic epithelia. However, the responses were significantly greater in tissues derived from infected animals. Maximally effective antigen concentrations prevented subsequent responses to anti-rat IgE in sensitized tissues, while anti-rat IgE only attenuated the responses to antigen. The ways in which antigen challenge modifies epithelial function is discussed, particularly in relation to its possible role in promoting rejection of the nematodes during secondary infection...|$|E

Cells were cultivated at two different temperatures (22 and 30 A degrees C) and were harvested at different growth phases (from the middle exponential phase to the late stationary phase). Bacterial membranes were characterized by determining the fatty acid composition, the lipid phase transition, and the membrane fluidity. Cultivability and acidification activity losses of L. lactis were quantified after freezing, drying, and 3 months of storage. The direct measurement of membrane fluidity by fluorescence anisotropy was linked to lipid composition, and it was established that the cyclopropanation of unsaturated fatty acids with concomitant membrane rigidification during growth led to an increase in the freeze-drying and storage resistance of L. lactis. As expected, cultivating cells at a lower fermentation temperature than the optimum growth temperature induced a homeoviscous adaptation that was demonstrated by a lowered lipid phase transition temperature but that was not related to any improvement in freeze-drying resistance. L. lactis TOMSC 161 was therefore able to develop a combined biochemical and <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> at the membrane level during fermentation.

40|$|Objective—To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> of the coarcted segment to balloon dilatation in the causation of aortic recoarctation.  Setting—Tertiary care centre/university hospital.  Design—Retrospective case series.  Methods—Records of 67  consecutive infants and children undergoing balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctations were examined for an 8. 7  year period ending September 1993.  At 12  months (median) follow up catheterisation, 15  (25 %) of 59  children developed recoarctation, defined as a gradient >  20  mm Hg. Stretch (balloon circumference − preballoon coarcted segment circumference/preballoon coarcted segment circum- ference), gain (postballoon coarcted segment circumference − preballoon coarcted segment circumference), and recoil (balloon circumference − postballoon coarcted segment circumference) were calculated from measurements obtained from cineangiograms performed before and immediately after balloon dilatation.  Results—The stretch in 44  children without recoarctation (2. 18  (1. 23)) was similar (p >  0. 1) to that in 15  children with recoarctation (1. 90  (0. 65)), implying that similar balloon dilating stretch was applied in both groups. Greater gain (p <  0. 05) was observed in the group without recoarctation (8. 8  (8. 0)  mm) than in the recoarctation group (5. 7  (2. 7)  mm) {{but this was not}} substantiated in the infant population. However, the recoil was greater (p < 0. 001) in the group without recoarctation (5. 1  (4. 3)  mm) than in the recoarctation group (2. 1  (1. 1)  mm); this was also true in the infant group.  Conclusions—Greater recoil in the patients without recoarctation implies preservation of intact elastic tissue in the coarcted segment. In the recoarctation group, with less recoil, the elastic properties may not have been preserved, thereby causing recoarctation. There might be a more severe degree of cystic medial necrosis in the recoarctation group than in the no recoarctation group. This needs confirmation in future studies.    Keywords: aortic coarctation;  recoarctation;  balloon angioplasty;  cystic medial necrosi...|$|E
40|$|Journal articleThe true {{efficacy}} of a programme of agricultural mitigation measures within a catchment to improve water quality {{can be determined}} only after a certain hydrologic time lag period (subsequent to implementation) has elapsed. As the <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> to policy is not synchronous, accurate estimates of total time lag (unsaturated and saturated) become critical to manage the expectations of policy makers. The estimation of the vertical unsaturated zone component of time lag is vital as it indicates early trends (initial breakthrough), bulk (centre of mass) and total (Exit) travel times. Typically, estimation of time lag through the unsaturated zone is poor, {{due to the lack}} of site specific soil physical data, or by assuming saturated conditions. Numerical models (e. g. Hydrus 1 D) enable estimates of time lag with varied levels of input data. The current study examines the consequences of varied soil hydraulic and meteorological complexity on unsaturated zone time lag estimates using simulated and actual soil profiles. Results indicated that: greater temporal resolution (from daily to hourly) of meteorological data was more critical as the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil decreased; high clay content soils failed to converge reflecting prevalence of lateral component as a contaminant pathway; elucidation of soil hydraulic properties was influenced by the complexity of soil physical data employed (textural menu, ROSETTA, full and partial soil water characteristic curves), which consequently affected time lag ranges; as the importance of the unsaturated zone increases with respect to total travel times the requirements for high complexity/resolution input data become greater. The methodology presented herein demonstrates that decisions made regarding input data and landscape position will have consequences for the estimated range of vertical travel times. Insufficiencies or inaccuracies regarding such input data can therefore mislead policy makers regarding the achievability of water quality targets. Teagasc Walsh Fellowship Scheme; NUI Galwa...|$|E

In this work, we describe the preparation of antibacterial and biocompatible polymeric film based on N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (VP) and 2 -hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), using ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), and synthetic acrylic monomer containing sulfadiazine chemically anchored. The synthesised polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) -based films were characterized by different techniques (1 H and 13 C NMR, ATR-FTIR, SEM, and TGA). In this study, the <b>biophysical</b> <b>responses</b> of bacteria and L 929 cells towards the prepared materials as model device surfaces were evaluated. The membrane that contains the anchored sulfadiazine moiety showed excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli as well as good biocompatibility. Based on the experimental results, this material is {{a good candidate for}} medical applications as a biomaterial.

40|$|The use of {{a carbon}} {{particle}} tattoo provided stable periosteal markers and a means of recording periosteal movement both anteroposteriorly and transversely during growth in guinea-pigs. In general, the periosteum migrated toward the cranial sutures. The radial pattern, demonstrated on the frontal bones and indicated on the nasal and parietal bones, showed that a periosteal envelope is identifiable with each bone. The area of origin of this centrifugal pattern of migration coincided with the ossification centre of that bone. Trabeculae and vascular canals tended to point {{in the direction of}} periosteal migration. The anteroposterior periosteal migration was proportional to but less than the anteroposterior growth of the craniofacial bones studied. The absolute medial periosteal marker migration, similar on the frontal and parietal bones, was directed in the opposite direction from the slight transverse bone growth. This may indicate a <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> to tension on the fibrous periosteum from the principally anteroposterior craniofacial growth. The amount of growth at the frontonasal, coronal and midline sutures diminished from anterior to posterior. The observed histological and morphological sutural characteristics concurred with these growth changes which correlate with the decreased cranial and increased facial growth during the age period studied. Although the fibrous periosteum is continuous over the separate membranous bones its behaviour appears to be intimately related to the growth of the craniofacial bones which it covers. The blending of the fibrous periosteum within the transverse sutures may prevent significant migration across craniofacial bones. It seems that the observed migratory patterns result from a close association of the fibrous periosteum with each growing craniofacial bone. The relationship of the fibrous periosteum to the growth of the craniofacial bones is a question requiring further investigation...|$|E
40|$|SummaryShortwave {{vegetation}} index (VI) {{and leaf}} area index (LAI) remote sensing products yield inconsistent depictions of <b>biophysical</b> <b>response</b> to drought and pluvial events {{that have occurred in}} Brazil over the past decade. Conflicting reports of severity of drought impacts on vegetation health and functioning have been attributed to cloud and aerosol contamination of shortwave reflectance composites, particularly over the rainforested regions of the Amazon basin which are subject to prolonged periods of cloud cover and episodes of intense biomass burning. This study compares timeseries of satellite-derived maps of LAI from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission (TRMM) with a diagnostic Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) retrieved using thermal infrared remote sensing over South America for the period 2003 – 2013. This period includes several severe droughts and floods that occurred both over the Amazon and over unforested savanna and agricultural areas in Brazil. Cross-correlations between absolute values and standardized anomalies in monthly LAI and precipitation composites as well as the actual-to-reference evapotranspiration (ET) ratio used in the ESI were computed for representative forested and agricultural regions. The correlation analyses reveal strong apparent anticorrelation between MODIS LAI and TRMM precipitation anomalies over the Amazon, but better coupling over regions vegetated with shorter grass and crop canopies. The ESI was more consistently correlated with precipitation patterns over both landcover types. Temporal comparisons between ESI and TRMM anomalies suggest longer moisture buffering timescales in the deeper rooted rainforest systems. Diagnostic thermal-based retrievals of ET and ET anomalies, such as used in the ESI, provide independent information on the impacts of extreme hydrologic events on vegetation health in comparison with VI and precipitation-based drought indicators, and used in concert may provide a more reliable evaluation of natural and managed ecosystem response to variable climate regimes...|$|E

"May 2013 "Heart failure begins with a reduction in the contractile strength of the cardiac myocytes (systolic dysfunction.) Cardiac myofibrils compensate via sympathetic activation to maintain adequate cardiac output. Beta-adrenergic stimulation has long been known as a cardiac inotropic agent, whereby it increases ventricular contractility yielding greater stroke volume (and more power output) for a given end diastolic volume, commonly known as the Frank-Starling Relationship. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate a potential molecular mechanism by which cardiac myofilaments augment ventricular contractility. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of cardiac myofilaments steepens the sarcomere length tension relationship, and it appears that phosphorylation of cTnI was both necessary and sufficient to mediate this <b>biophysical</b> <b>response.</b> The goal of this study was to investigate whether these biophysical/biochemical results translate to the organ (heart) level. The hypothesis was tested that the steepness of the left ventricular power-preload relationship would correlate with the phosphate content of cTnI. This was tested by direct comparison of cTnI phosphate content and ventricular function curves of the same isolated rat heart. The finding that these two parameters were highly correlated suggests that shifts in length-tension relationships at the myofilament level by covalent modulation of cTnI translate to ventricular function and may be a key molecular mechanism underlying the steepness of the Frank-Starling relationship...|$|E

40|$|Brazil has {{the largest}} {{commercial}} beef cattle herd in the world, with cattle ranching being particularly prominent in the 200 -million ha, Brazilian neotropical moist savanna biome, known as Cerrado, one of the world&# 8217;s hotspots for biodiversity conservation. As decreasing productivity {{is a major concern}} affecting the Cerrado pasturelands, evaluation of pasture conditions through the determination of biophysical parameters is instrumental for more effective management practices and herd occupation strategies. Within this context, the primary goal of this study was the regional assessment of pasture biophysical properties, through the scaling of wet- and dry-season ground truth data (total biomass, green biomass, and % green cover) via the combined use of high (Landsat-TM) and moderate (MODIS) spatial resolution vegetation index images. Based on the high correlation found between NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and % green cover (r = 0. 95), monthly MODIS-based % green cover images were derived for the 2009 &# 8211; 2010 hydrological cycle, which were able to capture major regional patterns and differences in pasture <b>biophysical</b> <b>responses,</b> including the increasing greenness values towards the southern portions of the biome, due to both local conditions (e. g., more fertile soils) and management practices. These results corroborate the development of biophysically-based landscape degradation indices, in support of improved land use governance and natural area conservation in the Cerrado...|$|R
40|$|Electrogenic ion {{transport}} across the epithelium lining the descending colon of male Sprague-Dawley rats has been measured under short-circuit conditions. Responses to kallidin (lysylbradykinin) were inhibited by 70 % if calcium {{was removed from}} the solution bathing the basolateral aspect of the tissue. Under identical conditions responses to prostaglandin E 1 and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate were not changed. Forskolin, which directly activates the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, was inhibited by 35 % by calcium removal, whereas responses to the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine were inhibited by 45 % by the same procedure. In the absence of calcium, strontium could substitute in promoting the chloride secretory events triggered by kallidin. Magnesium ions antagonized the effects of the kinin in the presence of calcium ions in the bathing solution. The effects of kallidin were partially antagonized by verapamil and trifluoperazine and were potentiated by isobutylmethylxanthine. These results, together with earlier evidence, suggest that kinin elicits a chloride secretory response in this epithelium by stimulating the formation of prostaglandins which then activate adenylate cyclase. Extracellular calcium ions appear to have {{an important role in the}} proximal part of this cascade for prostaglandin generation. However, biochemical correlates of these <b>biophysical</b> <b>responses</b> presented in the following paper indicate a more complex role for calcium in the genesis of the kinin response...|$|R
