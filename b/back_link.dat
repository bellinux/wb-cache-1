6000|$|In {{travelling}} by land {{there is}} a continuity of scene, and a connected succession of persons and incidents, that carry {{on the story of}} life, and lessen the effect of absence and separation. We drag, it is true, [...] "a lengthening chain" [...] at each remove of our pilgrimage; but the chain is unbroken; we can trace it <b>back</b> <b>link</b> by link; and we feel that the last still grapples us to home. But a wide sea voyage severs us at once. It makes us conscious of being cast loose from the secure anchorage of settled life, and sent adrift upon a doubtful world. It interposes a gulf, not merely imaginary, but real, between us and our homes--a gulf, subject to tempest, and fear, and uncertainty, rendering distance palpable, and return precarious.|$|E
50|$|When {{the search}} results pop {{up after the}} user has input their keyword, DeepPeep ranks the links based on 3 features: term content, number of backlinks. and pagerank. Firstly, the term content is simply {{determined}} by {{the content of the}} web link and its relevance. Backlinks are hyperlinks or links that direct the user to a different website. Pageranks is the ranking of websites in search engine results and works by counting the amount and quality of links to website to determine its importance. Pagerank and <b>back</b> <b>link</b> information are obtained from outside sources such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2011, the New York Times {{published}} an article titled “The Dirty Little Secrets of Search” detailing <b>back</b> <b>link</b> purchasing by the clothing retailer JCPenney. [...] By purchasing thousands of backlinks (often on unrelated sites), JCPenney dominated Google’s SERP across many clothing related queries, and even queries specifying a brand (JCPenney topped Samsonite for the query “Samsonite carryon luggage”). [...] Given Google’s previous updates and their emphasis on backlink analysis, the JCPenney incident revealed that flaws still existed within the Google ranking algorithm. Google quickly demoted JCPenney’s search position, crippling online sales. [...] Google has since lifted the demotion.|$|E

50|$|Each {{process is}} {{represented}} {{as an object}} and is interconnected {{with one another in}} the operating system. Within each process, there is a pre-allocated set of space that contains the address of the current, next, and mutex_locked thread. This vital information is listed in the EPROCESS in memory; the section in the object manager contains a double linked list of all known processes running, which is also known as the EPROCESS. However, DKOM's take advantage of this structure by modifying the front link (FLINK) to point to the previous node of the processor that we want to hide, and pointing the <b>back</b> <b>link</b> (BLINK) of the hidden processor to the previous structure. By modifying a subsection of the EPROCESS block, the list of currently active processes points around the hidden process. This essentially hides any paper trail of a given process or injector from the scrutiny of the scheduler because the process is hidden; yet it runs indefinitely because the thread it is in is active due to the round-robin policy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to piggy <b>back</b> <b>link</b> quality measurements to IEEE 802. 15. 4 acknowledgement frames by generating acknowledgements in software instead of relying on hardware support. We show that the software ACKs can be sent meeting the timing constraints in IEEE 802. 15. 4. This allows for a standard conforming, energy neutral dissemination of link quality related information in IEEE 802. 15. 4 networks. This information is available at no cost when transmitting data {{and can be used}} as input for various schemes for adaptive transmission power control and to assess the current channel quality.

It is available on arena of World Wide Web (WWW) in different forms and lacks a consistent definition. The search engines are struggling to eliminate spam pages through machine learning (ML) detectors. Mostly, search engines measure the quality of websites by using different factors (signals) such as, number of visitors, body text, anchor text, <b>back</b> <b>link</b> and forward link etc. information and, and spammers try to induce these signals into their desired pages to subvert ranking function of search engines.

Challenges include: biodiversity, climate change, eco-migrations, economy, energy, food, health, hunger, population growth, poverty, security, sustainability, transportation, urbanization, and water. Info bits are drawn from articles, podcasts, blogs, press releases, institutional reports, testimonies, encyclopedias, books, and documentaries. Each bit is referenced, date stamped, linked to the original article, tagged on multiple themes, and assigned a related image, which has its own description, author credit, date stamp, image permission, and <b>back</b> <b>link.</b> Connections are made to bits of info from the 2007 IPCC Report on Climate Change.

40|$|An internationally {{harmonized}} regulation permitting unlicensed transmission in {{the lower}} UHF bands is proposed, e. g. in the 515 - 605 MHz range. Transmission power levels up to 2 W EIRP are envisioned. This would give citizens {{a share of the}} best spectrum for free use. Tools against congestion could be based on mandatory stochastic channel back-off or, if multiple users are present, on adaptive power and bandwidth control. Compared to the FCC TV white space regulation, no <b>back</b> <b>link</b> would be needed as the spectrum would be used exclusively by wireless devices. In an environment of shrinking interest in terrestrial TV broadcasting, such a regulation is expected to create a new market for high-range consumer devices, competing with licensed communication, while being also suitable for offloading traffic from licensed operations. Furthermore, the approach will allow for efficient digitization of equipment for programme making and special events (PMSE). To enable accurate interference prediction, we propose that, instead of only providing transmitter regulation, receivers should also be required to adhere to a certain minimum selectivity...|$|E

Social networking is based on a certain structure that allow people to both express their individuality and meet people with similar interests. This structure includes having profiles, friends, blog posts, widgets, and usually something unique to that particular social networking website such as the ability to ‘poke’ people on facebook or hi 5. Blogs is another feature of some social networks is the ability to create own blog entries. While not as feature rich as blog hosts like wordpress or blogger, blogging through a social network is perfect for keeping people informed on own information.

40|$|Search engines {{retrieve}} {{and rank}} Web pages {{which are not}} only relevant to a query but also important or popular for the users. This popularity has been studied by analysis of the links between Web resources. Link-based page ranking models such as PageRank and HITS assign a global weight to each page regardless of its location. This popularity measurement has shown successful on general search engines. However unlike general search engines, location-based search engines should retrieve and rank higher the pages which are more popular locally. The best results for a location-based query are those which are not only relevant to the topic but also popular with or cited by local users. Current ranking models are often less effective for these queries since {{they are unable to}} estimate the local popularity. We offer a model for calculating the local popularity of Web resources using <b>back</b> <b>link</b> locations. Our model automatically assigns correct locations to the links and content and uses them to calculate new geo-rank scores for each page. The experiments show more accurate geo-ranking of search engine results when this model is used for processing location-based queries. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2008...|$|E
