40|$|AbstractIt is well {{established}} that the notochord influences the development of adjacent neural and mesodermal tissue. Involvement of the notochord in the differentiation of the dorsal pancreas has been demonstrated. However, {{our knowledge of the}} signals involved in pancreatic development is still incomplete. In order to identify proteins potentially implicated during pancreatic differentiation, we raised and characterized monoclonal antibodies against previously established embryonic pancreatic ductal epithelial cell lines (BUD and RED). Using the MAb 2117, the cell surface antigen 2117 (Ag 2117) was cloned. The predicted sequence for Ag 2117 is the rat homologue of BEN. Initially reported as a protein expressed on epithelial cells of the chicken bursa of Fabricius, BEN is expressed in a variety of tissues during development and described as a marker for the developing central and peripheral chicken nervous systems. A role has been suggested for BEN in the adhesion of stem cells and progenitor cells to the <b>blood-forming</b> <b>tissue</b> microenvironment. In this study, we demonstrate that BEN, initially expressed exclusively in the notochord during the early development of rat, is implicated in pancreatic development. We show that Ag 2117 regulates the pancreatic epithelial cell growth through the ras and Jun kinase pathways. In addition, we demonstrate that Ag 2117 is able to regulate the expression of the transcription factor PDX 1, required for insulin gene expression, in embryonic pancreas organ cultures...|$|E

In addition, the relative amounts of <b>blood-forming</b> <b>tissue</b> produced in normal and in UV embryos have been studied by Western blotting total protein from larval stages and by immunofluorescence on sections. The observations on midblastulae (around 5000 cells) were aimed at detecting any systematic retardation, due to u. v., of the slowing of the cell cycle that normally commences at the 2 - 4000 cell stage and makes possible zygotic transcription and the prep-aration for gastrulation. No such retardation was apparent. Observations on postgastrular stages gave {{an assessment of the}} size and character of the population of mesoderm founder cells, in relation to the control, for embryos visibly undergoing entirely nonaxial development. Little deficit in total mesoder-mal cell number was found, though the entire meso-derm adopted the histological character proper to only some 40 % of that in the normal pattern i. e. trunk lateral plate.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a number of steroid {{compounds}} on erythropoiesis in normal and polycythemic mice were examined. Of the steroids that stimulated erythropoiesis, the hormone testosterone and certain 5 β-H C 19 and C 21 nonhormonal metabolites were the most effective. Anti-erythropoietin abolished the erythropoiesis-stimulating effects of testosterone but not those exerted by the 5 β-H steroid, 11 -ketopregnanolone. Similarly, testosterone but not 11 -ketopregnanolone evoked the production of erythropoiesis-stimulating factor in rats. It is concluded that two mechanisms underlie the stimulating actions of steroids on erythropoiesis; one through the production of erythropoietin and the second involving a more direct influence on the <b>blood-forming</b> <b>tissues.</b> The 5 β-H steroid metabolites are postulated to act on erythropoiesis via the latter mechanism...|$|R

30|$|Leukemia is a {{malignant}} disease of <b>blood-forming</b> <b>tissues</b> causing the overproduction of immature blood cells that enter the blood stream (Azher & Shiggaon, 2013). It is the ninth most common cancer {{in men and}} the 12 th in women (Quinn, Babb, Brock, Kirby, & Jones, 2001). Leukemia can be classified basically as lymphoid or myeloid, according to the cell lineage, and as acute or chronic, according {{to the evolution of}} the disease (Love, 1936; Javed et al., 2012). Its etiologic factors include genetic alteration, environmental factors, smoking, alcohol consumption, chemicals, viruses, ionizing radiation, and immune deficiency (Kinane, 1999; Eden, 2010). This disease is usually treated by chemotherapy, combined with radiation and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (Seibel, 2008). Chemotherapy is one of therapeutic options for cancer, but it has severe side effects and dose-limiting toxicity (Camp-Sorrell, 2000). A lot of patients prefer medicinal herbs that are safe in contrast to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Mankaran, Dinesh, Deepak, & Gurmeet, 2013). Several types of herbs and fruits and their compounds were reported to inhibit carcinogen formation, block carcinogen interaction, and suppress tumor progression (e.g., ginseng root, garlic, Achillea fragrantissima) (Abdullah, Kandil, Elkadi, & Carter, 1988; Alenad, Al-Jaber, Krishnaswamy, Yakout, Al-Daghri, et al., 2013).|$|R

Materials and methods: Pregnant mice were exposed to 0, 1 or 2 [*]Gy at embryonic day 11. 5. Blood smears were obtained from pups at birth and on post-natal day 11, 21, 42 and 140. Hematological data (diameter of erythrocytes, percentage of reticulocytes and Granulocyte-to-Lymphocyte ratio [GLR]) and genotoxicity (micronucleated erythrocytes, micronucleated reticulocytes, CREST-positive and negative micronuclei) were assessed. Results: Prenatal irradiation caused perinatal reticulocytosis (which ended on postnatal day 11) and a dose-dependent increase of GLR (indicative of myeloid skewing) on postnatal days 42 and 140. Two temporally distinct genotoxic effects were observed: an early, acute damage (still detectable at birth and soon after) and a late, long-term damage. Conclusions: Increases in micronuclei frequencies and GLR observed from day 42 on are both ascribable to DNA damage.

40|$|In {{the adult}} {{organism}} some organs and tissues still contain proliferating and differentiating cells, whereas other organs only consist of non-dividing specialized cells. On {{the basis of}} their proliferative activity cell populations may be classified into three categories (135, 138, 208). In some cell populations, e. g. neurons, no cell divisions occur in the adult organism, and these have been referred to as "static" or "stable" cell populations. In other cell populations the number of cells keeps increasing in the adult organism at a slow rate with scattered mitoses, e. g. parenchymal cells of liver and kidney; such cell populations are called "growing" or 11 expanding" cell populations. In some organ systems cell proliferation occurs at a high rate in the adult organism, and mitotic figures are abundant. These cell populations do not increase in size, or only to a slight degree, and cell production is balanced by continuous cell loss. These cell populations are called "renewing" cell populations (141).

Terminology Experiments described elsewhere (1) led us to conclude that monocytes, histiocytes, macrophages, clasmatoeytes, polyblasts, Kupffer cells and microglia cells are synonymous terms for one cell type, which is capable of perpetuating itself by mitotic division. In this communication we shall refer to the round forms of this type of cell seen in the circulating blood, as monocytes, and to all other forms as histiocytes. Tumors of monocytes or histiocytes will be named histiocytomata (monocytoma) and the systemic disease characterized by these cells histiocytomatosis (monocytomatosis).

40|$|Leukemia {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that {{develops}} in <b>blood-forming</b> <b>tissues</b> of the immune system. These tissues can include the bone marrow or sites within the lymphatic system such as the lymph nodes. Leukemia progresses from a mutational event within a white blood cell. Often this mutation alters the cell’s normal life cycle, resulting in uninhibited cell division and growth. With this uncontrolled cell proliferation, mutated white blood cells accumulate and begin interfering with the functioning of healthy cells. Scientists are unsure of the exact mechanisms required for leukemia development. However, recently scientists identified four characteristic mutations in the protein tyrosine kinase, Lck, found specifically in the CTV- 1 leukemia cell line. Lck is suspected to play an important regulatory role in immune system cell growth. In this honors project, I introduced these mutations into the Lck gene and produced the wildtype and the mutant enzymes. By comparing the mutated enzyme’s activity to the wild-type enzyme’s activity, we can potentially better understand how a mutation in Lck could stimulate cell proliferation. One of the mutations is an insertion mutation located in the linker region of the Lck’s structure. It is a potentially interesting alteration that could result in the enzyme’s constitutive activation. This inability for the enzyme to be turned off not only demonstrates how mutated Lck could be contributing to cancer progression but also reveals valuable knowledge about the functional importance of the linker region in Lck...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the position of monocytes in certain lymph nodes and, if possible, to ascertain from what cells they arise. The writer (I) has shown in a previous communication that lymph nodes from different parts of the body exhibit marked differences in cytology and that developing monocytes may be found as normal constituents of all the lymph nodes of the rabbit, except the large mass lying in the mesentery of the intestine. At the time of the earlier communication, no reliable method had been found for demonstrating the relationship of monocytes within lymph nodes to other tissue elements. The method used in these observations, which has been fully described in another communication (2), gives true supravital staining of the cells, faithfully preserves this reaction in paraffin sections, and shows their relation to other cellular elements. The origin of the monocyte has been a much debated question. Various theories to the effect that monocytes arise from myeloblasts, lymphocytes, endothelium, histiocytes, reticulo-endothelial cells, and from undifferentiated cells have been advanced. Each is supported by a certain amount of evidence. However, no clear cut experiments are recorded to show that under normal conditions any of these cells give rise to monocytes.

According {{to the needs of}} body, Red and white blood cells usually grow, and divide precisely, and orderly. But in the leukemia, the regulation is disrupted, and it makes the growth of blood cells control aside. Nitroglycerin by transferring to nitric oxide (NO), and increasing of NO cellular oxidative stress cause induces apoptosis of cancer cells. This study was performed to survey the antitumor effects of nitroglycerin drug on K 562 cells in vitro. Methods: First, The leukemia cells K 562 category are cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10 percent of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, then different concentrations of drug prepared, and their antitumor properties at 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment was measured by MTT method. Then the drugs IC 50 measured. In the next stage, in order to survey the apoptotic, electrophoresis and staining with Hoechst colors used. Results: The results showed that the antitumor impacts of nitroglycerin dependently increase in a dose, and time. The IC 50 of nitroglycerin was observed at 79 (µmol /ml). Also, the results of electrophoresis and staining showed that these drugs have the effect of apoptosis. Conclusion: Based on the results, can be inferred that inhibitory effect of nitroglycerin on K 562 cells depends on time, and dose which the maximum inhibitory effect observed after 72 hours of treatments of the highest concentration.

In these studies we report that the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) directly or indirectly supported the survival of hematopoietic stem cells during culture of bone marrow with vector- producing fibroblasts, resulting in efficient recovery of stem cells able to compete for engraftment in irradiated recipient animals. The infection efficiency of hematopoietic stem cells recovered from these cultures was approximately 80 %; and all recipients (20 / 20) of the LIF- treated marrow were stably engrafted with the progeny of provirus- bearing stem cells. Expression of vector-encoded human adenosine deaminase (hADA) was detected in all recipients at levels averaging 15 - 50 % of endogenous murine ADA in all their hematolymphoid tissues. Survival of stem cells in untreated cultures was approximately 10 % of that observed from LIF-treated cultures, resulting in poor engraftment of recipient animals with transplanted cells. The infection efficiency of the few stem cells recovered from untreated cultures, however, was high (approximately 80 %), suggesting that LIF {{did not have an}} effect on infection efficiency per se, but acted at the level of stem cell survival. Consistent with the poor engraftment observed in the control animals, expression of vector-encoded ADA was only approximately 4 - 20 % of the endogenous levels.
