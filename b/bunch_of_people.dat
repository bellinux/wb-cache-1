Meyer also added, [...] "Just because [...] doesn't do kung fu and she cooks for her father doesn't make her worthy of that criticism". Shannon Simcox of The Daily Collegian has similarly dismissed the criticism surrounding Bella, commenting, [...] "While Bella plays the perfect damsel in distress that gets herself into sticky situations, she is also very in control of herself. She chose to move to Forks and be in a new place; she constantly faces a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who want to suck the life right out of her, and she is constantly pleading to become a vampire, too, so she can take care of herself and Edward." ...|$|E

The closest comparison you can draw in terms of our own military today is to think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces. They're these almost superhuman characters with a tremendous warrior ethic, who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece. I didn't want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms, because ultimately I do want you to root for the Spartans. I couldn't show them being quite as cruel as they were. I made them as cruel as I thought a modern audience could stand." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked if}} [...] "Recipe for Hate... Warhorse" [...] was written about any {{particular}} person, Mustaine {{said that there}} were [...] "a whole <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> that'd probably deserve that song," [...] but didn't single out anyone in particular. [...] "Silent Scorn" [...] is an instrumental song which is often played over the sound system at concerts; this can be heard on the band's live album Rude Awakening (2002) right after the final song in the set, [...] "Holy Wars... The Punishment Due". [...] "Return to Hangar" [...] is a sequel to [...] "Hangar 18" [...] from Rust in Peace; the captive aliens from the first song escape and kill their captors. On the live albums Rude Awakening and [...] (2007) it is played back-to-back with [...] "Hangar 18". The main riff and structure of [...] "When", the album's closing number, is reminiscent of [...] "Am I Evil?" [...] by Diamond Head, which Mustaine said was intentional.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Last Rites/Loved to Deth", {{consists}} of two parts. The first part, [...] "Last Rites", is an instrumental segue featuring a piano intro, a reinterpretation of J.S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. Mustaine explained that [...] "Loved to Deth" [...] was his [...] "version of a love song" [...] to his girlfriend at the time. The title track was inspired by The Punisher comic book, and tells of a paid serial assassin. The song caused minor media controversy when a man posted an online request to a radio station to play the tune, saying it was [...] "good music to go postal and kill a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to". The man was later arrested under suspicion of commencing a potential shooting spree. [...] "The Skull Beneath the Skin" [...] was developed under the working title [...] "Self Destruct". The song graphically describes a horrendous human torture, while also probing into the occult and black magic. Mustaine pointed {{that the creation of}} Vic Rattlehead was explained throughout that track. [...] "Rattlehead", according to Dave Mustaine, was dedicated to the band's mascot and their fans.|$|E
500|$|Following a Japanese tour in April 1988, Echo & the Bunnymen's lead singer, Ian McCulloch, {{announced}} that the band were going to split up.

After five months of speculation {{as to whether the}} split up was genuine, McCulloch met with {{the other members of the}} band in September 1988 and, despite the group's attempts to change his mind, told them he was leaving the band. McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview, [...] "The last days of The Bunnymen consisted of a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who were more interested in changing oil in their cars than rock 'n' roll. That pissed me off. I was doing every sodding interview, writing sodding every song." [...] Having been persuaded by Rob Dickins at WEA that the band could still be a success in the United States, Sergeant told McCulloch that he and the other two band members, bassist Les Pattinson and drummer Pete de Freitas, planned to continue. After a failed attempt to record with The B-52's singers Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson, the band advertised for a full-time replacement.|$|E

500|$|... "And Then There Were Fewer" [...] {{received}} widespread acclaim from {{critics and}} viewers, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "solidly funny, well-plotted, and nearly perfectly executed". In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the episode, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff commented that he enjoyed [...] "the 'a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> go to an isolated place and start getting killed' murder mystery subgenre", and that the episode [...] "made fun of the conceits of the genre". In the conclusion of his review VanDerWerff called the episode [...] "excellent and fun", and [...] "full of surprisingly gorgeous animation and a nicely creepy feel that hung over all of the jokes" [...] and rated it as a B+, the best rating between The Simpsons episode [...] "Elementary School Musical" [...] and The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Harder, Better, Faster, Browner". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the episode's writers for doing a [...] "solid job of creating a genuine mystery throughout the hour, keeping us guessing as to who did it and what their motive may have been". Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's numerous guest stars, and compared its portrayal of Diane Simmons to that of The Simpsons character Sideshow Bob. Natalie Zutter of Ology also praised the episode, calling it, [...] "Surprisingly, {{the best of the}} evening." [...] In the summary of her review, Zutter wrote that it was a [...] "fun murder mystery that lets us see all our favorite Quahog folks", while continuing to wonder whether the characters who were killed off would remain dead.|$|E
500|$|... 343 {{started with}} a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through {{development}}. Halo 4s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told {{they were going to be}} working on Halo 4. [...] "We had people who we hired who hated Halo because of 'X,'" [...] said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. [...] "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." [...] This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, Halo 4 executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make [...] "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. [...] With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an [...] "epiphany moment" [...] that proved the team was headed in the right direction was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was [...] "very traditional [...] ". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.|$|E
500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.
