50|$|After Sayf's death, he was {{succeeded by}} his brother <b>Baha</b> al-Din Sam <b>I,</b> who {{continued}} building Firuzkuh, and prepared an army to march towards Ghazna to avenge {{the death of his}} two brothers, but died shortly of natural causes before he reached the city. Ala al-Din Husayn, the younger brother of Sayf and Baha al-Din, then ascended the Ghurid throne. He, along with Fakhr al-Din Masud, shortly avenged their brothers by brutally sacking Ghazna. Ala al-Din Husayn later managed to conquer Garchistan, Tukharistan, and Bamiyan. Fakr al-Din Masud was shortly given Bamiyan as a part of his fief, starting the period of the Ghurid branch of Bamiyan. Ala al-Din Husayn later died in 1161, and was succeeded by his son Sayf al-Din Muhammad, who shortly died two years later. The son of <b>Baha</b> al-Din Sam <b>I,</b> Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad then ascended the throne.|$|R

50|$|Sayf al-Din Muhammad was {{succeeded by}} his cousin Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad, {{who was the}} son of <b>Baha</b> al-Din Sam <b>I,</b> and proved himself to be a capable king. Right after Ghiyath's ascension, he, with the aid of his loyal brother Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad, killed a rival Ghurid chief named Abu'l Abbas. Ghiyath then {{defeated}} his uncle Fakhr al-Din Masud who claimed the Ghurid throne and had allied with the Seljuq governor of Herat, and Balkh.|$|R
50|$|Ghiyath {{was born}} in 1139; {{he was the son}} of <b>Baha</b> al-Din Sam <b>I,</b> who briefly reigned as king of the Ghurid dynasty in 1149. Ghiyath also had a younger brother named Mu'izz al-Din. During his early life, Ghiyath along with Mu'izz al-Din were imprisoned by their uncle Ala al-Din Husayn but were later {{released}} by the latter's son Sayf al-Din Muhammad. When Sayf died in 1163, the Ghurid nobles supported Ghiyath, and helped him ascend the throne.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} avenge his brother, Sayf marched towards Ghazna in 1148, and scored a {{victory at the}} Battle of Ghazni while Bahram fled to Kurram.

50|$|After the {{accession}} of Sayf, {{he began}} persecution the Ismailis who were favored {{during the reign}} of his father. Sayf also freed the two sons of <b>Baha</b> al-Din Sam <b>I,</b> Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad and Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad. With the aid of Ghiyath, Sayf later waged war against the Oghuz Turks. Sayf was betrayed and murdered during a battle in 1163 near Merv by a brother of the Ghurid general Warmesh ibn Shith, whom Sayf had executed. Sayf was then succeeded by Ghiyath.|$|R

40|$|Vibrational energy {{relaxation}} (VER) of {{a selected}} mode in cytochrome c (hemeprotein) in vacuum is studied using two theoretical approaches: One is the equilibrium simulation approach with quantum correction factors, {{and the other}} is the reduced model approach which describes the protein as an ensemble of normal modes coupled with nonlinear coupling elements. Both methods result in estimates of VER time (sub ps) for a CD stretching mode in the protein at room temperature, that are in accord with the experimental data of Romesberg's group. The applicability of the two methods is examined through a discussion of the validity of Fermi's golden rule on which the two methods are based.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{apparent}} masking-level differences (MLDs) in users of bilateral bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) provide evidence of binaural hearing. However, there is considerably less acoustical isolation between the two ears with bone conduction (BC) compared to air conduction (AC). The apparent MLDs may have arisen, at least in part, from inter-cranial interference between signals arising from the two <b>BAHAs</b> (<b>i.</b> e. monaural effect). That might also explain some of the inter-individual variation in both the magnitude and the direction of the MLDs reported in BAHA users. The present study was composed of three experimental stages with the main aim to investigate the influence of interference in normal hearing participants by measuring masking level difference in AC and BC to explore the conditions contributing to the reported variation. An additional aim was to investigate the performance of a newly designed BC transducer; the balanced electromagnetic separation transducer (BEST), for bone conduction research as well as more general clinical use. Stage 1 evaluated the performance of the BEST in comparison to the clinically used RadioEar B 71 in a series of acoustical (sensitivity and harmonic distortion) and psychoacoustical (hearing thresholds and vibrotactile thresholds) measurements. The results from these studies led {{to the use of the}} BEST in the second and third stages because they produced significantly lower harmonic distortion at low frequencies (mainly 250 Hz). The psychoacoustic measurements alluded to the need to use different calibration values with the BESTs. Stage 2 was a preliminary investigation comparing the MLDs with standard bilateral configurations between the AC and BC in nine normal-hearing participants. Signals were pure tones at one of three frequencies (250, 500, 1000 Hz), presented via AC or BC. Broadband noise (100 - 5000 Hz) was always presented via AC at 70 dB SPL. Thresholds were estimated using a three-alternative forced choice procedure combined with an adaptive staircase. Transducers used were insert earphones and the BESTs for BC testing. The results from this stage showed a statistical significant difference between AC and BC MLDs at 250, 500 and 1000 Hz (mean difference is 9. 4, 6. 6 and 3. 5 dB respectively). Evidence of the change in the MLDs direction is observed at 250 Hz in three participants. Stage 3 consisted of the investigation of inter-cranial interference in eighteen normal hearing participants. This stage was composed of three main measurements. The first measurement compared the AC and BC MLDs at three test frequencies. The second measurement evaluated the transcranial attenuation (TA). The third measurement was the novel feature of the study it evaluated the monaural interference effect through the measurement of the diotic and dichotic conditions in one test ear. A significant discrepancy was found between the AC and BC MLDs of approximately 6, 1. 5 and 2. 5 dB at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz, respectively. The TA was found to be lower than 10 dB at the three test frequencies. Measurable MTLDs were reported in some of the participants, high inter-subject variability was observed in the direction of the MTLDs. The BEST can reliably replace the B 71 in clinical setup. Formal adjustment of the reference equivalent threshold force levels is advised. Binaural hearing was achieved through bilateral BC stimulation to a lesser magnitude compared to AC MLDs in normal hearing participants. The discrepancy between the AC and BC MLDs was reduced with the increase in the frequency. The discrepancy can partially be explained by the cross-talk of the signal in one ear. The results showed that in some participants the magnitude of the monaural tone level difference was similar to the magnitude of the BC MLD. Further investigation is recommended to investigate the association of the transcranial delay with the discrepancy between the AC and BC MLDs. This investigation also recommends the investigation of the AC and BC MLDs in patients fitted with bilateral BAHAs...|$|R
5000|$|A certain Ghori prince named Amir Banji, was {{the ruler}} of Ghori and {{ancestor}} of the medieval Ghori rulers. His rule was legitimized by the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid.Before the mid-12th century, the Ghoris had been bound to the Ghaznavids and Seljuks for about 150 years. Beginning in the mid-12th century, Ghor expressed its independence from the Ghaznavid Empire. In 1149 the Ghaznavid ruler Bahram-Shah of Ghazna poisoned a local Ghori leader, Qutb al-Din Muhammad, who had taken refuge {{in the city of}} Ghazni after having a quarrel with his brother Sayf al-Din Suri. In revenge, Sayf marched towards Ghazni and defeated Bahram-Shah. However, one later year, Bahram returned and scored a decisive victory against Sayf, who was shortly captured and crucified at Pul-i Yak Taq. <b>Baha</b> al-Din Sam <b>I,</b> another brother of Sayf, set out to avenge the death of his two brothers, but died of natural causes before he could reach Ghazni. Ala al-Din Husayn, one of the youngest of Sayf's brothers and newly crowned Ghurid king, also set out to avenge the death of his two brothers. He managed to defeat Bahram-Shah, and then had Ghazna sacked and burned and put the city into fire for seven days and seven nights. It earned him the title of Jahānsūz, meaning [...] "the world burner". The Ghaznavids retook the city with Seljuq help, but lost it to Oghuz Turks.|$|R
