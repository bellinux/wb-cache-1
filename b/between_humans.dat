5|$|In 1935 the Harvard medical {{researcher}} Hans Zinsser {{wrote the}} book Rats, Lice and History, alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus <b>between</b> <b>humans.</b> Despite this, the modern view is that only the body louse can transmit the disease.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological and {{historical}} records suggest interdependence <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and vultures {{for millions of}} years.

40|$|The love of God {{is usually}} {{interpreted}} as {{analogous to the}} loving relationship <b>between</b> <b>human</b> beings. However, since God is not like other people, his love cannot be identical with the love <b>between</b> <b>human</b> beings. We need therefore to explore {{the limits of the}} analogy <b>between</b> <b>human</b> and divine love.

40|$|Human and geographical” {{is a term}} {{short for}} the {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>human</b> and geographical environment. Sometimes, it’s {{used to refer to}} the relationship <b>between</b> <b>human</b> and nature. It is an ever-lasting fundamental relationship, and it is the foundation of all other relations in human society. The process of human using and changing physical geography equals to the evolutive process of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>human</b> and geography. With the social development and the progress of productive forces, this relationship develops and progresses. It is of dynamic character. Nowadays more {{attention has been paid to}} the research about the dynamic relationship <b>between</b> <b>human</b> and geography. It marks the progress of society and human’s awareness...|$|R
5|$|The {{physiological}} similarities <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> {{and other}} animals, especially primates, {{have led to}} more comparative research between the two groups.

5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on {{the similarities and differences}} <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order from any of the other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{literature}} suggests human resource practices stimulate innovation in organizations, limited studies {{have investigated the}} relationships <b>between</b> <b>human</b> resource practices and innovation activity in organizations, particularly in the {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). This study attempts to address this issue by examining the relationships <b>between</b> <b>human</b> resource practices and innovation activity of 48 small and medium-sized enterprises in the Malaysian manufacturing sector.

5|$|Human ecology {{deals with}} {{interdisciplinary}} {{study of the}} relationship <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and their natural, social, and built environments. In addition to Environmental sociology, this field overlaps with architectural sociology, urban sociology, {{and to some extent}} visual sociology. In turn, visual sociology—which is concerned with all visual dimensions of social life—overlaps with media studies in that it uses photography, film and other technologies of media.|$|E
5|$|In {{the distant}} future, {{thousands}} of years after a great war <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and their biologically engineered weapons, humans live in everything from small tribes to large nations. One nation, the Empire, has discovered a black tower {{in the middle of}} a lake near their capital, which gave them access to large amounts of ancient weapons which they used to beat back and control the ever present monsters in the world. The Imperials were corrupted by this power and became conquerors of others as opposed to liberators from a violent world.|$|E

5|$|The first-move {{advantage}} in chess is the inherent {{advantage of the}} player (White) who makes the first move in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often than Black, usually scoring between 52 and 56percent. White's winning percentage {{is about the same}} for tournament games <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and games between computers. However, White's advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} great {{interest}} in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were discovered in 1856, {{but at the time}} it was not clear that they represented a different species from modern humans.

5|$|Colonists {{arrived in}} the area where the park is located in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had {{plentiful}} wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, {{which was}} based on her {{doctoral}} research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In Animal Ethics in Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical focus in animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not wild, animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (causal) relationship <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and the animals' plight.|$|E
5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up into a ball and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E
