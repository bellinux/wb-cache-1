500|$|The video used soft focus, gentle {{lighting}} and airbrushing looks on Madonna. It starts with Timbaland chanting the opening line {{in front of}} a giant timer screen that counts down from four minutes. As he sings, a black geometric patterned screen comes from behind and engulfs all of the musical devices present. Madonna and Timberlake enter a house but run away from it after finding the screen there, which starts eating the hands and legs of the inhabitants of the house, thus showing their insides. After a number of shots showing Madonna and Timberlake jumping on and over cars to escape from the screen, they finally move into a supermarket. The screen follows them, consuming the long lines of stalls and the people present there. As the second chorus starts, they arrive in front of the screen where Timbaland is singing. After choreographed dancing, Madonna performs a <b>back</b> <b>arch</b> as the timer reaches zero time. The last [...] "tick-tock, tick-tock" [...] sound is heard, Madonna and Timberlake dance again on a long stage; the black screen approaches them from both sides. The video ends with both of them kissing, and the black screen devouring them. Timberlake's bones and ribs, and Madonna's cheeks are seen in the last shot.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in Milan, Italy between {{the dates of}} the 2009 leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. The concept of the video is in {{similarity}} to {{the title of the}} song; celebration of Madonna's career. According to MTV, the video is a throwback to Madonna's Erotica era and encompasses a dark music image. The Benny Benassi remix of the song is used in the video. It starts with Madonna asking the line [...] "Haven't I seen you somewhere before?". The music starts and the scenes cut between Madonna and her dancers start dancing to the music of the song. Madonna wears a crystal embossed, shouldered Balmain dress with knee-high Christian Louboutin boots. While she is present in almost every frame of the camera, she does not perform choreographed dance moves. Her dance is mostly confined to casual maneuvers. The dancers on the other hand, perform choreographed moves as a solo act. As the song progresses, more dancers are shown and they ultimately reach a club. The DJ in the club is portrayed by model Jesus Luz. Madonna indulges in sensual poses with him and removes his clothes in an attempt to recognize him, as the line [...] "I guess I don't recognize you with your clothes on" [...] is played. The two of them brush their lips together, and Madonna moves away to the dance floor again. Lourdes makes an appearance {{near the end of the}} video. She appears in an eighties styled, polka-dotted leotard and pants, and does a <b>back</b> <b>arch</b> on the ground. Madonna is then shown on the ground on all fours, or dancing while grabbing her groin. Both Madonna's and her dancer's moves are edited to appear in fast forward. Hip hop styled dancing is showcased towards the end of the video. [...] The end shot of the video portrays Madonna sliding down on the ground. Teaser trailers for the video, show Oakenfold dancing to the song, but his scenes are not included in the final version.|$|E

She was in the top three after the first rotation; but in the second rotation, she fell on her Yang Bo (a split jump with a <b>back</b> <b>arch).</b> She continued onto floor exercise where she earned a 15.425; which put her into first place going into the last rotation. She performed a double-twisting Yurchenko, but landed low, took a step, and placed her hands on the mat, and got a 0.8 deduction. She scored 14.025 and ended up in 6th place.|$|E
50|$|Pickups involve {{lifting the}} {{opponent}} {{off the ground}} and then bringing them down again. Common pick-ups are lifting variations of the double leg takedown, judo's Te Guruma or sukui nage (both classified as hand throws) and the suplex from wrestling, in which the attacker lifts their opponents body vertically and throws the opponent over their own center of gravity while executing a back fall (usually accompanied by a <b>back</b> <b>arch).</b> Variations of the suplex are common in most forms of wrestling and sometimes used in Mixed Martial Arts competition. In Judo the ura-nage throw is a version of the suplex, but it is importantly classified as a sacrifice throw.|$|E

5000|$|The Yau Kung Mun System is {{representative}} of southern styles in being based on a low, stable horse stance. It employs many upper body techniques and most kicks are kept low. The YKM stance (Chien Gung Ma) resembles the familiar [...] "ding gee ma" [...] or Kung-Fu side horse but <b>back</b> <b>arch</b> is more pronounced and the shoulders are thrown forward with arms and hands protecting the chest and groin area. Defense is natural since the critical areas of the body are behind the protective wall of the shoulders and arms. Kicks or punches delivered within range of the practitioner would still be {{out of range of}} vital areas. This same stance also lends itself readily to offense as the arms are already in the attack position and the back leg has the distance of leverage required for powerful kicking.|$|E
5000|$|Named after Karl Gotch, {{the move}} is {{technically}} known as a belly-to-back waist lock suplex or a <b>back</b> <b>arch</b> throw, the wrestler stands behind the opponent, grabs them around their waist, lifts them up, and falls backwards while bridging his back and legs, slamming the opponent down to the mat shoulder and upper back first. The wrestler keeps the waistlock and continues bridging with their back and legs, pinning the opponent's shoulders down against the mat. The regular pinning variation {{can be referred to}} as the German suplex pin. The wrestler can also release the opponent in mid arch, which is referred to as a release German suplex. Sometimes, rather than bridging for a pin, the wrestler may roll himself into another position to perform the move again, often referred to as multiple, rolling, or Non-Release German suplexes, in which the attacking wrestler performs a German suplex, then rolls his legs to get back into a standing position, but does NOT let the opponent go to do so. The attacking wrestler then repeats this numerous times, most commonly three, but sometimes up to eight or more. This variation is often associated with Eddie Guerrero, Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, Oliver Grey, and Brock Lesnar. Another variation was popularized by Rusev where he would carry his opponent in an Oklahoma roll and transit them to a release German Suplex, which he called [...] "Bulplex".|$|E

Japanese hip hop dancing duo Hamutsun Serve also made an appearance in the video. Before its release, Rolling Stone said that in the video Madonna and Timberlake act as if they were [...] "superheroes" [...] while they evade multiple obstacles. In the video, Madonna wore a cream colored corset, glistening black boots and styled her hair in platinum blond waves while Timberlake wore mainly denims and a scarf around his neck. Regarding the idea behind the music video, Madonna said that [...] "it was conceptualistic". She explained that the video was shot like a march past; [...] "It's a movement, and we want to take everybody with us." [...] About the idea of a black screen devouring everything, Madonna said,None of us did the concept of the black screen. It was just, you know, it's very conceptual. We basically gave the song to the two French directors & François and they came up with the only concept that I thought was interesting, with this black sort of amorphous graphic line slowly eating up the world.

40|$|We {{investigate}} two locomotion {{traits in}} dairy cows from overhead 3 D video to observe lameness trends. Detecting lameness -particularly {{at an early}} stage- is important {{in order to allow}} early treatment which maximizes detection benefits. The proposed physical setup is covert, non intrusive and it facilitates full autonomy; therefore, it could be implemented on a large-scale or daily-basis with high accuracy. The algorithm automatically tracks features to key regions (i. e. spine, hook bones) using shape index and curvedness measure from the 3 D map. The gait asymmetry trait is analysed {{in the form of a}} dynamic novel proxy derived from the pelvic height movements, as the animal walks. We have found this proxy sensitive to early lameness trends. The <b>back</b> <b>arch</b> trait is analysed using a fitted polynomial in the extracted spine region.

40|$|The study {{objectives}} were {{to provide a}} province-wide description of stall dimensions and the aspects of cattle welfare linked to stall design in the tie-stall industry. Data on stall design; stall dimensions; and the prevalence of lameness, injury, and hind limb and udder cleanliness in lactating dairy cattle were collected from a sample of 317 tie-stall farms across Ontario. The majority of the study farms (90 %) had stalls with dimensions (length, width, tie-chain length, and tie rail height) that were less than the current recommendations. This may explain, in part, the prevalence of lameness measured as the prevalence of <b>back</b> <b>arch</b> (3. 2 %) and severe hind claw rotation (23 %), hock lesions (44 %), neck lesions (3. 8 %), broken tails (3 %), dirty hind limbs (23 %), and dirty udders (4. 6 %).

40|$|Background Although {{a number}} of studies have found that {{maternal}} stress affects the fetus, it is unclear whether jerky fetal movements observed on ultrasound scans are indicative of fetal stress, or whether they are part of normal development. Aims The present study was designed to examine the relationship between jerky fetal arm movements in relation to fetal age and stress. Methods Video recordings were made of routine ultrasound scans of 57 fetuses (age range 8 to 33 weeks) classified into three age groups: 1 st trimester (8 – 12 weeks, N = 9), 2 nd trimester (13 – 24 weeks, N = 38), and 3 rd trimester (26 – 33 weeks, N = 10). Following previous research on stress behaviour in neonates, a fetal index of stress was derived from frequency of hiccup, <b>back</b> <b>arch</b> and rhythmical mouthing. Results Results indicated that while stress level was unrelated to fetal age, jerkiness of arm movements was significantly associated with the fetal stress index but not age. Conclusions Our findings suggest that jerky arm movements in fetuses are suggestive of fetal stress. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAssessment of {{lameness}} {{prevalence and}} severity requires visual evaluation of thelocomotion of a cow. Welfare schemes including locomotion assessments {{are increasingly being}} adopted, and more farmers and their veterinarians might implement a locomotion-scoring routine together. However, high within-observer agreement {{is a prerequisite for}} obtaining valid mobility scorings, and within-observer agreement cannot be estimated in a barn, because the gait of cows is dynamic and may change between 2 occasions. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the within-observer agreement according to the observers’ educational background and experience with cattle, based on video recordings with very diverse types of gait. Groups of farmers, bovine veterinarians, first- and fourth-year veterinary students, researchers, and cattle-inexperienced sensory assessors evaluated mobility using a 5 -point mobility score system developed specifically for walking cows (n= 102 observers). The evaluation sessions were similar for all groups, lasted 75 min, and were organized as follows: introduction, test A, short training session, break, and test B. In total, video recordings of 22 cows were displayed twice in a random order (11 cows in each test × 2 replicates). Data were analyzed applying kappa coefficient, logistic regression, and testing for random effects of observers. The crude estimates of 95 % confidence interval for weighted kappa in test A and B ranged, respectively, from 0. 76 to 0. 80 and 0. 70 to 0. 75. When adjusting for the fixed effects of video sample and gait scoring preferences, the probability of assigning the same mobility score twice to the same cow varied from 55 % (sensory assessors) to 72 % (fourth-year veterinary students). The random effect of the individual observers was negligible. That is, in general observers could categorize the mobility characteristics of cows quite well. Observers who preferred to assess the attributes <b>back</b> <b>arch</b> or the overall mobility score (based on uneven gait) had the highest agreement, respectively, 69 or 68 %. The training session seemed insufficient to improve agreement. Nonetheless, even novice observers were able to achieve perfect agreement up to 60 % of the 22 scorings with merely the experience obtained during the study (introduction and training session). The relatively small differences between groups, together with a high agreement, demonstrate that the new system is easy to follow compared with previously described scoring systems. The mobility score achieves sufficiently high within-observer repeatability to allow between-observer agreement estimates, which are reliable compared with other more-complex scoring systems. Consequently, the new scoring scale seems feasible for on-farm applications as a tool to monitor mobility within and between cows, for communication between farmers and veterinarians with diverse educational background, and for lamenessbenchmarking of herds...|$|E
