5000|$|The {{approach}} is most distinctive for its initial {{lack of an}} agenda, which {{sets the stage for}} the meeting's participants to create the agenda for themselves, in the first 30-90 minutes of the meeting or event. Typically, an [...] "open space" [...] meeting will begin with short introductions by the sponsor and usually a single facilitator. The sponsor introduces the purpose; the facilitator explains the [...] "self-organizing" [...] process called [...] "open space." [...] Then the group creates the working agenda, as individuals post their issues in bulletin board style. Each individual [...] "convener" [...] of a <b>breakout</b> <b>session</b> takes responsibility for naming the issue, posting it on the bulletin board, assigning it a space and time to meet, and then later showing up at that space and time, kicking off the conversation, and taking notes. These notes are usually compiled into a proceedings document that is distributed physically or electronically to all participants. Sometimes one or more additional approaches are used to sort through the notes, assign priorities, and identify what actions should be taken next. Throughout the process, the ideal facilitator is described as being [...] "fully present and totally invisible", [...] "holding a space" [...] for participants to self-organize, rather than managing or directing the conversations.|$|E
