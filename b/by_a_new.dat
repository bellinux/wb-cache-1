5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{succession}} to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy. The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English elite and its replacement <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.|$|E

5|$|After a brief postwar increase, Troy's {{population}} began {{a continuing}} decline. The city began {{the first of}} several urban renewal plans shortly after adopting its 1962 master plan. Those plans called for the demolition of many buildings downtown, to be replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> arterial road, large public housing projects and a shopping mall. After various delays, those projects were either scaled back or abandoned entirely. In the interim many businesses either closed or moved out of downtown.|$|E

5|$|Bull's station {{building}} {{burned down}} in 1914 {{and was replaced}} two year later <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>new.</b> By then {{it was decided that}} the line past Lysaker would be upgraded and Lysaker became the first of many stations on the line to be designed as an elevated station. The tracks were thereby placed elevated with an island platform with the station on the side, as the first station in Norway designed for double-track operation. The new station was designed in Baroque Revival by Adalbert Kielland at NSB Arkitektkontor. One year later the wooden bridge over Lysakerelven was replaced by a stone bridge.|$|E

5|$|Continued {{problems}} with the food supply, coupled the unpopularity {{of some of the}} government's measures, led to widespread press criticism of the Pierlot government. Strikes across the country in February 1945 further destabilised the government. On 7 February 1945, Pierlot publicly defended the actions of the government in parliament, but failed to make a significant impression. The government fell in February, and was replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> short-lived national union government under Achille Van Acker while the polemic surrounding the possible dismissal or restatement of Leopold III were considered.|$|E
5|$|During {{early studies}} of the optical {{spectrum}} of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on Earth.

Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.|$|E
