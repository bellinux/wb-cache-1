50|$|A <b>blade</b> <b>connector</b> {{is a type}} {{of single}} wire {{connection}} using a flat conductive blade which is inserted into a blade receptacle. Usually both <b>blade</b> <b>connector</b> and blade receptacle have wires attached to them either through of the wire to the blade or crimping of the blade to the wire. In some cases the blade is an integral manufactured part of a component (such as a switch or a speaker unit), and a blade receptacle is pushed onto the blade to form a connection.|$|E
5000|$|A {{common type}} of <b>blade</b> <b>connector</b> is the [...] "Faston terminal". While Faston is a {{trademark}} of TE Connectivity (formerly Tyco Electronics), it has come into common usage. Faston connectors come in male and female types. They have been commonly used since the 1970s.|$|E
40|$|The {{instability}} of the thermal characteristics of rotating-blade coupling (RBC), with longitudinal ribbed turbulators, in real-time four-wheel-drive (4 WD) vehicles has been investigated. The key parameters approximate {{to the operating}} conditions of a real vehicle. The co-axial rotating channel flow exhibits a pattern of unstable Taylor vortices. Longitudinal rib-roughened walls were employed to prevent high temperatures in local regions. The local temperature-distributions of the RBC with longitudinal ribbed turbulators were measured and compared with those with smooth walls. Longitudinal ribbed turbulators can: (i) prevent local increases in temperature, (ii) increase {{the lives of the}} parts of a rotational <b>blade</b> <b>connector</b> and (iii) protect the motive sources of 4 WD vehicles.

50|$|Power entry modules {{frequently}} allow {{connections to}} the equipment circuitry using quick connect tab terminals, also known as <b>blade</b> <b>connectors.</b> An AC inlet connector allows use of a separate, detachable AC line cord that has the type of wall plug favored by the locality. IEC 60320 AC inlet connectors typically used can handle either 120 or 250 volts.|$|R
5000|$|AMP FASTON {{terminals}} {{are widely}} used in electronic and electrical equipment, and compatible terminals are manufactured by many different vendors, commonly using the term [...] "quick disconnect", [...] "tab" [...] terminals, or <b>blade</b> <b>connectors.</b> They are similar in size {{to some of the}} Packard terminals, such as Packard 56, and may have been derived from them.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} {{configurations}} of NEMA plug and socket: straight-blade and locking. Numbers prefixed by L are twist-lock, others are straight <b>blade.</b> Locking type <b>connectors</b> are found mostly in industrial applications and are not common in residential and light commercial use.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{concerns a}} connector, in an aircraft engine, for mounting a ring to a turbine rotor which the ring surrounds. The ring carries propeller <b>blades,</b> and the <b>connector</b> transmits both thrust and torque loads between {{the ring and}} the rotor, without significant deformation. However, the connector does deform {{in order to accommodate}} differential thermal growth between the ring and the rotor...|$|R
50|$|An insulation-displacement contact (IDC), {{also known}} as insulation-piercing contact (IPC), is an {{electrical}} connector designed {{to be connected to}} the conductor(s) of an insulated cable by a connection process which forces a selectively sharpened blade or blades through the insulation, bypassing the need to strip the conductors of insulation before connecting. When properly made, the <b>connector</b> <b>blade</b> cold-welds to the conductor, making a theoretically reliable gas-tight connection.|$|R
5000|$|... "Breakouts" [...] {{are often}} used to connect {{fixtures}} to the cable. The breakout consists of a male Socapex connector with six [...] "tails" [...] with female Parallel Blade plug, stage pin connector, IEC 60309 16 A, NEMA L5-20P 'twist-lock', BS 546 15 A or Schuko connectors, according {{to the standards of}} the region in which the assembly is being used. A [...] "breakin" [...] is the opposite, consisting of [...] "tails" [...] with male Parallel <b>Blade,</b> stage pin <b>connectors,</b> IEC 60309 16 A, NEMA L5-20R 'twist-lock', BS 546 or Schuko connectors feeding a female socapex connector. These are used to connect Socapex cables to dimmer packs that do not have Socapex outputs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the groove}} {{formed by the}} V-shaped blade, there are two thin wires leading from {{the far end of}} the <b>blade</b> to a <b>connector</b> in the bellguard. These wires are held in place with a strong glue. The amount of glue is kept to a minimum as in the {{unlikely}} (but possible) case that a fencer manages a touch in that glue, the touch would be registered on the electrical equipment, as the glue is not conductive (the blade is grounded). In the event of tip to tip hits, a point should not be awarded. A [...] "body cord" [...] with a three-pronged plug at each end is placed underneath the fencer's clothing and attached to the connector in the bellguard, then to a wire leading to the scoring box. The scoring box signals with lights (one for each fencer) and a tone each time the tip is depressed.|$|R
