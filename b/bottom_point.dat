25|$|The set of nine {{campaign}} stars {{was designed}} by the Royal Mint engravers. The stars all have a ring suspender that passes through an eyelet formed above the uppermost point of the star. They are six–pointed stars, struck in yellow copper zinc alloy {{to fit into a}} 44 millimetres diameter circle, with a maximum width of 38 millimetres and 50 millimetres high from the <b>bottom</b> <b>point</b> of the star {{to the top of the}} eyelet.|$|E
25|$|The second logo {{adopted a}} blue {{triangle}} (with the <b>bottom</b> <b>point</b> missing) {{and a red}} triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to evoke a vertically-displayed national flag (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986, {{when it would be}} replaced by the current logo.|$|E
25|$|Southern Television's logo is {{sometimes}} {{said to be}} a compass, what with the directional station name {{and the fact that the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>point</b> on the logo is longest – thereby suggesting a compass pointing south, in the direction of Southern Television's service area. However, the general consensus is that it is a star, named after the Southern Star and because Southern Television's final transmission showed the logo zooming off into the night sky. For the purposes of this article, the logo will be referred to as a star, to reflect what it is most popularly called.|$|E
50|$|In 1975 the new {{track was}} {{complete}} on the Middle Road between <b>Bottom</b> <b>Points</b> and Top Points.

25|$|Southern Television's first {{identity}} featured an {{art deco}} style star which zoomed into screen before the <b>bottom</b> <b>point</b> extended downwards. The colour scheme of varying tones of grey, black and white. This was replaced {{in the early}} 1960s with a white rotating star against a black background against a drumroll jingle. This was again altered in the mid-1960s to the familiar star shape against a black background and accompanied by a jingle featuring a cacophony of noises. This shape formed from a circle, with the diagonal lines moving out and joining the circle and the horizontal and vertical lines being drawn last, with the name added last.|$|E
25|$|The 1980–1981 {{season was}} arguably the rock <b>bottom</b> <b>point</b> {{of the tape}} delay era for CBS. CBS aired {{four of the six}} Finals games on tape delay and six of nine during the Conference Finals. Just like the {{previous}} year, CBS scheduled Games 3 and 4 of the NBA Finals without an off-day to avoid yet another tape delayed game. CBS wanted the Pacific teams to advance in the playoffs so that they could show live games at 11:30p.m. on the Eastern U.S.; however, the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers were upset in Round 1, while the Phoenix Suns were upset in Round 2. This left two teams located in the Central Time Zone, the Houston Rockets and Kansas City Kings, to play in the Western Conference Finals.|$|E

50|$|The Lithgow Zig Zag {{line was}} {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the Main Western line and opened on the 19 October 1869. Between Lithgow and Clarence, the Main Western line needed to climb the western flank of the Blue Mountains, overcoming a vertical distance of 550 ft. The alternative eventually decided upon required the use of two railway zig zags known as Top <b>Points</b> and <b>Bottom</b> <b>Points,</b> where all trains had to reverse. The line had a ruling grade of 1:42 (~2.38%) on three inclines known as the Top Road (above Top Points), Middle Road (between the two zig zags) and Bottom Road (below <b>Bottom</b> <b>Points).</b> The line included several short tunnels and some viaducts.|$|R

50|$|In 1972 a {{cooperative}} formed to re-use the line using rolling stock sourced from inter-state. In 1975 the line re-opened {{as a tourist}} attraction, operating between Top and <b>Bottom</b> <b>Points.</b> The re-development extended to Mt Sinai halt in 1987 and on to Clarence in 1988.|$|R
50|$|When the Zig Zag Railway reopened in October 1975, <b>Bottom</b> <b>Points</b> was a {{terminal}} {{station on the}} line. It has a water crane at one end to replenish locomotives. The signal box was built in 1910 when the Ten Tunnels line opened, and was later relocated.|$|R
50|$|There were {{plans to}} replace the section of 1 in 42 from Lithgow to <b>Bottom</b> <b>points</b> with a second {{horseshoe}} curve-like longer deviation, or with a spiral, but as this section {{in the open air}} could be operated with bank engines, this second stage deviation was never carried out.|$|R

The coordinates of each pixel are denoted in red on Figure 2.|$|E
50|$|The Zig Zag Railway {{have plans}} to extend the railway from Clarence to Newnes Junction, using the Dargans Deviation. They are {{currently}} halfway in relaying the track to Narrow Gauge. One {{of the reasons is}} because Newnes Junction will provide a much better interchange with Blue Mountains Line services than Zig Zag <b>Bottom</b> <b>Points,</b> and this indicates that the Newnes Junction station will be restored in future.|$|R
5000|$|The Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle model {{differs from}} {{previous}} models {{of poverty in}} that it looks at the interactions between growth and inequality, rather than considering the two separately. On the Poverty-Growth-Inequality Triangle, the <b>bottom</b> <b>points</b> of the triangle are boxed together {{under the heading of}} [...] "development strategy," [...] because Bourguignon believed the mix of policies to reduce poverty should depend on that relationship between growth and inequality.|$|R

At the Kaikata Seamount, they are found in such numbers that the fish overlap one another on the <b>bottom.</b> <b>Point</b> densities at the Daikoku Seamount have been recorded as high as 392 individuals per square meter; these densities are an order of magnitude higher than flatfish densities reported anywhere else.|$|E
50|$|Stomachers {{were often}} embroidered, or covered in pearls and other jewels. They {{could be made}} of the same fabric as the dress or of a {{contrasting}} fabric. Depending on the period, their <b>bottom</b> <b>point</b> was at waist level, or lower; {{towards the end of the}} 18th Century they could be as deep as 10 inches below the waistline, making it impossible for the woman wearing them to sit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the scope}} of quality {{inspection}} for glass vessels, we introduce a novel method to automatically evaluate 3 -D range data acquired by a sheet-of-light sensor {{for the purpose of}} detecting discrepancies in the bottom measures of transparent vessels. We apply a histogram-based segmentation of the <b>bottom’s</b> <b>point</b> clouds to automatically derive parameters for the classification of the inspected object. The major benefit is the high inspection speed meeting the requirements of 100 % inspection in production lines running at a speed of three to ten bottles per second...|$|R
5000|$|The {{levels of}} ACTFL’s scale can be {{conceived}} as an inverse triangle, with the “Superior” rating {{at the top}} representing {{a wide range of}} skill in linguistic structures, vocabulary, and fluency. The Novice Low category forms the <b>bottom</b> <b>point</b> of the triangle, showing little functional knowledge of the language. Each progressive category represents broader skills and depth of knowledge. While one can progress relatively quickly through the Novice levels, progress is much slower through the upper ratings.|$|E
50|$|The kingpin axis is {{the line}} between the upper and lower ball joints of the hub. On a MacPherson strut, the top pivot point is the strut bearing, and the <b>bottom</b> <b>point</b> is the lower ball joint. The {{inclination}} of the steering axis is measured as the angle between the steering axis and the centerline of the wheel. This means that if the camber angle is adjustable within the pivot points the scrub radius can be changed, this alters the width and offset of the tires on a vehicle.|$|E

50|$|In 1890, it was {{proposed}} {{to bypass the}} troublesome Lapstone Zig Zag by utilising a tunnel. This proposal was soon approved and in March 1891, tenders were called for its construction. The line left <b>Bottom</b> <b>Points</b> and continued into a gully before entering the 2165 ft tunnel, on a continuous 1-in-33 gradient. After emerging just below the original alignment, the line curved {{to the left and}} ascended slightly before rejoining the original line at Glenbrook.
