50|$|Rosen also {{questioned}} {{what he believed}} to be many aspects of mainstream interpretations of biochemistry and genetics. He objects {{to the idea that}} functional aspects in biological systems can be investigated via a material focus. One example: Rosen disputes that the functional capability of a <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>protein</b> can be investigated purely using the genetically encoded sequence of amino acids. This is because, he said, a protein must undergo a process of folding to attain its characteristic three-dimensional shape before it can become functionally active in the system. Yet, only the amino acid sequence is genetically coded. The mechanisms by which proteins fold are not completely known. He concluded, based on examples such as this, that phenotype cannot always be directly attributed to genotype and that the chemically active aspect of a <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>protein</b> relies on more than the sequence of amino acids, from which it was constructed: there must be some other important factors at work, that he did not however attempt to specify or pin down.|$|E
5000|$|When {{genes from}} one {{organism}} {{are expressed in}} another organism the resulting protein sometimes forms inclusion bodies. This is often true when large evolutionary distances are crossed: a cDNA isolated from Eukarya for example, and expressed as a recombinant gene in a prokaryote risks {{the formation of the}} inactive aggregates of protein known as inclusion bodies. While the cDNA may properly code for a translatable mRNA, the protein that results will emerge in a foreign microenvironment. This often has fatal effects, especially if the intent of cloning is to produce a <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>protein.</b> For example, eukaryotic systems for carbohydrate modification and membrane transport are not found in prokaryotes. The internal microenvironment of a prokaryotic cell (pH, osmolarity) may differ from that of the original source of the gene. Mechanisms for folding a protein may also be absent, and hydrophobic residues that normally would remain buried may be exposed and available for interaction with similar exposed sites on other ectopic proteins. Processing systems for the cleavage and removal of internal peptides would also be absent in bacteria. The initial attempts to clone insulin in a bacterium suffered all of these deficits. In addition, the fine controls that may keep the concentration of a protein low will also be missing in a prokaryotic cell, and overexpression can result in filling a cell with ectopic protein that, even if it were properly folded, would precipitate by saturating its environment.{citation needed} ...|$|E

Novel hybrids, {{comprised}} of a <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>protein</b> molecule core, {{coated with a}} thin outer layer of porous metallic silver, were developed in our lab. By the conjugation of silver reducing polymer {{to the surface of}} soluble, molecular, <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>protein</b> molecules and subsequent addition of silver salt, electroless silver deposition, culminating in thin porous metallic coating, was directed {{to the surface of the}} protein molecules.
