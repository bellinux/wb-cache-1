5000|$|The {{island is}} {{noted for its}} parks and scenery {{including}} West Vancouver Park which overlooks the Saint Lawrence River. The 26-hectare Domaine Saint-Paul natural woodland {{in the southern part}} of the island, a crucial nesting area for more than a hundred species of birds, is one of the last remaining natural woodlands in southern Montreal. It has been progressively eroded by development. The woodland surrounds an artificial lake called Lac des <b>Battures.</b> This lake was actually created by accident as parts of the river known as [...] "water lots" [...] became landlocked during landfill operations in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of this landfill came from the excavation of Montreal's underground Metro system in the mid-1960s. That part of the Island was subject to annual floods caused by spring runoff. The resulting dykes and fill allowed an additional few million square feet to be used for development as well as a golf course.|$|R
5000|$|In 1807, after {{conducting}} a successful suit {{on behalf of}} a client’s title to a part of the <b>batture</b> or alluvial land near New Orleans, Livingston attempted to improve part of this land (which he had received as his fee) in the <b>Batture</b> Ste. Marie. Great popular excitement was aroused against him; his workmen were mobbed; and territorial Governor William C. C. Claiborne, when appealed to for protection, referred the question to the Federal government. [...] It has been alleged that Livingston’s case was damaged by then-President Thomas Jefferson, who believed that Livingston had favored Aaron Burr in the Presidential election of 1800, and that he had afterwards been a party to Burr’s schemes. Jefferson made it impossible for Livingston to secure his property title, since by asserting the claim that such battures were the property of the Federal government, Livingston's title obtained from the Territorial Court was invalid. In response, Livingston filed a civil lawsuit against Jefferson in 1810. After the case was dismissed on December 5, 1811 by Chief Justice John Marshall due to lack of jurisdiction, Jefferson, nonetheless, in 1812 published a pamphlet originally intended “for the use of counsel” in the case against Livingston, to which Livingston published a reply.|$|E

5000|$|After a {{long and}} active life, Julien Poydras died on his home {{plantation}} near Point Coupee, Louisiana. He was originally interred in Old St. Francis Cemetery. In 1891, his remains were reinterred {{on the grounds of}} the Poydras School in New Roads, when the old cemetery caved into the Mississippi River. OBITUARY of Julien Poydras 1824 , on the 25th of June, at Point Coupee, Louisiana; JULIEN POYDRAS, esq. Mr. P. was a man of very large fortune, and magnificent disposition. He was the first Delegate in Congress, from the territory of Orleans. The act, which no doubt will do most honour to his memory, is the foundation of the Female Orphan Asylum, to which he devoted £100,000. Long after many celebrated names shall have been sunk in oblivion, the name of Julien Poydras will be remembered by the innocent creatures who, by his wise providence and humanity, shall have been sheltered against the misfortune and danger which result from misery, for a weak defenseless sex. By his will he left for a college at Pointe Coupee, 20,000 dollars. For marriage portions to poor girls of said parish, 30,000 dollars. To each of his god-sons and goddaughters, 5,000 dollars. For marriage portions to poor girls of the parish of West Baton Rouge, 30,000 dollars. To the Charity Hospital of New Orleans, his house on the Levee, between St. Louis and Conti streets, and his house in Bourbon street. To the Poydras Female Asylum, all his houses in Poydras street, and on the <b>Batture.</b> The remainder of his fortune goes to his family with the exception of some legacies to his friends.In Pointe Coupee the legacy has been diverted to educational purposes, but in West Baton Rouge it continues in its original use 1941. Poydras himself was a bachelor. It is said that, when he came to Louisiana, he owned little more than the pack on his back and, as the girl he loved was too poor to furnish a dowry, it was impossible for them to marry.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{evaluates the}} {{geophysical}} {{influence of the}} combined effects of historic sea level rise (SLR) and morphology on tidal hydrodynamics in the Grand Bay estuary, located in the Mississippi Sound. Since 1848, {{the landscape of the}} Mississippi Sound has been significantly altered as a result of natural and anthropogenic factors including the migration of the offshore Mississippi–Alabama (MSAL) barrier islands and the construction of navigational channels. As a result, the Grand Bay estuary has undergone extensive erosion resulting in the submergence of its protective barrier island, Grand <b>Batture.</b> A large-domain hydrodynamic model was used to simulate present (circa 2005) and past conditions (circa 1848, 1917, and 1960) with unique sea levels, bathymetry, topography and shorelines representative of each time period. Additionally, a hypothetical scenario was performed in which Grand <b>Batture</b> Island exists under 2005 conditions in order to observe the influence of the island on tidal hydrodynamics within the Grand Bay estuary. Changes in tidal amplitudes from the historic conditions varied. Within the Sound, tidal amplitudes were unaltered due to the open exposed shoreline; however, in semi-enclosed embayments outside of the Sound, tidal amplitudes increased. In addition, harmonic constituent phases were slower historically. The position of the MSAL barrier island inlets influenced tidal currents within the Sound; the westward migration of Petit Bois Island allowed stronger tidal velocities to be centered on the Grand <b>Batture</b> Island. Maximum tidal velocities within the Grand Bay estuary were 5 cm/s faster historically, and reversed from being flood dominant in 1848 to ebb dominant in 2005. If the Grand <b>Batture</b> Island was reconstructed under 2005 conditions, tidal amplitudes and phases would not be altered, indicating that the offshore MSAL barrier islands and SLR have a greater influence on these tidal parameters within the estuary. However, maximum tidal velocities would increase by as much as 5 cm/s (63 %) and currents would become more ebb dominant. Results of this study illustrate the hydrodynamic response of the system to SLR and the changing landscape, and provide insight into potential future changes under SLR and barrier island evolution...|$|E

40|$|We {{surveyed}} 62 hunting {{clubs in}} the <b>batture</b> of the Mississippi River in Arkansas and Mississippi {{to determine the extent}} and severity of black bear (Ursus americanus) damage. Bear damage was more prevalent in Arkansas (70. 6 %) than in Mississippi (11. 8 %). Damage to deer- stands was most common (43. 8 %), followed by damage to buildings (22. 9 %), getting in garbage (12. 5 %) and damage to wildlife food plots (10. 4 %). Cost estimates of bear damage averaged approximately $ 40 per incident over the past 5 years. Most (90. 9 %) clubs rated bear damage as either a slight nuisance or not important at this time, and half have taken no preventive measures to reduce such damage. However, only 18. 5 % of clubs experiencing frequent damage favored increasing local bear populations, whereas 66. 7 % of clubs with little or no damage were in favor of increasing local populations. Future management strategies for black bears in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley should include effective public relations and education programs to help minimize potentially negative public opinion of bears in the region...|$|E
