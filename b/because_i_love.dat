500|$|The lyrics address {{aspects of}} a bad relationship, but also {{reference}} fashion in the line, [...] "Walk, walk fashion baby, Work it move that bitch crazy." [...] In an interview, Gaga pointed {{out that in the}} verse, [...] "I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick, Want you in my Rear Window, Baby, you're sick", she was listing Alfred Hitchcock films; she said, [...] "What I'm really trying to say is I want the deepest, darkest, sickest parts of you that you are afraid to share with anyone <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> you that much." ...|$|E

I'm studying things that I love so it's not like it's a chore", he told The Washington Post, according to a New York Magazine article. Franco has also credited his education for helping him [...] "take acting seriously" [...] when his parents did not see it as a successful post-college career.|$|E
500|$|Miller was {{survived by}} his wife, son, daughter, and grandson. Miller married on August 14, 1982. He was quiet and gentle, and was [...] "a modest man, with a self-deprecating sense of humour". Miller {{described}} his own attitude towards music in a 2005 interview: I worked hard to maintain a certain mental and emotional equilibrium. It's mostly due to my faith in the Creator. I don't put all my eggs in that basket of being a rich and famous jazz guy. That allows me {{a certain amount of}} freedom, because I don't have to play music for money. I play music <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> it.|$|E

500|$|... "Telephone" [...] was {{originally}} written by Gaga for singer Britney Spears's sixth studio album, Circus, but Spears rejected it. Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. Gaga said, [...] "I wrote {{it for her}} [...] {{a long time ago}} and she just didn't use it for her album. It's fine <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> the song and I get to perform it now." [...] Spears' demo for the song leaked in May 2010. Additionally, the guest vocalist {{was originally}} going to be Spears, but ultimately Gaga made Beyoncé the featured vocalist instead. The main inspiration behind the song was Gaga's fear of suffocation as she felt that she seldom found time to just let loose and have fun.|$|E
500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Belldandy {{was sent}} to grant Keiichi a wish and nothing more, Belldandy expresses many times that she has enjoyed her time with Keiichi and that her purpose is to make him happy. The {{contract}} really is an excuse for her to stay since her rival Marller, a first class demon, has stated that [...] "she can cancel a contract with a human anytime". Belldandy had then stated {{that she did not}} want to, because Keiichi was a special person in her heart. This was reinforced at the conclusion of chapter 39: with the [...] "System" [...] down, Belldandy's contract with Keiichi is effectively suspended, yet she chooses to stay because, as Fujishima has her explain in the manga, [...] "... I'm here now <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> you".|$|E

500|$|After the child's birth, Shelley {{wrote to}} Byron [...] "of the {{exquisite}} symmetry" [...] {{and beauty of}} [...] "a little being whom we ... call Alba, or the Dawn." [...] He asked Byron what his plans were for the child. Later, Shelley acknowledged the child's presence was becoming something of an embarrassment. Byron asked his half-sister Augusta Leigh to take Allegra into her household, but Leigh refused. Hostile to Clairmont and initially sceptical that he had fathered her daughter, Byron agreed to take custody of Allegra {{under the condition that}} her mother have only limited contact with her. Shelley warned Clairmont that this might not, after all, be the best plan for Allegra, but Clairmont hoped that her daughter would be more financially comfortable and would have a better chance at a good life if she lived with her father. [...] "I have sent you my child <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> her too well to keep her," [...] she wrote to Byron.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E
500|$|According to series creator Pendleton Ward, the show's {{style was}} {{influenced}} by his time attending the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and his experiences working {{as a writer and}} storyboard artist on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. In an interview with Animation World Network, Ward said he strives to combine the series' subversive humor with [...] "beautiful" [...] moments, using Hayao Miyazaki's film My Neighbor Totoro as inspiration. Ward has also named Home Movies and Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist as influences, largely because both shows are [...] "relaxing" [...] and feature [...] "conversational dialogue that feels natural [...] not over the top [...] cartoony and shrill". Ward described the show as a [...] "dark comedy"; he said [...] "dark comedies are my favorite, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> that feeling – being happy and scared at the same time. It's my favorite way to feel – when I'm {{on the edge of my}} seat but I'm happy, that sense of conflicting emotions. And there's a lot of that in the show, I think." [...] Executive producer Fred Seibert compared the show's animation style to that of Felix the Cat and various Max Fleischer cartoons, but said that its world is also equally inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and video games. Ward intends the show's world to have a certain physical logic instead of [...] "cartoony slapstick"; even though magic exists in the story, the show's writers try to create an internal consistency in how the characters interact with the world.|$|E

500|$|Robert Matthew Van Winkle {{was born}} in Dallas, Texas, on October 31, 1967. Van Winkle has never known his {{biological}} father; {{he was given the}} family name of the Dutch man his mother was married to {{at the time of his}} birth. When Van Winkle was four, his mother divorced. Afterward, he grew up moving between Dallas and Miami, where his new stepfather worked at a car dealership. Hip hop affected Van Winkle at an early age, saying [...] "It's a very big passion of mine <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> poetry. I was just heavily influenced by that whole movement and it's molded me into who I am today." [...] Between the ages of 13 and 14, Van Winkle practiced breakdancing, which led to his friends nicknaming him [...] "Vanilla", as he was the only one in the group who was not black. Although he disliked the nickname, it stuck. Shortly afterward, Van Winkle started battle rapping at parties and because of his rhymes, his friends started calling him [...] "MC Vanilla." [...] However, when he became a member of a breakdance troupe, Van Winkle's stage name was [...] "Vanilla Ice" [...] combining his nickname [...] "Vanilla" [...] with one of his breakdance moves; [...] "The Ice". When Ice's stepfather was offered a better job in Carrollton, Texas, he moved back to Texas with his mother. He attended R. L. Turner High School for a short time before dropping out. When Ice was not learning to ride motorbikes, he was dancing as a street performer with his breakdancing group, now called The Vanilla Ice Posse. Ice wrote [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] at the age of 16, basing its lyrics on a weekend he had with friend and disc jockey D-Shay in South Florida. The lyrics describe Ice and Shay on a drug run that ends in a drive-by shooting while praising Ice's rhyming skills.|$|E
500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – even though there are days when I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Amerie {{returned}} to the studio to work on her third album, <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> It, enlisting producers such as The Buchanans, One Up, Mike Caren. The album was her first not to feature writing and production from her long-time collaborator, friend, and producer Rich Harrison. She cited music of the 1980s as {{a major influence on}} the album, saying [...] "I love 80's music period! That's why I did <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> It, since it had mostly R, soul, and 80's new wave. When I said I wanted to do that in 2006, people were like, 'what?!' [...] but I love it." [...] "Take Control", which was co-produced by Mike Caren, Amerie and Nicholson and co-written by Amerie along with Cee-Lo Green, became a top 10 hit in the UK in mid 2007. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> It was released on May 14, 2007, in Europe, Asia and Australasia, reaching the top 20 in the UK, where the album's second single, [...] "Gotta Work", reached number 21.
