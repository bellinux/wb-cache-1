50|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>saltator</b> (Saltator atricollis) is {{a species}} of songbird. Traditionally placed in the Cardinalidae family, it {{probably}} belongs in the Thraupidae instead.|$|E
50|$|The genus Saltator is {{apparently}} polyphyletic. Whether the present species {{will remain in}} Saltator or eventually be moved to another genus remains to be seen. Somewhat similar in coloration to the buff-throated saltator, the genus' type species (which would retain the genus name), it resembles the probably well distant <b>black-throated</b> <b>saltator</b> or even the golden-billed saltator in other aspects.|$|E
40|$|The {{pressures}} for land use change {{have led to}} an increasing isolation of habitat remnants throughout the world. The goal {{of this study was}} to estimate the population size and density of some endemic and threatened species in a nature reserve in the Cerrado biome. One hundred and thirty four point transects were undertaken at the Estacao Ecologica de Itirapina (EEI), one of the last natural grassland savannah remnants in Sao Paulo state, in the south-east of Brazil between September and December 2006 and densities estimated for seven species (four endemic to the Cerrado, one near-endemic and two grassland specialists). Neither species reached the minimum viable population size of 500 - 5000 individuals. Four species, White-banded Tanager, White-rumped Tanager, <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Saltator</b> and Sharp-tailed Tyrant have populations ranging from 112 to 248 individuals, while the other species have a low population (< 60 individuals). The mean densities of Sharp-tailed Tyrant and Cock-tailed Tyrant in the EEI grassland showed similar values to those observed in larger areas of the Cerrado, which may indicate that the EEL grassland area is well conserved. In spite of the restricted size of the EEI, small areas can maintain some endemic and threatened bird populations, thus contributing to local biodiversity and the ecological processes in the region. The capacity of fragments of Cerrado (similar to 2, 000 ha) to maintain populations of endemic and threatened bird species is unlikely to be effective in the long term.
