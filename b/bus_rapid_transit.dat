5|$|Community Transit's Strategic Planning Group {{published}} a recommendation in 2004, calling for <b>bus</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> {{service on the}} State Route 99 corridor between Everett Station and Aurora Village Transit Center, featuring off-board fare collection, limited stops, and transit signal priority. The route alternatives proposed included express service from Aurora Village to Downtown Seattle via Aurora Avenue North or Interstate 5, as well as express service on Interstate 5 in Everett, if a partnership to share costs with Everett Transit for the Evergreen Way segment was not viable. In December 2005, the CT Board of Directors approved an accelerated planning schedule for a <b>bus</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> project, to cost an estimated $15–20 million, and to begin service as the first such system in the Puget Sound region in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay {{corridor}} was one {{of twelve}} Queens bus corridors studied under the city's <b>bus</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> (BRT) study, which was meant to determine the feasibility of having dedicated lanes and rebuilt stops to speed up service on BRT corridors. Beginning on January 4, 2008, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted an 18-month study on Woodhaven Boulevard {{as part of the}} city's Congested Corridors Project to improve congested and dangerous roadways. One of the short-term recommendations {{of the study was to}} implement <b>bus</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> along the corridor. In June 2010, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay corridor was added to the list of potential corridors for Phase II of Select Bus Service (SBS), the MTA's brand of BRT service.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the <b>Bus</b> <b>Rapid</b> <b>Transit</b> Scheme between Sheffield and Rotherham was {{approved}} by the Yorkshire and Humber Assembly's Regional Transport Board.

50|$|Bicycle can now {{be allowed}} to carry inside the <b>bus</b> and <b>rapid</b> <b>transit.</b> However, there are some {{restrictions}} applies regarding carrying the bike to <b>rapid</b> <b>transit.</b> Only foldable bikes are allowed to carry to the <b>bus</b> and <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> due {{to the size of}} bicycle that are easy to carry than other types of regular bikes and bikes are also prohibited to carry during peak hour. The maximum people in a cycling group to carry and ride inside the public transportation vary by types of lines and transportation methods. In Ampang Line, maximum five cyclists are allowed to on board, while on Kelana Jaya Line maximum two cyclists are allowed to on-board and only one cyclist is allowed to on board in bus.|$|R

5|$|Community Transit's {{planning}} for limited-stop bus service, which later evolved into <b>bus</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit,</b> {{began in the}} 1990s, with proposals to build bus lanes on State Route 99 between 145th Street NE in Shoreline and Casino Road (near State Route 526) in Everett. Sound Transit was established in 1996 as a regional transit authority, and selected the State Route 99 corridor as a route for its express bus system, but later replaced it, before service began, with an express route on Interstate 5 from Everett to Northgate, while leaving SR 99 to Community Transit. Sound Transit funded the construction of business access and transit lanes on State Route 99 through Lynnwood from 244th Street to 148th Street in 2002, converting former parking lanes, and widening the highway in some areas, improving existing bus service, and laying the ground for a future <b>bus</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> line.|$|E

5|$|Fares for Metro {{light rail}} service {{are the same}} as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other light rail and bus routes within 2.5 hours from the time a fare is paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro light rail services: fares within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive than regular fares but may not be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The Target Field station provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line <b>bus</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> service. The A Line <b>bus</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> line connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro light rail stations – 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling – have designated park and ride lots.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Raytheon Engineers and Constructors {{proposed}} {{to build and}} operate a Dulles Corridor <b>Bus</b> <b>Rapid</b> <b>Transit</b> (BRT) system. In January 1999, the Tysons-Dulles Corridor Group (which included Bechtel Corporation and West*Group) offered a competing BRT proposal that would ultimately extend the rail line to Ashburn. These proposals prompted the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to evaluate the merits of BRT and heavy rail public transit in the corridor.|$|E

40|$|Yogyakarta and Surakarta have a {{different}} spatial structure that affect the operation of <b>rapid</b> <b>bus</b> <b>transit</b> services – the Trans Jogja and the Batik Solo Trans in those two cities. This study investigates how differences in the spatial structure of the two cities shape the operational pattern of the two <b>rapid</b> <b>bus</b> <b>transit</b> services and explores {{the prospect of an}} alternative development. Descriptive quantitative and qualitative methods were used in examining the influence of the Yogyakarta concentric structure on the operation and performance of the Trans Jogja routes and that of the Surakarta grid on the operational spread of the Batik Solo Trans. It was found that the performance of Trans Jogja and Batik Solo Trans did reflect differences and disparities in terms of travel time, distance shelters, coverage area, number of passengers and operational time, with the net result that the Trans Jogja enjoyed high affordability in contrast to Batik Solo’s low affordability. It may thus be concluded that there are legitimate re-evaluation needs for enhancing both performance and coverage of the two <b>rapid</b> <b>bus</b> <b>transit</b> services...|$|R
