5|$|<b>Binaural</b> sold 226,000copies {{during its}} first week of release and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 album chart. It was held off the top spot by the Britney Spears album, Oops!... I Did It Again. <b>Binaural</b> became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach Platinum status. <b>Binaural</b> has been {{certified}} gold by the RIAA, and, as of 2013, has sold 850,000copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album topped the charts in New Zealand, where it was certified gold, and Australia, where it went Platinum and ended as the 36th best-selling record of the year.|$|E

5|$|<b>Binaural</b> is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on May 16, 2000 through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour {{in support of}} its previous album, Yield (1998), Pearl Jam took a short break before reconvening {{toward the end of}} 1999 to begin work on a new album. During the production of the album, the band encountered hindrances such as singer Eddie Vedder's writer's block, and guitarist Mike McCready's entrance into rehabilitation due to an addiction to prescription drugs.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{initially}} {{turned his}} efforts to his side-project Wellwater Conspiracy, to which both Shepherd and Thayil have contributed. He then worked briefly with The Smashing Pumpkins on the band's 1998 album, Adore. In 1998, he played drums for Pearl Jam's Yield Tour following Jack Irons's health problems, and later joined Pearl Jam as an official member. He has recorded five albums as the band's drummer: <b>Binaural</b> (2000), Riot Act (2002), Pearl Jam (2006), Backspacer (2009) and Lightning Bolt (2013). Cameron also played percussion on Geddy Lee's album My Favourite Headache. In 2017, he {{was inducted into the}} Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pearl Jam.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam {{entered the}} UK charts at number five, the band's highest {{position}} there since 2000's <b>Binaural,</b> while it reached number {{two in the}} U.S., selling 279,564copies in its first week. It was held off the top spot by the Tool album, 10,000 Days. As of July 2009, the album has sold 706,000copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. Pearl Jam is considered a comeback hit, outselling 2002's Riot Act - by 2009, 706,000 copies as opposed to Riot Acts 508,000- and ranking 90th in Billboards list of the 200 best-selling albums of 2006. It has been certified gold by the RIAA.|$|E
5|$|Reckoning is {{the second}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band R.E.M., released on April 9, 1984 by I.R.S. Records. Produced by Mitch Easter and Don Dixon, the album was recorded at Reflection Sound Studio in Charlotte, North Carolina, over 16 days in December 1983 and January 1984. Dixon and Easter intended to capture the sound of R.E.M.'s live performances, and used <b>binaural</b> recording on several tracks. Singer Michael Stipe dealt with darker subject matter in his lyrics, and water imagery is a recurring theme on the record. Released to critical acclaim, Reckoning reached number 27 in the United States—where it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1991—and peaked at number 91 in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Riot Act is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on November 12, 2002 through Epic Records. Following a full-scale tour {{in support of}} its previous album, <b>Binaural</b> (2000), Pearl Jam took a year-long break. The band then reconvened {{in the beginning of}} 2002 and commenced work on a new album. The music on the record featured a diverse sound, including songs influenced by folk, art rock, and experimental rock. The lyrics deal with mortality and existentialism, with much influence from both the political climate after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the accidental death of nine fans during Pearl Jam's performance at the 2000 Roskilde Festival.|$|E
25|$|Jeffress' first {{project at}} DRL was to {{determine}} whether the improvement humans show when detecting <b>binaural</b> rather than monaural signals could be adapted to Navy sonars. Jeffress designed and built an experimental <b>binaural</b> sonar that he and his students tested at Austin's Lake Travis. While this project was unsuccessful, it initiated a program at DRL on masking and <b>binaural</b> hearing that endured, and was highly productive, for more than 20 years.|$|E
25|$|Previously unreleased. <b>Binaural</b> outtake.|$|E
25|$|Monaural PPI {{is higher}} than <b>binaural.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Binaural</b> {{recordings}} use {{a different}} microphone technique to encode direction directly as phase, with very little amplitude difference below 2kHz, often using a dummy head, and can produce a surprisingly lifelike spatial impression through headphones. Commercial recordings almost always use stereo recording, rather than <b>binaural,</b> because loudspeaker listening has been more popular than headphone listening.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, Irish {{physician}} Arthur Leared {{invented a}} <b>binaural</b> stethoscope and, in 1852, George Philip Cammann perfected {{the design of}} the stethoscope instrument (that used both ears) for commercial production, which has become the standard ever since. Cammann also wrote a major treatise on diagnosis by auscultation, which the refined <b>binaural</b> stethoscope made possible. By 1873, there were descriptions of a differential stethoscope that could connect to slightly different locations to create a slight stereo effect, though this did not become a standard tool in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|A {{compressor}} is used {{in hearing}} aids to bring the audio volume into the listener's hearing range. To enable the patient to perceive the direction from which the sound is coming, <b>binaural</b> compression may be required.|$|E
25|$|A <b>binaural</b> beat is an {{auditory}} illusion perceived {{when two}} different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500Hz, {{with less than}} a 40Hz difference between them, are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear).|$|E
25|$|In September 2015, Yamaguchi {{collaborated with}} {{electronic}} musician Aoki Takamasa and fashion brand Anrealage {{to create a}} catwalk soundtrack for the brand's appearance at the Paris Fashion Week. The composition, Reflects, was released digitally on January 20, 2016, and features {{two versions of the}} set: an eighteen-minute live <b>binaural</b> recording of the composition as it was used at the event, and Reflects Live Rec 2015, a thirteen-minute real-time live studio recording of Yamaguchi and Aoki creating Reflects.|$|E
25|$|For example, if a 530Hz {{pure tone}} is {{presented}} to a subject's right ear, while a 520Hz pure tone {{is presented to}} the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the auditory illusion of a third tone, {{in addition to the}} two pure-tones presented to each ear. The third sound is called a <b>binaural</b> beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10Hz, that being the difference between the 530Hz and 520Hz pure tones presented to each ear.|$|E
500|$|Dixon was {{enamored of}} the {{technique}} of <b>binaural</b> recording, and used it extensively on the album. Easter recalled that Dixon [...] "made this sort of fake <b>binaural</b> head out of a cardboard box and stuck two microphones in it" [...] to record the group. In Easter's opinion the method made drummer Bill Berry's parts [...] "fresher sounding". <b>Binaural</b> recording also allowed bassist Mike Mills' backing vocals to be loud without covering up Stipe's lead vocals. Dixon explained, [...] "Mike Mills was often singing 12 to 15 {{feet away from the}} microphones that were recording his part, but because it was in a studio <b>binaural</b> field, we would tend to hear him as behind [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the <b>binaural</b> recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks. <b>Binaural</b> literally means [...] "having or relating to two ears." [...] Regarding the choice of the title, Gossard said, [...] "When we looked up the word 'binaural,' it meant to listen with both ears. So it seemed like a fitting title for the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Following its {{full-scale}} tour {{in support}} of Yield, the band took a short break, but then reconvened {{toward the end of}} 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, <b>Binaural.</b> It was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the <b>binaural</b> recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of the technique. <b>Binaural</b> was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members [...] "were ready for a change." [...] Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except Creed fans, Pearl Jam delve elsewhere." [...] He added, [...] "The album reflects both Pearl Jam's longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd." [...] The album is lyrically darker than the band's previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as [...] "pretty sombre." [...] <b>Binaural</b> included the singles [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] (...) , one of the songs featuring <b>binaural</b> recording, and [...] "Light Years". The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{the band}} hired {{producer}} Tchad Blake, {{known for his}} use of <b>binaural</b> recording. <b>Binaural</b> recording techniques, which employ two microphones to create a 3-D stereophonic sound, [...] were utilized on several tracks, such as the acoustic [...] "Of the Girl." [...] Regarding Blake, Gossard said, [...] "He was just there for us the whole time, wanting us to create different moods." [...] This was the first Pearl Jam studio album following the departure of drummer Jack Irons, and features drummer Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, who had previously drummed on Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{music on}} the record {{featured}} an experimental sound, evident on songs that used <b>binaural</b> recording techniques. The atmospheric tracks, mostly featuring somber lyrics dealing with social criticism, led the band to convey these themes with images of nebulas in the album artwork. [...] <b>Binaural</b> received positive reviews, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. Although the record was certified gold by the RIAA, it became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach Platinum status in the United States. The album's 2000 tour spawned a large collection of official bootleg releases.|$|E
500|$|<b>Binaural</b> {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics according to Metacritic, where it holds a 69 after 16 reviews. NME gave <b>Binaural</b> a {{nine out of}} 10. In the review, <b>Binaural</b> is called [...] "a seething, furious album; a declamatory statement against cynicism and passivity and the simple injustices of everyday life" [...] and that [...] "even when the band slow the pace, the songs are coloured by a heartfelt intensity." [...] AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, saying, [...] "The songs are sharper, the production is layered, and the performances are as compassionate as ever, resulting in their finest album since Vitalogy." [...] Time reviewer Christopher John Farley noted that the album is [...] "less impatient and rage filled than much of Pearl Jam's earlier work." [...] Farley added that [...] "Pearl Jam, rather quietly, is building a long-term career to rival the rock legends of the past." [...] Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+, considering that the [...] "weighty subjects [...] Pearl Jam's introspective lyrics and stone-faced rock a refreshing edge" [...] and adding that [...] "if PJ long ago lost the zeitgeist, at least they've kept a hold on their hearts." [...] Critic Robert Christgau described the album as [...] "Rock as inner struggle, eternally externalized." ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{series was}} {{promoted}} using an online <b>binaural</b> advert. It {{is also being}} used to launch a pilot scheme of a [...] "Series catch-up" [...] on the BBC iPlayer, in which the episodes {{will be on the}} iPlayer for longer than seven days so that people can catch up with the entire series.|$|E
500|$|When {{the track}} listing for <b>Binaural</b> was first {{released}} in late March 2000, {{it was quite}} different from the final version. Some tracks that were originally on the album were dropped and not released until the 2003 rarities compilation, Lost Dogs, and [...] "Gods' Dice" [...] was added to the final version. The original version is as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Two singles were {{released}} from <b>Binaural.</b> The lead single [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] was issued on April 11, entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 49, and reached number {{three on the}} Mainstream Rock charts. The album's other commercially released single, [...] "Light Years", did not chart on the Hot 100, but it did place on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts.|$|E
500|$|Three instrumentals {{featured}} on the Touring Band 2000 DVD ("Thunderclap", [...] "Foldback", and [...] "Harmony") come from the early <b>Binaural</b> sessions. Several songs were rejected from the album that eventually found their way on to the 2003 Lost Dogs collection of rarities. These include [...] "Sad", [...] "Hitchhiker", [...] "In the Moonlight", [...] "Education", [...] "Fatal", and [...] "Sweet Lew". [...] "Sad", originally called [...] "Letter to the Dead", was called [...] "a great pop song" [...] by Ament, {{but he said the}} song did not fit the album because the band does not [...] "really [...] very many pop records." [...] "Sweet Lew", about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, was cut from <b>Binaural</b> because it did not fit the album according to Ament. [...] "Fatal" [...] was producer Tchad Blake's favorite song {{to come out of the}} recording sessions. [...] "Strangest Tribe" [...] and [...] "Drifting" [...] were also recorded around the time of the album's recording sessions, and both songs were released on the band's 1999 fan club Christmas single as well as Lost Dogs.|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{the process}} for Yield, the band members worked on {{material}} individually before starting the recording sessions together. Lead vocalist Eddie Vedder called {{the making of the}} album [...] "a construction job." [...] <b>Binaural</b> was the first album since the band's debut that was not produced by Brendan O'Brien. Gossard stated that the band [...] "felt like it was time to try something new," [...] and that they [...] "were ready for a change." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's second studio album, Vs., {{released}} in 1993, {{was nominated for}} a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. From Vs., the song [...] "Daughter" [...] received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and the song [...] "Go" [...] received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. In 1994, the band released its third studio album, Vitalogy. The album received Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album in 1996. Vitalogy was ranked number 492 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The lead single [...] "Spin the Black Circle" [...] won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Pearl Jam has subsequently released No Code in 1996, Yield in 1998, <b>Binaural</b> in 2000, Riot Act in 2002, the eponymous Pearl Jam in 2006, Backspacer in 2009, and Lightning Bolt in 2013. The songs [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] (from Yield) and [...] "Grievance" [...] (from <b>Binaural)</b> both received Grammy nominations for Best Hard Rock Performance. Pearl Jam's contribution to the 2003 film Big Fish, [...] "Man of the Hour", {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe Award in 2004. The band was placed at number 21 on VH1's list of the 100 greatest artists of hard rock.|$|E
500|$|Spin {{gave the}} album {{seven out of}} 10 stars, writing that [...] "Everything you want is still there—goofy experimentalism, guitar frenzy, Eddie's self-abusive wail. It's just more solid, more clear." [...] Q gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "Grunge may have died, but Pearl Jam it seems will never be slayed." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer Jon Pareles gave the album three out of five stars, feeling that the album [...] "comes across {{as part of an}} {{extended}} conversation among the five band members...and fans loyal enough to check in for Pearl Jam's latest musings on love, death and social responsibility." [...] The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars, stating that Pearl Jam [...] "are dignified, musicianly, sincere... and a teensy bit dull" [...] and observing that [...] "Vedder's affecting vocal angst drowns in a sea of pessimistic riffola." [...] The review called <b>Binaural</b> [...] "a warts-and-all album; it has grabbers, songs that sink in slowly and a few absolute duds." [...] At the 2001 Grammy Awards, [...] "Grievance" [...] received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. Regarding <b>Binaural,</b> Ament stated that [...] "we look back and think we didn't put some of the best songs on it", adding that [...] "I think there are some beautiful things that came out of it, but we're never going to remember that record as one of the greats." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Binaural</b> {{opens with}} three up-tempo songs before growing more diverse. [...] Vedder explained, [...] "We'd rather {{challenge}} our fans {{and make them}} listen to our songs than give them something that's easy to digest. There {{is a lot of}} music out there that is very easy to digest but we never {{wanted to be part of}} it." [...] As described by critic Jon Pareles on his review for Rolling Stone, Pearl Jam distances itself from the grunge that made them famous and [...] "delve elsewhere: jumpy post-punk and somber meditations, tightly wound folk rock and turbulent, neopsychedelic rockers that sound like they boiled out of jam sessions." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Binaural</b> was {{recorded}} in late 1999 and early 2000 in Seattle, Washington at Studio Litho, {{which is owned by}} guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was initially mixed at Sunset Sound Factory in Los Angeles, California with Blake; however, the band proved to be dissatisfied with how the mixes turned out. According to McCready, Blake's work complemented the slower tracks such as [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] well, but faced trouble with others, which the band wanted to sound heavier. For the heavier songs, the group brought in former producer O'Brien, who remixed the tracks at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. It was with O'Brien that the band determined the final sequencing of the album.|$|E
500|$|Riot Act reached {{number five}} in the U.S. on the Billboard 200 album chart, with 166,000copies sold in its first week of release. The album would end up selling only 508,000copies in the United States {{according}} to Nielsen SoundScan, short of the 718,000 sold by predecessor <b>Binaural.</b> Riot Act has been certified gold by the RIAA. The international response to Riot Act [...] was more positive. The album topped the charts in Australia, where it went platinum and ended among the best-selling records {{of the year in}} both 2002 and 2003. Riot Act also went to number two in both Italy, and New Zealand, three in Norway, and number four in Canada.|$|E
500|$|A {{month after}} the European tour concluded, the band {{embarked}} on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that [...] "playing, facing crowds, being together—it enabled us to start processing it." [...] On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder {{took the opportunity to}} thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that [...] "I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something." [...] After concluding the <b>Binaural</b> Tour, the band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{decided to}} record every show on its 2000 <b>Binaural</b> Tour professionally, after noting {{the desire of}} fans to own {{a copy of the}} shows they {{attended}} and the popularity of bootleg recordings. The band had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings, and these [...] "official bootlegs" [...] were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product for fans. Pearl Jam originally intended to release them to only fan club members, but the band's record contract prevented it from doing so. Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and twice set a record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with {{subsequent}} releases. As {{he had more}} influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less catchy. He said, [...] "I felt that with more popularity, {{we were going to}} be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes." [...] By 1994’s Vitalogy, the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music. The band’s 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism. After Yield in 1998, which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work, they dabbled with experimental art rock on the <b>Binaural</b> album of 2000, and with folk rock elements on the 2002 Riot Act album. The band’s 2006 album, Pearl Jam, was cited as a return to their early sound. Their 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of pop and new wave.|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{commenced}} {{work on a}} {{new album}} following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of <b>Binaural.</b> McCready described the recording environment as [...] "a pretty positive one" [...] and [...] "very intense and spiritual." [...] Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's {{been a lot of}} mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." [...] Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles [...] "I Am Mine" [...] and [...] "Save You". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as [...] "Love Boat Captain". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said [...] "Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours." [...] The track entitled [...] "Arc" [...] was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.|$|E
