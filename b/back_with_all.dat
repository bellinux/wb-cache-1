500|$|Dead animals {{may appear}} to have been tipped over. But this is {{actually}} the process of rigor mortis, which stiffens the muscles of the carcass, beginning six to eight hours after death and lasting for one to two days. [...] It is particularly noticeable in the limbs, which stick out straight. [...] Post-mortem bloat also occurs because of gas formation inside the body. The process may result in cattle carcasses that wind up on their <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> four feet in the air.|$|E
2500|$|On the album’s evolution, Rygg commented, [...] "I {{was pretty}} set on keeping it more bare this time. When we did Blood Inside, we'd been holding <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> that minimal stuff {{for so long}} — the soundtracks (Lyckantropen Themes and Svidd neger), the Silence EPs and all that. So Blood Inside was an {{outburst}} of sorts. I guess this record is a withdrawal again, so that's an inherent dynamic...flux and reflux." ...|$|E
60|$|Sally's bright face {{expressed}} {{only the}} vague curiosity {{of a child}} to see something new; but the little Mara resisted and hung <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> her force, so that Mrs. Kittridge was obliged to take her up and hold her.|$|E
60|$|Acac. Bright Venus brings Albanius <b>back</b> again, <b>With</b> <b>all</b> the Loves and Graces in her train.|$|R
50|$|For example, /k'/ becomes prevelar before /i/ and /e/ {{but it is}} velar before /ʔa/ and it {{is backed}} before /u/ and /o/.In a similar way, the glottalized velar /q'/ is {{pronounced}} with more friction {{at the point of}} articulation as /q'ˣ/. It is in a frontal position before /i/ and /e/ and becomes <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the other vowels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Roddy, you are grand indeed!" [...] he cried. [...] "But I had {{rather see}} {{you with the}} King's blue coat upon your <b>back</b> than <b>with</b> <b>all</b> these frills and ruffles." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{gave the}} signal, and Andy and Pepper pulled <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> their might, and Jack did the same. Slowly but surely Reff Ritter came {{up out of}} the icy water, his teeth {{chattering}} loudly. Soon he was out of danger.|$|E
60|$|But {{the attack}} {{did not come}} off. Not over a score of redmen ran out into the open, and when three of these were {{stretched}} lifeless by the rangers, or the Royal Americans, as they were officially designated, the remainder ran <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> possible speed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he {{certainly}} did act queer," [...] agreed Hiram Duff. [...] "But that ain't here nor there. I want my box <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> that's in it, and I'm going to have it. I guess I had better go to town and tell the police about this." ...|$|E
60|$|It came <b>back</b> to her <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the inexorable {{force of}} an appalling certainty.|$|R
60|$|Her father turned Mumbles {{over with}} his toe. The puppy lay upon its <b>back,</b> lazily, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> four paws in the air, and cast a comical glance from one beady bright eye {{at the man}} who had {{disturbed}} him.|$|R
50|$|During Mayo's 2011 NFL campaign, Higgins {{received}} {{praise for}} his outstanding performances in right half <b>back</b> <b>with</b> people <b>all</b> {{across the nation}} noting his great pace, strength, reading {{of the game and}} said {{there is a lot more}} to come from this young prodigy.|$|R
6000|$|... "My name is Gertrude Margaret May," [...] {{said the}} little round mouth. The fat arm was drawn <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> a baby's dignity, and the rosy face was hidden in Dr. May's breast, {{at the sound}} of George Rivers's broad laugh and [...] "Well done, little one!" ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the signal}} post {{established}} above Bala-Hissar, an order was flashed to General Baker--who was many miles away--to inform him {{of what had}} occurred, and to order him to march <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> speed. Late that evening he arrived, with his column; and the British force was again united.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the dogs}} treed a {{squirrel}}, and Jim offered to climb the tree and shake the squirrel off; but Hen Billard said his watermelon tooth was beginning to trouble him, {{and he had no}} time for squirrels. That made all the big boys laugh, and they pulled Jim Leonard along, although he held <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his might and told them to quit it. He began to cry.|$|E
60|$|Bangs {{are coming}} in. Em Frewen has them. She went to Summerside {{for a visit}} and came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> them. <b>All</b> the girls in school are going to bang their hair as soon as their mothers will let them. But I {{do not intend to}} bang mine.|$|R
5000|$|A promotional single of {{the song}} was to be {{released}} as a double A-side with [...] "I'm Coming Out", but it never came to surface as the commercial release came for [...] "I'm Coming Out". Instead, [...] "Talkin' to Me" [...] was <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> the <b>All</b> I Have track [...] "I Just Died".|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma," [...] said Emmeline, walking {{first into}} the drawing-room, [...] "Lady Clara has come <b>back</b> <b>with</b> us after <b>all,</b> {{and is going to}} stay here to-night; we are so glad." ...|$|R
60|$|The war-vessels {{prepared}} the way by opening {{fire on the}} earthworks which lined the shore, a blockhouse, and a cable station which was occupied by Spanish soldiers. The defence was feeble; the enemy retreated in hot haste after firing a few shots. A small gunboat came down from Guantanamo, four miles away, {{at the beginning of}} the bombardment, but she put <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> speed after having approached within range.|$|E
6000|$|I {{resolved}} upon hastening <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> {{speed to}} El-Muwaylah, finishing, by the way, our work of quartz-prospecting on the 'Akabah Gulf. Thus far {{it had been}} a success; we heard of [...] "Marú" [...] in all directions. But all had not gone equally well. We had already on two occasions been prevented by circumstances from visiting the mysterious Hismá, and we now determined to devote all our energies to its exploration.|$|E
6000|$|Then pouncing upon Twemlow, {{who holds}} <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his feeble might, he is haling {{him off to}} present him, as Veneering, to Mrs Podsnap, when the arrival of more guests unravels the mistake. Whereupon, having re-shaken hands with Veneering as Veneering, he re-shakes hands with Twemlow as Twemlow, and winds it all up to his own perfect {{satisfaction}} by saying to the last-named, 'Ridiculous opportunity--but so glad of it, I am sure!' ...|$|E
50|$|After {{the raids}} {{he then went}} on to find Sir Walter Raleigh's {{settlement}} much further North at Roanoke which he replenished and also took <b>back</b> <b>with</b> him <b>all</b> of the original colonists before Sir Richard Greynvile arrived with supplies and more colonists. He finally reached England on 22 July, when he sailed into Portsmouth, England to a hero's welcome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Trifle!" [...] exclaimed Locker. [...] "Would {{you call}} it trifling if I fail, and then to save her from a worse fate, were to <b>back</b> you up <b>with</b> <b>all</b> my heart and soul?" ...|$|R
50|$|On October 22, 2016, a fanmeeting {{was held}} by NRG. At the meeting, Chung Myung-hoon {{announced}} that NRG would be getting <b>back</b> together <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the members except for Sung-hoon, and plan to release the eighth album in 2017. However, it is unknown if they have chosen to resign with Music Factory, or when the album is set to be released.|$|R
6000|$|But ere {{he could}} return to his repose, [...] A Cherub flapped his right wing o'er his eyes-- [...] At which Saint Peter yawned, and rubbed his nose: [...] "Saint porter," [...] said the angel, [...] "prithee rise!" [...] Waving a goodly wing, which glowed, as glows [...] An earthly peacock's tail, with heavenly dyes: [...] To which the saint replied, [...] "Well, what's the matter? [...] "Is Lucifer come <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> this clatter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She could not. All {{was strange}} and mazed and quivering in her, her spirit {{straining}} away, drawn to him, fantastically confused. She could only {{look into his}} face with her troubled, dark eyes. And suddenly she was seized and crushed to him. She shrank away, pushing him <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> her strength. He hung his head, abashed, suffering, with eyes shut, lips trembling; and her heart felt again that quiver of compassion. She murmured: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{before their}} mother could reach them, the {{children}} found trouble of their own. Teenty sprang at Weenty {{and began to}} fight, because his brother had pinched him, and Weenty fought <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his might and main. They scratched with their claws and bit with their teeth, and rolled over and over upon the floor, bumping into the wall and upsetting the chairs, and snarling and growling all the while like two puppies.|$|E
60|$|There was James lying {{across his}} bed, half-dressed, {{turned away from}} the dim morning light, and more frightfully pale than ever. He started angrily at Louis's entrance, and sprang up, but fell <b>back,</b> insisting <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his might that nothing ailed him but a common headache, which needed only to be left quiet for an hour or two. He said it venomously.|$|R
6000|$|... "A ride! I {{know where}} you have been, sir! He goes away morning after morning, to that little Mr. Ridley's--his chums, papa, and he comes <b>back</b> <b>with</b> his hands <b>all</b> over horrid paint. He did this morning; you know you did, Clive." ...|$|R
50|$|The Uffizialen Superioren (Superior Officers) {{represent}} the remote source of supreme authority, which occasionally materializes as colonels, generals or other inspecting officers. In one series, an aging general finds himself stripped off his uniform and, by extension, {{of all his}} authority and might. He is rudely treated as a senile old man, until he manages to get his uniform <b>back,</b> along <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his respect and authority.|$|R
6000|$|... "How fortunate," [...] {{said the}} Girl, {{as she went}} to her room, [...] "that I {{relieved}} my mind to that Young Man out in the park today. If I had come <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> that pent-up feeling seething within me and heard this news right on top of it all, I might have flown into a thousand pieces. What lovely brown eyes he had! I do dote on brown eyes. The Creature will be sure to have fishy blue ones." ...|$|E
60|$|Much as Malcolm {{would have}} liked to have seen the {{punishment}} of Wallenstein's treacherous followers, he could not but feel that the duke's view was, under the circumstances, the correct one. The tents were speedily struck, and the force fell <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> speed towards Bavaria, and after accompanying them for a march or two, Malcolm left them and rode to join his regiment, the duke having already sent off a messenger to Oxenstiern with a full account of the murder of Wallenstein.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{handle of}} the bolt!" [...] cried Burke. [...] "Now I can {{unfasten}} the trap-door." [...] And taking hold {{of the top of}} the bar, he pulled <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> his force. At first he could not move it, but suddenly the resistance ceased, and he pulled the bar forward until it stood at an angle of forty-five degrees from the wall. Further than this Burke could not move it, although he tugged and bore down on it with all his weight.|$|E
60|$|The {{boat was}} but {{half a mile}} behind them when it was joined by an eight-oared galley, which had been seen rowing out from the harbor, whence, doubtless, it had been {{dispatched}} to inquire into the errand of the boat seen rowing off to the ship. After lying alongside the barge {{for a minute or}} two she turned her head, and made <b>back</b> again <b>with</b> <b>all</b> speed.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{his time}} as a {{resident}} of Melbourne, Briggs returned to his hometown of Shepparton in 2010. Briggs has explained, [...] "I like being <b>back</b> home, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> my cousins and my friends who I grew up with - they keep me honest." [...] Briggs then relocated to Melbourne {{for the second time}} in 2014, and provided a further insight into his experience of Shepparton following the move: ...|$|R
60|$|But {{he did not}} die. He was nursed <b>back</b> to life <b>with</b> <b>all</b> {{the skill}} that money could buy, for the Law wanted him; {{and in the end}} he grew {{sufficiently}} healthy to be hanged in due and proper form.|$|R
