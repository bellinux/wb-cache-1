5|$|Early in {{the recall}} process, Republican George Rivera {{announced}} his candidacy for Giron's senate seat. Rivera {{was planning to}} run against Giron in the 2014 elections but stated he would put {{his name on the}} <b>ballot</b> during the recall process. Rivera had to turn in a petition with 1,000 signatures in order to qualify to be on the <b>ballot</b> and turned in 1,500 signatures on July 26. Sonia Negrete Winn, a Democrat, also sought to be on the <b>ballot</b> to replace Giron, but failed to obtain the required signatures to be a candidate. In Morse's district, Republican Bernie Herpin announced his interest in replacing Morse and submitted sufficient signatures to qualify for the <b>ballot.</b>|$|E

On the first <b>ballot,</b> he garnered the most votes (275), leading Clay (264), Clardy (190), and Hardin (186). Over the next nine ballots, the vote counts changed little. Finally, the convention chairman announced that the candidate receiving the fewest votes on the next <b>ballot</b> would be dropped from the voting. Clardy received the fewest votes, and on the next <b>ballot,</b> his supporters divided almost equally between the remaining three candidates. Hardin was the next candidate to be dropped, and Brown received a majority over Clay on the thirteenth <b>ballot.</b>|$|E

The officers select one officer, the NCOs select one individual and the private soldiers or seamen select two individuals. In all 46 awards have been awarded by <b>ballot</b> with 29 of the awards during the Indian Mutiny. Four further awards were granted to Q Battery, Royal Horse Artillery at Korn Spruit on 31 March 1900 during the Second Boer War. The final <b>ballot</b> awards for the army were the six awards to the Lancashire Fusiliers at W Beach during the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 although three of the awards were not gazetted until 1917. The final seven <b>ballot</b> awards were the only naval <b>ballot</b> awards with three awards to two Q-Ships in 1917 and four awards for the Zeebrugge Raid in 1918.

50|$|Logan {{announced}} on December 13 that 561 absentee <b>ballots</b> {{in the county}} had been wrongly rejected due to an administrative error. The next day, workers retrieving voting machines from precinct storage found an additional 12 <b>ballots,</b> bringing the total to 572 newly discovered <b>ballots.</b> Logan admitted the lost <b>ballots</b> were an oversight {{on the part of}} his department, and insisted that the found <b>ballots</b> be counted. On December 15, the King County Canvassing Board voted 2-1 in favor of counting the discovered <b>ballots.</b>|$|R
50|$|Upon {{examination}} of the discovered <b>ballots,</b> it was further discovered that, {{with the exception of}} two <b>ballots,</b> none of the <b>ballots</b> had been cast by voters whose surnames began with the letters A, B, or C.

5|$|Lawsuits {{were filed}} against Barr by GOP members in Pennsylvania {{to prevent the}} {{candidate}} from appearing on the state's <b>ballot</b> on charges that the Libertarian Party tricked individuals into signing the state's <b>ballot</b> access petition. Commonwealth Court Judge Johnny Butler dismissed these allegations on September 16, allowing Barr {{to remain on the}} state's <b>ballot.</b> The Barr campaign filed a lawsuit to prevent John McCain and Barack Obama from appearing on the <b>ballot</b> in Texas, charging that the candidates' parties did not reach the state's August 26 deadline to report their nominations to the Secretary of State. Texas Secretary of State Esperanza Andrade reported that all the correct paperwork was filed, though neither the Democratic nor Republican parties formally nominated their candidates (at their respective conventions) until after the deadline.|$|E
5|$|Measure 91 was {{approved}} in 2014, legalizing non-medical cultivation and uses of marijuana. It followed perennial, unsuccessful efforts to legalize marijuana by <b>ballot</b> initiative, including in 1986 and in 2012 {{which made it}} to the <b>ballot,</b> but voters rejected.|$|E

40|$|Decoy <b>ballots</b> do {{not count}} in {{election}} outcomes, but otherwise they are indistinguishable from real <b>ballots.</b> By {{means of a}} game-theoretical model, we show that decoy <b>ballots</b> may not provide effective protection against a malevolent adversary trying to buy real <b>ballots.</b> If the citizenry is divided into subgroups (or districts), the adversary can construct a so-called "Devil's Menu" consisting of several prices. In equilibrium, the adversary can buy the real <b>ballots</b> of any strict subset of districts at a price corresponding to the willingness to sell {{on the part of}} the citizens holding such <b>ballots.</b> By contrast, decoy voters are trapped into selling their <b>ballots</b> at a low, or even negligible, price. Blowing up the adversary's budget by introducing decoy <b>ballots</b> may thus turn out to be futile. The Devil's Menu can also be applied to the well-known "Lemons Problem"...|$|R
5000|$|As of December 30, county {{officials}} had found about 1,350 wrongly rejected <b>ballots.</b> The Franken campaign agreed to count {{all of those}} <b>ballots,</b> while the Coleman campaign agreed to a subset, and also wanted to reconsider more than 700 other absentee <b>ballots.</b> On December 30 and 31, representatives of both campaigns met with officials in each county and sorted through the absentee <b>ballots.</b> After some <b>ballots</b> were rejected by one campaign or the other, 953 <b>ballots</b> {{were sent to the}} secretary of state's office. The [...] "fifth pile" [...] of wrongly rejected absentee <b>ballots</b> were opened, checked for identifying marks, and counted (where found eligible) on January 3, 2009. Of the 933 <b>ballots</b> found to be eligible, 481 were for Franken; 305 were for Coleman; and 147 were for other candidates or were overvotes or undervotes.

5|$|The balloting {{began the}} {{following}} morning, July 10, with {{a two-thirds vote}} necessary to nominate. Bryan, who remained at his hotel, sent word to the Nebraska delegation to make no deals on his behalf. He stood second out of fourteen candidates in the first <b>ballot,</b> behind Bland. On the second <b>ballot,</b> Bryan still stood second, but had gained as other candidates had fallen away. The third <b>ballot</b> saw Bland still in the lead, but Bryan took the lead on the fourth <b>ballot.</b> According to Jones, {{it was clear that}} Bland could not win, and that Bryan could not be stopped. On the fifth <b>ballot,</b> the Illinois delegation, led by Governor Altgeld, switched its votes from Bland to Bryan. Other delegations, seeing that Bryan would be nominated, also switched, securing the victory. Nevertheless, he won the nomination without the votes of the gold delegates, most of whom either left the convention or refused to vote.|$|E

5|$|A Historical Overview Committee of sportswriters {{appointed}} by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a <b>ballot</b> of 10 managers and umpires. The managers/umpires list was then submitted to a panel composed of Hall of Fame members, executives and veteran media members for a final vote. A separate <b>ballot</b> of 10 executives was developed by a panel including executives, players and writers, which was the same committee which finally voted in that area. The final ballots were released in November 2009. Each panel member was allowed to vote for up to four individuals on each <b>ballot,</b> and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either panel was elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions were possible from each <b>ballot.</b> Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Indianapolis on December 6, 2009, with the results announced the next day; {{as was the case}} with the 2008 class of inductees, the Committee met to discuss the candidates, although the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.|$|E

5|$|At the Republican State Convention on March 22, 2014, Baker {{received}} 2,095 votes (82.708%), Fisher received 374 votes (14.765%) {{and there}} were 64 blank votes (2.527%). The threshold for making the <b>ballot</b> is 15% and the party announced that Baker had thus received the nomination {{without the need for}} a primary election. However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are not counted for the purposes of determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the <b>ballot.</b> He sued the Massachusetts Republican State Committee and was certified for the primary <b>ballot</b> after a lengthy battle. In the primary election held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{reports say}} Florida, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., (and {{possibly}} other states) have received record numbers of requests for absentee <b>ballots</b> for this election.

Washington State allows 15 days after the election for out of country absentee <b>ballots</b> to come in. It is possible that absentee <b>ballots</b> are being requested due to concerns about electronic voting, or simply due to an expected high overall voter turnout.|$|R
50|$|On February 13 {{the court}} ruled that no {{evidence}} had been presented to establish widespread problems with the counting of absentee <b>ballots</b> and that rejected absentee <b>ballots</b> from 12 of 19 disputed categories would not be counted. According to Coleman's attorney, this left approximately 3,500 <b>ballots</b> still open for consideration. The order also specified that parties must demonstrate that disputed <b>ballots</b> were legally cast, not just that they should not have been rejected, making it more difficult to argue in favor of counting remaining absentee <b>ballots.</b>|$|R

However, he {{was removed from the}} <b>ballot</b> on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3,500 valid signatures to be on the <b>ballot.</b> Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from the <b>ballot.</b> The vast majority of the rejected signatures were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots, which were mailed out before he was removed from the <b>ballot,</b> were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.|$|E
5|$|Harrison placed fifth on {{the first}} <b>ballot,</b> with Sherman in the lead, and the next few ballots showed little change.

2500|$|Florida also {{received}} an additional 2,411 overseas <b>ballots</b> after the 7 PM deadline on election day. Florida officials rejected these overseas <b>ballots,</b> mostly {{from members of}} the United States Armed Forces.
