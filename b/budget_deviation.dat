40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. First, it {{examines}} the communication strategies pursued by firms related to alcohol beverages in Spain during a decade with major changes in alcohol marketing regulations. Second, it analyzes the relationship between these strategies and underage alcohol consumption before and after 2007. Design/methodology/approach. Panel data methodology is implemented using data from ESTUDES national survey (average sample size 26, 000 interviews, 2004 - 2010) and INFOADEX (nationwide advertising expenditure, 1999 - 2013). Findings. The results show that, under a restrictive alcohol marketing framework, firms related to alcohol beverages adapt their communication strategies: <b>budget</b> <b>deviation</b> from advertising to sponsorship. Regarding alcohol quantity and frequency models, the relationship between alcohol advertising expenditure and underage alcohol consumption after 2007 is very small but still positive and significant. However, contrary to expectations, in the case of alcohol sponsorship, the relationship between expenditure and underage alcohol consumption has not been affected by the observed <b>budget</b> <b>deviation</b> from advertising to sponsorship after 2007. Research limitations/implications. Changes in alcohol advertising and sponsorship regulation lead firms related to alcohol beverages to change their communication strategies to overcome new regulatory restrictions and to reach their target group. Overall, despite the relationships between both advertising and sponsorship expenditure and underage alcohol consumption diminish between periods, they still remain positive and significant. Closer and updated monitoring of alcohol communication strategies pursued by firm is needed to keep controlling the alcohol advertising and sponsorship exposure to under age people. Originality/value. This is a pioneer study in analyzing communication strategies within the Spanish alcohol beverages sector and in proposing a model to analyze the dynamic effect of such strategies on underage alcohol consumption...|$|E

The aim is to define determinants of municipalities' tax revenue budgeting errors using static panel data models with fixed and random effect. Czech municipalities have a tendency to underestimate both total and tax revenues. On average, budgeted tax revenues are about 7 % lower than collected revenues during the period under examination. Such action could entail less transparency in budgeting process. Results indicate that structure of tax revenues also plays a role in explaining forecast errors.

Indeed it is expected to detect insecticides, including the ones for biocontrol, in nearshore marine waters and thus predicting where, when and with what magnitude these impacts are most likely to occur is imperative if we are effectively interested in understanding the role of biological products as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) on marine biodiversity. Bivalves are important elements of marine biodiversity and very often they play a role of ecosystem engineers in that many other species structurally depend on their presence. Oxygen consumption through respiration in these organisms varies with natural physical and chemical factors like temperature and food availability. However, it has been demonstrated that also several contaminants may affect respiration rates in intertidal bivalves like the small Mediterranean Mytilid, Mytilaster minimus. Since the respiration is an important component of energy <b>budget,</b> <b>deviation</b> of its magnitude from common natural patterns may alter the amount of energy available for growth and reproduction. Such a fact, by cascade, may induce alteration of biodiversity. Experiments have been carried out with adult mussels of about 1. 4 ± 0. 3 cm collected in March 2010 from the coasts around Palermo (Northern Sicily). We measured standardised respiration rates (µmoli h- 1 g- 1) at ambient temperature (20. 0 ± 1. 0 °C) in mesocosmal tanks both in presence of Bt and without.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of budget {{allocation}} for permanent and contingent workforce under stochastic demand. The level of permanent capacity is determined {{at the beginning of}} the horizon and is kept constant throughout whereas the number of temporary workers to be hired must be decided in each period. Compared to existing budgeting models, this paper explicitly considers a budget constraint. Under the assumption of a restricted budget, the objective is to minimize capacity shortages. When over-expenditures are allowed, both budget deviations and shortage costs are to be minimized. The capacity shortage cost function is assumed to be either linear or quadratic with the amount of shortage, which corresponds to different market structures or different types of services. We thus examine four variants of the problem that we model and solve either approximately or to optimality when possible. A comprehensive simulation study is designed to analyze the behavior of our models when several levels of demand variability and parameter values are considered. The parameters consist of the initial budget level, the unit cost of temporary workers and the <b>budget</b> <b>deviation</b> penalty/reward rates. Varying these parameters produce several trade-off between permanent and temporary workforce levels, and between capacity shortages and budget deviations. Simulation results also show that the quadratic cost function leads to smooth and moderate capacity shortages over the time periods, whereas all shortages are either avoided or accepted when the cost function is linear...|$|E

Moreover, we find support for our framework pre-dicting that the relationship between in-store slack and <b>budget</b> <b>deviation</b> (the amount by which actual spending deviates from the mental trip budget) depends on factors related to desire and willpower. Researchers and practitioners alike have commonly as-sumed that unplanned purchases are largely due to consumers ’ susceptibility to in-store stimuli (Heilman, Nak-amoto, and Rao 2002; Park, Iyer, and Smith 1989) and that, as a result, unplanned purchases represent unplanned spend-ing (i. e., Mukopadhyay and Johar 2007). On the other hand, two major studies have reported the surprising finding that actual spending closely approximated spending intentions despite the fact that over 50 % of purchases were unplanned (Kollat and Willett 1967; POPAI 1995). In this research, we draw upon mental budgeting to provide an explanation for this apparent paradox.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} impact of in-store slack on shoppers' spending. In my first essay, I propose that consumers' mental budgets for grocery trips are typically comprised of both an itemized portion and in-store slack. I conceptualize the itemized portion as the amount that the consumer has allocated to spend on items planned to the brand or product level and the in-store slack as {{the portion of the}} mental budget that is not assigned to be spent on any particular product but remains available for in-store decisions. Using a secondary data set and a field study, I find incidence of in-store slack. Moreover, I find support for my framework predicting that the relationship between in-store slack and <b>budget</b> <b>deviation</b> (the amount by which actual spending deviates from the mental trip budget) depends on factors related to desire and willpower. Building on my first essay, my second essay examines how {{the impact of}} promotions depends on whether the shopper still has in-store slack remaining in her mental budget. Specifically, I evaluate how the effect of promotional savings' for both planned and unplanned items on spending varies as a function of whether the item is purchased before or after the shopper's in-store slack is depleted. Additionally, I examine how these relationships vary depending on income. To achieve these goals, I conducted a field study in which respondents used a hand held scanner to record the order of purchases. The results suggest that savings on planned items lead to stockpiling by higher income shoppers when the savings occur before the in-store slack has been depleted, but lead to increased purchase of unplanned items when they occur after in-store slack is depleted. I also show that promotions on unplanned grocery items do generate incremental spending at the basket level which increases with income, but only when the item is purchased after the in-store slack is exceeded.

Indeed in a country such as Italy and in particularly Sicily where agricultural areas nearshore marine waters, predicting where, when and with what magnitude the impact of xenobiotics derived from agriculture is imperative. In this contest we use as model a biological product (Bacillus thuringiensis) in understanding its potential effects on non target species and on marine biodiversity. Bivalves are important elements of marine biodiversity and very often they play a role of ecosystem engineers in that many other species structurally depend on their presence. Moreover as they consume bacteria, to investigate {{the effect of the}} enthomopathogenic bacteria B. thuringiensis on this non target organisms could be useful to implement environmental risk assessment and data on food biosafety. Oxygen consumption through respiration in these organisms varies with natural physical and chemical factors like temperature and food availability.

The analysis uses quarterly data for South Africa. The paper reveals that government authorities in South Africa are more likely to react more quickly when the budget is in deficit than when in surplus, and that the stabilisation measures used by government are fairly neutral at low deficit levels; that is, at deficit levels of 4 per cent of GDP and below. We conclude that the assumption that adjustment towards equilibrium is always present and of the same strength under all circumstances, is not valid in the case of fiscal data on South Africa; and that that fiscal sustainability in South Africa has been attained at the expense of a reduction in the ratio of expenditure to GDP on education, and a relatively constant ratio of expenditure to GDP on health. The paper noted that a priori one would expect that such a decline in the allocations to sectors which could stimulate growth and which in turn could generate future revenue, may pose a threat to the accumulated fiscal space.

Our studies objectives were: (1) To determine whether cigarette excise tax revenue has been below budget in recent years, compared with previous decades. (2) To determine {{trends in the}} size of the illicit market since 1995. Methods For (1), mean percentage errors and root mean square percentage errors were calculated for <b>budget</b> revenue <b>deviation</b> for three products (cigarettes, beer and spirits), for various subperiods. For (2), predicted changes in total consumption, using actual cigarette price and GDP changes and previously published price and income elasticity estimates, were calculated and compared with changes in tax-paid consumption. Results Cigarette excise revenues were 0. 7 % below budget for 2000 – 2012 on average, compared with 3. 0 % below budget for beer and 4. 7 % below budget for spirits. There is no evidence that illicit trade in cigarettes in South Africa increased between 2002 and 2009. There is a substantial increase in illicit trade in 2010, probably peaking in 2011. In 2012 tax-paid consumption of cigarettes increased 2. 6 %, implying that the illicit market share decreased an estimated 0. 6 percentage points.

40|$|International audienceThis paper explores a {{multi-model}} scenario ensemble {{to assess}} the impacts of idealized and non-idealized climate change stabilization policies on fossil fuel markets. Under idealized conditions climate policies significantly reduce coal use in the short- and long-term. Reductions in oil and gas use are much smaller, particularly until 2030, but revenues decrease much more because oil and gas prices are higher than coal prices. A first deviation from optimal transition pathways is delayed action that relaxes global emission targets until 2030 {{in accordance with the}} Copenhagen pledges. Fossil fuel markets revert back to the no-policy case: though coal use increases strongest, revenue gains are higher for oil and gas. To balance the carbon budget over the 21 st century, the long-term reallocation of fossil fuels is significantly larger—twice and more—than the short-term distortion. This amplifying effect results from coal lock-in and inter-fuel substitution effects to balance the full-century carbon <b>budget.</b> The second <b>deviation</b> from the optimal transition pathway relaxes the global participation assumption. The result here is less clear-cut across models, as we find carbon leakage effects ranging from positive to negative because trade and substitution patterns of coal, oil, and gas differ across models. In summary, distortions of fossil fuel markets resulting from relaxed short-term global emission targets are more important and less uncertain than the issue of carbon leakage from early mover action...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Reliable {{exposure}} data {{is a vital}} concern in medical epidemiology and intervention studies. The present study addresses {{the needs of the}} medical researcher to spend monetary resources devoted to exposure assessment with an optimal cost-efficiency, i. e. obtain the best possible statistical performance at a specified budget. A few previous studies have suggested mathematical optimization procedures based on very simple cost models; this study extends the methodology to cover even non-linear cost scenarios. Methods Statistical performance, i. e. efficiency, was assessed in terms of the precision of an exposure mean value, as determined in a hierarchical, nested measurement model with three stages. Total costs were assessed using a corresponding three-stage cost model, allowing costs at each stage to vary non-linearly with the number of measurements according to a power function. Using these models, procedures for identifying the optimally cost-efficient allocation of measurements under a constrained budget were developed, and applied on 225 scenarios combining different sizes of unit costs, cost function exponents, and exposure variance components. Results Explicit mathematical rules for identifying optimal allocation could be developed when cost functions were linear, while non-linear cost functions implied that parts of or the entire optimization procedure had to be carried out using numerical methods. For many of the 225 scenarios, the optimal strategy consisted in measuring on only one occasion from each of as many subjects as allowed by the <b>budget.</b> Significant <b>deviations</b> from this principle occurred if costs for recruiting subjects were large compared to costs for setting up measurement occasions, and, at the same time, the between-subjects to within-subject variance ratio was small. In these cases, non-linearities had a profound influence on the optimal allocation and on the eventual size of the {{exposure data}} set. Conclusions The analysis procedures developed in the present study can be used for informed design of exposure assessment strategies, provided that data are available on exposure variability and the costs of collecting and processing data. The present shortage of empirical evidence on costs and appropriate cost functions however impedes general conclusions on optimal exposure measurement strategies in different epidemiologic scenarios. </p...|$|R
30|$|In such {{evaluations}} of {{impacts on the}} atmosphere by global land-use change, large uncertainties persist among model estimates (Sato et al. [2014]). For example, {{in the study of}} the current global carbon budget, one of the largest uncertainties originates from anthropogenic land-use changes in terrestrial ecosystems. The standard deviation of carbon flux caused by historical anthropogenic land-use change is estimated to be in the order of ± 0.5 PgC (Le Quéré et al. [2013]). The choice of land-use data could be one of the causes of estimate variations in land-use change emissions (Jain and Yang [2005]; Meiyappan and Jain [2012]). In the global evaluation of land-use and land-use change effects, land-use data compiled at an approximately 0.5 ° × 0.5 ° spatial resolution are generally used. Uncertainty in gridded historical land-use data derives from differences in cropland and pasture area between datasets, downscaling processes of regionally aggregated data, and others. These uncertainties in the reconstruction of historical land-use data should be considered in model evaluation (Klein Goldewijk and Verburg [2013]). In a recent study of the global carbon <b>budget,</b> the standard <b>deviation</b> of estimated land-use change flux with multiple terrestrial carbon cycle models using the same land-use dataset was estimated at 0.42 PgC year− 1 (Le Quéré et al. [2013]). In contrast, the standard deviation estimated by a single model, which was also used in the multiple model comparison using three different land-use datasets, was 0.27 PgC year− 1 (Jain et al.

Its specifications, e. g., XY-travel range of 50 mm × 50 mm and sub-micrometric accuracy; and some novel designed solutions, e. g., a three-layer and two-stage architecture are described. Once defined the prototype, an error analysis is performed to propose improvement design features. Then, the metrology loop {{of the system is}} mathematically modelled to define the propagation of the different sources. Several simplifications and design hypothesis are justified and validated, including the assumption of rigid body behavior, which is demonstrated after a finite element analysis verification. The different error sources and their estimated contributions are enumerated in order to conclude with the final error values obtained from the error <b>budget.</b> The measurement <b>deviations</b> obtained demonstrate the important influence of the working environmental conditions, the flatness error of the plane mirror reflectors and the accurate manufacture and assembly of the components forming the metrological loop. Thus, a temperature control of ± 0. 1 °C results in an acceptable maximum positioning error for the developed NanoPla stage, i. e., 41 nm, 36 nm and 48 nm in X-, Y- and Z-axis, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores a {{multi-model}} scenario ensemble {{to assess}} the impacts of idealized and non-idealized climate change stabilization policies on fossil fuel markets. Under idealized conditions climate policies significantly reduce coal use in the short- and long-term. Reductions in oil and gas use are much smaller, particularly until 2030, but revenues decrease much more because oil and gas prices are higher than coal prices. A first deviation from optimal transition pathways is delayed action that relaxes global emission targets until 2030 {{in accordance with the}} Copenhagen pledges. Fossil fuel markets revert back to the no-policy case: though coal use increases strongest, revenue gains are higher for oil and gas. To balance the carbon budget over the 21 st century, the long-term reallocation of fossil fuels is significantly larger – twice and more – than the short-term distortion. This amplifying effect results from coal lock-in and inter-fuel substitution effects to balance the full-century carbon <b>budget.</b> The second <b>deviation</b> from the optimal transition pathway relaxes the global participation assumption. The result here is less clear-cut across models, as we find carbon leakage effects ranging from positive to negative because leakage and substitution patterns of coal, oil, and gas differ. In summary, distortions of fossil fuel markets resulting from relaxed short-term global emission targets are more important and less uncertain than the issue of carbon leakage from early mover action.

40|$|The {{financial}} budget {{is a statement}} about {{what is to be}} achieved at a future date and on the other drew up the method by which it shall achieve the financial goals. This has two dimensions, a time frame and level of aggregation, and most of the decisions involve long lead times, which means that they require much time to implant. In most tourist facilities practice indicates that the making of the <b>budget</b> shows a <b>deviation</b> of up to 45 % on the obtained real. From the above it follows that these assumptions are carried out under conditions of considerable uncertainty as it becomes necessary to use methods that take into account financial planning these conditions result in uncertainty and minimize the deviations are not substantiated. There are different methods to prepare the budget, which have advantages and disadvantages. In this research intends to use the preparation of budgets, fuzzy linear regression,  which consists in finding two regression lines that contain all the information and that the distance between them is minimal, in order to obtain a range of budget as a basis for future estimation. The two lines are determined by linear programming and its solution is used for the computer system LINDO. Preliminary testing in a hotel installation of the province Santiago de Cuba, are closer to actual budget execution in the years 2007 and 2008 compared with the traditional method by 14 and 18 % less compared to the traditional method.  </div...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{efforts have been}} carried on to develop and {{evaluate}} versions of global terrestrial ecosystem models (GTEM) in which crop specificities are represented. The goal {{of this study is}} to evaluate the ability of the ORCHIDEE-STICS (Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEms-Simulateur mulTIdisciplinaire pour les Cultures Standard) GTEM in simulating the observed seasonal variations and annual budgets of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP) and total ecosystem respiration (TER) fluxes over seven wheat sites spanning a large climate gradient in Europe. Overall, the seasonal variations of GPP are well represented by the model, with 5 sites out of 7 exhibiting a correlation coefficient (R) value higher than 0. 9 and a normalized standard deviation (NSTD) between 0. 8 and 1. 2. In comparison, the model performances for catching the seasonal variations of TER are lower, especially in terms of NSTD. Regarding the annual <b>budgets,</b> mean simulated <b>deviations</b> averaged over all sites do not exceed 10 % and 15 % of the observed annual mean budget, for GPP and TER, respectively. For NEE, the model capacity at estimating annual budgets is low, its mean deviation corresponding to ~ 35 % of the observed mean value. This clearly shows that more accurate model estimates of GPP and especially TER are required for estimating NEE annual budgets. In this respect, past land-use and land-management changes are probably the most crucial processes to add, for getting soil carbon disequilibrium and more accurate NEE annual budgets. From a sensitivity analysis of the modelled fluxes to three management practices (plant variety, sowing date and fertilization intensity), we found that the fertilization is the most sensitive practice impacting the model performances of any flux, both in terms of seasonal variations and annual budgets. </p...|$|R

Since its launch in Austria in 1986 and the launch in South Africa in November 1997, Red Bull has caused a stir. Dietrich Mateschitz created Red Bull after visiting Thailand and seeing the taxi drivers drinking syrup called Kraling Daeng. He took this mixture to his home country and started to develop something more acceptable to the Western taste. The Red Bull brand was developed and built by firstly developing the taste, then designing the can and lastly designing the famous cartoons. Only thereafter the rollout started. Red Bull created a new drinks category called energy drinks. This research will take a close look at and discuss how Red Bull used the strategic marketing process to decide whether to enter the South African market, and from a marketing point of view, how the brand was and still is managed, focusing specifically on the first ten years since its launch in South Africa. Red Bull hit the South African shops in November 1997. This happened after a local distributor, THUMB Trading and later J Melnick & Company, did some analysis about the market. This industry, political, economic, social, technical and environmental analysis showed that the brand could be successful in the country. The volatile and ever changing exchange rate and import duties would however be the biggest external factors affecting the pricing in South Africa. Red Bull Head Office together with the local distributor investigated the market size and market potential, concluding that there was huge potential to launch the product in South Africa. The distributor at the time, THUMB Trading, was a consumer goods importer with good knowledge of the market. Their distribution and penetration into the retail market was solid although they lacked in the newly identified on-premise market. A new team was established to service this on-premise market, which was Red Bull 's focus when entering the market, supported by consumer sampling. The first phase, getting the silver and blue can into all the trendy and well-known on-premise outlets, was very successful but soon the next phase of rolling the brand out to the retail and convenience stores needed to commence. This coincided with even more consumer awareness programs across the country. The marketing activities soon followed, not in the traditional 4 Ps style of price, product, place and promotion, but something quite different. Red Bull introduced their methodology looking at the brand based on five pillars - media, sport and events sponsoring, consumer collecting, trade and retail promotions, and market research. These pillars each have their specific goals closely interacted to form an integrated marketing approach. Red Bull has unique brand events such as Boxcart and "Flugtag" (Flying day) to create the awareness and fun around the brand. These events are held in popular and spectacular locations, which attract tens of thousands of spectators to witness the brand at first hand. The Red Bull sponsored and supported athletes help to promote the functionality of the brand by helping athletes (and other consumers) with endurance, recovery, concentration and focus in time when they need it most. The marketing mix also consists of trade and retail promotions where Red Bull has developed specific point-of-sale items for the different channels. The category management and "global score" projects further enhance the Red Bull visibility, resulting in increased sales. Red Bull looks at the marketing spend on a monthly basis making sure it is progressing according to the <b>budget.</b> Any <b>deviations</b> found in the control process are carefully analysed and the adjustments are made accordingly. The local marketing team has to submit a revision at the end of each quarter making sure they stay on track according to the Annual Business Plan approved in December of the previous year. Monthly feedback is given to the country manager or Quarterback and Area Manager in the marketing and sales report on all development according to a predefined set of targets. The Red Bull sales and marketing efforts in South Africa are not only supported by local marketing efforts but also by Red Bull Head Office's international marketing strategies. These include Red Bull projects such as the channel crossing, the Jesus statue jump and world record speed skiing attempts to name but a few. The Red Bull companies with the well-known Red Bull Racing and Torro Rosso respectively competing in the Formula One Grand Prix series, Hangar 7 housing the Flying Bulls or the Red Bull Air Race, also contributes to keep the brand in consumers minds. Red Bull is truly a different brand with unique ways of doing business. The planning and thinking integrate not only the different pillars but also the head office projects, and Red Bull companies make the marketing effort something special to watch. This integrated marketing approach comprising of so many different angles sets new marketing standards, and also makes it easier to understand why the brand is so strong globally. The Red Bull success can be attributed to a small number of things, which include their people,the passion for the brand, a drive to succeed, and their detailed planning methodology. The way of doing is consistent throughout the world, speaking the same language with the same message everywhere - a unique brand with strong brand values, focus and strategies, which thinks as a number two to be the number one [...] "Red Bull gives you wiiings!"AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Red Bull is waarskynlik een van die mees interessante handelsname wat ooit geskep is. Sedert die bekendstelling in Oostenryk in 1986 en die bekendstelling in Suid-Afrika in November 1997, het Red Bull 'n beroering veroorsaak. Dietrich Mateschitz het Red Bull ontwerp nadat hy Thailand besoek het en daar gesien het dat taxi-bestuurders 'n stroop, genaamd Krating Daeng, drink. Mateschitz het hierdie mengsel na sy tuisland teruggeneem en begin om iets te ontwikkel wat meer aanvaarbaar vir die Westerse smaak sou wees. Die Red Bull handelsmerk is ontwikkel en uitgebou deur eerste die smaak te ontwikkel, daarna die blikkie te ontwerp en laastens die welbekende tekenprente. Slegs daarna het die bekendstelling begin. Hierdie navorsing sal in diepte kyk en bespreek hoe Red Bull die strategiese bemarkingsproses gebruik het in die besluit om die Suid-Afrikaanse mark binne te dring al dan nie en vanuit 'n bemarkingsoogpunt bespreek hoe die handelsmerk bestuur is en steeds bestuur word deur spesifiek te fokus op die eerste tien jaar vanaf bekendstelling in Suid-Afrika. Red Bull is in November 1997 in Suid-Afrikaanse winkels beskikbaar gestel. Dit het gebeur nadat 'n plaaslike verspreider, THUMB Trading, later bekend as J Melnick & Company, 'n markanalise gedoen het. Hierdie industrie, politieke, ekonomiese, sosiale, tegniese en omgewingsanalise het gewys dat die handelsnaam baie suksesvol in die land kon wees. Die onbestendige en ewig veranderende wisselkoers asook invoerbelasting sou egter die grootste eksterne faktore wees wat betref die prysbepaling vir die Suid-Afrikaanse mark. Red Bull hoofkantoor, tesame met die plaaslike verspreider het die markgrootte en markpotensiaal ondersoek en tot die gevolgtrekking gekom dat daar baie potensiaal is om die produk in Suid-Afrika vry te stel. Die verspreider, THUMB Trading, was 'n invoermaatskappy van verbruikersgoedere met 'n grondige kennis van die mark. Hul verspreiding en penetrering van die handelsmark was bestendig, alhoewel hulle tekortgeskiet het in die nuut geidentifiseerde "op-perseel"-mark. Red Bull wou spesifiek fokus op die "op-perseel"-mark asook verbruikersmonsters terwyl die mark betree word en daar is toe 'n span saamgestel wat hierdie "op-perseel"-mark sou diens. Die eerste fase, om die silwer-en-blou-blikkie in al die gewilde, toonaangewende "op-perseel" verkooppunte beskikbaar te stel, was baie suksesvol, maar kort daarna moes die volgende fase begin - om die produk in die kleinhandelafsetpunte en gerieflikheidswinkels te hê. Hierdie fase het saamgeval met selfs nog meer gebruikersbewusmakingsprogramme oral deur die land. Die bemarkingsaktiwiteite het kort daarna gevolg - nie in die tradisionele 4 P-styl van prys, produk, plek en promosie nie, maar iets heeltemal eiesoortig. Red Bull het hulle metodologie bekendgestel wat daarop berus dat hulle die bemarking van die handelsmerk op vyf pilare basseer: media, sport en geleentheidsborgskappe, verbruikersversameling, handel- en kleinhandel promosies, asook marknavorsing. Hierdie pilare het elk sy eie spesifieke doelwitte met noue wisselwerking tussen mekaar om uiteindelik 'n geintegreerde bemarkingsbenadering te vorm. Red Bull bied unieke okkasies, soos "Boxcart" en "Flugtag" (Vliegdag) aan om bewusmaking en pret rondom die handelsmerk te verhoog. Hierdie okkasies word in gewilde, skouspelagtige plekke aangebied wat tienduisende toeskouers teiken wat die handelsmerk eerstehands kan ervaar. Atlele wat deur Red Bull geborg en/of ondersteun word, help om die funksionaliteit van die handelsnaam te bevorder deur atlete, asook ander verbruikers, te help met hul uithouvermoë, herstel, konsentrasie en fokus op die tye wat hulle dit die nodigste het. Die bemarkingsaktiwiteite sluit ook in handels- en kleinhandelpromosies waar Red Bull spesifieke verkooppunt-items ontwikkel het vir die verskillende kanale. Die kategorie bestuur- en globale puntestandprojekte bevorder die Red Bull sigbaarheid wat weer lei tot verhoogde verkope. Red Bull kyk maandeliks na die bemarkingsbesteding om sodoende te verseker dat dit volgens die begroting verloop. Enige afwykings wat tydens die kontrole proses gevind word, word baie deeglik geanaliseer en aanpassings word gemaak. Die plaaslike bemarkingspan moet elke kwartaal 'n revisie indien om te verseker dat hulle op die regte spoor bly aangaande die Jaarlikse Besigheidsplan wat Desembermaand van die vorige jaar goedgekeur is. In die bemarkings- en verkoopsverslag word maandeliks terugvoer aan die landbestuurder en areabestuurder gegee rakende alle vordering op grond van 'n voorafgedefinieerde stel doelwitte. Die Red Bull verkoop- en bemarkingsprestasies in Suid-Afrika word nie net deur plaaslike bemarkingspogings ondersteun nie, maar ook deur Red Bull hoofkantoor se internasionale bemarkingstrategiee. Hierdie sluit projekte in soos die kanaaloorkruising, die Jesusbeeld-sprong en wereldrekord spoedskipogings, om maar net 'n paar te noem. Die Red Bull maatskappye, tesame met die welbekende Red Bull Racing en Torro Rosso wat afsonderlik deelneem aan die Formule Een Grand Prix-reeks, die Hangar- 7 wat die Vlieende Bulle of die Red Bull Lugspan huisves, dra almal daartoe by om bewusmaking van hierdie handelsnaam by verbruikers te verhoog. Red Bull is verseker 'n andersoortige handelsnaam wat op 'n unieke manier besigheid doen. In die beplanning- en oorwegingsfase word nie net die verskillende pilare geintegreer nie, maar ook die projekte wat deur die hoofkantoor geloods word en die Red Bull maatskappye maak die bemarkingsprojek iets besonders om te sien. Hierdie geintegreerde bemarkingsbenadering wat uit soveel verskillende fasette bestaan, stel nuwe bemarkingstandaarde, maar maak dit ook makliker om te begryp waarom hierdie handelsnaam wereldwyd so sterk is. Die sukses van Red Bull kan toegeskryf word aan 'n paar dinge, wat insluit hul mense, die passie vir die handelsmerk, die deursettingsvermoe om suksesvol te wees, asook hul gedetaileerde beplanningsmetodologie. Die manier van doen is wereldwyd konsekwent, praat oral dieselfde taal met dieselfde boodskap - waarlik 'n unieke handelsnaam met sterk waardes, fokus en strategiee, wat dink soos 'n nommer twee om verseker die nommer een te wees..
