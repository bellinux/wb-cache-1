5|$|Election Special is the 2012 fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Ry Cooder. After his 2011 album Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, Cooder {{continued}} writing topical and storyline-inspired songs. Displeased {{with the}} Republican Party and its financial supporters, {{he also wanted}} to write an album that would address listeners during the United States presidential election of 2012, which he believed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> event in the country's history. Election Special was recorded mostly at Drive-By Studios in North Hollywood and produced by Cooder.|$|E

Marvel Comics and Bungie announced the first Halo limited comic series, Halo: Uprising, at the San Diego Comic-Con 2006.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> factor in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival's future.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{opposition}} from the two SS panzer divisions in the area proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> factor not only in preventing the British 1st Airborne Division from holding the Rhine Bridge at Arnhem, but also imposed serious delays on the capture of the bridges at Nijmegen by the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the advance of the armoured units of the British XXX Corps. For SHAEF, the outcome meant that attention had {{to turn to the}} Battle of the Scheldt to open the approaches to Antwerp and to building up resources for an invasion of Germany in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The first {{director}} approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was Danny Boyle. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director {{taking charge of}} the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whomever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film Shallow Grave and {{wanted to see how}} that film was received before committing to Our Friends in the North. When Shallow Grave proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew from Our Friends in the North. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he too had other production commitments.|$|E

5|$|The play {{established}} Fielding as {{a popular}} London playwright, and the press reported that seats were in great demand. Although largely ignored by critics until the 20th century, most agree that the play is primarily a commentary on events in Fielding's life, signalling his transition from older forms of comedy to the new satire of his contemporaries. Fielding's play within a play satirised {{the way in which}} the London theatre scene, in his view, abused the literary public by offering new and inferior genres. The Author's Farce is now considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> success and a highly skilled satire.|$|E

50|$|There is {{also the}} {{optional}} rule of Critical Successes and Critical Failures. If using a d10, rolling <b>a</b> 10 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Critical</b> Success, and allows a second roll. The result of the second roll {{is added to the}} first to calculate the result. Further 10's may <b>be</b> rerolled. <b>A</b> roll of 1 <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>critical</b> failure and you subtract 1d10 from your total. When using 3d6; a roll of all sixes, (<b>an</b> 18), <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Critical</b> Success, and two additional dice can be rolled and added to the result. A roll of three ones, (<b>a</b> 3), <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Critical</b> Failure, (even if all you only needed to roll <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 3 to succeed the check), and subtract 2d6 from the total. <b>A</b> <b>Critical</b> Failure may represent something more disastrous happening to the character as the Referee sees fit. <b>A</b> <b>Critical</b> Failure on <b>a</b> Lockpicking task, for example, could trigger a silent alarm the character wasn't aware of.|$|R

25|$|After Jean Brodie, Allen {{had another}} success on Broadway with Forty Carats (1968).

25|$|Rice {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} a musical based on the subject to Lloyd Webber, but although the idea of writing a score including tangos, pasos dobles, and similar Latin flavours intrigued him, Lloyd Webber ultimately rejected the idea. He decided instead to collaborate with Alan Ayckbourn on Jeeves, a traditional Rodgers and Hart-style musical based on the P. G. Wodehouse character, which proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> and commercial failure. After Jeeves, Lloyd Webber returned to Rice, and they began developing Rice's proposed musical.|$|E
25|$|In menopausal women, sexual {{functioning}} can impact several {{dimensions of}} a woman’s life, including her physical, psychological, and mental well-being. During {{the onset of}} menopause, sexuality can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> issue in determining whether one begins to experience changes in their sexual response cycle. Both age— and menopause-related events can affect the integrity of a woman’s biological systems involved in the sexual response cycle, which include hormone environment, neuro-muscular substrates, and vascular supplies. Therefore, it can be appropriate {{to make use of}} HRT, especially in women with low or declining quality of life due to sexual difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} upon this group because {{the years between}} the late teens and the mid-twenties are {{believed}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> period during which young people form adult identities and move toward independence. The effects of youth disconnection—limited education, social exclusion, lack of work experience, and fewer opportunities to develop mentors and valuable work connections—can have long-term consequences that snowball across the life course, eventually influencing everything from earnings and self-sufficiency to {{physical and mental health}} and marital prospects. Much discussion has been focused on how to reach these young people and connect them with broader social institutions in order to prevent these negative consequences.|$|E

She last sang in public on 24 October 1914, taking part in a Red Cross concert at London's Royal Albert Hall that had been organized to aid victims of World War I. She lived long enough to see the war end, dying in 1919 of natural causes.|$|E
