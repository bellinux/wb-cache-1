50|$|In {{the time}} of Cellachán's {{descendant}} Cormac Mac Cárthaig, the Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil (<b>Battle</b> <b>history</b> of Cellachán Caisil) was composed, probably inspired by the Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh written for Muirchertach Ua Briain, glorifying Murchad's ancestor Brian Bóruma. The Caithréim portrays the Eóganachta, and Cellachán in particular, fighting against Norsemen invaders, but also gives credit to the Dál gCais ancestors of Muirchertach. It is thought that this {{is related to the}} contemporary threat posed to the Munster families by the Connacht king Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair.|$|E
