When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large gap between the incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth—premolars and molars—approach a bilophodont pattern, with two distinct lobes. Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) {{is larger than the}} molars <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E

5|$|Bond veteran {{cameraman}} {{and professional}} skier Willy Bogner, Jr. {{was promoted to}} director of a second unit involving ski footage. Bogner designed the ski chase on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d'Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me. To allow better filming, Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a bobsleigh, allowing to film the vehicle or <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> a set of skis {{that allowed him to}} ski forwards and backwards to get the best shots. In February 1981, {{on the final day of}} filming the bobsleigh chase, one of the stuntmen driving a sleigh, 23-year-old Paolo Rigon, was killed when he became trapped under the bob.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki {{had wanted}} to produce a new film for years, but his two {{previous}} proposals (one based on the Japanese book Kirino Mukouno Fushigina Machi, and another about a teenage heroine) were rejected. Miyazaki's third proposal, which ended up becoming Sen and Chihiro Spirited Away, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. Miyazaki thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, {{and there was a}} small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bathhouse. Miyazaki was always curious to what was <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of Spirited Away.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Isma'il Pasha {{also saw the}} return of royal {{patronage}} to al-Azhar. As khedive, Isma'il restored the Bab al-Sa'yida (first built by Katkhuda) and the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya. Tewfik Pasha, Isma'il's son, who became khedive {{when his father was}} deposed as a result of British pressure, continued to restore the mosque. Tewfik renovated the prayer hall that was added by Katkhuda, also aligning the southeastern facade of the hall with the street <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> remodeling several other areas of the mosque. Abbas II succeeded his father Tewfik as khedive of Egypt and Sudan in 1892, and continued the renovations started by his grandfather Isma'il. He restructured the main facade of the mosque and built a new riwaq. Under his rule, the Committee for the Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art (initially formed under French occupation), also restored the original Fatimid sahn. These renovations were both needed and helped modernize al-Azhar and harmonize it with what was becoming a metropolis.|$|E

5|$|On the {{division}} right, Tabu-dong was in North Korean hands, {{on the left}} Waegwan was a no-man's land, {{and in the center}} strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> was in danger of being surrounded. After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker, Gay on September 5 issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position. The movement was to progress from right to left beginning with the 8th Cavalry Regiment, then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area, and finally the 5th Cavalry in the Waegwan area. This withdrawal caused the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, to give up a hill it had just attacked and captured near the Tabu-dong road on the approaches of the Walled City of Ka-san. In the 7th Cavalry sector the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd Battalions were to withdraw in that order, after the withdrawal of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry, on their right. The 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry, on Hill 303 north of Waegwan was to cover the withdrawal of the 7th Cavalry and hold open the escape road.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

25|$|During this time, {{while still}} in Sacramento, the {{gigantic}} engine {{was used as an}} advertising tool by the railroad, to spectacular effect. According to author Guy L. Dunscomb, the engine was kept under steam near the Central Pacific's passenger depot, where it would await the arrival of passenger trains coming in from the east. As the train arrived, El Gobernador would steam past the depot dragging a long line of empty freight cars <b>behind</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> causing quite a stir in the process. The engine would then be uncoupled and placed on adjacent trackage, where the passengers could {{get a good look at}} the monster up close.|$|E
25|$|Borough {{bridge and}} Corporation Street, which crosses it, {{were laid out}} {{as part of the}} same development, and named to {{celebrate}} the incorporation of Sheffield as a borough. Samual Worth and Samual Furness Holmes were responsible for its design, and the foundation stone carries the date 12 March 1853. The bridge is built of stone, has three segmental arches, and was completed in 1856. It is a grade II listed structure. During the Great Flood, large quantities of debris built up <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> then caused the iron bridge below it to be swept away.

25|$|At {{the other}} side, {{as soon as}} his forces were deployed, Zeki Pasha decided to take the {{offensive}} towards Kumanovo. In the evening of 22 October, Vardar Army gathered in the valley of Pčinja River. While Zeki Pasha had the precise information about the strength and disposal of the Serbian forces, the Serbian command did not realise that the battle with the main Ottoman force would start the very next morning. Not expecting the attack, Serbs did not fortify their positions, which were topographically strong. Still, only two out of five infantry divisions were deployed in the front echelon – Danube Division I on the left wing, with Cavalry Division <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> Morava Division I on the right wing. The left flank was particularly vulnerable, because Srtevica, the important topographic object, was defended by local irregulars.|$|E
25|$|The second line, half-way up {{the slopes}} of the Moronvilliers hills, was {{destroyed}} from south of Mont Perthois to the Suippes, barbed-wire in the woods to the north-east of Mont Sans Nom was partially cut, making an attack on the German position on the ridges above the Suippes practicable.

25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use {{jet blast}} deflectors {{at the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. Jet blast deflectors are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The jet blast deflector lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position <b>behind</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|E
