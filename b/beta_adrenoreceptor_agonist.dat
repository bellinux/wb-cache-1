50|$|Beta {{adrenergic}} agonists or Beta agonists are {{medications that}} relax {{muscles of the}} airways, which widens the airways and results in easier breathing. They are a class of sympathomimetic agents which act upon the beta adrenoceptors. In general, pure beta-adrenergic agonists have the opposite function of beta blockers. <b>Beta</b> <b>adrenoreceptor</b> <b>agonist</b> ligands mimic the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine signaling in the heart, lungs and smooth muscle tissue, with epinephrine expressing the highest affinity. The activation of β1, β2 and β3 activates the enzyme, adenylate cyclase. This in turn leads to the activation of the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cAMP then activates Protein Kinase A (PKA) which phosphorylates target proteins ultimately inducing smooth muscle relaxation and contraction of the cardiac tissue.|$|E
40|$|The forced {{swimming}} test (FST) in mice {{has failed}} to predict antidepressant activity for drugs having <b>beta</b> <b>adrenoreceptor</b> <b>agonist</b> activity and for serotonin uptake inhibitors. We investigated the potential for clonidine to render the FST sensitive to antidepressants by using a behaviorally inactive dose of this agent (0. 1 mg/kg). All antidepressants studied (tricyclics, 5 -HT uptake inhibitors, iprindole, mianserin, viloxazine, trazodone) showed either activity at lower doses or activity at previously inactive doses. The effect appeared specific {{because it did not}} appear with drugs other than antidepressants (diazepam, chlorpromazine, sulpiride, atropine), except for amphetamine and apomorphine which have a strong effect on the dopaminergic system. The use of behaviorally subactive doses of clonidine may thus provide an important means of increasing the sensitivity of the forced swimming test...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} role played by beta {{adrenoreceptor}} mediated pathways on human upper gut function a series of studies were conducted into the effects of beta adrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists on orocaecal and duodenocaecal transit and on antral and duodenal motor activity. Under control conditions orocaecal transit was consistent within individuals (mean coefficient of variation (18. 0 %) but varied widely between individuals (median transit 63 minutes, range 33 - 164). Prior administration of the non-selective beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol consistently hastened orocaecal transit (median transit 51 : 25 - 93, v control p < 0. 005). The selective beta- 1 antagonist, atenolol, also hastened transit (median transit 50 : 35 - 93 minutes, v control p < 0. 01). The magnitude of an individual's response to beta blockade correlated closely with the orocaecal transit (Tau = 0. 54, p < 0. 01). Duodenocaecal transit was also hastened by propranolol from control values of 66 : 45 - 107 minutes to 50 : 16 - 62 minutes, p < 0. 025). In contrast neither duodenal nor antral motility were consistently altered by beta blockade. The <b>beta</b> <b>adrenoreceptor</b> <b>agonist,</b> isoprenaline, delayed both orocaecal transient (97 : 55 - 178 minutes, v control p < 0. 005) and also duodenocaecal transit (160 : 45 - 215 minutes, v 73 : 40 - 133) (p < 0. 025). Isoprenaline also reduced antral motility by an effect which appeared to occur predominantly through a reduction in contraction amplitude (from a median amplitude of 27 : 5. 39 mm Hg to 14 : 3 - 24 mm Hg, p < 0. 03) rather than an effect on the interval between contractions. No effect on either amplitude or frequency of duodenal motor activity was observed. A beta adrenoreceptor mediated pathway thus appears to exert a biologically relevant effect on gut function not only under conditions of sympathetic stimulation, but also at rest when a basal beta adrenergic tone appears to influence the speed of nutrient transit through the human upper gut...|$|E
40|$|Dopexamine {{is a new}} {{vasodilator}} with {{a combination}} of dopamine receptor and <b>beta</b> 2 <b>adrenoreceptor</b> <b>agonist</b> properties. Its haemodynamic effects were assessed after dose titration and during infusion for up to 24 hours in 15 patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. At the initial titration a dose of 1 micrograms/kg/min produced a 25 % decrease in the systemic vascular resistance index and a 32 % increase in cardiac index. Stroke volume index and heart rate increased by 23 % and 9 % respectively. Left ventricular filling pressures and mean blood pressures were not affected. The short term effects were well sustained during the long term infusion and tolerance did not develop.

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{placebo-controlled}} study in mild atopic asthmatics, we observed {{a significant decrease}} in eosinophils in the bronchial submucosa, after 2 months oftreatment with inhaled formoterol and budesonide. Biopsy material from each treatment group; formoterol (24 microg bid), budesonide (400 microg b. i. d.) and placebo has been further assessed to investigatethe role of Th- 2 cytokines by immunohistochemistry using Mabs to eosinophils as an index of inflammation, IL- 4 and IL- 5. Treatment with formoterol significantly reduced the number of eosinophils (EG 2 +) in the submucosa and epithelium, but this was not paralleled by changes in cytokine immunoreactivity In contrast, treatment with budesonide significantly reduced both the number of eosinophils (EG 2 +) and immunoreactivity for IL- 4 and IL- 5 in the submucosa. Thus, while budesonide has effects on cytokines involved in eosinophil recruitmentthis explanation does not apply tothe eosinopaenia observed with the long-acting <b>beta</b> 2 <b>adrenoreceptor</b> <b>agonist</b> formoterol. </p...|$|R

40|$|Alpha- 2 <b>adrenoreceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> {{have long}} {{been used in the}} {{treatment}} of arterial hypertension. However, in that indication they have progressively been replaced by antihypertensive drugs with a more interesting therapeutic profile. Nonetheless, pharmacological activation of alpha- 2 adrenoreceptors leads to a variety of clinical effects that are of major interest for anaesthesia and intensive care practice. Indeed, the sedative and analgesic properties of alpha- 2 <b>adrenoreceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> allow a reduction of hypnotic and opioid needs during general anaesthesia. In addition, they induce a down-regulation of the level of consciousness comparable to that of natural slow-wave sleep during post-anaesthesia and intensive care unit stay. These drugs may also prevent some deleterious effects of the sympathetic discharge in response to surgical stress. Furthermore, alpha- 2 <b>adrenoreceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> are potent adjuncts for locoregional anaesthesia. In this article, we will summarize the most frequent applications of alpha- 2 <b>adrenoreceptor</b> <b>agonists</b> in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine. We will focus on the clinical data available for the two most representative molecules of this pharmacological class: clonidine and dexmedetomidine. Peer reviewe...|$|R

This study utilises the methods of cassette dosing and the perfused ovine eye model – to reduce animal usage and therefore animal time – to show that for a series of <b>beta</b> <b>adrenoreceptor</b> antagonists, lipophilicity is a key physicochemical property that governs drug distribution within the eye. Following intravitreal injection, lipophilic <b>beta</b> <b>adrenoreceptor</b> antagonists penetrate to the posterior eye, where they bind to the choroid and reside in the retina at greater concentrations than more hydrophilic <b>beta</b> <b>adrenoreceptor</b> antagonists, which preferentially penetrate to the anterior eye...|$|R

No appreciable changes were observed in the dissocation constants for 3 H-DHA binding. The changes in cortical <b>beta</b> <b>adrenoreceptor</b> density found in early (8 hr) and later phases (32 hr) of withdrawal were paralled by a selective increase and decrease, respectively, in cortical neuron sensitivity to noradrenergic stimulation.
