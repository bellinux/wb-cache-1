30|$|On {{the other}} hand, from a {{pathological}} viewpoint, as our histological study showed the endothelial lining, which is typically observed in sinus pericranii (<b>Bollar</b> et al. 1992), their etiological backgrounds may be similar. Although {{the etiology of}} sinus pericranii is still unknown, two possible etiologies have been postulated: congenital and traumatic. As sinus pericranii is frequently associated with intracranial developmental venous anomalies or other anomalies, it suggests a congenital cause, such as transient venous hypertension during the late embryonic period (Nomura et al. 2006). On the other hand, some patients developed sinus pericranii without congenital anomalies after head trauma. In this case, it suggests that sinus pericranii has an acquired pathophysiology (David et al. 1998), but the causal trauma is frequently too slight to be noticed (<b>Bollar</b> et al. 1992). The patient in our case {{did not have any}} other venous anomalies but may have suffered minor trauma in the past.|$|E
