5|$|Predominantly insectivorous, the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} berries and seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and {{the closeness of}} its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species {{for the study of}} warbler behavior in the wild. The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> mostly forages in the {{understory}} {{instead of}} the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> more often hovers rather than gleans its prey {{because it is more}} difficult to glean among thick understory foliage.|$|E
5|$|Its {{nesting site}} is more {{important}} than its foraging site in playing a role in determining the habitat of the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler.</b> The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> is an open-nesting species, that nests very close to the ground so it has to choose a protected nesting site where the risk of predation is relatively low.|$|E

500|$|A {{variety of}} warblers {{is found in}} Colton Point State Park. The Pennsylvania Audubon Society states that Pine Creek Gorge is [...] "especially rich in warbler species, {{including}} Pine, <b>Black-throated</b> <b>blue,</b> <b>Black-throated</b> green, Blackburnian, and Black-and-white." [...] Many of these smaller birds are more often heard than seen as they keep away from the trails and overlooks.|$|R
5|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> {{enjoys a}} large range {{and a big}} {{population}}. Its population trend is currently increasing. This species was ranked as Least Concern by the IUCN in 2012. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are threatening the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> in its tropical wintering areas. A report in 2000 discussed the impact {{of global climate change}} on the population dynamics of the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> by an observation from 1986 to 1998. In particular, the effect of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied in relation to the survival, fecundity and recruitment of this migratory bird. It was found that El Niño years (the warm South Pacific oceanic phase) were associated with lower adult survival rate in their wintering ground, Jamaica, lower fecundity in the breeding habitats in New Hampshire of the United States, and lower annual recruitment of yearlings and juveniles to both breeding and wintering grounds. All the three factors were relatively higher during La Niña years (cold South Pacific Ocean) when the weather was wetter and the food availability was much more abundant. Long-term global warming can aggravate the ENSO effect, adding to the fluctuation of the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> population.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> (Setophaga caerulescens) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird of the New World warbler family. Its breeding ranges {{are located}} in the interior of deciduous and mixed coniferous forests in eastern North America. Over the cooler months, it migrates to islands in the Caribbean and Central America. It is very rarely found in western Europe, where it {{is considered to be a}} non-indigenous species. The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> is sexually dimorphic; the adult male has a black face and cheeks, deep blue upperparts and white underparts, while the adult female is olive-brown above and light yellow below.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> forages {{actively}} in low vegetation, sometimes hovering or catching insects in flight. It often forages {{in one area}} {{for a while before}} moving on to the next. It mainly eats invertebrates such as caterpillars, crane flies, and spiders. It may supplement its diet with seeds, berries, and fruit in the winter.|$|E
50|$|There are {{no known}} species of special concern inhabiting Spruce Run in Buffalo Township and Kelly Township. Acadian Flycatchers have been {{observed}} {{in the vicinity of}} the stream on Buffalo Mountain. <b>Black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> warblers have also been observed near the stream.|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that malarial parasites (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) of <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> warblers (Dendroica caerulescens) provide sufficient geographical signal to track population movements between the warbler's breeding and wintering habitats in North America. Our results from 1083 warblers sampled across the species' breeding range indicate that parasite lineages are geographically widespread and do not provide site-specific information. The wide distribution of malarial parasites probably reflects postnatal dispersal of their hosts as well as mixing of breeding populations on the wintering range. When compared to geographically structured parasites of sedentary Caribbean songbirds, patterns of malarial infections in <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> warblers suggest that host–malaria dynamics of migratory and sedentary bird populations {{may be subject to}} contrasting selection pressures...|$|R
50|$|Becker Brook is {{classified}} as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery. In 1986, the stream was noted {{to have a good}} population of native trout. Yellow-bellied flycatchers have been observed nesting at the headwaters of Becker Brook. Other bird species inhabiting the Becker Brook Swamp include <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> warblers, dark-eyed juncos, and white-throated sparrows.|$|R
5|$|A 1996, {{researchers}} {{showed that}} the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> prefers to reside in hardwood forests with higher shrub densities where food is more abundant compared to lower shrub density plots. Within these high shrub density habitats, {{not only is there}} a higher density of warblers, but the population age average is also older, being composed of males and females who are at least two years of age.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> {{is one of}} the New World warblers or wood-warblers in {{the family}} Parulidae. This species was {{originally}} placed under the genus Dendroica. It was recently adjusted {{to be a member of}} genus Setophaga along with all other members of the genus Dendroica, based on the findings from a recent phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA in 2010. The old genus Dendroica was then deleted. Within the genus, it appears to have no particularly close relatives.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> is a {{socially}} monogamous species, males are frequently observed in territories of other males, suggesting {{the occurrence of}} extra-pair matings. Nestling parentage is identified by microsatellites in a study plot at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. The results show that extra-pair fertilization occurs and {{that the majority of}} the extra-pair sires come from males in neighboring territories. Only very few extra-pair sires are from distant territories. This local reproductive interaction is also supported by another study conducted earlier, which finds that extra pair fertilizations are strongly and positively correlated with local synchrony but there is no significant association with population level synchrony.|$|E
25|$|In {{the animal}} world, some species, {{including}} birds such as swans and fish such as Neolamprologus pulcher, once believed monogamous, are now known {{to engage in}} extra-pair copulations. One example of extra-pair fertilization (EPF) in birds is the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> warblers. Though it is a socially monogamous species, {{both males and females}} engage in EPF.|$|R
50|$|The blackthroat (Calliope obscura), {{also known}} as the black-throated robin or <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> robin, is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae. It breeds in north-central China but its {{wintering}} grounds are uncertain. It has been recorded as a vagrant in northwest Thailand. Its natural habitat is bamboo thickets within coniferous forest at altitudes of 3000-3,400 metres. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
5|$|The area is {{populated}} with white-tailed deer, grouse and raccoon. The deer population, which was extirpated by 1895, has rebounded since re-introduction by park ranger Arthur Woody during the 1930s. Over 100 {{species of birds}} inhabit or migrate through the area, including native songbirds such as the Canada <b>warbler,</b> Blackburnian, <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue,</b> <b>black-throated</b> green and chestnut-sided warblers. Also found are hawks, owls, woodpeckers, kinglets, thrushes, vireos, cuckoos, phoebes, chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, brown creepers, wrens, tanagers, grosbeaks, indigo buntings and red crossbills. Migratory species are present during the late spring and early fall, making the area popular among birdwatchers The creeks surrounding the lake are rich with species of salamanders.|$|R
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless is much lower in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it {{listens to the}} post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing {{at the beginning and}} the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E
5000|$|The song is a trill {{similar to}} the {{chipping}} sparrow's (Spizella passerina), except that the red-backed junco's (see below) song is more complex, {{similar to that of}} the yellow-eyed junco (Junco phaeonotus). The call also resembles that of the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> warbler's, which is a member of the New World warbler family. Calls include tick sounds and very high-pitched tinkling chips. [...] It is known among bird language practitioners as an excellent bird to study for learning [...] "bird language." ...|$|R

25|$|Tordoff {{was born}} in Mechanicville, New York on February 8, 1923, the {{youngest}} and the only son among the six children of Harry and Ethel Tordoff. With his father, a stone mason, he learned to hunt and fish, and {{spent much of his}} free time observing birds and other wildlife, afield with his dog. He raised ring-necked pheasants for release, and started studying wildlife management, which he expected to be his career. He later said that shooting a <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> and admiring its unusual plumage sparked an interest in ornithology.|$|E
25|$|Birds are an {{especially}} {{important component of}} the local ecosystem for historical reasons. Bicknell's thrush was first observed on the summit of Slide in 1881; today, after recently being declared a separate species from the gray-cheeked thrush, it is considered a threatened species and its summer breeding areas in the boreal forests important enough that in 1999, New York governor George Pataki augmented the wilderness status of the area with Bird Conservation Area status that applied to almost all the Catskill High Peaks. This protects not only the Bicknell's but other species such as the black-and-white warbler, <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler,</b> Canada warbler, red-eyed vireo, Louisiana waterthrush, scarlet tanager and rose-breasted grosbeak, some of which require large unbroken forests to nest.|$|E
25|$|Birdwatching {{activity}} peaks {{each spring}} (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can {{pass through the}} park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the northern parula, American redstart, prairie warbler, hooded warbler, palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, common yellowthroat, yellow-rumped warbler, ovenbird, northern waterthrush, <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler,</b> blackpoll warbler, and Cape May warbler, with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as cattle egrets are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and buttonwood trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation {{in the fall of}} 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, songs vocalized in post-breeding season {{act as a}} cue to conspecific eavesdroppers. In <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> warblers, males {{that have}} bred and {{reproduced}} successfully sing to their offspring to influence their vocal development, while males that have failed to reproduce usually abandon the nests and stay silent. The post-breeding song therefore inadvertently informs the unsuccessful males of particular habitats that have a higher likelihood of reproductive success. The social communication by vocalization provides a shortcut to locating high quality habitats and saves the trouble of directly assessing various vegetation structures.|$|R
500|$|Bird watchers have {{observed}} over 200 {{species of birds}} in the park, including the great blue heron, northern harrier, white-throated sparrow and highly sensitive species which are rare as breeding birds in Pennsylvania such as northern goshawk and yellow-bellied flycatcher. The state park and forest {{are part of the}} larger Pennsylvania Important Bird Area (IBA) #42, which encompasses [...] The Pennsylvania Audubon Society has designated the IBA as a globally important habitats for the conservation of bird populations. The IBA is home to Swainson's thrush and ruffed grouse, the state bird of Pennsylvania. Other notable passerine species found in the park and IBA include blue-headed and red-eyed vireos, Acadian and least flycatchers. Breeding warblers in the park include both northern and Louisiana waterthrushes, as well as Blackburnian, <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue,</b> <b>black-throated</b> green, Canada, magnolia, mourning, Nashville, and yellow-rumped.|$|R
500|$|The {{sheltered}} open {{waters of}} the bay and the outlying chain of keys provide resting areas for migrating birds on their way between North American, the Caribbean islands, and South America. Many southbound land birds stop in the fall at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, {{just north of the}} park on Key Biscayne, before venturing across the open waters of Biscayne Bay. [...] Northbound spring migrants do likewise on Elliott Key. Most of the small passerine migrants are warblers, with ovenbirds, palm warblers, American redstarts, common yellowthroats, prairie warblers, worm-eating warblers and <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> warblers accounting for the majority. Migrant raptors include short-tailed hawks, sharp-shinned hawks, merlins, peregrine falcons and swallow-tailed kites, while bald eagles and ospreys nest in the park. Both white-tailed and red-tailed tropicbirds are seen in the park, as are American flamingos, with some of the latter probably escaped captive birds.|$|R
500|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> is a migratory species. It breeds in {{temperate}} mature deciduous forests {{or mixed}} coniferous-deciduous forest {{with a thick}} understory. The species is often found in hilly and mountainous regions in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. In late summer, it migrates to the tropical wooded and scrub habitats in the Greater Antilles for wintering. Along the migration route, the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> {{can be observed in}} habitats such as parks and gardens.|$|E
500|$|The German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin {{described}} the <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> in 1789. Its species name is the Latin adjective caerulescens meaning [...] "turning blue".|$|E
500|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> is a monogamous species. Its {{breeding}} season usually begins in May and ends in July. As a songbird, the male <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> <b>warbler</b> attracts a female’s attention by singing a soft melody. He then follows the female {{while she is}} foraging or searching for nesting sites. As soon as the female stops to rest, the male droops his wings slightly, stretches his head forward and up, opens his bill, and faces the female. The female also makes displays to the male by vibrating her wings. In response, the male mounts the female for 2–3 seconds and then flies off.|$|E
40|$|Although {{predicted}} {{some time}} ago, {{there has been}} little success in demonstrating that the overall fitness of migratory birds depends on the combined influences of their experiences over all seasons. We used stable carbon isotope signatures (delta 13 C) in the claws of migrating <b>black-throated</b> <b>blue</b> warblers Dendroica caerulescens to infer their wintering habitats and investigated whether winter habitat selection can be linked to condition during migration. Resident bird species with low delta 13 C corresponded to selection of more mesic habitats, and migrating birds with low delta 13 C were in better condition than conspecifics with higher delta 13 C signatures. These findings concur with empirical observations on the wintering grounds, where dominants (mostly males) tend to exclude subordinates from mesic areas (considered to be high-quality habitats). We believe that variation in condition during migration {{may be one of the}} key factors determining differences in arrival times and condition at the breeding areas, which in turn have a major influence on reproductive success...|$|R
40|$|Although fat {{deposition}} during stopover in migrating passerine birds {{has been}} extensively studied, changes in lean mass during refuelling are not well understood. I used quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) analysis to measure the deposition of fat and lean mass for both recaptured and single capture migrant passerines in spring and fall at Long Point, Ontario. Both the recapture analysis and single capture regression analysis indicated a substantial contribution of lean mass to overall increases in total body mass. Some {{of the variation in}} the relative deposition of fat and lean mass was explained by sex, age and season. I then used radio-telemetry and mark-recapture analysis to investigate whether QMR affects a bird’s magnetic compass or stopover duration. QMR had no effect on stopover duration and departure orientation of migrating <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Blue</b> Warblers. QMR slightly increased stopover duration in adult White-throated Sparrows in fall, but not in spring. My study demonstrates that lean mass deposition is substantial and dynamic, and that QMR is a safe and effective technology to study fuel deposition of migrant birds in the field...|$|R
