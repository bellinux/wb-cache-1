50|$|Thai food {{is known}} for its {{enthusiastic}} use of fresh (rather than dried) herbs and spices. Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, galangal, coriander/cilantro, lemon grass, shallots, pepper, kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, fish sauce, and chilies. Palm sugar, made from the sap of certain Borassus palms, is used to sweeten dishes while lime and tamarind contribute sour notes. Meats used in Thai cuisine are usually pork and chicken, and also duck, beef, and water buffalo. Goat and mutton are rarely eaten except by Muslim Thais. Game, such as wild boar, deer and wild birds, are now less common due to loss of habitat, the introduction of modern methods of intensive animal farming in the 1960s, and the rise of agribusinesses, such as Thai Charoen Pokphand Foods, in the 1980s. Traditionally, fish, crustaceans, and shellfish {{play an important role in}} the diet of Thai people. Anna Leonowens (of The King and I fame) observed in her book The English Governess at the Siamese Court (1870):"The stream is rich in fish of excellent quality and flavour, such as is found in most of the great rivers of Asia; and is especially noted for its platoo, a kind of sardine, so abundant and cheap that it forms a common seasoning to the labourer's bowl of rice."Freshwater varieties come from the many rivers, lakes, ponds, and paddy fields inland, and seafood from the tropical seas of the southern half of the country. Some species, such as the giant river prawn, need brackish water as juveniles but live out their lives in freshwater once mature. Aquaculture of species such as Nile tilapia, catfish, tiger prawns, and <b>blood</b> <b>cockles,</b> now generates a large portion of the seafood sold in, and exported from Thailand.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to clarify the feeding biology of the blood cockle (Anadara granosa). We {{collected}} <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> from 8 stations in the Matang mangrove estuary of Malaysia in July and August 2010. The digestive tube contents of the specimens were stained with Congo red and observed under a light microscope. The results showed <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> take in particles containing cellulose as well as phytoplankton such as diatoms. As <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> in estuaries are known to exhibit cellulolytic enzyme activity in their digestive gland, the present results indicate <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> in estuaries feed on litter supplied from mangrove forests and terrestrial plants...|$|E
30|$|Normally, <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> exhibit {{resistance}} to low salinity. For example, from a salt-resistance experiment on <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> by Davenport and Wong (1986), the cockles showed a clear shell-closing reaction upon exposure to salinity {{of less than}} 19  PSU; about 50  % of them survived at salinity of 16  PSU, while the mortality rate was 100  % upon exposure to salinity of lower than 10  PSU for a week. Therefore, mass mortality of <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> is extremely likely upon exposure to a low-salinity environment of lower than 10  PSU {{for a week or}} more, which affects the filtering activity that cockles can exhibit at a salinity level of 16 – 19  PSU.|$|E
30|$|In this study, the {{salinity}} {{changes at}} the aquaculture ground during the mass mortality event are unknown because we did not measure this variable. However, it is highly likely that a reduction in salinity due to flooding occurred because there was precipitation of over 30  mm/day on four days in mid-February, {{as shown by the}} weather data. However, to explain this mass mortality event of <b>blood</b> <b>cockles,</b> multiple factors should be considered. Normally, in the spawning season, bivalves have lower environmental resistance, which is known to be potentially associated with death due to even weak environmental stress (Cho and Jeong 2005). Thus, even though the salinity decrease in the aquaculture ground alone may not have been sufficiently severe to kill the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles,</b> we should consider the possibility that the spawning season made these organisms particularly susceptible. In addition, from observation of the digestive gland tissue, many of the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> collected in mid-March had no food in the digestive duct, and the epithelial cells in the tubes were also flattened. Thus, it is suggested that the state of the digestive gland made it difficult to absorb nutrients. As such, it is suggested that the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> cultured in the Selangor region were debilitated by reproductive activity, and died due to a feeding disorder that was also influenced by low salinity due to the flooding in mid-February.|$|E

The purpose {{of this research was}} to synthesize precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) of <b>blood</b> <b>cockle</b> shell by varying the type of solvent and acid carbonation time. A number of <b>blood</b> <b>cockle</b> shell powder was calcined at 900 oC temperature to calcium oxide (CaO) form, then CaO was dissolved into some acid solvents (HNO 3, HCl, and CH 3 COOH). Furthermore, the carbonation process with carbonation time variation 30, 60, and 90 minutes.

30|$|A mass {{mortality}} {{event of}} <b>blood</b> <b>cockles,</b> Anadara granosa, occurred in aquaculture ground in Selangor in mid-February 2012. To identify {{factors contributing to}} this event, we estimated the changes in survival rate and population density of the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> using data from field surveys carried out in late-January and mid-March, 2012. In addition, blood cockle samples were used for histological observation of various tissues with a light microscope. Furthermore, we examined the environmental factors {{that seemed to be}} involved in this mass mortality event using environmental data obtained in two surveys and weather data for the Selangor region from late-January to mid-March 2012. As a result of the field surveys and the histological observation, the mortality was estimated to be 30  % over, and the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> were shown to be in the spawning season at this time of year. In addition, numerous individuals collected in mid-March had no food in the digestive duct, which suggested low food availability. Precipitation data for the Selangor region showed rainfall of 30  mm/day over four days in mid-February, which suggested an impact of freshwater flooding from rivers on the aquaculture ground. Normally, the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> are tolerant to low-salinity environments. However, the fact that the flooding and associated environmental changes occurred, when the population was debilitated by reproductive activity, may have led to the mass mortality event in association with low food availability.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Bandon Bay (Surat Thani Province) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} coastal areas in southern Thailand.

Many individuals collected in mid-March were also in a state of poor feeding. In addition, precipitation data showed four days on which there was rainfall of over 30  mm/day in mid-February, so the blood cockle aquaculture ground close to an estuary was considered to have been adversely impacted by flooding from nearby rivers. These results suggest that some individuals had been debilitated by reproductive activity, which led to their death upon low food availability due to low salinity and related environmental changes caused by flooding.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} pH on larval development in larval Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and <b>blood</b> <b>cockle</b> (Arca inflata Reeve). The larvae were reared at pH 8. 2 (control), 7. 9, 7. 6, or 7. 3 beginning 30 min or 24 h post fertilization. Exposure to lower pH during early embryonic development inhibited larval shell formation in both species. Compared with the control, larvae took longer to reach the D-veliger stage when reared under pH 7. 6 and 7. 3. Exposure to lower pH immediately after fertilization resulted in significantly delayed shell formation in the Pacific oyster larvae at pH 7. 3 and <b>blood</b> <b>cockle</b> larvae at pH 7. 6 and 7. 3. However, when exposure was delayed until 24 h post fertilization, shell formation was only inhibited in <b>blood</b> <b>cockle</b> larvae reared at pH 7. 3.

30|$|The {{harvest of}} <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> in the Selangor region {{remained}} {{at less than}} 10, 000  tons in the early 2000 s, but increased after 2008, with a record harvest of about 40, 000  tons in 2010. Factors thought to have contributed to this increase include the arrival of new aqua farmers and expansion of the area used for aquaculture. However, the harvest has declined to about 25, 000  tons since 2011, with its level remaining unstable (Alias Man, unpublished data). Factors that may {{have had an impact}} on this have been identified, such as overcrowding cockles, sediment deterioration, flooding, and sediment disturbance in aquaculture grounds, but the main factor remains unidentified. Against this background, we heard from fishermen that a mass mortality event of <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> occurred at our monitoring site for aquaculture research in Selangor in mid-February, 2012. To achieve stable production in bivalve aquaculture, it is important to measure and control factors that negatively influence the growth of these organisms. Therefore, in order to clarify the causes of this mass mortality event, we examined the survival rate and population density of the cockles, alongside an environmental survey using data from field surveys that were conducted before and after the mass mortality event; in addition, the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> were observed histologically after the two sampling periods, and the obtained results were discussed along with data on the weather at around this time.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{collected}} biological and environmental data {{to clarify the}} cause of a mass mortality event that occurred in a blood cockle aquaculture ground in the Selangor region of Malaysia in mid-February, 2012. The shell length results also supported the occurrence of the mass mortality event in mid-February, because both shell length histograms of the living individuals in late-January and the dead individuals in mid-March were approximately the same. Thus, this result suggests that the dead individuals spawned while they were alive. Additionally, it became clear that many individuals had fed poorly in mid-March and that the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> were in the spawning season when this mass mortality event occurred. Among the survived individuals in mid-March, we observed a phenomenon that epithelial cells in the digestive tube were flattened in severe cases; it is suggesting the <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> had a no feeding period caused both physiological and environmental factors (Ellis et al. 1998), and there was a high probability that nutrient absorption was difficult by the histological condition, so even in such individuals who had fed well recently. On the other hand, certain parasites, such as Nematopsis sp., trematode sporocysts, and Turbellaria, were reported to have been isolated from <b>blood</b> <b>cockles</b> along the coast of the Malacca Strait by Uddin et al. (2011). However, in the present study, no parasitic infections were found in the observed tissues in the gonads, digestive gland, mantle, and gill. Therefore, we considered it unlikely for parasitism {{to be related to the}} mass mortality event. In addition, we considered improper functioning of those tissues to be unlikely to be related to this event. Furthermore, abnormal water quality, such as the occurrence of a high water temperature, low salinity, and hypoxic water, was not observed in the aquaculture ground during the field surveys. The chlorophyll-a content was also appropriate for bivalves, which indicates that phytoplankton was present during the studied periods.|$|E
