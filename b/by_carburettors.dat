50|$|The {{design has}} been used for two-stroke, four-stroke, and diesel engines, {{air-cooled}} and water-cooled, and aspirated <b>by</b> both <b>carburettors</b> and turbochargers.|$|R
50|$|When Brillié {{left the}} company, {{at the end}} of 1903, the design was changed to use a more {{conventional}} pressed-steel ladder-frame chassis, the engine was moved to the front, and the fuel-distributor was replaced <b>by</b> a <b>carburettor,</b> but they still kept the opposed-piston engine design.|$|R
50|$|The first {{moves towards}} a petrol straight-five {{were made by}} Rover, which {{developed}} a 2.5-litre five-cylinder engine in 1966 {{as a means of}} supplying more power for the Rover P6 saloon. However the design, fuelled <b>by</b> three <b>carburettors</b> (one of a different size to the other pair), suffered fuelling problems and did not proceed past the prototype stage.|$|R
50|$|The 100-series engine has a {{three main}} bearing crankshaft, a cast iron block and an {{aluminium}} cylinder head with an integrated intake manifold. The camshaft {{was placed in}} the block and was chain-driven. There were 2 overhead valves per cylinder, actuated by an OHV valvetrain. The first versions were fed <b>by</b> a <b>carburettor,</b> but single point fuel injection with catalyst would appear in the early '90s to fulfill anti-pollution laws, along with distributorless electronic ignition.|$|R
5000|$|The Giulietta was {{launched}} in November 1977. Two models were available: Giulietta 1.3, with an oversquare [...] 1357 cc engine, and Giulietta 1.6, with a [...] 1570 cc engine, both Alfa Romeo Twin Cam inline-fours fed <b>by</b> two twin-choke <b>carburettors.</b>|$|R
50|$|From 1898 Sutton held patents for {{improvements}} in combustion engine <b>carburettors.</b> <b>By</b> 1899 {{he had built}} and driven the Sutton Autocar, {{one of the first}} motor cars in Australia. In 1903 Sutton was {{a founding member of the}} Automobile Club of Victoria.|$|R
50|$|The owner-driver's needs seem to {{have been}} {{considered}} very carefully and all but one of them met, that is the difficulty in draining engine oil which requires the removal of an undershield. A minor point was that the rear tappet plate was made difficult to remove <b>by</b> having <b>carburettor</b> control springs anchored on it. A few drops of oil {{two or three times a}} week and tappets will run for a long time without shake otherwise they soon become noisy.|$|R
5000|$|Small {{improvements}} {{had been}} made to last year's [...] engine including the replacement of the S.U. <b>carburettor</b> <b>by</b> a Solex instrument which increased the power output to [...] at 4000 rpm and improved the smoothness of running. The engine coolant now had a pump and thermostatically controlled bypass.|$|R
25|$|The most {{fundamental}} change {{made to the}} later Merlin (60, 70, 80 and 100 series) and Griffon engines (60 and 80 series) was the incorporation of a two-stage, two-speed supercharger, which provided a considerable increase in power, especially at higher altitudes. Two-stage refers {{to the use of}} two impellers on a common driveshaft, constituting two superchargers in series. As air was drawn through the air intake, fuel was pumped into the airstream <b>by</b> the <b>carburettor.</b> The first-stage impeller compressed the air-fuel mixture and this was then fed to the smaller second-stage impeller which further compressed the mixture.|$|R
50|$|Johnson {{sold the}} project to Bristol—who used the car {{as the basis for}} an assault on Le Mans that would bring them several class wins in the mid-1950s—and focused the company on {{research}} and development (R&D) engineering. He eventually sold it to Zenith Carburettor Ltd, which was then purchased <b>by</b> Solex, another <b>carburettor</b> firm.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in March 1954, the 220a {{was a more}} luxurious and up-scale {{version of}} the W120 model 180 with a {{wheelbase}} stretched by 170 mm. 100 mm of that increase in length was necessary to accommodate the longer straight-6 M180 engine taken from the W187 model 220, that in this application delivered [...] fed <b>by</b> a single <b>carburettor.</b>|$|R
25|$|Like its predecessor, the three-litre engine had a {{cast iron}} block, an {{aluminium}} head with hemispherical combustion chambers, two valves per cylinder, angled 90° and timed by directly acting, chain driven dual overhead camshafts. Fed <b>by</b> a twin-choke <b>carburettor,</b> it developed , {{sent to the}} rear wheels through a 4-speed all-synchromesh gearbox with a column-mounted shifter as on the 6C 2500.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} cars of the time, bodies were getting more luxurious and hence heavier. Five weeks after their 30 August 1935 {{announcement}} of minor improvements to their Speed 20 Alvis {{announced a new}} additional 3½-litre 26hp engine fed <b>by</b> triple SU <b>carburettors</b> naming it 3½-litre SA. Twelve months later given a strengthened engine with seven main bearings it was renamed Speed 25.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} an {{evolution}} of Maserati's own all-aluminium, four overhead cam V8, fed <b>by</b> four Weber <b>carburettors.</b> The automatic transmission initially used was a three-speed Borg-Warner automatic transmission, soon {{replaced by a}} Chrysler A727 [...] "Torqueflite" [...] gearbox. Manual gearboxes were ZF S5 five speeds. When leaving the factory all 4200 Maseratis were originally fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72).|$|R
5000|$|The car's wetliner, {{aluminium}} cylinder block, six-cylinder 1991 cc {{engine was}} the unit first {{offered by the}} company in the AC 16, back in 1922. However, by 1947 the engine was fed <b>by</b> three SU <b>carburettors,</b> and boasted a power output of , increased again in 1951 to [...] which was {{more than twice the}} [...] claimed for engine's original commercial application.|$|R
5000|$|To prevent erratic {{and sudden}} {{movements}} of the piston it is damped by light oil (20W Grade) in a dashpot, which requires periodic replenishment. The damping is asymmetrical: it heavily resists upwards movement of the piston. This serves as the equivalent of an [...] "accelerator pump" [...] on traditional <b>carburettors</b> <b>by</b> temporarily increasing the speed of air through the venturi, thus increasing {{the richness of the}} mixture.|$|R
50|$|In September 1975, {{in order}} to meet the new {{emissions}} regulations for that year, the L26 was replaced by the larger yet 2753 cc L28 six-cylinder. <b>By</b> October the <b>carburettors</b> in the L20 were replaced with electronic fuel injection and the engine was now dubbed L20E. Because of the difficulty in meeting the emissions regulations, the twin-carburetted engines were all discontinued. The 1,770 cc L18 replaced the G18 in the lineup.|$|R
50|$|Models {{manufactured}} from 1931 to 1945 had a recommended petrol-to-oil mix {{of either}} 8:1 or 10:1. From 1942 models specified a 10:1 mix which was specified up to 1979. After that date a 25:1 mix was specified, which was again {{changed for the}} introduction of the models 125 and 170, but these engines with the 50:1 mix soon failed, and British Seagull again specified 25:1. This relatively high percentage of oil was necessary due to the way the crankshaft bushings worked. Early engines used short bushings, and later ones used longer bushings, hence the changes in oil requirement. The longer bushings were, in fact, used from 1967 onwards, and the engines from 1967 to 1979 can be used on the 25:1 mix <b>by</b> making <b>carburettor</b> adjustments.|$|R
2500|$|The CB400T Dream was {{introduced}} in 1977. It has alloy and steel compound Comstar wheels. Fuelling is provided <b>by</b> 32mm Keihin <b>carburettors.</b> Braking is provided by a single hydraulic front disc and an expanding rear drum. The Dream was also available in a [...] CB250T version {{to comply with the}} UK learner regulations at the time. Period reviews stated the bike was a mid-range tourer with rider comfort being considered one of its best attributes.|$|R
50|$|The Kabinenroller {{was based}} on a central {{monocoque}} tub made from pressed steel sheet and tubular steel. The tub tapered upward from front to rear with a bulkhead at the back. The bulkhead supported a tubular steel subframe and acted as the firewall. The subframe supported the engine and the rear suspension. The engine cover was hinged to the monocoque structure. The fuel tank was {{in the top of the}} engine cover and fed the <b>carburettor</b> <b>by</b> gravity.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} a 6-cylinder in-line engine of 4,887 ccm with an {{overhead}} inlet and side exhaust valves. Fed <b>by</b> two SU <b>carburettors,</b> unofficially the engine generates approximately 180 HP. {{according to a}} test drive of the Silver Wraith {{carried out by the}} British automobile magazine, The Autocar. The engine is the biggest in the Silver Wraith models and from 1954 when it was bored out from 4,257 ccm. In 1959 the engine was discontinued from the Rolls-Royce engine programme after 19 years.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} hydraulic dampers to go into production was the Telesco Shock Absorber, exhibited at the 1912 Olympia Motor Show and marketed <b>by</b> Polyrhoe <b>Carburettors</b> Ltd. This contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers' mentioned above, but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction. The Telesco unit was fitted at the rear end of the leaf spring, {{in place of the}} rear spring to chassis mount, so that it formed part of the springing system, albeit a hydraulically damped part. This layout was presumably selected as it was easy to apply to existing vehicles, but it meant the hydraulic damping was not applied to the action of the main leaf spring, but only to the action of the auxiliary spring in the unit itself.|$|R
50|$|The Super Dream {{was fitted}} with a four stroke, air-cooled, twin {{cylinder}} engine. It had three valves per cylinder, two inlet and one exhaust, operated by a chain driven over head camshaft. Ignition was provided by capacitor discharge ignition (CDI). It utilized a 360° crank layout similar to many traditional British parallel twins albeit with tandem balance-shafts in the front {{left side of the}} engine to reduce unwanted vibrations. It used a six-speed transmission with a chain final drive. Fuelling was provided <b>by</b> twin Keihin <b>carburettors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Europe {{and rest}} of the world markets, the Big Valve [...] "Europa Special" [...] version was {{aspirated}} <b>by</b> Dell'Orto <b>carburettors</b> version of the same engine; in addition it also offered a new Renault five-speed (Type 365) gearbox option. It weighed 740 kg (1631 lb), Motor magazine famously tested a UK Special to a top speed of 123 mi/h km/h, did 0 - 60 mph in 6.6 seconds, and ran the 1/4 mile in 14.9 sec. This at a time when all road tests were carried out with both a driver and passenger, with only the driver on board the 0 - 60 mph time would have been well under 6 seconds, a phenomenal performance for the period. In the US version of the Europa Special, where the Federalized version of the Big Valve had already been introduced earlier in the Twin Cam model, the only changes were larger brakes and the optional 5 speed transmission which would become standard on the special in 1974.|$|R
50|$|The Duocar was {{described}} at the 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show, with a JAP 8 hp V-twin providing the power, with fan assisted cooling. A large diameter external flywheel was fitted {{to smooth the}} engine which was fed <b>by</b> a Lukin <b>carburettor</b> operated <b>by</b> an accelerator pedal. The steering had a cable and worm drive. It used Hans Renold chain drive to the countershaft, and the drive to the rear wheels was by 1.125inch armoured V-belts. Gearing was provided by expanding pulleys to the back axle, with the back axle moving to ensure no slack in the drive belts.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to sedan and coupé models, Holden in Australia produced the Gemini as a three-door station wagon and three-door panel van, which {{were derived from}} the Opel Kadett C Caravan and Vauxhall Chevette wagon, with Isuzu Gemini front panels. The panel van's side panels came from the Bedford Chevanne. The Australian Holden Gemini was fitted with an Isuzu G161Z petrol engine, although 1979 and later models were available with a 1.8-litre 8-valve SOHC diesel engine (4FB1). The more common G161Z was a 1.6-liter 8-valve SOHC fed <b>by</b> a Nikki <b>carburettor.</b> The Holden Gemini was Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for 1975.|$|R
50|$|Like its predecessor, the three-litre engine had a {{cast iron}} block, an {{aluminium}} head with hemispherical combustion chambers, two valves per cylinder, angled 90° and timed by directly acting, chain driven dual overhead camshafts. Fed <b>by</b> a twin-choke <b>carburettor,</b> it developed , {{sent to the}} rear wheels through a 4-speed all-synchromesh gearbox with a column-mounted shifter as on the 6C 2500.The car used unit body construction, had a wheelbase of 3.05 m and a dry weight of 1,400 kg. The all-independent suspension was of the double wishbone type with coil springs upfront, and trailing arm type with transverse torsion bars at the rear.|$|R
500|$|Early in its development, the Merlin engine's lack of fuel {{injection}} meant that Spitfires and Hurricanes, unlike the Bf 109E, {{were unable to}} simply nose down into a steep dive. This meant a Luftwaffe fighter could simply [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape an attack, leaving the Spitfire behind, as its fuel was {{forced out of the}} <b>carburettor</b> <b>by</b> negative [...] "g". RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. The carburettor was adopted because, as Sir Stanley Hooker explained, it [...] "increased the performance of the supercharger and thereby increased the power of the engine".|$|R
5000|$|The 4.2-litre XK {{engine of}} the 420/Sovereign was fitted with the {{straight}} port cylinder head and 3/8-inch lift cams. Compression ratios of 7:1, 8:1 and 9:1 could be specified according to local fuel quality, the difference being obtained by varying the crown design of the pistons. The engine was fed <b>by</b> just two <b>carburettors</b> and developed a claimed [...] gross at 5,500 rpm, which was [...] less than the triple-carburettor version in the 420G and E-Type. The maximum torque of the engine at 283 lbft Nm was virtually {{the same as that}} of the triple-carburettor version yet was achieved at 3,750 rpm rather than 4,000 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{introduced}} initially in 1.1-litre {{single overhead cam}} and 1.4-litre dual overhead cam versions. Because Honda stopped providing Rover with engines {{after the end of}} their relationship, but well before the BMW takeover, an enlargement of the K Series design to 1.6 and 1.8 litres was carried out. This was done by using larger diameter cylinder liners and also increasing the stroke. The change required a block redesign with the removal of the cylinder block's top deck and a change from [...] "wet" [...] liners to [...] "damp" [...] liners. [...] The plastic throttle body fitted to the engine until 2001 was manufactured <b>by</b> the SU <b>Carburettor</b> company. They also included aluminium and larger sized bodies.|$|R
5000|$|The drive {{package on}} the Royal Star Venture {{includes}} a liquid-cooled [...] (referred to as 1,300 cc) V4 engine fed <b>by</b> four <b>carburettors</b> - one per cylinder - primed by a manually operated push-pull choke. It has four valves per cylinder, overhead camshafts, and shim-over bucket valves. Bore x stroke is 79 x 66 mm (3.11 x 2.60 in) with a compression ratio of 10:1. The five-speed, overdrive transmission {{is part of}} the engine case and the engine and transmission share the same oil. The drive shaft and final drive assembly are built into {{the left side of the}} double-sided swing arm. Swing arm motion is damped by a mono shock mounted in the center of the frame. The clutch is of the wet plate design and is hydraulically activated by the left hand lever.The gear selection lever is typically mounted on the left side and is the rocker-style, heel-and-toe type sitting above a spring-loaded, hinged foot board. The rear brake pedal on the opposite (right) side also sits above a spring-loaded, hinged foot board. There are foot boards fitted for the pillion passenger that are also hinged but not spring-loaded, so they can be upright when not in use or dropped to the horizontal position for riding.|$|R
50|$|The 1914 {{model was}} {{exhibited}} at the 1913 Olympia show, the company still named Swift Cycle Co Ltd, at which time its price was £140 'fully equipped'. For 1914 the car changed over to steel channel frame carried on four semi-elliptic leaf springs. The car had worm and sector steering, and the brakes comprised a pedal operated transmission brake and two hand-lever operated external contracting brakes. The two-seater body had the seats slightly staggered, and the specification included the hood, adjustable windscreen, a boot, mudguards, running boards, and an acetylene lighting set. The engine remained at 970cc and was fitted with an Eisemann magneto and Claudel carburettor. The clutch was a leather lined cone type fitted into the external flywheel. The petrol tank was placed behind the dashboard and fed the <b>carburettor</b> <b>by</b> gravity.|$|R
50|$|From 1968 the Thunderbolt {{benefited from}} a number of minor {{improvements}} including a longer kick start to make starting easier and metal tank badges to replace the earlier plastic ones, which had a tendency to crack. An Amal Concentric Float carburettor dealt with the problems of fuel flooding experienced with the earlier monobloc <b>carburettor,</b> <b>by</b> having the float bowl arranged centrally around (concentric with, hence the name) the main jet to remove the sensitivity to fuel surge inherent in all the earlier designs. Stiffer suspension improved cornering but poor quality control and production problems on the BSA assembly line with later models led to oil leaks and rusting parts which damaged the reputation of the Thunderbolt, which was already struggling to compete against the emerging Japanese motorcycles of the early 1970s (such as the Honda CB750) and production ended in 1972.|$|R
5000|$|At launch {{two models}} were available, 33 1.3 and 33 1.5 Quadrifoglio Oro. [...] Both engines were SOHC boxers fed <b>by</b> a twin-choke <b>carburettor,</b> carried {{over from the}} Alfasud along with its 5-speed gearbox: a 1,350 cc {{developing}} [...] at 6,000 rpm, and a 1,490 cc developing [...] at 5,800 rpm. Unlike on the Alfasud, fifth gear acted like an overdrive gear and top speed was reached in fourth.The luxurious 1.5 Quadrifoglio Oro (Gold Cloverleaf in the UK) was distinguished by a silver grille, two-tone paintwork (metallic paint upper body separated by a brown tape from the dark brown lower body and bumpers) and clear front turn indicator lenses outside; by beige Texalfa leatherette/cloth interior, a woodtone steering wheel and shifter knob inside. Standard equipment included bronze tinted glass, headlight wipers, passenger side wing mirror and a trip computer.|$|R
50|$|The 3.7 L (3670 cc/223 in³) engine, {{designed}} by Tadek Marek, was a double overhead cam straight-6, with cylinder head and block of cast R.R.50 aluminium alloy, a {{further development of}} the earlier engine. The engine was prone to overheating initially, but the 240 hp (179 kW) produced <b>by</b> the twin-SU <b>carburettor</b> version made buyers forgive this unfortunate trait. Servo-assisted disc brakes were fitted all round: early 11.5 in Dunlops were replaced by Girlings. The independent front suspension used ball-jointed wishbones, coil springs and rack-and-pinion steering. The live rear axle also used coil springs and was located by a Watt's linkage. The normal final-drive ratio for British and European use was 3.54:1: in the United States the ratio was usually 3.77. Customers wanting a car with an especially high top speed could choose a 3.31:1 ratio.|$|R
50|$|The biggest design {{difference}} between the Morris-designed C-Series and the Austin-penned A- and B-Series engines was {{the position of the}} camshaft - on the right-hand side of the block (as viewed from within the car) rather than the left, although all three engines had their inlet and exhaust ports on the left. This meant that the C-Series didn't require the compound ports of the Austin engines, which were partly required to provide space in the cylinder head for the pushrods. This should, theoretically, have provided the C-Series with superior 'breathing' and efficiency than the smaller engines since it still used the same highly-effective heart-shaped Combustion chamber design by Harry Weslake. However this was undermined <b>by</b> the <b>carburettor</b> arrangements; instead of a dedicated intake manifold the C-Series was designed with an intake gallery cast into the cylinder head, with the carburettor(s) attached directly to the intake(s). This design was chosen for ease of construction and to allow different carburettor arrangements to be easily accommodated and the design also eliminated carburetor icing. Each cylinder had a generous-sized intake port from the gallery but the restrictive shape of the gallery and the carburettor port(s) severely limited the engine's maximum power output and speed, as did the four-bearing crankshaft. There appear to have been plans for a twin cam variant of the C-Series, using the same basic head and valve design as the DOHC B-Series in the MGA Twin Cam for use in Rileys and Wolseleys. This explains the relatively unadventurous design of the standard engine. However the reliability problems of the twin-cam B-Series and the mixed reception of the Riley Pathfinder discouraged BMC from pursuing this development and work stopped in 1955.|$|R
