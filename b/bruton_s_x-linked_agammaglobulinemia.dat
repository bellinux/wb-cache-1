40|$|To the Editor: The {{letter of}} Kornfeld et al. raises two {{separate}} questions: Do some patients with mild hypogammaglobulinemia have defects {{in the same}} gene as patients with typical <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinemia?</b> Can you predict the clinical phenotype of <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> {{on the basis of}} the site of the Btk mutation? Our paper answers the first question by demonstrating that a mutation in Btk can cause an atypical or mild form of <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinemia.</b> The results described by Kornfeld et al. support this conclusion. We did not address the second question; however, emerging data indicate that the genotype-phenotype correlations in <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> are likely to be complex. Within a single family, such as our patient's family, some members may have mild <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> whereas others have more typical disease, indicating that factors other than the site of mutation influence the phenotype. These factors may include past infections, the age of the patient, and the treatment received, as well as modifying or compensatory genetic factors. As suggested by Kornfeld et al., mutations in non-kinase domains of Btk have been associated with typical <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> and mutations in the kinase domain have been associated with mild disease 1. However, we would argue that both the site and the type of Btk mutation make important contributions to the phenotype. We were surprised to find that a high percentage of our patients with mild disease lacked the Btk transcript in cell lines transformed by Epstein-Barr virus or neutrophils. To identify the mutations in these patients, we screened genomic DNA by single-strand conformation polymorphism using polymerase-chain-reaction primers that flanked each of the 19 exons of Btk 2. The patients lacking the transcript were found to have premature stop codons as the result of either substitutions in a single base pair or small insertions or deletions associated with frame shifts. It is well recognized that premature stop codons in some genes, for example β-globin, are associated with a failure to accumulate transcript in the cytoplasm 3. As was true with Kornfeld's patients, some but not all of our patients with premature stop codons had mild disease 4. We interpret this finding as indicating that in the absence of Btk, other kinases may partially compensate. This leads to the further observation that some mutant Btk proteins may be more deleterious to B-cell proliferation or survival than a complete absence of Btk. As gene therapy and other sophisticated treatments for <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> are contemplated, it becomes increasingly important to understand how all the factors that contribute to the phenotype for this deficiency interact...|$|R

Recent studies have shown that Btk is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated upon B cell antigen receptor (BCR) stimulation. To elucidate the functions of this kinase, we examined BCR signaling ofDT 40 B cells deficient in Btk. Tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC) [...] ~/ 2 upon receptor stimulation was significantly reduced in the mutant cells, leading to the loss of both BCK-coupled phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and calcium mobilization. Pleckstrin homology and Src-homology 2 domains of Btk were required for PLC-~/ 2 activation.

40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} {{encoding}} Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (btk) cause the B cell deficiency diseases <b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinemia</b> (XLA) in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency (xid) in mice. In vivo and {{in vitro studies}} indicate that the BTK protein is essential for B cell survival, cell cycle progression, and proliferation in response to B cell antigen receptor (BCR) stimulation. BCR stimulation leads to the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor (NF) -�B, which in turn regulates genes controlling B cell growth. We now demonstrate that a null mutation in btk known to cause the xid phenotype prevents BCR-induced activation of NF-�B. This defect can be rescued by reconstitution with wild-type BTK. This mutation also interferes with BCR-directed activation of I�B kinase (IKK), which normally targets the NF-�B inhibitor I�B � for degradation.

40|$|<b>X-linked</b> <b>agammaglobulinemia,</b> a B cell immunodeficiency, {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene. The absence of a functional Btk protein leads to a failure of B cell differentiation and antibody production. B cell receptor stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of the Btk protein and it is, therefore, likely that Btk is involved in B cell receptor signaling. As a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Btk is likely to interact with several proteins {{within the context of}} a signal transduction pathway. To understand such interactions, we have generated glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins corresponding to different domains of the human Btk protein. We have identified a 120 -kD protein present in human B cells as being bound by the SH 3 domain of Btk and which, after B cell receptor stimulation, is one of the major substrates of tyrosine phosphorylation. We have shown that this 120 -kD protein is the protein product of c-cbl, a protooncogene, which is known to be phosphorylated in response to T cell receptor stimulation and to interact with several other tyrosine kinases. Association of the SH 3 domain of Btk with p 12 (Y bt provides evidence for an analogous role for p 120 'bt in B cell signaling pathways.
