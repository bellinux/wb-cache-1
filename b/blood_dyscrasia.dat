50|$|Mephenytoin (marketed as Mesantoin by Novartis) is a hydantoin, {{used as an}} anticonvulsant. It was {{introduced}} approximately 10 years after phenytoin, in the late 1940s. The significant metabolite of mephenytoin is nirvanol (5-ethyl-5-phenylhydantoin), {{which was the first}} hydantoin (briefly used as a hypnotic). However, nirvanol is quite toxic and mephenytoin was only considered after other less toxic anticonvulsants had failed. It can cause potentially fatal <b>blood</b> <b>dyscrasia</b> in 1% of patients.|$|E

50|$|Side {{effects of}} {{phenylbutazone}} {{are similar to}} those of other NSAIDs. Overdose or prolonged use can cause gastrointestinal ulcers, <b>blood</b> <b>dyscrasia,</b> kidney damage (primarily dose-dependant renal papillary necrosis), oral lesions if given by mouth, and internal hemorrhage. This is especially pronounced in young, ill, or stressed horses which are less able to metabolize the drug. Effects of GI damage include edema of the legs and belly secondary to leakage of blood proteins into the intestines, resulting in decreased appetite, excessive thirst, weight loss, weakness, and in advanced stages, kidney failure and death.|$|E
50|$|The {{administration}} of antimalarials to {{large numbers of}} individuals {{with little or no}} preliminary screening could result in significant toxicity as nearly all antimalarials in common use can occasionally cause serious adverse events. For example, the widespread use of 8-aminoquinolines in areas where Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is common carries the risk of precipitating episodes of haemolysis. Few MDA projects have reported specifically on adverse events. No life-threatening outcomes have been reported {{as a result of an}} MDA but a rare serious adverse event such as a <b>blood</b> <b>dyscrasia</b> would probably not have been detected without active surveillance for adverse events which was not reported in any of the studies. There is a theoretical risk that {{administration of}} antimalarial drugs during the course of MDAs to women in the first trimester of pregnancy, some of whom may not know that they are pregnant, could lead to foetal abnormalities. The benefit of malaria control has to be weighed against potential problems. Hence MDA is likely to be only used in areas with very high malaria endemicity.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{case reports}} of {{haemorrhage}} into the carpal tunnel causing median nerve compression were extraneural and {{usually associated with}} a <b>blood</b> <b>dyscrasia</b> although Watson Jones reported one due to direct trauma and Hayden recorded spontaneous intraneural haemorrhage not associated with trauma. We describe a case of intraneural haemorrhage, involving the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, due to indirect trauma and not associated with a <b>blood</b> <b>dyscrasia.</b> The condition required intraneural decompression to obtain relief. The symtom-complex of carpal tunnel syndrome is classically described as episodic paraesthesiae {{in the distribution of}} the median nerve in the hand; worse nocturnally and often relieved by shaking the affected extremity. The condition may progress to cause weakness of thumb abduction and opposition and eventually atrophy of the thenar muscles. The pathophysiology of this syndrome was suggested by Marie and Foix in 1913, who reported a case wit...|$|E

Investigations revealed hairy cell leukaemia, and 'hairy cells' were detected in the synovial fluid. No other cause for this arthritis was found, and we consider the <b>blood</b> <b>dyscrasia</b> to be the likely cause. This case demonstrates a hitherto unreported association between arthritis and hairy cell leukaemia...|$|E
30|$|Ultrasound CNB can be {{difficult}} in patients with severe psychiatric disorders, which makes them impossible to collaborate on, and is contraindicated in some cases of severe <b>blood</b> <b>dyscrasia.</b> However, there are {{no statistically significant differences}} in haematoma formation between patients taking anticoagulant therapy daily and non-treated patients [11]. Thus, {{it is not necessary to}} stop that therapy to perform an ultrasound CNB. Expert radiologists can perform biopsies of very deep lesions located close to the pectoral muscle in large breasts. Obtaining a biopsy in some patients with silicone implants can be also contraindicated.|$|E
40|$|A {{patient with}} a 28 -year history of {{schizophrenia}} was treated {{with a wide range}} of antipsychotic medications since diagnosis. She had experienced no clinically significant symptomatic relief until she commenced treatment on clozapine. Her psychotic symptoms, self care, and general sense of well-being improved significantly. After 6 years of successful treatment, she developed leukopenia and clozapine was discontinued.

The extent of old and recent manifestations of haemorrhage in the membranes increased in a statistically significant relation with their size and thickness.

Furthermore, a group of inherited cerebral small vessel diseases linked to ICH have been reported recently and the number of these forms is increasing. The presence of leukoaraiosis, lacunar infarcts and microbleeds has been suggested to indicate a higher risk for cerebral hemorrhage. In recent years, MRI and neuroimaging techniques contributed to the understanding and the diagnosis of this disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|Primary Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) {{infection}} in children is common and frequently asymptomatic. While symptomatic patients typically present with features of infectious mononucleosis, a rare complication of primary EBV is acute acalculous cholecystitis. A 6 year old previously healthy boy presented with 6 days of low-grade fevers, non-bloody non-bilious vomiting, and periumbilical pain. Based on clinical, laboratory, and radiographic evidence, {{the patient was}} diagnosed with acute acalculous cholecystitis due to a primary EBV infection. The patient improved with supportive therapy and remained asymptomatic at follow-up. Overall, clinicians should consider EBV {{infection in}} the setting of multi-organ disease and <b>blood</b> <b>dyscrasia.</b> Furthermore, while the pathogenesis of EBV cholecystitis is still unclear, {{it is important to note}} that these patients may improve with supportive treatment and do not require surgical intervention...|$|E
