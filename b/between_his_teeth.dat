25|$|One night Jacob {{climbs up}} and jumps each car, while {{the train is}} moving, to August's room, {{carrying}} a knife <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> intending to kill August. However, he backs out, leaving the knife on August's pillow, and returns to his car, only to find no one there but Queenie. He then realizes that Walter and Camel were red-lighted, {{and he was also}} supposed to have been.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} style of South African popular music to emerge was pennywhistle jive (later known as kwela). Black cattle-herders had long played a three-holed reed flute, {{adopting}} a six-holed flute {{when they moved}} to the cities. Willard Cele is usually credited with creating pennywhistle by placing the six-holed flute <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> at an angle. Cele spawned a legion of imitators and fans, especially after appearing in the 1951 film The Magic Garden.|$|E

2500|$|After {{dinner with}} his staff that night, Jackson fell asleep again, with a biscuit clenched <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth.</b> Upon {{awakening}} he announced, [...] "Now, gentlemen, let us at once to bed, and rise with the dawn, and see if tomorrow we can do something."

2500|$|Everton {{fans have}} given him the {{nickname}} [...] "Tiny Tim" [...] after the Charles Dickens character because he is slightly short and slim. He has made a corner flag goal celebration his [...] "trademark". The celebration, where Cahill pretends to trade punches with the corner flag while putting the Everton badge <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> was first seen in the 2005–06 season. On 2 March 2008, Cahill controversially celebrated his goal in the 3–1 home victory of Portsmouth by crossing his wrists {{as if he had}} been handcuffed. This was in reference to the recent jailing of his brother, Sean, for Grievous Bodily Harm and Cahill apologised. Cahill dedicated his winning goal in a Europa League game against BATE Borisov to the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Samoa, miming rowing a canoe after scoring in the second half of the match in Belarus.|$|E
2500|$|Chief American Horse was {{examined}} by the two surgeons. One of them pulled the chief’s hands away, and the intestines dropped out. [...] "Tell him he will die before next morning," [...] said the surgeon. The surgeons worked futilely to close his stomach wound, and Chief American Horse refused morphine preferring to clench a stick <b>between</b> <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> to hide any sign of pain or emotions and thus he bravely and stolidly died. Chief American Horse lingered until 6:00a.m. and confirmed that the tribes were scattering and were becoming discouraged by war. [...] "He appeared satisfied that {{the lives of his}} squaws and children were spared." [...] Dr. McGillicuddy, who attended the dying chief, said that he was cheerful to the last and manifested the utmost affection for his wives and children. [...] American Horse’s squaws and children were allowed to remain on the battleground after the dusky hero’s death, and subsequently fell into the hands of their own people. [...] Even [...] "Ute John" [...] respected the cold clay of the brave Sioux leader, and his corpse was not subjected to the scalping process." [...] Crook was most gentle in his assurances to all of them that no further harm should come if they went along peacefully, and it only required a day or two of kind treatment to make them feel very much at home.|$|E
