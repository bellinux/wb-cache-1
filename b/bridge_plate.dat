40|$|The {{standard}} {{operative treatment}} of Lisfranc fracture dislocations currently consists of open reduction and transarticular fixation. Recently, <b>bridge</b> <b>plating</b> {{has been used}} more often. Using joint spanning, the reduced fracture dislocation is temporary stabilized to minimize articular damage. The present study describes the outcomes of patients treated with <b>bridge</b> <b>plating</b> after tarsometatarsal fracture dislocations compared with transarticular screw fixation. A retrospective cohort study was performed. Patients with an isolated tarsometatarsal injury who had been treated operatively from June 2000 to October 2013 were included. The primary functional outcome was measured using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot score and the Foot Function Index. The secondary outcome was patient satisfaction, which was measured using the EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire and a visual analog scale. A total of 34 patients were included. <b>Bridge</b> <b>plating</b> was used in 21 patients. In 13 patients, Kirschner wires or transarticular screws or a combination were used. The median follow-up period was 49 (interquartile range 18 to 89) months. The implants were removed in 10 of 13 patients in the transarticular group and 17 of 21 patients in the <b>bridge</b> <b>plating</b> group. The incidence of wound complications was comparable in both groups. The median American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score was lower in the transarticular group (77 versus 66). The Foot Function Index score was 18 in both groups. Patient satisfaction was 90 % in the <b>bridge</b> <b>plating</b> group and 80 % in the transarticular group. <b>Bridge</b> <b>plating</b> for Lisfranc injuries led to at least similar results compared with transarticular fixation in terms of functional outcomes and patient satisfaction. Longer follow-up is necessary {{to determine whether the}} prevention of secondary damage to the articular surface leads to less post-traumatic arthritis and better functional outcome...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A prospective, {{randomized}} {{study to}} compare patients with closed, multi-fragmented tibial diaphyseal fractures treated {{using one of}} two fixation methods undertaken during minimally invasive surgery: nonreamed interlocking intramedullary nails or <b>bridging</b> <b>plates.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients were studied; 22 patients were treated with <b>bridging</b> <b>plates,</b> 23 with interlocking nails without reaming. All fractures were Type B and C (according to the AO classification). RESULTS: Clinical and radiographic healing occurred in all cases. No cases of infection occurred. The healing time for patients who received nails was longer (4. 32 weeks on average) than the healing time for those who received plates (P = 0. 026). No significant differences were observed between the two methods regarding ankle mobility for patients in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The healing time was shorter with the <b>bridging</b> <b>plate</b> technique, although no significant functional differences were found...|$|R

40|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of highly comminuted distal radius fractures in elderly patients with poor bone quality or in polytrauma patients is a technical challenge. Aim: The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the results of temporary <b>bridge</b> <b>plating</b> in these patients. Method: A retrospective review using data from 21 patients undergoing temporary <b>bridge</b> <b>plating</b> in our department was performed. All patients had fractures classified as type C 3 by AO classification. To achieve optimal joint surface reduction, supplementary fixation was necessary in all cases. Data was evaluated for clinical and radiological parameters. Results: Radiological results showed a mean post-operative positive ulnar variance of 1. 2 mm, mean radial inclination of 18 0; and a mean radial length of 10 mm.

40|$|Contemporary locking plates promote {{biological}} fixation through indirect reduction {{techniques and}} by elevating the plate from the bone. They have improved fixation strength in osteoporotic bone. Periarticular locking plates are rapidly being adopted for <b>bridge</b> <b>plating</b> of periprosthetic femur fractures. When these plates {{are used for}} indirect reduction and <b>bridge</b> <b>plating</b> osteosynthesis, fracture union occurs by secondary bone healing with callus formation which is stimulated by interfragmentary motion. In two patients with similar periprosthetic femur fractures treated with periarticular locking plates one fracture healed by ample callus formation while the other resulted in a non-union and had no callus formation six months post-operatively. The case, which progressed to secondar y bone healing with callus formation, exhibited varus migration {{as a result of}} loss of fixation. The non-union case retained stable fixation. The difference in outcome may indicate that callus formation was promoted by interfragmentary motion secondary to loss of fixation. Conversely, in absence of fixation failure, callus formation was suppressed by stable fixation with a stiff locking plate construct which reduced interfragmentary motion. These observations suggest that locked plating constructs should be sufficiently flexible when applied for <b>bridge</b> <b>plating</b> of comminuted fractures to promote callus formation...|$|R

40|$|OBJETIVO: comparar a rigidez de três diferentes montagens de placa em ponte com a da haste intramedular bloqueada, em tíbias de cadáveres com fratura tipo C. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: vinte tíbias humanas captadas de cadáveres, submetidas à fratura do tipo C; quinze fixadas com placas em ponte, divididas em 03 grupos, de acordo com o tamanho das placas (10, 14 e 18 furos) e 05 fixadas com hastes intramedulares bloqueadas. Todas as tíbias foram expostas a cargas progressivas e semelhantes. Foram medidos os deslocamentos de ambos fragmentos (proximal e distal), nos planos sagital, coronal e axial do espaço, {{conforme}} incremento gradual de carga. RESULTADOS: tíbias fixadas com placas em ponte de 18 furos apresentam um comportamento biomecânico semelhante às fixadas com haste intramedular bloqueada. CONCLUSÕES: Em fraturas do tipo C em tíbias há maior mobilidade do segmento ósseo distal no plano coronal, quando a fratura é fixada com placas em ponte de 14 e 18 furos que quando fixada com haste intramedular bloqueada sem fresagem. Apesar dessa maior mobilidade, os movimentos relativos entre os fragmentos fraturários nos GHB e GP 18 tendem a ser semelhantes entre si. OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} stiffness {{of three different}} assemblies of <b>bridging</b> <b>plates</b> with intramedullary locking nails in cadaveric models of tibial fractures type C. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty cadaveric tibias subjected to type C fractures; fifteen were fixed with the <b>bridging</b> <b>plate</b> technique and divided into three groups, according to the plate size (10, 14 and 18 holes), and five were fixed with intramedullary nail. All the tibias were exposed to similar and progressive loads. Dislocation of both fragments (proximal and distal) was measured on three planes (sagittal, coronal and axial), as the load was increased. RESULTS: tibias fixed with the 18 hole <b>bridging</b> <b>plate</b> have the same biomechanical behavior of tibias fixed with intramedullary locking nails. CONCLUSIONS: In type C tibial fractures, there is more mobility at the distal segment on the coronal plane when the fracture is fixed with 14 and 18 holes <b>bridging</b> <b>plates</b> as compared to fractures fixed with non-reamed intramedullary locking nails. Even with this mobility, the relative movements between the fragments at GHB and GP 18 seem to be similar...|$|R
