40|$|David Chaum has {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} blind signamres, {{an extension of the}} concept of digital signatures, as a way to pro-tect the identity and privacy of a user in electronic payment and service networks. <b>Blind</b> <b>signatures</b> also prevent so-called ‘dossier creation ” about users by organizations. While the concept of <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> still allows authorities to distinguish between valid and false data, it prevents these authoriries from connecting specific data or actions to specific users. With the growing emphasis on the protection of the privacy of user data and user actions in electronic systems, blind signa-tures seem to be a perfect solution. This paper however, dis-cusses a problemaric aspect of <b>blind</b> <b>signatures,</b> showing that this perfect solution can potentially lead to perfect crime. We use a real crime case as an example...|$|R
50|$|David Chaum is {{associated}} with the invention of <b>Blind</b> <b>Signature</b> Technology. In 1982, while studying at the University of California, Berkeley, Chaum wrote a paper describing the technological advancements to public and private key technology in order to create this <b>Blind</b> <b>Signature</b> Technology. Chaum's <b>Blind</b> <b>Signature</b> Technology was designed to ensure the complete privacy of users who conduct online transactions. Chaum was concerned with the public nature and open access to online payments and personal information. He then proposed to construct a system of cryptographic protocols in which a bank or the government would be unable to trace personal payments conducted online. This technology became fully implemented in 1990 through Chaum's company, DigiCash.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>signature</b> schemes can be {{implemented}} using a number of common public key signing schemes, for instance RSA and DSA. To perform such a signature, the message is first [...] "blinded", typically by combining it in some way with a random [...] "blinding factor". The blinded message is passed to a signer, who then signs it using a standard signing algorithm. The resulting message, along with the blinding factor, can be later verified against the signer's public key. In some <b>blind</b> <b>signature</b> schemes, such as RSA, it is even possible to remove the blinding factor from the signature before it is verified. In these schemes, the final output (message/signature) of the <b>blind</b> <b>signature</b> scheme is identical {{to that of the}} normal signing protocol.|$|E
50|$|In {{cryptography}} a <b>blind</b> <b>signature</b> as {{introduced by}} David Chaum {{is a form}} of digital signature in which the content of a message is disguised (blinded) before it is signed. The resulting <b>blind</b> <b>signature</b> can be publicly verified against the original, unblinded message {{in the manner of a}} regular digital signature. Blind signatures are typically employed in privacy-related protocols where the signer and message author are different parties.

40|$|Round-optimal <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> are {{notoriously}} hard to construct in the stan-dard model, {{especially in the}} malicious-signer model, where blindness must hold un-der adversarially chosen keys. This is substantiated by several impossibility results. The only construction that can be termed theoretically efficient, by Garg and Gupta (Eurocrypt’ 14), requires complexity leveraging, inducing an exponential security loss. We present a construction of practically efficient round-optimal <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> in the standard model. It is conceptually simple and builds on the recent structure-preserving signatures on equivalence classes (SPS-EQ) from Asiacrypt’ 14. While the traditional notion of blindness follows from standard assumptions, we prove blindness under adversarially chosen keys under an interactive variant of DDH. However, we neither require non-uniform assumptions nor complexity leveraging. We then show how to extend our construction to partially <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> and to <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> on message vectors, which yield a construction of one-show anonymous credentials a ̀ la “anonymous credentials light ” (CCS’ 13) in the standard model. Furthermore, we give the first SPS-EQ construction under non-interactive assump-tions and show how SPS-EQ schemes imply conventional structure-preserving signa-tures, which allows us to apply optimality results for the latter to SPS-EQ...|$|R

50|$|Anonymous {{credential}} {{systems are}} related to the concept of untraceable or anonymous payments. In this important work, Chaum presents a new cryptographic primitive, <b>blind</b> <b>signature</b> protocols. In such a scheme the signer neither learns the message he signs, nor the signature the recipient obtains for his message. Blind signatures are an important building block of many privacy-sensitive applications, such as anonymous payments, voting, and credentials. The original idea for an anonymous credential system was derived from blind signatures, but relied on a trusted party for credential transfer—the translation from one pseudonym to another. The <b>blind</b> <b>signature</b> scheme introduced by Chaum was based on RSA signatures and based on the discrete logarithm problem can be used for constructing anonymous credential systems.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>signatures</b> make {{anonymity}} {{a reality}} in digital cash systems. However, when deployed in digital cash systems such as eCash, <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> raise such drawbacks as bad scalability and unfair anonymity. In this thesis, efforts have been done to combine digital signatures and a mechanism called "money-exchange" found in NetCash {{to build a new}} digital cash system. In the new system, two forms of digital cash are introduced: digital notes and digital coins. "Money-exchange" is extended to permit cash exchange from one form to the other. At the side of the digital cash issuer, at least two databases are maintained to detect double-spending. The new digital cash system is secure due to its deployment of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms. The combination of <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> and the extended money-exchange mechanism offers unconditional and fair anonymity, and it makes the system more scalable with the regards to the number of clients served...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} new system modeled after Nymble. Like Nymble, our scheme {{provides}} a privacy-preserving analog of IP address blocking for anonymizing networks. However, unlike Nymble, the user in our scheme need not trust third parties to maintain their anonymity. We achieve this while avoiding the use of trusted hardware and without requiring an offline credential issuing authority to guarantee that users do not obtain multiple credentials. We use zero-knowledge proofs to reduce the capabilities of colluding third parties, and introduce a new cryptographic technique that we call verifier-efficient restricted <b>blind</b> <b>signatures,</b> or VERBS, to maintain efficiency. Signature verification with our VERBS are 1 – 2 orders of magnitude faster than existing restricted <b>blind</b> <b>signatures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{intruder}} deduction {{problem for}} an electronic purse protocol with <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> is considered.

The whole deductive power of the intruder is modeled as a sequent calculus that, modulo this rewriting system, deals with <b>blind</b> <b>signatures.</b> It is proved that the associative-commutative (AC) equality of the algebraic theory can be decided in polynomial time, provided a strategy to avoid distributivity law between the AC operators is adopted. Moreover, it is also shown that the intruder deduction problem can be reduced in polynomial time to the elementary deduction problem for this equational theory. ...|$|R

40|$|Formal {{methods have}} proved to be very useful for {{analyzing}} cryptographic protocols. However, most existing techniques apply to the case of abstract encryption schemes and pairing. In this paper, we consider more complex, less studied cryptographic primitives like CBC encryption and <b>blind</b> <b>signatures.</b> This leads us to introduce a new fragment of Horn clauses. We show decidability of this fragment using a combination of several resolution strategies. As a consequence, we obtain a new decidability result for a class of cryptographic protocols (with an unbounded number of sessions and a bounded number of nonces) that may use for example CBC encryption and <b>blind</b> <b>signatures.</b> We apply this result to fix the Needham-Schroeder symmetric key authentication protocol, which is known to be flawed when CBC mode is used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{complexity}} of voting procedures make it challenging {{to design a}} secure electronic voting system. In many proposals, {{the security of the}} system relies mainly on a black box voting machine. Meanwhile, the most advanced proposals base their security arguments on (complicated) cryptographic protocols, e. g. <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> or homomorphic schemes. Canard and Traoré proposed cryptographic primitives dedicated to provide anonymous services using smart cards. Among these primitives, list signatures are specially suitable for e-voting, as they provide specific properties such as multiple vote detection. Moreover, unlike <b>blind</b> <b>signatures,</b> they do not involve a signing authority during the ballot creation process. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present an e-voting system, whose security relies on a tamper-resistant smart card embedding several cryptographic primitives, including list signatures...|$|R

50|$|Chaum {{published}} {{the idea of}} anonymous electronic money in a 1983 paper; eCash software on the user's local computer stored money in a digital format, cryptographically signed by a bank. The user could spend the digital money at any shop accepting eCash, without having {{to open an account}} with the vendor first, or transmitting credit card numbers. Security was ensured by public key digital signature schemes. The RSA <b>blind</b> <b>signatures</b> achieved unlinkability between withdrawal and spend transactions. Depending on the payment transactions, one distinguishes between on-line and off-line electronic cash: If the payee has to contact a third party (e.g., the bank or the credit-card company acting as an acquirer) before accepting a payment, the system is called an on-line system. In 1990, Chaum together with Moni Naor proposed the first off-line e-cash system, which was also based on <b>blind</b> <b>signatures.</b>|$|R

Chaum's proposal allowed users to obtain digital currency from a bank and spend it {{in a manner that is}} untraceable by the bank or any other party. In 1988, he extended this idea (with Amos Fiat and Moni Naor) to allow offline transactions that enable detection of double-spending.|$|E
50|$|This attack {{works because}} in this <b>blind</b> <b>signature</b> scheme the signer signs the message directly. By contrast, in an {{unblinded}} signature scheme the signer would typically use a padding scheme (e.g. by instead signing {{the result of a}} cryptographic hash function applied to the message, instead of signing the message itself), however since the signer does not know the actual message, any padding scheme would produce an incorrect value when unblinded. Due to this multiplicative property of RSA, the same key should never be used for both encryption and signing purposes.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{symbolic}} definition of election verifiability for electronic voting protocols {{in the context}} of the applied pi calculus. Our definition is given in terms of boolean tests which can be performed on the data produced by an election. The definition distinguishes three aspects of verifiability, which we call individual verifiability, universal verifiability, and eligibility verifiability. It also allows us to determine precisely which aspects of the system’s hardware and software must be trusted for the purpose of election verifiability. In contrast with earlier work our definition is compatible with a large class of electronic voting schemes, including those based on <b>blind</b> <b>signatures,</b> homomorphic encryption and mixnets. We demonstrate the applicability of our formalism by analysing two protocols which have been deployed; namely Helios 2. 0, which is based on homomorphic encryption, and Civitas, which uses mixnets.

In the process, we identify and address some subtle issues which were not considered by previous constructions and (informal) security definitions. Our second main contribution is a generic construction that yields practical schemes with round-optimal signing and constant-size signatures.
