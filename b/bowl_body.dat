40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of an environmental cue (bowl size) on food consumption and to examine the influence of exercise on that relationship. This cross-sectional study included 286 college students attending a large Midwestern University. Upon arrival at an ice cream social for university students, participants were randomly given a small (8 oz) or large (12 oz) bowl and a 4 -page survey addressing exercise and eating habits. At the social, participants were invited to dish themselves as much ice cream as they wanted and the amount consumed was determined by weighing the bowl with ice cream before and after consumption using a scale that measured to the nearest tenth of a gram. Participants who were provided the 12 oz bowl scooped and consumed significantly more ice cream than the participants provided the 8 oz bowl. Regular exercisers consumed more ice cream than non-regular exercisers regardless of statistical control for <b>bowl</b> size and <b>body</b> weight. Those participants who reported exercising previously that day also consumed significantly more ice cream than those not previously exercising; however, the difference was no longer significant after controlling for <b>bowl</b> size and <b>body</b> weight. Environment cues significantly influence food consumption and exercise may also influence subsequent food consumption but further research is needed...|$|R

5000|$|Jardine {{instructed}} his fast bowlers, {{most notably}} Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, to <b>bowl</b> at the <b>bodies</b> of the Australian batsmen, {{with the goal}} of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats, thus providing easy catches to a stacked leg-side field. Jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it [...] "leg theory" [...] but it was widely disparaged by its opponents, who dubbed it [...] "Bodyline" [...] (from [...] "on the line of the body"). Although England decisively won the Ashes 4-1, Bodyline caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo-Australian relations, and the MCC eventually changed the Laws of cricket to curtail the number of leg side fielders.|$|R

40|$|Figure 1 : Twenty-four {{deformable}} objects {{fall into}} a <b>bowl.</b> Each <b>body</b> is evolved asynchronously with ε =. 5. We propose a series of techniques for hybridizing implicit and semi-implicit time integration methods {{in a manner that}} retains much of the speed of the implicit method without sacrificing all of the higher quality vibrations one obtains with methods that handle elastic forces explicitly. We propose our scheme in the context of asynchronous methods, where different parts of the mesh are evolved at different time steps. Whereas traditional asynchronous methods evolve each element independently, we partition all of our elements into two groups: one group evolved at the frame rate using a fully implicit scheme, and another group which takes a number of substeps per frame using a scheme that is implicit on damping forces and explicit on the elastic forces. This allows for a straightforward coupling between the implicit and semi-implicit methods at frame boundaries for added stability. As has been stressed by various authors, asynchronous schemes take some of the pressure off of mesh generation, allowing time evolution to remain efficient {{even in the face of}} sliver elements. Finally, we propose a force distributing projection method which allows one to redistribute the forces felt on boundaries between implicit and semi-implicit regions of the mesh in a manner that yields improved visual fidelity...|$|R

5|$|Lindwall and Miller were {{groundbreaking}} fast bowlers, {{with high}} pace {{and the ability}} to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the batsmen. Prior to World War II, pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely <b>bowled</b> at the <b>body.</b> England were yet to develop similar bowlers, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At one stage, the Australian short-pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton, something that provoked great controversy. Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece, at averages of 19.62 and 23.33 respectively, while the injury-prone Miller took 13 at 23.15. For England, the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton, who scored 562 runs at 62.44. Washbrook (356 runs at 50.85) was the only other player to average beyond 45.|$|R
40|$|The use of micro-scale {{metallic}} pins {{in small}} engineering devices poses numerous problems {{due to their}} physical size and the dominant forces which act on micro-scale objects. Assembly of devices with micro-scale parts is problematic because the components are below the practical threshold of unaided human manipulation and most robotic manipulation. The use of tweezers and microscopes to aid human assembly is possible but challenging because the micro-scale pins tend to adhere to tweezers. Previous work has found that vibratory feeder-bowls provide a feasible means to singulate and orient micro-scale pins by overcoming the adhesive forces that plague other manipulation techniques. ^ The analysis and prediction {{of the behavior of}} vibratory feeder bowls for micro-scale components has previously been limited to two dimensions. To advance the understanding of vibratory feeder bowls for micro-pins, a three dimensional simulation has been developed that predicts the pin capture rates {{as a function of the}} physical properties of the feeder <b>bowl</b> and <b>bodies.</b> This model is based on an impulse-momentum contact model and it incorporates traditional macro-scale forces such as gravity, air-drag, and friction as well as micro-scale interactions such as magnetic and electrostatic forces. In comparison to prior experimental pin capture rates, the three dimensional simulation produced more accurate results than the existing two dimensional simulation. Finally, the simulation was used to conduct a parametric study to characterize the effects that varying system parameters have on the performance of the feeder bowl. ...|$|R
5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often <b>bowl</b> at the <b>body.</b> England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|R
40|$|Waterpipes, {{commonly}} referred to as hookah, shisha and narghile, have been used for centuries and are a relatively simple apparatus composed of a head, <b>body,</b> <b>bowl,</b> hose and a mouthpiece. The bottom of the head consists of a series of holes which allow smoke to pass into the body of the waterpipe. The body of the waterpipe is submerged in the bowl which contains water. The hose exits {{from the top of the}} bowl and is not submerged in the water. A mouthpiece is attached to the end of the hose which is used by the smoker to inhale the smoke. Moist tobacco, a herbal mixture or another substance is placed into the head of the waterpipe and is burned by a piece of charcoal which rests on top of the tobacco, usually separated by a piece of aluminum foil.

40|$|Housing conditions, body weight, leg {{problems}} and pain influence behaviour of broilers. Apart {{from the physical}} ability, {{little is known about}} the motivation to perform behaviour. The distinction between motivation and ability is relevant as a lack of motivation has consequences for the interpretation of, e. g. the observed immobility in terms of compromised welfare. A runway experiment with fast growing broilers was conducted to investigate the influence of sex and type of feed on motivation and ability to walk for a food reward (mealworm) without depriving the birds from feed before testing. Twenty-four males and 24 females fed with two types of feed, conventional or free-range (less energy and protein) feed, were individually tested in a 2 m long runway from four to seven weeks of age. Five bowls were placed in the runway, one at every 40 cm. Three sessions were applied within 1 week (1) control session: each bowl contained one mealworm; (2) frustration session: the first four bowls were empty, the last bowl contained five mealworms, and (3) obstacle session: each bowl contained one mealworm and 10 cm high obstacles were placed between the <b>bowls.</b> Weekly, <b>body</b> weight and feed consumption were measured and gait score was assessed of each individual. Over all weeks, birds walked faster in frustration sessions than in control or obstacle sessions and faster in control than in obstacle sessions. Birds sat more in obstacle than in control sessions, indicating that ability to walk was affected by the difficulty of the task. Males walked faster in control and obstacle sessions than females, despite the higher body weight. The number of vocalisations in the runway decreased over time and males vocalised more than females. In both sexes, free-range fed birds vocalised more than conventionally fed birds. Differences between frustration and control sessions and obstacles and control sessions at individual level within a week were also measured, called the motivation and the ability effect. Concluded is that sex and type of feed have effects on different measures in the runway. Male broilers walked faster to a food reward and vocalised more than females. The role of type of feed was ambiguous. It did not influence body weight, walking speed or gait score, but conventionally fed birds sat more and had a higher latency to leave the start box and to reach the last bowl, and free-range fed birds vocalised more. No sex or feed differences were found for the motivation and the ability effect. That means that frustration and obstacles had similar impact on both sexes and both types of feed and that sex differences in walking speed probably were a result of physical differences (males are stronger and bigger) ...|$|R
