In this project we conducted a quantitative research, consisting of a questionnaire based survey. For data processing and interpretation we used SPSS statistical software and Excel. For data analysis, we used the descriptive statistics indicators, and a series of bi-varied analysis for testing some statistical assumptions. Viewed at first with skepticism by the Internet users in Romania, because of the many news about how dangerous the credit card payments are, the online stores have gained much ground and trust in the recent years. Since the study was conducted mainly in the online environment, we can not talk about the representativeness of the sample, only about a trend observed in the studied population. The study helps us understand the population reactions and attitudes regarding the online shopping.

40|$|Organizations gain resources, {{skills and}} {{technologies}} {{to find out}} the ultimate mix of capabilities to be a winner in the competitive market. These are all important factors that need {{to be taken into account}} in organizations operating in today's business environment. So far, there are no significant studies on the organizational capabilities in the field of PSM. The literature review shows that the PSM capabilities need to be studied more comprehensively. This study attempts to reveal and fill this gap by providing the PSM capability matrix that identifies the key PSM capabilities approached from two angles: there are three primary PSM capabilities and nine subcapabilities and, moreover, the individual and organizational PSM capabilities are identified and evaluated. The former refers to the PSM capability matrix of this study which is based on the strategic and operative PSM capabilities that complement the economic ones, while the latter relates to the evaluation of the PSM capabilities, such as the <b>buyer</b> <b>profiles</b> of individual PSM capabilities and the PSMcapability map of the organizational ones. This is a constructive case study. The aim is to define what the purchasing and supply management capabilities are and how they can be evaluated. This study presents a PSM capability matrix to identify and evaluate the capabilities to define capability gaps by comparing the ideal level of PSM capabilities to the realized ones. The research questions are investigated with two case organizations. This study argues that PSM capabilities can be classified into three primary categories with nine sub-categories and, thus, a PSM capability matrix with four evaluation categories can be formed. The <b>buyer</b> <b>profiles</b> are moreover identified to reveal the PSM capability gap. The resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capabilities view (DCV) are used to define the individual and organizational capabilities. The PSM literature is also used to define the capabilities. The key findings of this study are i) the PSM capability matrix to identify the PSM capabilities, ii) the evaluation of the capabilities to define PSM capability gaps and iii) the presentation of the <b>buyer</b> <b>profiles</b> to identify the individual PSM capabilities and to define the organizational PSM capabilities. Dynamic capabilities are also related to the PSM capability gap. If a gap is identified, the organization can renew their PSM capabilities and, thus, create mutual learning and increase their organizational capabilities. And only then, there is potential for dynamic capabilities. Based on this, the purchasing strategy, purchasing policy and procedures should be identified and implemented dynamically...|$|R

40|$|This thesis examines, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of the professional buyer, value perceptions and approaches to relationship management. Research relating to the professional buying process is often hampered by issues relating to commercial confidentiality which impacts upon access to both the pre-sales interaction and also to details of the final terms of trade. Nevertheless, both researchers and practitioners continue to call for a better understanding of the purchaser/supplier interface. This thesis endeavours to penetrate the commercial sensitivity by adopting a qualitative research stance focusing on perceptions of transactional value and buyer behaviour. Support for such an approach is to be found across a range of literature and through this methodology the research aims to provide a more holistic understanding of the professional buying process and the related social interactions and relationships. The study centres on transactions in which the prevailing power balance dictates that there is significant interdependence between the parties. These transactions are characterised by buyers having the incentive to be proactive in their choice of sourcing behaviours, but also by their recognition that they do not possess the power advantage that would allow them to simply dictate the terms of trade. The transactions examined involve rebuys which are seen to include either an upgrade or are otherwise perceived as important by the buyer. In such situations not only are buyers most likely to be focussed on the presales interaction, but literature also shows that they have more flexibility in their choice of relationship management approach. Conducting an initial literature review suggested that buyer behaviour is likely to conform to broad perspectives whose objective is either to appropriate value through building cooperative relationships or to capture value by maximising transactional power. However, in order to better inform the research effort, an exploratory study was undertaken which showed that while the initially expected underpinning principles and practices are evident; they do not fully explain buyer behaviour throughout the transactional process. Through a further review of literature, including that from the emergent school of Service-Dominant Logic (S-DL), consideration of the professional buyer’s value perception appeared to offer a theoretical platform from which those wider aspects of buyer behaviour may be better understood. While S-DL is premised on the notion of value-in-use, and recognises Exchange Value, the exploratory study suggested that a further value perception may be present. Buyer Specific Perception of Value (BSPV), which is phenomenologically determined by the buyer’s wider psychological needs, may be a significant driver of buyer behaviour. In order pursue the research objectives, the adopted method of data collection involved engaging professional buyers in a contemporary interpretation of the ‘Diary - Diary Interview Method’ (after Zimmerman and Wieder, 1977). A web based diary was initially used to collect the thoughts of buyers as they progressed through the pre-sales and immediate post-sale interaction associated with an appropriate transaction. On completion of the diary, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the buyers to develop the themes raised. The interviews were transcribed and the resulting texts examined using Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA), which involved detailed examination of the textual data in an attempt to identify recurrent themes. These themes were then systematically grouped with the intention of developing a deeper and more complete understanding of the text. In order to present the QCA results in a manner that minimises the effects of decomposition and decontextulisation, a graphical format was developed to represent both the buyer’s adopted relationship management approach and also the buyer’s value perceptions. The term ‘Transaction X-Ray’ is used to describe the resulting graphic. The results are initially presented in the form of individual ‘Transaction X-Rays’ then, through the aggregation of individual results that share specific common characteristics, composite ‘X-Rays’ are formed. Analysis of these composite ‘X-Rays’ gives rise to the emergent themes from which the research contribution is derived. The dominant behaviour pattern to appear from the X-Ray analysis is that of the ‘T-Shaped’ Buyer, who characteristically adopts an Adversarial commercial approach to relationship management while simultaneously seeking, to a somewhat limited extent, the means for operational collaboration. Secondary behaviour patterns are also identified. ‘Transaction X-Rays’ also demonstrate that the dominant value perception held by buyers is that of Exchange Value, while also confirming the significance of Buyer Specific Perception of Value (BSPV). Recognising the limitations that are implicit in findings based on empirical evidence derived from a relatively small sample, it is nevertheless suggested that the dominance of the ‘T-shaped’ <b>Buyer</b> <b>profile</b> has a significance that resonates far beyond the confines study. For example, the findings appear counter to the philosophy advanced by those who suggest that by building a relationship, and openly sharing information, the buyer-seller dyad will develop in a manner that would not be possible via Arm’s Length approaches. A further significant contribution made by the thesis relates to the application of Service-Dominant Logic in respect of the Buyer Specific Perception of Value (BSPV) which is created for the buyer, during the pre-sales interaction. This point occurs much earlier in the value co-creation process than has previously been considered within the S-DL School, and identifies a source of value that has been largely ignored within S-DL. The thesis concludes with a discussion as to the significance of the wider findings of the study and suggests where further research may extend the contribution...|$|E
40|$|Introduction With {{too little}} information, {{reasoning}} and learning systems cannot work effectively. Too much information {{can also cause}} the performance of these systems to degrade, in both accuracy and efficiency. It is therefore important to determine what information must be preserved, or more generally, i. e., what information is "relevant". Reasoning about {{what is and is}} not relevant to the goals at hand is ubiquitous in humans. Much of this meta-theoretic reasoning occurs outside of the scope of our introspection; it is believed that over 90 % of the neuronal connections in our brains are inhibitory and serve to discard or suppress inputs received through our senses. Moreover, when we engage in deliberate problemsolving (e. g., writing this introduction, planning a trip, or learning a <b>buyer's</b> <b>profile</b> from credit data), we explicitly reason about the relevance of entities in our conceptualization of the problem.

40|$|Defining the {{potential}} buyers’ needs and requirements should precede any concept design. Most usually, such needs and requirements are defined through statistical analyses. Due to various <b>buyer</b> <b>profiles,</b> {{there are also}} as many various market niches laying down the relevant equipment features.

In that way, systematic identification and validation of potential buyers’ needs and requirements were enabled, leading through a precisely determined procedure to the basic parameters for defining the targeted equipment configuration. In the second phase, the Finite element analysis (FEA) is suggested for the global strength analysis and optimization of the previously selected equipment configuration. In the paper, the suggested methodology was used in the case study dealing with the racing sail boat keel selection and design.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} into the implications of labour market change for a sample of 500 first time home buyers in South Australia (SA). Increased job insecurity is presumed to be impacting on home ownership aspirations and sustainabilty across all income groups but is largely untested. While Australia {{has one of the}} highest casual employment rates among developed countries, SA stands out within the nation as being the most precarious labour market. SA experienced a net loss of 20, 000 full time jobs in the decade 1990 to 2000 with part time and casual employment the main job growth area. Australia’s welfare and housing polices have been predicated for fifty years on the perceived merits of home ownership. Welfare benefits both during employment and on retirement have been based on household investment being extended over time through home ownership. Thus any significant change in purchaser behaviour particularly in the cohort who would traditionally have entered home ownership as early as possible, merits review. The main research instrument was a postal survey of first time homebuyers who made their purchase during the period 1 st January 1999 to 31 st December 2000. The study area included the Adelaide metropolitan area and the rural townships of Mount Gambier, Murray Bridge and Port Lincoln. The survey aimed to determine first time <b>buyer</b> <b>profiles</b> including the nature of their employment, their expectations and attitudes to job security, and if and how, this had influenced the timing, location, borrowing arrangements, or nature of their home purchase.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide clearer {{insights}} into and identify the key consumer behaviour metrics of the lower alcohol category (< 11 per cent ABV) in the UK wine market. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected via an online survey from a sample size of 598 regular UK wine drinkers. To operationalise the study, five research questions were formulated. A highly structured quantitatively directed questionnaire was designed to find the answers to the research questions. Findings – Barriers to a larger uptake of the product category included non-availability of the products, lower quality perceptions, taste issues, lack of awareness, lack of alcohol's “feel effect” and absence of a lower alcohol drinking occasion. Many UK consumers are not yet convinced how/if lower alcohol wine fits into their wine drinking occasions. The lower ABV wine <b>buyer's</b> main <b>profile</b> characteristics are weighted towards females, Millennial and Baby Boomer age generations, mostly mid to low income, who drink mainly white and rosé wines. Lower alcohol on its own is not seen as a big benefit, thus lower ABV wines should be more creatively communicated to sell the benefits. Originality/value – This study contributes to the knowledge base in that it is the first to investigate consumer behaviour metrics as regards lower ABV wine in one of the world's leading markets, in the process providing some important baseline research information on this category. As such it is of value to academic researchers and practitioners alike. Johan Bruwer, Vladimir Jiranek, Lulie Halstead, Anthony Salib...|$|R
5000|$|... "Laminated" [...] or [...] "engineered" [...] logs are a {{different}} approach to log-house building. Full trees or (alternatively) sawn cants (unfinished logs to be further processed) are brought to a mill with a dry kiln, the bark is removed and the trees are sawn into boards usually no more than two inches thick. These boards are then taken to the dry kiln, where (because of their size) they can be dried without causing severe damage to the wood. Timber destined for glue lamination must be brought down below 15% moisture before the lamination process will work, so typically these timbers are dried to around 8-10% moisture. The drying process varies on the species of lumber, but can be done in as little as a week. Once the drying process is complete the planks are sent through a surfacer (or planer), which makes the face of the lumber perfectly smooth. These planks travel to a machine, which then spreads a special glue on the interior boards. Depending on the type of glue and type of mill, {{there are two ways to}} finish the lamination process. One type of glue reacts with radio-frequency (RF) energy to cure the glue in minutes; the other uses a high-pressure clamp, which holds the newly reassembled timbers under pressure for 24 hours. Once the glue has dried, the result is a [...] "log cant" [...] that is slightly larger than the <b>buyer's</b> desired <b>profile.</b> These log cants are run through a profiler, and the end result is a log that is perfectly straight and uniform. Some mills are capable of joining together small timbers by using a combination of face and edge gluing and a process known as finger- jointing. Boards which would be scrap at another mill may be used in the center of a laminated log or beam to minimize waste.|$|R
40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{in the corporate}} world are achieving increasing importance and attention especially in the advent of intense globalization. This is evident from the magnitude and growth of deal values and resultant ‘mega-mergers’ transacted in recent times. As expert advisory are sought in M&A activities to facilitate the undertaking and maximise the value of the transaction, advisory firms begin to play a more significant {{and at the same time}} lucrative role in M&A activities, to the extent of determining the outcome of such projects. Being an area of limited research, it is thus valuable to investigate what M&A advisory firms view as critical success factors to the projects they undertake. Consequently, the research question of “What are the critical success factors for merger & acquisition projects in the view of merger & acquisition advisory firms” has been raised. A list of ten critical success factors for M&A projects is firstly identified from an extensive literature review. These factors are (1) Complete and Clear objectives, goals and scope of the project, (2) Client consultation and acceptance, (3) Project manager’s competence and commitment, (4) Project team member’s competence and commitment, (5) Communication and information sharing and exchange, (6) Project plan development, (7) M&A advisory firm’s resource planning, (8) Time management and tight secrecy, (9) Price evaluation and financing scheme, and (10) Risk management. In an attempt to explore the importance of each factor in the practical context, data have been collected through three research methods. Primarily, the authors conduct a semi-structured interview with six interviewees currently working in three organizations which provide professional services related to M&A projects. Meanwhile, a self-completion questionnaire method is employed, following which a sample of 325 M&A advisory firms based in the U. S. is selected to participate in an online survey. In addition, the authors follow a case study approach based on the three organizations of the six interviewees in order to establish comprehensive knowledge about issues relating to M&A projects. In response to the research question, the findings strongly indicate that seven out of ten factors in the original list have a positive impact, being the factors listed above as (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (8), and (9). On the other hand, it revealed the lesser importance of the other three. In addition, three new factors have been discovered from analyzing the data collected, being (i) Having a number of key potential <b>buyers</b> with suitable <b>profile</b> (ii) Right, correct and complete information and data in the data room, and (iii) The quality of the selling company. While as another outcome of this research, further practical insights have been provided regarding the role of M&A advisory firms, the M&A process, common issues faced by M&A projects and the success criteria for M&A projects. The findings from this research contribute valuable new knowledge to both researchers and practitioners in both project management and M&A fields, while facilitating the achievement of successful M&A projects...|$|R
