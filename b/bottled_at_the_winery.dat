50|$|As {{with most}} Napa Valley wineries, Sutter Home {{was shut down}} during Prohibition. <b>The</b> <b>winery</b> {{remained}} abandoned until 1948, when it was purchased by John and Mario Trinchero, immigrant brothers from New York City whose family had {{been active in the}} Italian wine business. The Trincheros refurbished <b>the</b> <b>winery</b> and began producing Napa Valley wines, initially scraping by making generic jug wines. For years they operated “mom-and-pop” style, selling to their Napa Valley neighbors, who filled their barrels and <b>bottles</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>winery’s</b> back door.|$|R

50|$|Benovia Winery is a family-owned {{producer}} of Pinot noir, Chardonnay, and Zinfandel wines in Santa Rosa, California. Founded in 2005 by Joe Anderson and Mary Dewane, Benovia Winery farms three estate vineyards, including the venerable Cohn Vineyard, which total 71.67 acre and {{are located in}} the Russian River Valley AVA and Sonoma County. To supplement the fruit it harvests each year, Benovia purchases additional grapes from the vintner Martinelli. Benovia's winemaker, Mike Sullivan, is also co-owner and general manager of <b>the</b> <b>winery.</b> Benovia wines are produced and <b>bottled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>winery's</b> winemaking facilities in the Russian River Valley AVA. Annual production is approximately 4,000 cases. Benovia wines are sold direct to customers, as well as distributed to restaurants for resale.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} Benovia’s Pinot noir wines begins with handpicking the fruit during harvest. Workers clip the grapes from the vines in bunches, collect the grape clusters in bins, and transport the fruit to a sorting table. Each cluster is inspected by hand <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sorting table prior to the automated destemming process which separates the berries from the stems. A second sorting area following destemming allows workers to inspect the individual berries and discard unsuitable fruit. The grapes are then transferred to small, open-top fermentors as gently as possible to minimize fruit damage. After a pre-fermentation maceration of five to eight days, the indigenous yeast encourages the longer process of malolactic fermentation. The wines then spend 14 to 16 months aging in French oak barrels before being transferred to <b>the</b> <b>bottling</b> line <b>at</b> Benovia. <b>The</b> <b>winery's</b> Chardonnay grapes follow a similar process. After hand-sorting, the whole clusters are transferred directly to the wine press. Whole cluster pressing helps minimize the amount of malic acid and tannins that naturally exist in the skins, seeds and stems from entering the wine. After settling, the resulting juice (called “must”) is moved to French oak barrels to ferment at a cool temperature for approximately four to six weeks. The barrels are inoculated for malolactic fermentation, and the lees are stirred weekly until the process is complete. This method helps the malolactic fermentation, integrates the new oak, and builds body and structure in the wine.|$|R

50|$|Penfolds Pty. Ltd. {{purchased}} <b>the</b> <b>winery</b> and vineyards in 1912.

In 1898, during James Angus's winemaking years, the vineyards suffered a viral disease that destroyed the vines. New vines were planted and grew until 1962 when soil erosion made them useless. New vineyards were established on other properties around the area to supply the fruit for <b>the</b> <b>winery.</b> Minchinbury Winery became famous for its champagne.

[...] <b>At</b> this time, <b>the</b> Penfolds' son-in-law, Thomas Hyland, was unaware of Mary's fundamental role <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>winery,</b> and he urged his mother-in-law to sell the business as preparation for her retirement.
