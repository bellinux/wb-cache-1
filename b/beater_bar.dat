25|$|Cotton mills get {{the cotton}} shipped {{to them in}} large, 500 pound bales. When the cotton {{comes out of a}} bale, it is all packed {{together}} and still contains vegetable matter. The bale is broken open using a machine with large spikes. It is called an Opener. In order to fluff up the cotton and remove the vegetable matter, the cotton is sent through a picker, or similar machines. The cotton is fed into a machine known as a picker, and gets beaten with a <b>beater</b> <b>bar</b> in order to loosen it up. It is fed through various rollers, which serve to remove the vegetable matter. The cotton, aided by fans, then collects on a screen and gets fed through more rollers till it emerges as a continuous soft fleecy sheet, known as a lap.|$|E
5000|$|In mid-2014, Dyson {{personally}} {{appeared in}} Tokyo to introduce his [...] "360 Eye" [...] robotic vacuum cleaner. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360° scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width <b>beater</b> <b>bar,</b> and user interface via a free iOS or Android app.|$|E
50|$|Upright vacuum {{cleaners}} are {{popular in the}} United States, Britain and numerous Commonwealth countries, but very unusual in Continental Europe. They {{take the form of}} a cleaning head, onto which a handle and bag are attached. Upright designs generally employ a rotating brushroll or <b>beater</b> <b>bar,</b> which removes dirt through a combination of sweeping and vibration. There are two types of upright vacuums; dirty-air/direct fan (found mostly on commercial vacuums), or clean-air/fan-bypass (found on most of today's domestic vacuums).|$|E
25|$|Scutching {{refers to}} the process of {{cleaning}} cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first scutching machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The scutching machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel <b>bars</b> called <b>beater</b> <b>bars</b> or <b>beaters.</b> The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.|$|R
5000|$|Hoover's {{business}} {{began to}} flourish, and, {{a year after}} Hoover acquired the patent from Spangler, he established a research and development department for his new business. By 1926, Hoover had developed the 'beater bar' - a metal bar attached to the rotating brush roll, situated in the floor nozzle cavity of the upright vacuum cleaner. [...] Introduced on Models 543 and 700, the <b>beater</b> <b>bars</b> alternated with the sweeping brushes to vibrate the carpet while sucking. It provided a more distinct 'tap' than the bristle tufts used on the former machines, {{and led to a}} 101% increase in efficiency. This cleaning action was marketed by Hoover as [...] "Positive Agitation". 'It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans' rang more true now than ever. In 1929, Hoover introduced the Model 200 Duster. This would be their first attempt at a cylinder cleaner. It used a Model 575 motor with a modified suction impeller, which was mounted on a unique aluminum body with runners, allowing the cleaner to be pulled behind the user. The Duster was produced for only three months and roughly 9,000 were made.|$|R
40|$|Soil mixing is a {{well-established}} technology {{used in the}} improvement of the strength of soil as well as the remediation of chemical contaminants in soil. This process is typically referred to as in situ solidification/stabilization (S/S). In situ S/S involves mixing a binding reagent into the contaminated media or waste using soil augers and has been used to treat both organic and inorganic hazardous waste constituents. Cement-based mix designs are most commonly used for S/S treatment of hazardous waste, however, a variety of additives such as fly ash, hydrated lime, bentonite can also used to meet specific project requirements. Several technologies can be used for the in situ S/S of soils, however, a specific focus will be placed {{on the use of the}} Shallow Soil Mixing (SSM) technique. SSM consists of using a single large diameter auger, generally on the range of 5 to 10 ft in diameter, capable of mixing to depths up to 30 or 40 feet deep. The mixing shaft, known as the kelly bar, is hollow stemmed and is attached to a single flight auger which breaks the soil loose and lifts it slightly to six <b>beater</b> <b>bars</b> on the mixing shaft. As the auger penetrates the soil, a slurried reagent is pumped through the mixing shaft and exits through jets located on th...|$|R

5000|$|In 1906 James B. Kirby {{developed}} his {{first of many}} vacuums called the [...] "Domestic Cyclone". It used water for dirt separation. Later revisions {{came to be known}} as the Kirby Vacuum Cleaner. In 1907 department store janitor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915) of Canton, Ohio invented the first portable electric vacuum cleaner, obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper on June 2, 1908. Crucially, in addition to suction from an electric fan that blew the dirt and dust into a soap box and one of his wife's pillow cases, Spangler's design utilized a rotating brush to loosen debris. Unable to produce the design himself due to lack of funding, he sold the patent in 1908 to local leather goods manufacturer William Henry Hoover (1849-1932), who had Spangler's machine redesigned with a steel casing, casters, and attachments, founding the company that in 1922 was renamed the Hoover Company. Their first vacuum was the 1908 Model O, which sold for $60. Subsequent innovations included the <b>beater</b> <b>bar</b> in 1919 ("It beats as it sweeps as it cleans"), disposal filter bags in the 1920s, and an upright vacuum cleaner in 1926.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>beater</b> speed, grid <b>bar</b> setting and cotton trash {{percentage}} upon Uniclean (B 11) and Giant cleaner setup were studied for quality characteristics of cotton. The results {{in respect of}} fibre length and uniformity ratio showed highly {{significant differences in the}} mean values for different combination of settings as well as cleaning segments. Uniclean exert swift gentle but firm action of less stress on fibres whereas the action of Giant cleaner is very aggressive and severe during its cleaning action, which is detrimental to fibre staple...|$|R
50|$|The Barabaig are {{the largest}} group of Tatoga-speaking peoples who {{migrated}} south to East Africa from the Nile Valley in North Africa more than a thousand years ago. Linguists tell us they entered what is now Kenya late in the first millennium AD where they congregated around Mount Elgon up until around 250 years ago. In the late 1800s, German explorers found them on the Serengeti plains of German East Africa now Tanzania. Archaeological evidence suggests that they were still in the Ngorongoro Highlands until around 150 years ago, before they were chased out by the Maasai, who live there to this day, still calling the area Osupuko loo Ltatua (Mountains of the Tatoga). The Tatoga then headed south along the eastern branch of East Africa’s Great Rift Valley and eventually split into groups they call emojiga. Those who settled on the plains surrounding Mount Hanang became known as Barabaig - <b>Beaters</b> of Sticks (<b>bar</b> = to beat, baig = sticks) because of the importance they place on sticks as a weapon and percussion instrument at dances. Numbering between 35,000 and 50,000 people (although it is impossible to be sure of population as the Tanzania census does not record ethnicity) they live to this day on the Hanang Plains in Hanang District of Mara Region of north central Tanzania.|$|R
