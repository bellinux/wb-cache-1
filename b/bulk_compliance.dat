40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of polymers {{in the neighborhood}} of the glass transition has been investigated in the framework of the free volume theory of nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. Free volume theory as normally applied above the glass transition was modified to account for the effect of the residual volume of vacancies below the glass transition; this modification was accomplished by modelling the changes {{in the state of the}} polymer as the sum of viscoelastic changes and a random disturbance deriving from the thermal collisions between molecules. The changes in mechanical properties going across the glass transition follow from the freezing-in of relaxation mechanisms and of free volume. The pressure dependence of the glass transition was found to be in qualitative agreement with measurements on PVAc, while the ratio of the glassy and rubbery heat capacities was found to coincide with the ratio of the equilibrium <b>bulk</b> <b>compliances</b> in the glassy and rubbery domains. The predictions of the model for the problem of transient and residual thermal stresses were compared with those of two simpler models. The second part of the thesis studies the consequences of the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior on the decohesion zone in front of a crack propagating through an adhesive layer. The softening of the material response in the cohesive zone is taken to be effected by free volume induced change in relaxation times of the cohesive material and by void growth; the latter is assumed to depend on a critical value of strain at the beginning of the cohesive zone. The stress intensity factor for steady crack propagation is obtained by imposing the finiteness of strains at the crack tip. For the case where the properties of the adherends are the same as the linearized properties of the adhesive, the predictions show three regimes of crack propagation: a low speed regime where the adherends behave elastically with the rubbery properties, an intermediate range where their response becomes increasingly stiffer, and a high speed regime characterized by glassy behavior of the adherends and control of the crack growth process exclusively by the nonlinearly viscoelastic behavior of the failing material...|$|R

40|$|Measurements are {{described}} and analyzed for {{the determination of}} the dynamic <b>bulk</b> <b>compliance</b> for polyvinyl acetate) [PVAc] as a function of frequency and temperature. The real and imaginary parts of the dynamic <b>bulk</b> <b>compliance</b> over the frequency range from 10 Hz to 1, 000 Hz have been measured at different temperatures by determining the compressibility of a specimen confined to an oil-filled cavity via pressurization by a piezoelectric driver and response of a piezoelectric sensor. The wavelength of the compressional wave generated by the piezoelectric transducer over the frequency range used is much larger than the size of the cavity so that the pressure can be considered uniform inside the cavity. The complex compliances of the specimen, confining liquid, and the cavity, are additive upon the pressure variations due to the piezoelectric transducer expansion and contraction. All deformations are considered to be purely dilitational. A master compliance curve over a total frequency range of about 12 decades is generated by the method of time-temperature superposition. Experimental problems addressing limitations in resolution capability are discussed. The results are compared with the classical measurements obtained by McKinney and Belcher over thirty years ago. Further comparison of the bulk with shear compliance data shows that the extent of the transition ranges for the shear and for the bulk functions are comparable, but the two transitions belong to different time scales: That of the bulk response falls mostly into the glassy domain of the shear behavior. One concludes thus that for linearly viscoelastic response the molecular mechanisms contributing to shear and bulk deformations have different conformational sources...|$|E

It {{is based on the assumption}} that the pore space can be represented by a distribution of crack-like spheroidal pores having a distribu-tion of aspect ratios, and a single family of non-closable spheroidal pores.

Asymptotic analytical expressions are obtained for the compliances of both dry and fluid-saturated spheroidal pores that are crack-like, needle-like, or nearly spherical. These expres-sions are incorporated into two commonly used effective medium theories, the Mori-Tanaka and the Differential schemes, to obtain expressions for the effective elastic properties of dry and fluid-saturated rocks containing spheroids of a given aspect ratio, as a function of porosity or crack density. The stress dependence of the elastic velocities is modelled by considering that the elastic moduli vary with stress due to crack closure.

40|$|In early heart development, {{bilateral}} {{fields of}} heart progenitor cells (HPCs) undergo a large-scale {{movement from the}} anterior lateral plate mesoderm to merge on the ventral midline, undergoing a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) halfway through this process. While the heart is the first functioning organs in the developing embryo, a comprehensive model for early heart development that integrates both physical mechanisms and molecular signaling pathways remains elusive. Here, we utilize Xenopus embryos to investigate the role of mechanical cues in driving MET in HPCs and show how dysregulation of these cues can cause congenital heart defects (CHDs). Small molecule inhibitor treatments targeting actomyosin contractility reveal a temporally specific requirement of <b>bulk</b> tissue <b>compliance</b> to regulate heart development and MET. Through tracking of tissue level deformations in the heart forming region (HFR) as well as movement trajectories and traction generation of individual HPCs, we find the onset of MET correlates with a peak in mechanical stress within the HFR and changes in HPC migratory behaviors. Targeting mutant constructs to modulate contractility and compliance in the underlying endoderm, we find MET in HPCs can be accelerated in response to microenvironmental stiffening and can be inhibited by softening. To test whether MET in HPCs is responsive to purely physical mechanical cues, we mimicked a high stress state by injecting an inert oil droplet to generate high strain in the HFR, demonstrating that exogenously applied stress is sufficient to drive MET. MET-induced defects in anatomy result in defined functional lesions in the larval heart and furthermore, when we recreate a clinically-relevant CHD phenotype through overexpression of a Noonan Syndrome-associated mutant protein, we find it leads to abnormal MET in HPCs due to a decoupling of force transmission and mechanosensory pathways. From this integrated analysis of HPC polarity and mechanics, we propose that normal heart development requires HPCs to undergo a critical behavioral and phenotypic transition {{on their way to}} the ventral midline and that this transition is driven in response to the changing mechanical properties of their endoderm substrate. We conclude that the etiology underlying many CHDs may involve errors in mechanical signaling and MET...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} {{bulk modulus}} and effective shear modulus of porous materials having {{various types of}} pore shapes are investigated, using both analytical and numerical methods. These solutions, and the scaling laws that are derived {{with the aid of}} these solutions, are then used to make predictions of the effective elastic moduli of some sandstones and ceramics, based on two-dimensional images of the pore space. The complex variable method is used to find the hydrostatic and shear compliances of a large family of pores that have N-fold rotational symmetry, and which have at most four terms in their conformal mapping function. This solution is validated using boundary element (BEM) calculations, and is also used to test two scaling laws that estimate the compliances based on the area and perimeter of the pore. The boundary perturbation method is used to study the effect of small-scale roughness on the compressibility and shear compliance of a nominally circular pore. The solution is carried out to fourth order in the roughness parameter for the case of hydrostatic loading, and to second order for shear loading. These solutions allow one to judge the scale of roughness that can safely be ignored when obtaining images of the pores. Predictions are then made of the elastic moduli of some porous materials – two sandstones and a ceramic. Starting with scanning electron micrographs, image analysis software is used to isolate and extract each pore from the host material. The <b>bulk</b> and shear <b>compliances</b> are estimated using both BEM and the two scaling laws. Areally-weighted mean values of these compliances are calculated for each material, and the differential effective medium scheme is used to obtain expressions for the moduli as functions of porosity.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three chapters, which describe {{different aspects}} of {{an investigation of the}} bulk response of Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) (PMMA). The first chapter describes the physical measurements by means of a Belcher/McKinney-type apparatus. Used earlier for the measurement of the bulk response of Poly(Vinyl Acetate), it was now adapted for making measurements at higher temperatures commensurate with the glass transition temperature of PMMA. The dynamic <b>bulk</b> <b>compliance</b> of PMMA was measured at atmospheric pressure over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies, from which the master curves for the <b>bulk</b> <b>compliance</b> were generated by means of the time-temperature superposition principle. It was found that the extent of the transition ranges for the bulk and shear response were comparable. Comparison of the shift factors for bulk and shear responses supports the idea that different molecular mechanisms contribute to shear and bulk deformations. The second chapter delineates molecular dynamics computations for the bulk response for a range of pressures and temperatures. The model(s) consisted of 2256 atoms formed into three polymer chains with fifty monomer units per chain per unit cell. The time scales accessed were limited to tens of pico seconds. It was found that, in addition to the typical energy minimization and temperature annealing cycles for establishing equilibrium models, it is advantageous to subject the model samples to a cycle of relatively large pressures (GPa-range) for improving the equilibrium state. On comparing the computations with the experimentally determined "glassy" behavior, one finds that, although the computations were limited to small samples in a physical sense, the primary limitation rests in the very short times (pico seconds). The molecular dynamics computations do not model the physically observed temperature sensitivity of PMMA, even if one employs a hypothetical time-temperature shift to account for the large difference in time scales between experiment and computation. The values computed by the molecular dynamics method do agree with the values measured at the coldest temperature and at the highest frequency of one kiloHertz. The third chapter draws on measurements of uniaxial, shear and Poisson response conducted previously in our laboratory. With the availability of four time or frequency-dependent material functions for the same material, the process of interconversion between different material functions was investigated. Computed material functions were evaluated against the direct experimental measurements and the limitations imposed on successful interconversion due to the experimental errors in the underlying physical data were explored. Differences were observed that are larger than the experimental errors would suggest. ...|$|E
40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Australian Taxation Office’s administration of capital gains tax for individual and small business taxpayers. To form a conclusion against this objective, the ANAO adopted the following high-level criteria: 	management arrangements support the effective administration of CGT for individual and small business taxpayers; 	compliance risks are assessed and a coherent strategy is in place to promote compliance with CGT requirements; and 	compliance activities are appropriate and effective. The ANAO focused on CGT activities undertaken in the Small Business and Individual Taxpayers Business and Service Line. The audit also includes a review of the implementation status of the seven recommendations from the 2006 – 07 ANAO audit report. Overall conclusion Australian taxpayers have been required to include net capital gains as part of their assessable income since 1985 when the capital gains tax (CGT) system was introduced. In 2013 – 14, CGT receipts were around $ 7. 2  billion, which represented some 2. 2  per cent of the $ 321. 7  billion total net tax collected by the ATO. Based on the latest ATO estimates, in 2011 – 12, some 63  per cent of CGT was paid by individual taxpayers, with small business comprising around 14  per cent in that year. The arrangements put in place by the ATO to administer CGT reflect its general approach to taxation administration. The ATO has provided a range of targeted marketing, communication and education activities explaining CGT requirements and encouraging compliance by individual and small business taxpayers, which are the focus of this audit. The ATO has also implemented sound management arrangements and suitable risk management processes to administer CGT for these taxpayers. Nevertheless, CGT presents particular compliance challenges for taxpayers intending to fulfil their tax obligations and administrative challenges for the ATO—essentially related to the one-off nature of capital events, extensive record keeping requirements for taxpayers and reliance on third-party data by the ATO, particularly for compliance activity with individual taxpayers. As a result, CGT has been classified as a high compliance risk for the ATO, requiring effective approaches to risk mitigation and active management oversight to monitor performance. While the ATO’s general approach to the administration of CGT is sound, there has been a heavy reliance on taxpayers’ voluntary disclosures of CGT liabilities in their annual tax returns. Insufficient attention has been given to addressing the limited effectiveness of compliance activities for individual and small business taxpayers that have not met their CGT obligations. As a consequence, there has been a considerable reduction in the revenue raised from specific CGT compliance activities directed at individual and small business taxpayers in recent years. This aspect of CGT administration requires closer consideration by the ATO. In relation to compliance activities, the ATO has programs for CGT that take into account the different elements of the individual and small business taxpayer market segments. CGT compliance activities for individual taxpayers are primarily conducted through correspondence (letters that draw on third‑party data), while reviews and audits are conducted for small business taxpayers. These active compliance programs raised some $ 546  million in liabilities from 2011 – 12 to 2013 – 14, of which around 30  per cent ($ 149  million) has been collected. Further, the liabilities raised and cash collected from these targeted CGT compliance activities are relatively small amounts in comparison to the voluntary disclosure of capital gains. The latest available ATO data indicates that in 2011 – 12 the estimated total tax payable on capital gains made by individual and small business taxpayers was around $ 4. 3  billion, with around $ 150  million in liabilities raised and only $ 46  million (31  per cent) in cash collected from compliance activities conducted in that year. To support the CGT compliance letter strategy for individual taxpayers, the ATO obtains extensive data from third-parties in relation to real property and share transactions. Although the ATO has implemented extensive data cleansing and filtering processes, problems in matching this data to taxpayer declarations limits the number of CGT cases the ATO reviews and the accuracy of the potential non-compliance that is identified. As a consequence, the active compliance programs for individual taxpayers have had a heavy emphasis on real property and a limited focus on shares and other types of assets. To achieve a more balanced coverage across asset types, there would be merit in the ATO reassessing its capacity to target compliance activities for individual taxpayers across all asset types. Despite the known problems with third-party data, the ATO sends letters to thousands of individual taxpayers each year, questioning the accuracy of their declarations of CGT. The outcome of this correspondence can be that the taxpayer contacts the ATO and clarifies their situation to the satisfaction of the ATO, or the ATO amends their assessment. The ANAO’s sample of 322 letters sent to individual taxpayers found that most did not result in further action by the ATO (59  per cent) and that many (almost half) of the amended assessments were subsequently reversed. This largely reflects a lack of accuracy of information in these letters, which impacts on the taxpayer’s experience and the ATO’s prospects of securing appropriate revenue. On this basis, the ATO would benefit from evaluating the effectiveness of its CGT <b>bulk</b> letter <b>compliance</b> strategy for individual taxpayers. As mentioned previously, there has also been a significant reduction in revenue from specific CGT compliance activities for small business taxpayers—from $ 59. 0  million to $ 30. 3  million from 2011 – 12 to 2013 – 14. In 2014 – 15, the ATO expects to raise only $ 13. 1  million from 32 specific CGT small business cases, and to incorporate CGT into the broader small business compliance program. To gain assurance that its CGT compliance strategies for individual and small business taxpayers are targeted effectively across the major categories of CGT events and, in the light of recent changes to CGT administrative arrangements, {{it is important for the}} ATO to evaluate its strategies and activities. To support the ATO’s administration of CGT, the ANAO has made one recommendation aimed at improving the effectiveness of CGT compliance strategies and activities for individual and small business taxpayers...|$|R

It has been previously shown experimentally that the pair of differential or integral operators necessary to define the viscoelastic behaviour of a linear material along the whole viscoelastic spectrum may be reduced, to {{a high degree of}} approximation, to one operator relationship and an initial value.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{simultaneous}} isothermal tensile creep {{measurements of the}} longitudinal extension and the lateral contraction in standard thin tension specimens yielded individual curves for the variation of the lateral contraction ratio (Poisson's ratio) at different loading and temperature steps throughout the viscoelastic spectrum {{for a series of}} pure and plasticized cold-setting epoxy polymers. By applying the principle of reduced variables and shifting the isothermal creep curves along the log(time) scale, composite curves were obtained for Poisson's ratio which have the shape of sigmoid curves, thus proving the dependence of this viscoelastic function on time and temperature. It was shown that the corresponding transition regions were shifted towards the origin (t = 0) as the amount of plasticizer was increased, while the shape of the corresponding composite curves did not change and the variation of the logarithmic time factor remained essentially the same but with steeper gradients for increasing amounts of plasticizer. Comparison of the viscoelastic spectra for this function with the corresponding spectra for creep extension, shear and bulk compliances found previously indicated that the spectrum of this function is broader than the others and while it starts to appear earlier than the shear compliance spectrum it disappears after the corresponding <b>bulk</b> <b>compliance</b> spectrum.

By digitally scanning the ear canal and taking the dynamics of the ear into account the performance and comfort of a hearing aid can be greatly improved.

A new absorption based optical technique is introduced, which is capable of generating three dimensional maps of an ear subjected to a varying pressure.

40|$|Realistic {{material}} {{models to}} simulate the behavior of brain tissue at large deformations and high strain rates are necessary when designing equipment to protect against ballistic impacts. Acquiring experimental data for brain tissue response is critical to developing appropriate models. Current in vivo and in situ procedures for testing the material behavior of soft tissues are dominated by indentation techniques. The major challenge for this testing configuration is in finding a unique solution to the "inverse problem" i. e., obtaining material properties that are uniquely defined by the indentation force-displacement response. Much of the information related to the interplay between shear and <b>bulk</b> <b>compliance</b> in the deformation field beneath the indenter is lost when capturing the single force-displacement output. To address this challenge, we propose a material testing technique that follows the well- proven path of conventional indentation methods, but also enriches the signal by acquiring displacement data for an offset, passive surface tracking sensor. We present {{the results of a}} finite element (FE) study to demonstrate that the addition of a secondary sensor can help to discern between materials with varying degrees of compressibility. To this end, a large displacement in vivo dynamic indentation surface tracking (DIST) tool was designed and manufactured. This tool incorporates the secondary sensor concept to measure the force-displacement response of brain tissue at strain rates up to 1000 %/s. The technique is applied in vitro to measure the response of porcine brain tissue. To select an appropriate constitutive framework for porcine brain tissue in vitro, uniaxial compression tests measuring the corresponding lateral stretch response are performed. (cont.) A three-dimensional large deformation constitutive model for brain tissue is developed. The model accounts for the observed features of the material response including non-linearity, conditioning, hysteresis, and strain-rate dependence. The model is incorporated into an FE simulation of the brain indentation tests performed with the DIST tool. The effectiveness of the DIST as a material-testing tool is assessed. by Asha Balakrishnan. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2007.

40|$|To provide {{quantitative}} {{measures of}} the importance of fluid effects on shear waves in heterogeneous reservoirs, a model material called a ''random polycrystal of porous laminates'' is introduced. This model poroelastic material has constituent grains that are layered (or laminated), and each layer is an isotropic, microhomogeneous porous medium. All grains are composed of exactly the same porous constituents, and have the same relative volume fractions. The order of lamination is not important because the up-scaling method used to determine the transversely isotropic (hexagonal) properties of the grains is Backus averaging, which [...] for quasi-static or long-wavelength behavior [...] depends only on the volume fractions and layer properties. Grains are then jumbled together totally at random, filling all space, and producing an overall isotropic poroelastic medium. The poroelastic behavior of this medium is then analyzed using the Peselnick-Meister-Watt bounds (of Hashin-Shtrikman type). We study the dependence of the shear modulus on pore fluid properties and determine the range of behavior to be expected. In particular we compare and contrast these results to those anticipated from Gassmann's fluid substitution formulas, and to the predictions of Mavko and Jizba for very low porosity rocks with flat cracks. This approach also permits the study of arbitrary numbers of constituents, but for simplicity the numerical examples are restricted here to just two constituents. This restriction also permits the use of some special exact results available for computing the overall effective stress coefficient in any two-component porous medium. The bounds making use of polycrystalline microstructure are very tight. Results for the shear modulus demonstrate that the ratio of compliance differences R (i. e., shear compliance changes over <b>bulk</b> <b>compliance</b> changes when going from drained to undrained behavior, or vice versa) is usually nonzero and can take a wide range of values, both above and below the value R = 4 / 15 valid for low porosity, very low aspect ratio flat cracks.
