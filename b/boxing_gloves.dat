5|$|Queen conch shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians {{in a wide variety}} of ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Taíno used conch shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, cookware and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves)</b> during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens with}} Mangte Chungeijang Kom (Priyanka Chopra) in labour, walking towards the {{hospital}} with her husband, Onler Kom (Darshan Kumaar). Due to a curfew, they have difficulty finding a public transport and Onler is mistaken for an insurgent and beaten {{when he tries to}} find a vehicle. The film then shifts to a flashback in which Kom found <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> in the remains of an air crash in 1991, which prompted her interest in boxing despite her father's disapproval. During an early fight, she chases a boy and ends up in a boxing gym. After realising that the coach of the gym, Narjit Singh (Sunil Thapa), was also the coach of the Asian champion Dingko Singh, Kom tells him about her boxing aspirations. He asks her to visit the gym for the next thirty days and says that he will only teach her if she is deserving enough. She starts visiting the gym, informing her mother but not her father. Days pass but her coach does not enquire about her. Due to Kom's dedication and stubbornness, Singh starts training her. Later, he suggests changing her name to Mary Kom.|$|E
25|$|<b>Boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> are {{cushioned}} gloves that fighters wear {{on their}} hands during boxing matches and practices. Unlike the ancient cestus which were designed as a weapon, modern <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> are {{designed to protect the}} fighter's hand during a bout, though competitions, sparring and other forms of training have their own specialized gloves. Modern <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> reduce superficial facial injuries; however, as modern <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> give their user the ability to throw stronger punches to head without damaging the hands, they also increase the risk of brain damage for participants.|$|E

25|$|Modern <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> {{started showing}} up towards {{end of the}} 1990s. Over ten years of {{engineering}} and testing {{by some of the}} biggest boxing manufacturers and sport names have helped create safe, durable equipment. Modern <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> include mesh palm, velcro, leather-based stitching, suspension cushioning and new padding for the boxer. The International Boxing Association (amateur) approves new designs of gloves according to rules around weight and the amount of leather, padding and support allowed.|$|E

25|$|<b>Boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> {{usually come}} with either lace-ups or velcro. In velcro gloves, the velcro {{acts as a}} second handwrap that adds more {{stability}} to the wrist. Lace-up gloves provide a more snug and secure fit, but unlike velcro gloves, require assistance from another person to lace, and are usually wrapped with tape before the match. Lace-up gloves {{can be converted to}} velcro gloves using a hook and loop converter.|$|E
25|$|All {{polonium}} compounds, such as polonium dioxide, {{are extremely}} radioactive and thus must be handled in a <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> must further be enclosed in another box {{similar to the}} <b>glove</b> <b>box,</b> maintained at a slightly lower pressure than the <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{incidence}} of infection after minor surgery conducted using non-sterile clean <b>boxed</b> <b>gloves</b> with surgery conducted using sterile gloves. Design: Prospective randomised controlled single-centre trial testing for non-inferiority in infection rates. Setting: Primary care regional centre, Queensland, Australia. Participants: Consecutive patients presenting to participating general practitioners for a minor skin excision, between 30 June 2012 and 28 March 2013, were eligible to participate. Intervention: The use of non-sterile clean <b>boxed</b> <b>gloves</b> was compared with normal treatment using sterile gloves in the control group. Main outcome measures: Wound infection, assessed {{at the time of}} removal of sutures, and other adverse events. Results: Four hundred and ninety-three consecutive patients presenting for minor skin excisions were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups: non-sterile clean <b>boxed</b> <b>gloves</b> (n = 250) or sterile gloves (n = 243). Four hundred and seventy-eight patients contributed data for analysis (241 non-sterile, 237 sterile gloves). The incidence of infection in the non-sterile gloves group (8. 7...|$|R

25|$|Since boxing {{involves}} forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must {{be taken}} to prevent damage to bones in the hand. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without wrist wraps and <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves.</b> Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not utilise them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves {{to be used in the}} bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place.|$|E
25|$|Sport {{organizations}} {{use different}} competition rule systems. Light contact rules {{are used by}} the WKF, WUKO, IASK and WKC.

25|$|During {{the colonial}} period, martial arts like pradal serey were {{considered}} by the European colonists to be brutal and uncivilised. The French turned the art into a sport by adding timed rounds, a boxing ring and western <b>boxing</b> <b>gloves</b> {{in an attempt to}} lessen injury. Originally matches were fought in dirt pits with limited rules while hands were wrapped in rope. Some matches had boxers wrap seashells around their knuckles to increase the damage that could be inflicted. In the 1960s, Cambodian boxing promoters held inter-martial art exhibitions.|$|E

40|$|In {{a nuclear}} fuel cycle facility, radiotoxic {{materials}} are being handled in freestanding leak tight enclosures called <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> (GBs). These <b>glove</b> <b>boxes</b> {{act as a}} primary confinement for the radiotoxic materials. <b>Glove</b> <b>boxes</b> are designed as per codal requirements for class I component. They are designed to withstand extreme level of earthquake loading with a return period of 10, 000 years. To evaluate seismic performance of the <b>glove</b> <b>box,</b> {{there is a need}} to check the stability (sliding and overturning), structural integrity (stresses and strains) and leak tightness under earthquake loading. Extensive shake table experiments were conducted on a single standalone <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> Actual laboratory conditions were simulated during testing to check the response. After extensive shake table testing, <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure was also analyzed using finite element (FE) software. Detailed three-dimensional model of <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure was developed and analyzed using nonlinear time history method. It was observed that finite element methods could be utilized to accurately predict dynamic response of <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure. This paper discusses the details and results of shake table testing and methodology used for modelling and analysing freestanding <b>glove</b> <b>box</b> structure under seismic loading. In addition, simplified numerical procedure, developed using energy conservation principle is applied to estimate approximate sliding displacement of the <b>glove</b> <b>box.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B.
