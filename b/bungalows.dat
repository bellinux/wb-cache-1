The <b>bungalow</b> court was created in Pasadena, California in 1909 and was the predominant form of multi-family housing in Southern California from the 1910s through the 1930s. Homes in <b>bungalow</b> courts were generally small, low-rise houses {{in the spirit of}} <b>bungalow</b> design; however, the homes were designed in a variety of architectural styles, including Swiss chalet and Spanish Colonial Revival. <b>Bungalow</b> courts also integrated their courtyards with the homes, providing green space to homeowners.|$|R

2500|$|This {{game was}} played each week between one of the <b>Bungalow</b> Heads and DCI Harry Batt, portrayed by Ian Kirkby. In the game, the <b>Bungalow</b> Head was led into DCI Harry Batt's Interrogation Room (one of the rooms in the <b>Bungalow),</b> {{accompanied}} by either Dick or Dom. The <b>Bungalow</b> Head was then given a [...] "secret word" [...] by Dick or Dom, such as [...] "windows". DCI Harry Batt would then enter. A 90-second clock would start and the <b>Bungalow</b> Head {{would have to tell}} an elaborate story about why they had supposedly been arrested by DCI Harry Batt, saying their secret word as many times as possible in the story. Each mention of the secret word during the story was worth 20 <b>Bungalow</b> Points, and a running count of how many points the <b>Bungalow</b> Head had scored was shown on screen. However, {{at the end of the}} 90 seconds, DCI Harry Batt would then be given the opportunity to guess the <b>Bungalow</b> Head's secret word from the story they had told. If DCI Harry Batt correctly guessed the secret word, as happened on the majority of times the {{game was played}}, the <b>Bungalow</b> Head would score no points at all. If DCI Harry Batt was incorrect however, the <b>Bungalow</b> Head would keep all the points they had scored in the game.|$|R

50|$|American <b>Bungalow</b> is a {{quarterly}} special interest magazine whose stated purpose is “preserving and restoring the modest American 20th Century home, the <b>bungalow,</b> {{and the rich}} lifestyle it affords.” Since its introduction in 1990, the publication {{has been a major}} spur to the revitalization of interest in <b>bungalow</b> homes and their connection to the original and contemporary Arts and Crafts movement. The magazine and its advertisers are a popular resource for <b>bungalow</b> owners and architects.|$|R
5|$|Chestnut Street is also largely residential. The 200 {{block of}} West Chestnut {{features}} old supports for the Big Four Bridge and the 100 block of West Chestnut holds the Grisamore House, which was separately {{placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1983. On East Chestnut, the 100 block contains many houses built around 1900 and the 200 block is filled with <b>bungalows.</b> St. Augustine Roman Catholic Church, a Spanish-flavored neo-Baroque structure with a Moorish-styled rectory, {{is located on the}} 300 block of East Chestnut. Another church is located on the 400 block including the Gothic Revival style First Presbyterian Church (with lancet windows and belltower), and a typical Works Progress Administration Art Modern school whose cruciform plan has a stuccoed facade and metal casement windows.|$|E
5|$|Riverside and Brooklyn saw modest growth until 1887, {{when the}} city of Jacksonville annexed them and {{established}} a streetcar line. Following the Great Fire of 1901, which destroyed most of Downtown Jacksonville, many displaced residents moved to Riverside. Wealthy citizens built mansions close to the river, while the less well-to-do purchased more modest <b>bungalows</b> and other plantation houses further inland. The neighborhood grew steadily, with development continuing well beyond its original bounds to the south, until {{the collapse of the}} Florida land boom in the late 1920s. During this period, so many architects working in such a wide variety of contemporary styles experimented in Riverside that it has become the most architecturally diverse neighborhood in Florida. Largely due to Riverside's profusion of bungalow plantation houses, Jacksonville has what is likely the largest number of such structures in the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{rest of the}} {{interior}} of the fortress was, at various times, occupied by a range of different military buildings, but they have mostly been demolished and grassed over to form a large parade ground. Among the surviving buildings are the Royal Garrison Artillery barracks, located {{to the north of the}} parade ground. Built between 1900 and 1902, it could hold 140 soldiers in 12 man barrack-rooms. Alongside the barracks are <b>bungalows,</b> originally for the use of senior non-commissioned officers, a storehouse dating from the Napoleonic Wars, and two guard barracks from 1700, which form a very early example of this form of military architecture in England. Other buildings that have survived include a 19th-century field train shed, and an 18th-century gunpowder magazine, since converted into a shelter for gunners.|$|E

5|$|There are 13 {{residential}} neighbourhoods, {{each with}} a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and <b>bungalows.</b> There are no residential tower blocks, apart from the 8 storey Milton Mount Flats at the North end of Pound Hill. Many houses have their own gardens and are set back from roads. The hub of each neighbourhood is a shopping parade, community centre and church, and each has a school and recreational open spaces as well. Crawley Development Corporation's intention was for neighbourhood shops to cater only to basic needs, and for the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements. The number of shop units provided in the neighbourhood parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each neighbourhood, the number actually built ranged from 19 in the outlying Langley Green neighbourhood to just seven in West Green, close to the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Tourists on {{the island}} of Bora Bora were {{evacuated}} to a local church, after Wasa–Arthur had swept high seas into tourist <b>bungalows.</b> Overall the system caused an estimated US$60 million in damage within French Polynesia, with the majority of the damage done between December 9– 12. The system destroyed or damaged several homes, a variety of crops and damaged several public buildings, hotels, roads and power installations, with the worst affected islands being Bora Bora and Tubuai. On Rurutu island, Moerai harbour was destroyed by a cyclonic swell generated by the system, while the local school and police station were destroyed by high waves. Two people were killed after torrential rainfall from the system caused a mudslide {{on the island}} of Moorea, during a night of torrential rain the day after Wasa had made its closest approach to the island. The French Government incurred costs of about FF68 million including FF53 million for the efforts of the French Military. The French Polynesian Government subsequently borrowed FF55 million and built up a fund from local banks of about FF1.5 billion, to help with the reconstruction. The name Wasa was later retired, from the list of tropical cyclone names by the World Meteorological Organization.|$|E
