60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> left {{absolutely}} {{free and}} independent, untrammelled, uncounselled, {{alone with her}} wealth.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} quite {{rigid and}} mute, half {{hidden by the}} gloom, evidently terrorized by the cruel threats hurled against her.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{no longer}} {{listening}} to him. She had abruptly {{turned her back}} on him and made for the door. Her father interposed.|$|E

60|$|Her tears {{began to}} flow again, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> more {{mistress}} of herself, and she hid {{her face in}} Philip's handkerchief. She tried hard to control herself.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> different. Her sorrow {{had given}} her dignity and had added to her beauty. She quickly told her tale, and he started upright in his chair as he heard it.|$|E
60|$|She might open towards him, a {{long while}} hence, in her dreams, {{when she was a}} pure spirit. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not to be {{violated}} and ruined. She closed against him fiercely.|$|E
6000|$|... "At least <b>she</b> has <b>been</b> sick," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "She {{has had a}} fever, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> slowly getting well. Her name is Rosalie." ...|$|R
5000|$|Teeny Tina: Tina Tate is a dare-devil who {{can never}} resist a challenge. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> facing one against her better {{judgement}} - Teeny, {{who is a}} tiny version of herself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The old witch had enchanted you, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{dead and}} you are free. We will wake up the other knights that she laid under her spells, {{and then we will}} go.' ...|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this time}} {{her love for}} the stage had been single-minded. No man had touched her heart with {{sufficient}} fire to disturb her serenity, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not merely following where he led, she was questioning the value and morality of her avocation.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{not until}} I was fairly seated by the driver, and {{rattling}} through a rocky valley with dwarf olives, that I became aware of my bereavement. I had lost Modestine. Up to that moment I had thought I hated her; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> gone, ...|$|E
60|$|Chris {{was still}} on her back. His shirt was in ribbons. The backs of his hands were bruised and lacerated, while his face was {{streaming}} blood from a gash near the temple.

6000|$|... "Neither, O Asika. It {{was another}} lady who loved {{him very much}} and wanted to marry him, {{and that was why}} he ran away to Africa. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> dead and buried." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Only that Sylvia {{makes no}} complaint," [...] remarked Mrs. Grosvenor, [...] "I should {{apprehend}} {{that the town}} air is ill-suited to her constitution. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> always, indeed, a delicate creature; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a mere gossamer.

6000|$|... "When I came in {{from the}} pasture, Marilla was in the room where the piano was. I could see by the strings and woolsacks on the floor that she had had it unwrapped. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tying the wagon-sheet over it again, and {{there was a kind of}} solemn, whitish look on her face.|$|E
6000|$|It was a pity that Geoffrey did {{not explain}} {{that he meant}} Bransome's payment by the words [...] "my first fee," [...] for Helen had never {{forgotten}} how she had failed {{in the attempt to}} double the amount for which he had bargained. She had considered him destitute of all the gentler graces, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> surprised that he should apparently attempt to wound her.|$|E
6000|$|But {{they got}} to Soho Square at last; and through the glass door, in among the stalls--that fairy land in general to Kate; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too much frightened and bewildered {{to do more than}} hurry along the passages, staring so wildly for her albums, that Josephine touched her, and said, [...] "Tenez, Miladi, they will think you farouche. Ah! see the {{beautiful}} wreaths!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{novel is}} most likely set in the late 1970s, {{due to the fact}} that Ellen states the {{following}} on page 48 when talking about her teacher-"She lived in the sixties. <b>She</b> used to <b>be</b> a flower child <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> low key so she can hold a job." ...|$|R

6000|$|During {{the winter}} Carol was to hear Dave Dyer's hen-catching {{impersonation}} seven times, [...] "An Old Sweetheart of Mine" [...] nine times, the Jewish {{story and the}} funeral oration twice; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ardent and, because she did so want {{to be happy and}} simple-hearted, she was as disappointed as the others when the stunts were finished, and the party instantly sank back into coma.|$|E
60|$|And {{then they}} walked on. Adela had come there {{expressly}} {{to speak to}} him, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> almost afraid to speak. Her heart had been full {{of what it would}} utter, but now all utterance seemed to have left her. She had intended to console, but she did not dare to attempt it. There was a depth, almost a sublimity about his grief which kept her silent.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> revelling {{amongst the}} flowers, which {{she seemed to}} love passionately. Phibbs wheeled her slowly along the narrow paths between the beds, and she stopped {{frequently}} to fondle a blossom or pull away a dead leaf or twig from a bush. The roses were magnificent, {{in spite of the}} old gardener's croaking, and the sun was warm and grateful and the hum of the bees musical and sweet.|$|E

6000|$|No {{wonder that}} Andor feels this dance, this movement, the music, the girl's sweet, quick breath, {{going to his}} head like wine. Elsa was always pretty, always dainty and gentle, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> excited, tearful at the coming parting, and by all the saints a more {{exquisite}} woman never came out of Paradise! ...|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{could have}} told him. She was the angel with the flaming sword who guarded their paradise. Marriage was causing her to make {{unexpected}} discoveries with regard to herself. Before she had always looked on herself as a rather unusually reasonable, and certainly not a jealous, woman. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> filled with an active dislike for these quite harmless young men who came to try and share Kirk with her.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Clavering blushed as she answered.

60|$|It {{was plain}} that Lydgate, as Dorothea had expected, {{knew nothing about}} the {{circumstances}} of her yesterday's visit; nay, he appeared to imagine that she had carried it out according to her intention. She had prepared a little note asking Rosamond to see her, which she would have given to the servant if he had not been in the way, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in much anxiety as to the result of his announcement.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gilbert is shy,' said Albinia, 'afraid of the responsibility, {{and perhaps}} he is almost too near, {{the very next}} to ourselves.

5000|$|Now, {{five years}} after her miraculous recovery, Maria Mercedes says <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{experiencing}} a new miracle from D'Onofrio, as she has become pregnant despite doctors' diagnoses {{that it would be}} impossible. [...] "All the specialists who examined her {{came to the conclusion that}} she could never have any children. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> pregnant.

5000|$|No Place Like Home - For {{as long as}} she can remember, Josie Small {{has been}} fostered by Mum Keegan.
