5|$|O'Reilly {{responded by}} {{becoming}} the leading Australian wicket-taker {{in the series}} taking 25, with Bill Voce taking 26 for England. However, he almost failed {{to take to the}} field; O'Reilly and several players had threatened to withdraw after vice-captain Stan McCabe's wife was forbidden from sitting in the Members' Stand in the First Test. The Australian Board of Control backed down, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> start of a tumultuous season.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} 2003 World Cup, England {{were one of}} the tournament favourites. They reached the final on 22 November 2003 against host Australia and became world champions after a match-winning drop goal by star flyhalf Jonny Wilkinson deep into extra time that made the final score 20–17. Not only was it their first Rugby World Cup victory, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> country's first World Cup since winning the 1966 FIFA (football) World Cup as hosts. On 8 December, the English team greeted 750,000 {{supporters}} on their victory parade through London before meeting Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.|$|E

5|$|Rock {{and roll}} {{developed}} out of country, blues, and R Rock's exact origins and early influences have been hotly debated, {{and are the}} subjects of much scholarship. Though squarely in the blues tradition, rock took elements from Afro-Caribbean and Latin musical techniques. Rock was an urban style, formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American, Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco. Rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called rockabilly, which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music. Black-performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> white performer Elvis Presley who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music, {{becoming one of the}} best-selling musicians in history, and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world.|$|E
5|$|The Actor's Children is a 1910 American silent short drama {{written by}} Lloyd Lonergan and {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company in New Rochelle, New York. The film features Orilla Smith, Yale Boss, Frank Hall Crane and Nicholas Jordan. The production {{was not the first}} film subject by the company, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first to be released. Both Barry O'Neil and Lloyd B. Carleton have been credited {{as the director of the}} production. Edwin Thanhouser stated that 19 copies of the film were produced and distributed to dealers.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mk. IV in July 1940 {{improved}} matters, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> delivery of the Bristol Beaufighter starting in August that produced a truly effective system. The Beaufighter had considerably more powerful engines, speed that allowed it to catch its targets, and a powerful gun pack of four 20mm cannon that could easily destroy a bomber in a single pass. Squadron use began in October, and its first victory came soon after on 19/20 November when a Beaufighter IF of No. 604 Squadron destroyed a Ju 88A-5 near Chichester, {{very close to the}} first success of the Mk. III.|$|E

5|$|The {{diminutive}} Hassett was {{an elegant}} middle-order batsman, {{known for his}} wide range of strokes, timing, quick footwork and strong wrists. However, as his career progressed and his seniority in the Australian team increased, he became a more cautious player who often frustrated spectators with sedate scoring, particularly after World War II. Despite this, Hassett remained an aggressive and adventurous strokemaker in matches for Victoria. He had a poker face, and this benefited him as a captain, as even his teammates sometimes {{found it hard to}} discern his mood or thinking. During his 24 Test matches in charge, he won 14 games and suffered defeat only four times, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last of the four losses that blighted his record. Hassett was a very occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, averaging one over per first-class match. He took 18 wickets in 216 matches, and never took more than two in a single innings. He never took a wicket at Test level and bowled less than 19 overs.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} full (and primary religious) {{account of}} Nandanar's life {{is found in}} the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Nandanar Charitram by the Tamil poet Gopalakrishna Bharati (1810–1896) brought Nandanar's tale to public attention. The Nandanar Charitam (printed in 1861), the magnum opus of Bharati, added new elements to Sekkizhar's tale. Though it is unknown when he lived exactly, generally he is dated to 7th or 8th century CE.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} two {{unemployed}} parents obtaining employment {{in an upcoming}} theater production. Shortly after returning home, the landlady shows up and demands the rent, but can not collect. She gives them one week, but the theater production does not manifest and the parents again search for work. While they are out, the landlady finds a tenant and puts the children out on the street. They end up dancing for an organ grinder and are saved by a theater manager who puts them on his vaudeville bill. The parents come into a fortune and are reunited by their children at the theater. The film was met with positive reviews and some criticism for its acting and scenario, but the industry had reasons to encourage the success of Edwin Thanhouser's company. A print of the film exists, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> subject of nitrate deterioration.|$|E

5|$|The {{game between}} the Hokies and the Longhorns was {{the first meeting of}} the two teams. The {{competition}} marked Virginia Tech's first trip to the annual Sugar Bowl game, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Hokies' third consecutive bowl appearance. It was Texas' third Sugar Bowl appearance and its first since 1958. In exchange for playing in the game, each team received $8.3 million. Thanks to revenue-sharing agreements with Big East conference members, Virginia Tech received $3.5 million, minus expenses, for playing in the Sugar Bowl. Pregame media coverage of the event focused on Virginia Tech making its first appearance in a major bowl game and Texas' resurgence as a major college football power. On the field, attention was focused on Virginia Tech's strong defense and Texas' successful offense.|$|E
5|$|The {{recession}} of the 1930s was only halted by the increasing tension as the Second World War loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield {{were set to}} work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city once again became a target for bombing raids. In total there were 16 raids over Sheffield, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> heavy bombing over the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940 (now known as the Sheffield Blitz) when the most substantial damage occurred. More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The subgenre has {{its origins}} in open world action {{adventure}} games popularized in Europe (and particularly the United Kingdom) throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The release of Grand Theft Auto (1997) marked a major commercial success for open-ended game design in North America, and featured a more marketable crime theme. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> popularity of its 3D sequel Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 {{that led to the}} widespread propagation of a more specific set of gameplay conventions consistent with a subgenre. The subgenre now includes many games from different developers all over the world where the player can control wide ranges of vehicles and weapons. The subgenre has evolved with greater levels of environmental detail and more realistic behaviors.|$|E

5|$|This was a cashless society; the {{settlers}} bartered their stores of water, wood, vegetables, meat, fish and bird feathers for clothes, tea, sugar, tools, tobacco and other commodities not {{available on the}} island – <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> whalers’ valuation {{that had to be}} accepted. These first settlers eventually left the island when they were bought out for £350 in September 1841 by businessmen Owen Poole and Richard Dawson (later joined by John Foulis) whose employees and others then settled on the island.|$|E
5|$|Two other fragmentary {{copies of}} the same decree were {{discovered}} later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees (the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of PtolemyIV, c. 218 BC). The Rosetta Stone is, therefore, no longer unique, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term Rosetta Stone is now used in other contexts as the name for the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.|$|E
5|$|York's first {{protectorate}} did {{not last}} long. Early in 1455 the king rallied sufficiently to return to power, at least nominally, with Somerset again wielding real power. Warwick returned to his estates, as did York and Salisbury, and the three started raising troops. Marching towards London, they encountered the king at St Albans, where the two forces clashed. The battle was brief and not particularly bloody, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first instance of armed hostilities between {{the forces of the}} Houses of York and Lancaster in the conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. It was also significant because it resulted in the capture of the king, and the death of Somerset.|$|E

5|$|In 837, Theophilos {{raised him}} {{to the rank of}} patrikios and sent him {{together}} with the general Theophobos in a campaign against the Abasgians, but the Byzantines were defeated. With the death of Theophilos, the young Michael III (r. 842–867) ascended the throne. As he was only two years old, a regency council was set up headed by Theodora. Bardas and his brother Petronas, as well as their relative Sergios Niketiates, were also members, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> logothete Theoktistos who quickly established himself as Theodora's chief advisor. Bardas still played {{an active role in the}} early days of the regency, encouraging Theodora to abandon Iconoclasm for good and taking part in the investigations that led to the deposition of the pro-iconoclast patriarch John the Grammarian and the restoration of the veneration of icons in 843. In 844, however, Theoktistos blamed Bardas for the desertions that led to the Byzantine defeat in the Battle of Mauropotamos against the Abbasids, even though the logothete himself led the Byzantine army, and had him exiled from Constantinople.|$|E
