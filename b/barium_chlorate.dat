40|$|International audienceTrains {{of short}} pulses {{in the manner}} of ‘delays {{alternating}} with nutations for tailored excitation’ (DANTE) have been applied to the Pake patterns of protons of water molecules trapped in a static powdered sample of <b>barium</b> <b>chlorate</b> monohydrate. The spin dynamics in the course of such experiments have been investigated by means of numerical simulations and compared with the ideal refocusing that can be achieved under magic-angle spinning (MAS). Solid echoes yield essentially undistorted lineshapes, in contrast to direct excitation without refocusing that leads to severe dispersions of the phases because of inhomogeneous interactions such as homonuclear dipolar couplings and anisotropic chemical shifts. The selectivity of DANTE sequences allows one to access ‘slices’ of the Pake pattern that can be related to particular crystallite orientations. Single-crystal spectra can therefore be extracted from powder spectra. A similar behavior is expected for both dipolar and quadrupolar echoes...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} {{effect of}} the chromium hydroxide film for the reduction of hypochlorite {{has so far been}} studied on gold, platinum and iron electrodes in sodium hydroxide and sodium chlorate solution.

In order to more clearly distinguish, the effects of the film, the addition of chromate and its effect on the cathodic reduction of hypochlorite in sodium and alkaline earth metal chlorates solutions, the studies were carried out in platinum electrode. It was found that the addition of chromate to the sodium chlorate solution suppresses the hypochlorite reduction by forming a thin layer of chromium hydroxide on the electrode surface.

40|$|AbstractThe NMR double-quantum {{response}} to a three-pulse sequence of dipolar coupled spin- 1 / 2 pairs in powder samples spinning at the magic angle is investigated for arbitrary spinning frequencies. It is shown that double-quantum spinning sideband patterns result from the rotor modulation of the Hamiltonian. The existence of rotor modulated double-quantum spectra is confirmed by experiments with spin pairs of protons in <b>barium</b> <b>chlorate</b> monohydrate. The understanding of these sideband patterns now allow quantitative analysis of the double-quantum spectra to yield structural information in rigid solids. This is demonstrated by application to malonic acid. By combining single and double quantum NMR spectra proton distances within functional groups are determined, as well as connectivities between them. The 1 H 1 H distance in the aliphatic group is 0. 18 nm and the shortest distance between two carboxylic protons in the dimer structure is 0. 22 nm. The closest aliphatic and carboxylic protons are separated by 0. 26 nm, in agreement with neutron diffraction data...|$|E
40|$|The water {{molecules}} in inorganic hydrate salts adopt different geometries and {{are involved in}} different hydrogen bond interactions. In this work, magic-angle spinning (MAS) and static 17 O solid-state NMR experiments are performed to characterize the 17 O electric field gradient (EFG) and chemical shift (CS) tensors of the {{water molecules}} {{in a series of}} inorganic salt hydrates which include: oxalic acid hydrate, <b>barium</b> <b>chlorate</b> hydrate, sodium perchlorate hydrate, lithium sulphate hydrate, and potassium oxalate hydrate, which were all enriched with 17 O water. Data were acquired at magnetic field strengths of 9. 4, 11. 75, and 21. 1 T. Gauge-including projector-augmented-wave density functional theory (GIPAW DFT) calculations are performed on <b>barium</b> <b>chlorate</b> hydrate and oxalic acid hydrate where structural changes including the Ow-H•••O distance, H-O-H angle, and O-H distance are employed to understand their impact on the NMR parameters. Furthermore, simplified molecular models consisting of a metal cation and a water molecule were built to establish the effect the M-Ow distance has on the parameters. The computational studies are then used to understand the experimental results. The 17 O quadrupolar coupling constant ranged from 6. 75 MHz in K 2 C 2 O 4 •H 2 O to 7. 39 MHz in NaClO 4 •H 2 O while the asymmetry parameter ranged from 0. 75 in NaClO 4 •H 2 O to 1. 0 in K 2 C 2 O 4 •H 2 O and the isotropic chemical shift ranged from - 15. 0 ppm in NaClO 4 •H 2 O to 19. 6 ppm in BaClO 3 •H 2 O. The computational results revealed the trends for each parameter, where there is an increasing trend for quadrupolar coupling constant and span as a function of increasing hydrogen bond distance, decreasing trend for the three chemical shift tensors as a function of increasing M-Ow distance and unclear trends for asymmetry parameter and skew due to competing electronic factors. Overall, this study provides benchmark 17 O NMR data for water molecules in crystalline hydrates, including the first measurement of 17 O chemical shift anisotropy for such materials...|$|E
40|$|Pressure and {{temperature}} dependence of ^ 3 ^ 5 Cl nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) {{has been investigated}} in NaClO_ 3 and Ba(ClO_ 3) _ 2 ·H_ 2 O. NQR frequencies are measured in the temperature range 77 – 300 K and up to 5 kbar pressure.

In general, the pressure effect on the internal motions {{is found to be}} less in Ba(ClO_ 3) _ 2 ·H_ 2 O compared to NaClO_ 3. When the samples are cooled to 77 K the pressure coeffecient of NQR frequency becomes nearly zero in sodium chlorate, whereas it retains a value of 6 kHz kbar^- 1 in <b>barium</b> <b>chlorate.</b> This behaviour follows from the fact that at 77 K, the torsional frequency in NaClO 3 is unaffected by the application of pressure while it increases at the rate 12 cm^- 1 kbar^- 1 in Ba(ClO_ 3) _ 2 ·H_ 2 O...|$|E
40|$|The {{dehydration}} of <b>barium</b> <b>chlorate</b> monohydrate is investigated as the monoclinic fully hydrated Ba(ClO 3) 2 ·H 2 O modification {{is transformed}} into the orthorhombic face centered (ofc) fully anhydrous Ba(ClO 3) 2. The underlying structural changes were followed, both on single crystal and powdered samples, {{as a function of}} their degree of dehydration using a combination of several experimental techniques which included Raman and infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, and thermodifferential analysis. The dehydration process gets thermally activated at T∼ 85 °C and the transition seems to proceed through intermediate steps, where the two phases coexist with a gradual dominance of the ofc phase as the temperature increases. The role of the loss of the water of crystallization in the process is clarified and the experimental results are interpreted by invoking a two-step mechanism for the accomplishment of the structural changes within the crystal. This comprises random nucleation and growth of clusters of vacancies, left by the exit of H 2 O molecules, which up to a certain critical size can retain the original crystal structure, followed by a sudden onset of the phase transition within each of the overcritically sized clusters. As this process goes on, the concentration of clusters increases and the transition gets further enhanced by cluster-cluster interactions. © 1978 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|Ultrawideline 137 Ba SSNMR {{spectra of}} several barium-containing systems (barium nitrate, barium carbonate, <b>barium</b> <b>chlorate</b> monohydrate, barium {{chloride}} dihydrate, anhydrous barium chloride, and barium hydrogen phosphate) were acquired at two different magnetic field strengths (9. 4 and 21. 1 T) using frequency-stepped techniques. The recently reported WURST-QCPMG pulse sequence (O 2 ̆ 019 Dell et al. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2008, 464, 97 - 102) {{is shown to}} be very useful for rapidly acquiring high signal-to-noise 137 Ba SSNMR spectra. The breadths of the second-order quadrupolar-dominated spectra and experimental times are notably reduced for experiments conducted at 21. 1 T. Analytical simulations of the 137 Ba SSNMR spectra at both fields yield the quadrupolar parameters, and in select cases the barium chemical shift anisotropies (CSAs). Quadrupolar interactions dominate the 137 Ba powder patterns, with quadrupolar coupling constants, CQ (137 Ba), ranging from 7. 0 to 28. 8 MHz. The 137 Ba electric field gradient (EFG) parameters extracted from these spectra are correlated to the local environments at the barium sites, via consideration of molecular symmetry and structure, and first principles calculations of 137 Ba EFG tensors performed using CASTEP software. The rapidity with which 137 Ba SSNMR spectra can be acquired using the WURST pulse sequence and/or at ultrahigh magnetic fields and {{the sensitivity of the}} 137 Ba EFG tensor parameters to the changes in the barium environment suggest that 137 Ba SSNMR has great potential for structural characterization of a variety of barium-containing materials.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the structures of biological systems, such as, fibril-forming peptides and proteins, membrane proteins, and viruses, by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has materialized as an important field due to the high-resolution details that the technique provides. While solid-state NMR {{studies have focused on}} the three prevalent spin I = 1 / 2 nuclei present in biomolecules, oxygen has largely been ignored as a probe of the structure of such systems. Described in this thesis are the results of studies to advance the use of solid-state ¹⁷O NMR spectroscopy for structure {{determination of}} biological molecules by utilizing the sensitivity of the electric field gradient (EFG) and chemical shift tensors of ¹⁷O. We demonstrated a distinct chemical shift range for bound water in crystalline amino acids and dipeptides and identified discordance between experimental and calculated EFG parameters. This difference was further studied via variable temperature ¹⁷O NMR experiments on <b>barium</b> <b>chlorate</b> monohydrate that demonstrated the effect of the librational motions of the bound water on the NMR measurable ¹⁷O quadrupolar coupling constant. A well resolved splitting in the ¹⁷O magic-angle spinning NMR spectrum was shown at the'rigid lattice limit of the bound water that was determined to be caused by the interaction between the ¹H-¹H dipole coupling and the ¹H-¹⁷O dipole couplings. Further study of bound water environments is presented exhibiting the ability to resolve multiple unique bound water environments in a single system by high-resolution ¹⁷O NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate the ability to utilize dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR to polarize multiple nuclei via an endogenous radical dopant that does not disrupt the native crystal structure. Efficient ¹⁷O labeling of a dipeptide is explored to enable the study of the dipeptide via ¹⁷O NMR. Utilizing one- and two-dimensional double resonance correlation spectroscopy, the interatomic correlations between oxygen and carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen atoms were explored, exhibiting the ability of ¹⁷O NMR to determine structural characteristics of biomolecular solids. A study on the use of DNP NMR to study biosilica entrapped proteins is also presented as part of this thesis. by Eric George Keeler. Thesis: Ph.
