40|$|Nicotine is the {{addictive}} {{substance in}} tobacco {{and it has}} a broad impact on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Over the past decades, an increasing number of genes potentially involved in <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> have been identified by different technical approaches. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> remain largely unclear. Under such situation, a comprehensive analysis focusing on the overall functional characteristics of these genes, as well as how they interact with each other will provide us valuable information to understand <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction.</b> In this study, we presented a systematic analysis on nicotine addiction-related genes to identify the major underlying biological themes. Functional analysis revealed that biological processes and biochemical pathways related to neurodevelopment, immune system and metabolism were significantly enriched in the nicotine addiction-related genes. By extracting the nicotine addiction-specific subnetwork, a number of novel genes associated with addiction were identified. Moreover, we constructed a schematic molecular network for <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> via integrating the pathways and network, providing an intuitional view to understand the development of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction.</b> Pathway and network analysis indicated that the biological processes related to <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> were complex.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a review {{regarding}} magnesium and zinc influence on smoking and tobacco addiction. Magnesium and zinc {{are two very}} important bivalent cations involved in different functions of central nervous system. There are different mechanisms by which magnesium can decrease the <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction.</b> Magnesium decrease the dopamine release and the NMDA receptor stimulation by glutamate (two essential steps in the devolopment of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction).</b> This cation also inhibits the synthesis of substance P and nitric oxide, others important neurotransmiters involved in addiction. Magnesium may decrease the nicotine effect on GABA synthesis and could reduce also NPY involvement in <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction.</b> Zinc also reduces the glutamatergic brain systems activity and modulates the nicotinic receptors activity from brain. The hypomagnesemia favorises the development of tobacco addiction. The magnesium treatment can be beneficial for reducing the smoking and <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> in heavy smokers. By increasing the magnesium concentration we can moderately improve the stimulation of the reward system and can reduce the needs of stimulation by nicotine or by others addictive substances. The treatment of intracellular and plasma magnesium deficit could be way to minimize the development of tobacco smoking and <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} has implicated the endocannabinoid (eCB) system in <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction.</b> The eCB system {{also has an}} important role in reward mechanisms, and <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> has been associated with aberrant reward processing. Motivated by this evidence, we tested the hypothesis that eCB modulation of reward processing is altered in subjects with a <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> (NAD). For this purpose, we compared reward-related activity in NAD with healthy controls (HC) in a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study using ¿ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration to challenge the eCB system. Eleven HC and 10 NAD participated in a 3 -T functional MRI (fMRI) study with a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled design, using a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) paradigm with three reward levels. Reward activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caudate putamen during anticipation and feedback of reward was compared after THC and placebo. fMRI results indicated a significant reduction of reward anticipation activity in the NAcc in NAD after THC administration, which was not present in HC. This is indicated by a significant group by drug by reward interaction. Our data show that THC significantly reduces the NAcc response to monetary reward anticipation in NAD. These results suggest that <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> is associated with altered eCB modulation of reward processing in the NAcc. This study adds important human data to existing evidence implicating the eCB system in <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The abuse {{liability}} of nicotine {{is comparable to}} or greater than that of a variety of addictive substances. However, the reinforcing and/or rewarding properties of addictive substances other than nicotine far outweigh the reinforcing and/or rewarding effects associated with nicotine use.

The present paper presents an overview of the role of learning in <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction.</b> In addition, recent advances in the identification of behavioral processes, neural substrates, and cellular and molecular substrates that underlie nicotine-associated alterations in learning are reviewed.

40|$|I {{have been}} {{conducting}} research on smoking for 30 years. The following recommendation is based on 40 studies our group has conducted to discover the pathophysiology of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction.</b> While most of these studies have been published, about a dozen of our most recent studies are still in press or under review, {{so much of this}} material, including some of the terms, will be unfamiliar to you. The DSM-III, III-R and IV nicotine dependence criteria were published without the APA having done any research to establish their validity. The criteria that I will recommend are {{based on the results of}} 13 years of continuous research involving over 20, 000 individual interviews, 3 long-term prospective studies and dozens of surveys of a total of about 50, 000 individuals. Through this effort we have been able to establish the pathophysiology of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> beyond any reasonable scientific doubt by replicating all of our findings at least once. At last it is possible to derive a definition of nicotine dependence from an understanding of the disease process. However, to understand the pathophysiology of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> it is necessary to first put aside the assumption that DSM-IV describes the core features of the disease, for it does not. Based on the pathophysiology of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction,</b> which will be explained below, it is possible to define nicotine dependence in 20 words, with a single criterion. Nicotine dependence can be diagnosed when a patient experiences a recurrent and periodic wanting, craving, or needing for tobacco.

40|$|Abstract In their commentary, Dar and Frenk {{call into}} {{question}} the validity of all published data that describe the onset of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction.</b> They argue that the data that describe the early onset of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> is so different from the conventional wisdom that it is irrelevant. In this rebuttal, the author argues that the conventional wisdom cannot withstand an application of the scientific method that requires that theories be tested and discarded when they are contradicted by data. The author examines the origins of the threshold theory that has represented the conventional wisdom concerning the onset of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> for 4 decades. The major tenets of the threshold theory are presented as hypotheses followed by an examination of the relevant literature. Every tenet of the threshold theory is contradicted by all available relevant data and yet it remains the conventional wisdom. The author provides an evidence-based account of the natural history of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction,</b> including its onset and development as revealed by case histories, focus groups, and surveys involving tens of thousands of smokers. These peer-reviewed and replicated studies are the work of independent researchers from around the world using a variety of measures, and they provide a consistent and coherent clinical picture. The author argues that the scientific method demands that the fanciful conventional wisdom be discarded and replaced with the evidence-based description of <b>nicotine</b> <b>addiction</b> that is backed by data. The author charges that in their attempt to defend the conventional wisdom in the face of overwhelming data to the contrary, Dar and Frenk attempt to destroy the credibility of all who have produced these data. Dar and Frenk accuse other researchers of committing methodological errors and showing bias in the analysis of data when in fact Dar and Frenk commit several errors and reveal their bias by using a few outlying data points to misrepresent an entire body of research, and by grossly and consistently mischaracterizing the claims of those whose research they attack. </p...|$|R
