The data on average concentration of macro and trace components, organic matter, pH of <b>bog</b> <b>waters</b> are obtained.

40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} silicon species in organic-rich waters {{is a very}} {{significant}} problem. This type of waters is widely spread all over the world. It {{is characterized by a}} high content of humic substances, high color of water and low pH. In this regard, a certain determination of silicon concentration in this type of waters is impossible without a preliminary investigation of silicon species. The aim of this research is therefore an investigation of the ratio of silicon dissolved forms in organic-rich waters depending on the silicon concentration and the acidity of the water. The study of pH influence on silicic acids and a silicon–humic matter interaction was carried out using model solutions and natural <b>bog</b> <b>waters</b> (Tomsk region). It has been found that the degree of polymerization of silicic acids essentially depends on the acidity of a solution. Scanning of spectrophotometric measurements has shown that silicon does not form stable complexes with fulvic and humic acids in weak-acid media (рН 3 - 4). Studying the <b>bog</b> <b>waters</b> of Tomsk Region has shown that they (рН= 3. 66 - 3. 80) contain only monomeric-dimeric and polymeric forms of silicic acids...|$|R
50|$|The {{landscape}} {{to the east}} and west of the river is also remarkable. Peat extraction in the 17th and 18th century turned vast low-lying fens into a collection of shallow, man-made lakes and <b>bogs.</b> <b>Water</b> lilies, reeds, swamps and wooded areas have developed spontaneously from the old peat canals (trekgaten) where the peat was extracted. A total of about 70 square kilometres have been designated as a series of nature reserves and are part of the European Natura 2000 scheme.|$|R
2500|$|The film {{is set at}} a young couple's wedding on Craggy Island in 1740. A ship {{bringing}} alcohol for {{the wedding}} loses its cargo in a storm. The attendees are devastated.

2500|$|The primary {{habitat of}} the uplands {{consists}} of heath and bog. The mountain blanket bogs formed around 4,000 {{years ago as}} a result of a combination of climate change and human activity. Prior to this, the mountains were cloaked with pine forest. A change in the climate to wetter and milder weather left the ground waterlogged and leached nutrients from the soil, leading to the formation of peat. Mountain blanket bog is found in areas above [...] in altitude and where there are more than 175 days rainfall a year. The most important builders of peat are the Sphagnum bog mosses. Carnivorous plants such as sundews and butterworts are specific to boglands and bog asphodel and bog cotton are also common. <b>Bog</b> <b>water</b> is important for the reproduction of dragonflies and damselflies and the Wicklow mountain bogs also support insects such as pond skaters, whirligig beetles, water boatmen and midges as well as the common frog and the viviparous lizard. Wading birds such as snipes, curlews and golden plover feed in the waterlogged bogland.|$|E
60|$|The {{climate of}} Chattuc is {{excessively}} damp and hot throughout the year, but though sunk amid interminable swamps, {{the place is}} perfectly healthy! Such indeed is {{the character of the}} climate throughout the Jheels, where fevers and agues are rare; and though no situations can appear more malarious to the common observer than Silhet and Cachar, they are in fact eminently salubrious. These facts admit of no explanation in the present state of our knowledge of endemic diseases. Much may be attributed to the great amount and purity of the water, the equability of the climate, the absence of forests and of sudden changes from wet to dry; but such facts afford no satisfactory explanation. The water, as I have above said, is of a rich chesnut-brown in the narrow creeks of the Jheels, and is golden yellow by transmitted light, owing no doubt, as in <b>bog</b> <b>water</b> and that of dunghills, to a vegetable extractive and probably the presence of carburetted hydrogen. Humboldt mentions this dark-coloured water as prevailing in some of the swamps of the Cassiquares, at the junction of the Orinoco and Amazon, and gives much curious information on its accompanying features of animal and vegetable life.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of {{increased}} atmospheric N input on N availability in ombrotrophic peatlands, the relative concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were measured in <b>bog</b> <b>waters</b> along a natural gradient of atmospheric N deposition. Six European bogs were selected, spanning a range of chronic atmospheric N inputs from 0. 2 to 2. 0 g m- 2 yr- 1. DIN as well as DON concentrations increased with N deposition, the latter increasing at a sharper incline. The increase in DIN concentrations {{was related to the}} reduced capacity of the moss layer to trap atmospheric N, which in turn was a result of N saturation of the moss layer. The enhanced DON concentrations appear to be a consequence of increased leaching of organic N compounds by Sphagnum.
