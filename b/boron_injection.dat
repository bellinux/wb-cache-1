50|$|On April 9, 2014, a flood {{challenged}} the cooling systems. A water leak disabled an electrical control system, causing a temporary loss of {{full control of}} reactor systems, and <b>boron</b> <b>injection</b> into the primary cooling system was used to cause an emergency shutdown.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the steady state and {{transient}} behavior of CNA-II, several tasks were required. Methods and models were developed in several areas. HELIOS lattice models were developed and benchmarked against WIMS/MCNP 5 results generated by NA-SA. Cross-sections for the coupled RELAP 5 /PARCS calculation were extracted from HELIOS within the GenPMAXS framework. The validation of both HELIOS and PARCS was performed primarily by comparisons to WIMS/PUMA and MCNP for idealized models. Special methods were developed to model the control rods and <b>boron</b> <b>injection</b> systems of CNA-II. The insertion of the rods is oblique, and a special routine was added to PARCS to treat this effect. CFD results combined with specialized mapping routines were used to model the <b>boron</b> <b>injection</b> system. In all cases there was good agreement in the results which provided confidence in the neutronics methods and modeling. A coupled code benchmark between U of M and U of Pisa is ongoing and results are still preliminary. Under a LOCA transient, the best estimate behavior of the core appears to be acceptable...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the energetics and electronic structure of multiatomic vacancies in hexagonal boron nitrideh-BN {{based on the}} local-density approximation in the density-functional theory. We find that the energeticsof vacancies strongly depends {{not only on the}} environmental condition of boron and nitrogen chemical potentialsbut also on electron chemical potentials of these systems. Under nitrogen- and electron-rich conditions, thetriangular vacancy comprised of one nitrogen and three boron atoms is a geometrically favorable structure. Wealso find that the atomic structure of vacancies depends on their charge state. In vacancies with nitrogen edges,the distance between the next-nearest-neighbor nitrogen atoms increases on injection with excess electrons. Incontrast, the distance between the next-nearest-neighbor boron atoms decreases for vacancies with <b>boron</b> edgeson <b>injection</b> with excess electrons. Our detailed analysis of electronic structures of vacancies unravels theorigin of the structural modification of vacancies with regard to their charge state...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{distributions}} and {{radial density}} {{profiles of the}} fast confined trapped alpha particles in DT experiments on TFTR are being measured in the energy range 0. 5 [...] 3. 5 MeV using a Pellet Charge eXchange (PCX) diagnostic. A {{brief description of the}} measurement technique which involves active neutral particle analysis using the ablation cloud surrounding an injected impurity pellet as the neutralizer is presented. This paper focuses on alpha and triton measurements in the core of MHD quiescent TFTR discharges where the expected classical slowing down and pitch angle scattering effects are not complicated by stochastic ripple diffusion and sawtooth activity. In particular, the first measurement of the alpha slowing down distribution up to the birth energy, obtained using <b>boron</b> pellet <b>injection,</b> is presented. The measurements are compared with predictions using either the TRANSP Monte-Carlo code and/or a Fokker-Planck Post-TRANSP processor code, which assumes that the alphas and tritons are well confined and slow down classically. Both the shape of the measured alpha and triton energy distributions and their density ratios are in good agreement with the code calculations. The authors conclude that the PCX measurements are consistent with classical thermalization of the fusion-generated alphas and tritons...|$|R
40|$|Osteosarcoma is a {{malignant}} tumor {{commonly found in}} human and animals. The ability of boric acid (BA) to accumulate in osteosarcoma due to the mechanism of the bone formation of cancer cells would make boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) an alternative therapy for osteosarcoma. This study evaluated the feasibility of using BA as the boron drug for BNCT of bone cancer. The cytotoxicity of BA to L 929 cells exceeded that of UMR- 106 cells. With 25 mu g (10) B/mL medium of BA treatment, the boron concentration in UMR- 106 cells was higher than that in L 929 cells. The biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of BA in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were studied by administrating 25 mg (10) B/kg body weight to SD rats. Blood boron level decreased rapidly within one hour after BA <b>injection.</b> <b>Boron</b> concentration in the long bone was 4 - 6 time {{higher than that of}} blood. Results {{of this study suggest that}} BA may be a potential drug for BNCT for osteosarcoma. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|At room {{temperature}} yellow photoluminescence {{with a broad}} peak of 2. 13 eV is a well-known feature of boron-doped 6 H-SiC. Usually yellow luminescence is regarded as recombination involving both the boron-related deep acceptor and donor level. But {{the nature of the}} deep level has not been clearly understood yet. We annealed 6 H-SiC substrates by current in vacuum without <b>boron</b> <b>injection</b> at the temperature of 1350 and 1500 ºC. We received red and yellow luminescence in PL spectrum for the heated 6 H-SiC. The luminescence was regarded as donor-acceptor pair recombination involving the deep aluminum acceptor related to the adjacent carbon vacancies and nitrogen donor or the formation of quantum well like regions of 3 C-SiC in 6 H-SiC matrix...|$|E
40|$|Atucha- 2 is a Siemens-designed PHWR reactor under {{construction}} in the Republic of Argentina. Its geometrical complexity and (e. g., oblique Control Rods, Positive Void coefficient) required a developed and validated complex three dimensional (3 D) neutron kinetics (NK) coupled thermal hydraulic (TH) model. Reactor shut-down is obtained by oblique CRs and, during accidental conditions, by an emergency shut-down system (JDJ) injecting a highly concentrated boron solution (boron clouds) in the moderator tank, the boron clouds reconstruction is obtained using a CFD (CFX) code calculation. A complete LBLOCA calculation implies {{the application of the}} RELAP 5 - 3 D© system code. Within the framework of the third Agreement “NA-SA – University of Pisa” a new RELAP 5 - 3 D control system for the <b>boron</b> <b>injection</b> system was developed and implemented in the validated RELAP 5 - 3 D/NESTLE model of the Atucha 2 NPP.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental validation of RELAP 5 and TRACE 5 for licensing {{studies of the}} Atucha II-PHWR nuclear power plant. A scaled experimental facility, representing the <b>boron</b> <b>injection</b> system of Atucha II, was built. The system has a fundamental importance for loss of coolant accidents (LOCA) and anticipated transients without scram (ATWS). The experiment consists of the discharge of a tank that represents the boron tank filled with air or a mixture of air-water onto a discharge tank that represents the moderator tank. Both tanks are connected by a pipe which includes a valve and an orifice plate to model the pressure losses due to the fittings in the real system. The pressure and water level measured in the tanks are compared with the RELAP 5 and TRACE 5 predictions. The codes predict the pressure in the tanks accurately. However, both codes overpredict the heat transfer in the boron tank air-water interface which produces a greater expansion of the air {{which leads to a}} small discrepancy in the boron tank level prediction...|$|E
40|$|Background: Boron {{neutron capture}} therapy (BNCT) {{is a form}} of {{radiation}} therapy and has been proposed for the treatment of some malignancies with encouraging results. However, none of them has ever been applied to liver malignancy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the potential of boron-lipiodol (B-lipiodol) for the treatment of VX 2 liver tumor via BNCT Materials and Methods: Twelve New Zealand rabbits were randomly separated into two groups: lipiodol and boron-lipiodol groups. The rabbits were anesthetized, a midline incision was made and the left lobe of the liver was injected with 0. 1 ml of VX 2 tumor cells. After the tumor reached 2 - 3 cm in diameter, the rabbits were anesthetized and 0. 5 ml of boron-lipiodol was injected into the hepatic artery via an angiocatheter. Liver function tests and renal function tests were performed before, at 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days after injection of drugs in both groups. The concentration of boron in various tissues was determined on the 7 th day after injection. Results: Liver function was abnormal at 12 hours after injection, and then gradually returned to normal at 7 days, indicative of acute temporary hepatic damage. As for the renal function, no significant change was noted in either group. The boron level was 49. 7 ppm in tumor and 631 ppm in the healthy liver 7 days after injection of B-lipiodol. The ratio of boron concentrations between the tumor and the normal liver tissue was 7. 87 As for blood and other organs including spleen, heart and kidney, the concentration of boron was low. In the lipiodol group, the boron concentrations in tumor and various organs were low. Conclusion: The high concentration of <b>boron</b> after intra-arterial <b>injection</b> of B-lipiodol can be used for neutron capture therapy. B-lipiodol has potential for the treatment of liver malignancy...|$|R

40|$|Heavy {{water in}} tissues may {{influence}} {{on the effects of}} boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). If light water is replaced with heavy water in tissues， boron containing compounds and the other drugs might remain in the tumor tissues for a longer time. A neutron beam seems to penetrate deeper through the heavy water than through the light water in biological tissues. Therefore， the author had experimented on the rat C 6 glioma with boron neutron capture therapy after the animals had been given heavy water in place of their normal water supply and furthermore experimentally the effect of heavy water has been investigated. 1. BNCT with heavy water. The investigation was carried out in Wistar albino rats weighing approximately 300 g at the begining of the experiment. A thermal neutron fluence of 1. 0 x 10 ^ 13 neutrons/cm^ 2 was planned. In the first experiment， 1. 0 x 10 ^ 5 cells were implanted stereotactically into the right caudate nucleus of four rats. Two weeks later，the author brought these rats to the Musashi Atomic Energy Research Laboratory. These rats were set on an acryl plate in the prone position after pentobarbital anesthesia. They were put into aluminum cans covered with a thin lead sheet to protect their bodies from the gamma ray contamination of the beam. The thickness of cans was 3 mm. On the other hand，their restricted heads were exposed in the thermal neutron irradiation field. Two days after irradiation， these rats were sacrificed and coronal sections of brains were cut down. The specimens were stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin and examined histopathologically. In the second experiment，all rats were fed heavy water orally on demand for two days before irradiation and injected with 50 μg/g-body weight boron compounds into the peritoneal cavity six hours before irradiation. The doses of thermal neutron in these two sequential experiments were determined by activation of gold foils set {{at the back of the}} rats 2 ̆ 7 heads. The doses were 8. 41 x 10 ^ 12 neutrons/cm^ 2 and 1. 17 x 10 ^ 13 neutrons/cm^ 2 respectively，and were satisfactorily close to our initially anticipated fluence. The gamma ray dose was 156. 1 rad on the body and 375. 6 rad on the head of the animal. Histological findings in the first experiment were that three of four rats showed advanced tumor growth. On the other hand，only one rat in the second group showsd tumor growth and intratumoral necrosis. " 2. Pharmacokinetic study on boron compound with heavy water. The investigation was carried out in Fisher rats weighing 150 - 200 g at the begining of the experiment. 4. 0 x 10 ^ 5 rat 9 L gliosarcoma cells were implanted into the subcutaneous region of the right latus. 8 rats (group A) were injected with heavy water into the peritoneal cavity everyday for 5 days. 6 rats (group B) were injected with light water. On the 6 th day, 100 μg/g-body weight boron compounds (BSH) was injected into the peritoneal cavith of all rats. 4 rats of A group and 3 rats of B group were sacrified on 6 hours after boron injcction. Other rats were sacrified on 12 hours after <b>boron</b> <b>injection.</b> Boron concentration in brain tissue and blood and tumor tissue were calculated. Boron concentration in tumor tissue was higher in A group than in B group. Such an experimental results might be contributory to clinical application of boron neuton capture therapy of brain tumors in near future. "医歯学総合研究科博士論文(医学); 学位取得日: 平成 7 年 3 月 14...|$|E
