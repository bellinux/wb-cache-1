5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained <b>by</b> <b>means</b> of the attitude control system. Towards {{the end of the}} coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) <b>by</b> <b>means</b> of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
