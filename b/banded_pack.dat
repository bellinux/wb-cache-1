40|$|This article {{deals with}} the packing problem of {{irregular}} items allocated into a rectangular sheet to minimize the waste. Conventional solution is not visual during the packing process. It obtains a reasonable and relatively satisfactory solution between the nesting time and nesting solution. This article adopts a physical method that uses rubber <b>band</b> <b>packing</b> algorithm to simulate a rubber <b>band</b> wrapping those <b>packing</b> irregular items. The simulation shows a visual and fast packing process. The resultant rubber band force is applied in the packing items to translate, rotate, and slide them to make the area decrease and obtain a high packing density. An improved analogy QuickHull algorithm is presented to obtain extreme points of rubber band convex hull. An adaptive module could set a variable rubber band force and a variable time step to make a proper convergence and no intersection. A quick convex decomposition method is used {{to solve the problem}} of concave polygon. A plural vector expression approach is adopted to calculate the resultant vector of the rubber band force. Several cases are compared with the benchmark problems to prove rubber <b>band</b> <b>packing</b> algorithm performance...|$|R

The discussions were so lengthy that the Ojibwe had little time to plant their regular spring crops. As a result, they had to go to Sandy Lake to gain payments and supplies for their survival. In the fall of 1850, representatives from 19 Ojibwe <b>bands</b> <b>packed</b> up and started the arduous journey to the shores of Sandy Lake, where they had been told to gather by late October.

5000|$|Many animals, {{including}} humans, tend {{to live in}} groups, herds, flocks, <b>bands,</b> <b>packs,</b> shoals, or colonies (hereafter: groups) of conspecific individuals. The size {{of these}} groups, as expressed {{by the number of}} participant individuals, is an important aspect of their social environment. Group size tend to be highly variable even within the same species, thus we often need statistical measures to quantify group size and statistical tests to compare these measures between two or more samples. Group size measures are notoriously hard to handle statistically since groups sizes typically follow an aggregated (right-skewed) distribution: most groups are small, few are large, and a very few are very large.|$|R
