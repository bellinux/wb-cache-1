40|$|The {{quality of}} {{dialysis}} fluids {{has become increasingly}} important {{in the treatment of}} HD patients. Purified water represents over 95 % of its volume. Bacterial and endotoxin content of Reverse Osmosis (RO) water is usually kept under control by <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters,</b> inserted in the distribution departure loop, and by monthly disinfection of the distribution circuit; the simpler the circuit, the better. This paper reports 12 years experience during which Ultraviolet Irradiation (UV) has replaced <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters.</b> To keep the bacterial growth under control in a complex RO water circuit (including a tank and multiple loops) a simple UV lamp was inserted in the departure line. It proved sufficient to keep bacterial count within AAMI norms. Failure of the UV lamp was associated with a rise of up to 500 cfu/ml in the last (fourth week) before routine disinfection. Normal levels were again obtained after replacement of the UV lamp. Six years later, a second UV lamp was added on the return loop. Bacterial counts and endotoxin levels in RO water promptly fell to < 1 cfu/ml and < 0. 125 EU, till today. It is concluded that UV lamps should be favoured over <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters</b> in systems that are not disinfected daily, such as the RO water circuit. The principle of UV irradiation is explained and its advantage over <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters</b> is discussed. Future possible applications of UV are presented...|$|R

40|$|Background/PurposeIn {{order to}} reduce the {{contamination}} in the ventilator, <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters</b> were placed on the expiratory limb of a ventilator circuit. Aerosolized mucolytic agents may increase the resistance of the ventilator. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the impact of aerosolized mucolytic agents on the pressure change during mechanical ventilation. MethodsA lung model was investigated with mucolytic inhaled agents of 10 % acetylcysteine and 2 % hypertonic saline. The agents were administered using a jet nebulizer every 45 minutes for 15 minutes. The pressure drop was measured after nebulization. The end point was referred to the 45 th dose or obstruction of the filter. Furthermore, the pressure drop after steam autoclaving was also measured. ResultsThe maximum pressure was significantly higher with 10 % acetylcysteine than with 2 % sodium chloride (39. 32  ±  7. 22  cmH 2 O vs. 3. 53  ±  0. 90  cmH 2 O, p <  0. 001). With acetylcysteine filters, the pressure drop over 4  cmH 2 O occurred earlier and had a good relationship between the degree of pressure drop and doses. The acetylcysteine group yielded a significant difference in the pressure drop compared to the newly autoclaved and the end point of inhalation (p =  0. 043). ConclusionThis study demonstrated the aerosolized mucolytic agents could increase the pressure drop of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters</b> during mechanical ventilation. The pressure drop of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters</b> was higher with 10 % acetylcysteine. It is critical to continuously monitor the expiration resistance, auto-positive end-expiratory pressure, and ventilator output waveform when aerosolized 10 % acetylcysteine was used in mechanical ventilation patients...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{interrupter}} {{technique is}} increasingly used in preschool children to assess airway resistance (Rint). Use of a <b>bacterial</b> <b>filter</b> {{is essential for}} prevention of cross-infection in a clinical setting. It is not known how large an effect this extra resistance and compliance exert upon interrupter measurements, especially on obstructive airways and in smaller children. We aim to determine {{the contribution of the}} filter to Rint, in a sample of children attending lung function testing at an asthma clinic. METHODS: Interrupter measurements were performed according to ATS/ERS guidelines during quiet normal breathing at an expiratory flow trigger of 200 ml s(- 1), with the child seated upright with cheeks supported and wearing a nose clip. A minimum of 10 interrupter measurements was made with and without a <b>bacterial</b> <b>filter.</b> Spirometric and plethysmographic tests were also performed. RESULTS: A small but significant difference (0. 12 (95 % CI 0. 06 - 0. 17) kPa s L(- 1), P = 0. 0002) with 2 x SD of 0. 34 kPa s L(- 1) was observed between Rint with and without filter in 39 children, with a large spread. This difference was not dependent on Rint magnitude, age or height, nor on lung function parameters (effective resistance, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, and maximal expiratory flow at 50 % of expired vital capacity). CONCLUSIONS: A <b>bacterial</b> <b>filter</b> causes a small difference but is not clinically significant, with a wide spread comparable to the variability of the technique and recommended cut-offs for assessing repeatability and bronchodilation.

The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate if any micro-organisms can be yielded from used internal machines’ breathing-circuit-system. Based on such results objective reprocessing intervals could be defined. Methods: The internal parts of 40 anesthesia machines’ breathing-circuit-system were investigated. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were performed. An on-site process observation of the re-processing sequence was conducted. Results: Bacterial growth was found in 17 of 40 machines (43 %). No significant difference was ascertained between the contamination and the processing intervals. The most common contaminants retrieved were coagulase negative Staphylococci, aerobe spore forming bacteria and Micrococcus species. In one breathing-circuit-system, Escherichia coli, and in one further Staphylococcus aureus were yielded. Conclusion: Considering the availability of <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters</b> installed on the outlet of the breathing-circuit-systems, the type of bacteria retrieved and the on-site process observation, we conclude that the contamination found is best explained by a lack of adherence to hygienic measures during and after re-processing of the internal breathing-circuit-system. These results support an extension of the re-processing interval of the anesthesia apparatus longer than the manufacturer’s recommendation of one week. However, the importance of adherence to standard hygienic measures during re-processing needs to be emphasized...|$|R

Disturbed samples from an Alfisol topsoil and subsoil were used to fill 15 cm long soil columns. A pulse of bacterial suspension (initial concentration of 1011 cells ml- 1) was applied to the top of each soil column followed by the application of sterile water. Bacteria were counted in effluent portions and in soil using microscopy. Large variations were observed in the shape of breakthrough curves; effluent bacterial concentrations were occasionally larger than influent concentrations. We developed the &# 8216;limited entrapment model&# 8217; to simulate the observed bacterial transport. The model assumes that (a) the capacity of soil pore space to trap bacteria is limited, (b) the bacteria entrapment rate depends on the amount of trapped bacteria and that the entrapment accelerates as the amount of trapped bacteria approaches the soil trapping capacity, and (c) the trapped bacteria form cell clusters that may be released back to the soil solution but travel slowly and may become re-trapped because of their size.

Two hundred grams of each powder of material was added to 300  ml distilled water in the ratio of 2 : 3 (w/v) and were shaken for 24  h at 200  rpm. The pulverized mass of plant leaves was squeezed through a double-layered muslin cloth and then centrifuged at 5000  rpm for 20  min at 4  °C.

The chicken thighs were stored at- 18 ° C. for 4 weeks and thawed at 0. 6 ° C. for 20 hr. They were then inoculated with a 24 hr. culture of Salmonella typhimurium. The number of S. typhimurium of each chicken thigh was determined before and after freezing using the most probable number (MPN) method. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} showed that {{there was no significant difference}} (P <. 05) between the freezing methods. However, it was possible to rank the freezing methods according to the average percentage reduction in the total viable aerobic microorganisms and the average percentage reduction in S. typhimurium.

40|$|Summary. Background: The {{burden of}} {{childhood}} respiratory illness is large in low and {{middle income countries}} (LMICs). Infant lung function (ILF) testing may provide useful information about lung growth and susceptibility to respiratory disease. However, ILF has not beenwidelyavailable in LMICs settings where the greatest burden of childhood respiratory disease occurs. Aim: To implement and evaluate a pilot study of ILF testing in a semi-rural setting in South Africa. Method: Infant lung function testing was established at a community hospital in South Africa. All measures were done in unsedated infants during sleep. Measurements, made with the infant quietly breathing through a face mask and <b>bacterial</b> <b>filter,</b> included tidal breathing (TBFVL), exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), and sulphur hexafluoride multiple breath washout (MBW) measures using an ultrasonic flow meter and chemoluminescent NO analyzer. Results: Twenty infants, mean age of 7. 7 (SD 2. 9) weeks were tested; 8 (40 %) were Black African and 12 (60 %) were mixed race. Five (25 %) infants were preterm. There were 19 (95 %) successful TBFVL and NO tests and 18 (90 %) successful MBW tests. Themean tidal volume was 30. 5 ml (SD 5. 9), respiratory rate 50. 2 breaths per minute (SD 8. 7), and eNO 10. 4 ppb (SD 7. 3). The mean MBW measures were: functional residual capacity 71 ml (SD 13) and the lung clearance index 7. 6 (SD 0. 5). The intra-subject coefficient of variations (CV) of lung function measures were similar to published normative data for Caucasian European infants.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One, and subsequently two UV lamps were inserted in a complex RO water distribution circuit, devoid of <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters.</b> RO water <b>bacterial</b> content was checked weekly between RO water distribution disinfections. RESULTS: With one UV lamp on the departure of the RO water circuit, bacterial results remained negative (< 1 cfu/ml) till the second week after disinfection.

Geosmin is naturally produced by numerous cyanobacteria and actinomycetes in surface waters. Although it is non-toxic, it causes an unpleasant taste and odor even {{at very low}} concentrations. Water utilities, therefore, often must expend great effort and funds to remove geosmin to avoid customer complaints when the compound {{is present in the}} source water. Saint Paul Regional Water Services in St. Paul, MN successfully uses granular activated carbon (GAC) filters to remove geosmin from its drinking water, but, curiously, the useful life of their full-scale GAC filters has exceeded estimates based on batch sorption isotherms and AdDesignS modeling. It has been hypothesized that geosmin-degrading microorganisms on the GAC filters degrade geosmin, thereby extending the GAC filter bed life. In this study, the microbial communities growing in full-scale, biologically active GAC filters at Saint Paul Regional Water Services were characterized using automated ribosomal spacer analysis (ARISA) and high throughput DNA sequencing (Illumina sequencing) of 16 S rRNA gene fragments. This study showed that Saint Paul Regional Water Services has highly diverse <b>bacterial</b> <b>filter</b> communities that are functionally stable throughout year. Illumina sequencing revealed that a dominatnt bacterial phylum on the GAC filters was Nitrospira and that pathogen levels (e. g., Enterobacteria) were negligible. Additionally, the effects of mediatype and inoculation on the development of a geosmindegrading bacterial community on GAC filters was investigated using a pilot-scale column system that was fed geosmin. A geosmin-degrading biofilm developed after 40 days of being enriched with 100 ng/L of geosmin. Additionally, the geosmin-degrading organisms proved to be robust in {{that they were able to}} resume geosmin degradation after 6 weeks when geosmin was absent.

40|$|SYNOPSIS Experiments are {{described}} with glass fibre filter paper and complete glass filters as fitted to high pre-vacuum autoclaves {{to determine whether}} organisms can grow or penetrate through the filters. A filter consisting of four layers of glass fibre paper fitted inside a sterilizer chamber {{for a year and}} used for 96 sterilization cycles was found to have retained its initial efficiency. Many high pre-vacuum sterilizers are now fitted with glass fibre filters. These are of much greater efficiency than the types of filter previously in use (M. R. C. Report, 1960). A glass fibre filter should be changed once every 12 months although this recom-mendation is to some extent arbitrary as many filters would probably give satisfactory service for a longer period. In places where there is much atmospheric pollution a coarse pre-filter will extend the life of the absolute filter. Although these filters are highly efficient in removing bacteria from the air which passes through them, the possibility exists that micro-organisms might grow through them as has been found with other types of <b>bacterial</b> <b>filter.</b> Experiments were carried out both with an intact filter and with the glass fibre filter medium which consisted of glass fibre felted into sheet-form of paper thickness. 2 The outside of the filter was soaked with a broth culture of organisms, on one occasion Pseudomonas pyocyanea and on other occasions Chromobacterium prodigiosum (Serratia marcesens), and was incubated (in a closed container {{in order to keep the}} filter moist) either at room tem-perature or at 37 °C. for a week on each occasion.

In both cases, however, {{a major part of the}} radioactivity was not excreted even in 24 h. Sterile conditions were used to collect the radioactive material directly from the bladder. When chondroitin 4 -sulphate was injected, the molecular sizes of injected and excreted materials were similar, as assessed by gel chromatography on Sephadex G- 200, whereas when proteoglycan was injected the molecular size of the excreted labelled material was similar to that of the chondroitin 4 -sulphate chains in the original proteoglycan. In neither case did the size of the excreted labelled material change with time over 1 h, and low-molecular-weight labelled material was virtually absent. In contrast, when urine was collected for 24 h without preservative the labelled material in it was extensively degraded after either the proteoglycan or chondroitin 4 -sulphate had been given. Chondroitin 4 -sulphate became similarly degraded when incubated with non-sterile urine, but not when the urine was passed through a <b>bacterial</b> <b>filter,</b> suggesting that degradation was caused by contaminating micro-organisms in the experiments in which urine was collected for 24 h. It is concluded that chondroitin 4 -sulphate chains of about 18000 molecular weight can be excreted readily as such, whereas intact proteoglycans must be degraded to free glycosaminoglycans first, although both are taken up by the tissues more rapidly than they are excreted...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Hospital {{infections are}} one of the {{important}} reasons of mortality and incurred expenses. Therefore, we must control these infections by identifying contamination sources. The aim of this study was the determination of bacterial pollution of corrugated anesthesia sets in surgical rooms. Methods: This study was an analytic-description one performed in training hospitals of Yazd city. Research sample was 440 cases provided from different parts of corrugate after completing the anesthesia period by wet sterile swabs and transferred to culture media. On Thursday, each week, a sample from different parts of tube after sterilizing with cetrimide solution was obtained. Finally, after 24 hours, culture medias were studied for colony growth. Results: Obtained results indicated that of 440 cases taken samples, 343 cases were without bacterial pollution, 71 cases (19. 29 %) had bacterial pollution of samples before sterilizing and 26 cases (36. 1 %) were polluted after tube sterilizing. Conclusion: Sampling and culturing from used equipment and tools in hospital is one of the important actions for identifying and controlling hospital infections. Obtained results from this study indicated that of 440 cases, there were 97 cases of pollution. Therefore, it is suggested that anti <b>bacterial</b> <b>filters</b> should be installed before Y form piece of tubes in anesthesia machines and disposable corrugated tubes should replace traditional tubes. In addition, it seems necessary that wider investigations should be done...|$|R
40|$|Rhizobium japonicum {{cells were}} grown in liquid {{suspension}} cultures and separated from soybean plant cells by {{two to three}} <b>bacterial</b> membrane <b>filters.</b> Under these conditions, the plant cells elaborated materials into the medium which aided in {{the expression of a}} major rhizobial phenotype, namely, nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction). The evolution of H 2 was also measured and this activity relative to acetylene reduction, was influenced by: (a) O 2; (b) the quantity of conditioned plant medium; and (c) ammonia. It is concluded that plant substances are of major importance in the H 2 evolution and nitrogenase activities of free-living rhizobia in suspension cultures...|$|R
