5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, {{it is by no}} fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
5|$|Using her {{influence}} at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: You {{can have}} the most beautiful {{city in the world}} as appearance goes, the streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept... <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.|$|E
25|$|I {{might put}} it this way. The story is cast {{in terms of a}} good side, and a bad side, beauty against {{ruthless}} ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> as it were, taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the questions of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless...|$|E

500|$|Artist Richard Chopping {{once again}} {{provided}} the cover art for the novel. On 20 July 1960 Fleming wrote to Chopping {{to ask if}} he could undertake the art for the next book, agreeing on a fee of 200 guineas, saying that [...] "I will ask [...] to produce an elegant skeleton hand and an elegant Queen of Hearts. As to the dagger, I really have no strong views. I had thought of the ordinary flick knife as used by teenagers on people like you and me, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a nice dagger in mind please let us use it. The title of the book will be Thunderball. It is immensely long, immensely dull and only your jacket can save it!" ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical meaning behind [...] "Give It Away" [...] is {{centered}} on the philosophy of selflessness and altruistic behavior. The song is titled after its most prevalent lyrical phrase [...] "give it away", which is taken from an experience Kiedis had with his former girlfriend—punk rock singer Nina Hagen—in the early 1980s. Hagen was several years Kiedis' senior and became a role-model during his drug addiction to heroin: [...] "she realized how young and inexperienced I was then, so she was always passing on gems to me, not in a preachy way, just by seizing on opportunities." [...] When Kiedis was looking through her closet he came across a jacket he liked, and commented to Hagen that it was [...] "really cool". Upon expressing this, Hagen immediately told him to keep it. Her reasoning behind this selflessness was due to an attempt to constantly make her life more enjoyable, and explained to Kiedis that [...] "if you have a closet full of clothes {{and you try to}} keep them all, your life will get very small. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a full closet and someone sees something they like, if you give it to them, the world is a better place." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{her role}} as {{resident}} pessimist, lacking vision, Sabina says, [...] "That's all we doalways beginning again! Over and over again. Always beginning again." [...] After each disaster, they just rebuild the world again. She also says: [...] "Don't forget that {{a few years ago}} we came through the depression by the skin of our teeth! One more tight squeeze like that and where will we be?" [...] And later she says,..."My nerves can't stand it. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any ideas about improving this crazy old world, I'm really with you. I really am." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frumious: Combination of [...] "fuming" [...] and [...] "furious". In Hunting of the Snark Carroll comments, [...] "ake the {{two words}} 'fuming' and 'furious'. Make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it {{unsettled}} which you will say first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so little towards 'fuming', you will say 'fuming-furious'; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious', you will say 'furious-fuming'; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say 'frumious'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mulholland {{has said}} her {{favourite}} character is Eliza Doolittle from My Fair Lady. [...] "I love her transformation from a rough and ready girl to a sophisticated lady". And she credits influences such as Julie Andrews, Judy Garland, and Dionne Warwick. She recalled the best {{piece of advice}} she received was: [...] "Believe in yourself. There {{are plenty of people}} in life waiting to knock you down <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> confidence in your talent, in your own ability, nobody can take that away from you and you will succeed. Never give up. Learn from your mistakes and move on." ...|$|E

And it's just about that striving to get there. t was kind of like looking back at all of the things I've been through, just kind of putting that into the song."

2500|$|Hosokawa {{made several}} {{unprecedented}} moves toward atonement with Japan's Asian neighbors during his term as prime minister. In his first {{news conference in}} office, he made an unprecedented statement acknowledging that Japan waged a war of aggression in World War II. He later said: [...] "You can obviously define 'aggression' {{in any number of}} ways, depending on context. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any common sense, you just cannot say in good conscience that Japan was not the aggressor when Japan did in fact cause tremendous anguish and loss of life in China, Korea and Southeast Asian nations in order to protect its own interests.
