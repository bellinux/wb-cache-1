50|$|According to the <b>Bragg-Gray</b> <b>cavity</b> theory, the {{ionization}} {{produced in}} a small cavity within an irradiated medium or object {{is related to the}} energy absorbed in that medium {{as a result of its}} radiation exposure. It was developed in 1936 by British scientists Louis Harold Gray, William Henry Bragg, and William Lawrence Bragg.|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} approach to Bragg-Gray dosimetry is: a <b>Bragg-Gray</b> <b>cavity</b> is a cavity (detector) so small that, when inserted into a medium, {{it does not}} disturb the fluence of charged particles existing in the medium. This means that the ideal <b>Bragg-Gray</b> <b>cavity</b> (detector) is one of infinitesimal dimensions, a "point" detector. In practice, such detectors do not exist but many real detectors may, in a first approximation, be treated as Bragg-Gray detectors to {{a high degree of}} accuracy. Corrections needed (so called perturbation corrections) to account for the deviation of the signal from a practical detector from that of an ideal one has been treated by, e. g., ICRU 1984, Alm Carlsson, 1985, Svensson and Brahme 1986, Alm Carlsson 1987. Derivation of "perturbation corrections" needs careful consideration and under-standing of the ideal case, i. e., that from which deviations are to be corrected for. The ideal case of a Bragg-Gray detector has been treated by Bragg 1912, Gray 1936, Laurence 1937, Spencer and Attix 1955 and Burch 1955. The formulation of Bragg-Gray theory by Spencer and Attix has found wide practical application and has been treated in detail elsewhere. The theory of Burch treats the same problem as did Spencer and Attix, viz., the significance of generation and slowing down of delta-particles in both medium and detector. Burch treated the problem in considerable detail but didn't find a solution for practical calculations. From a physical point of view, however, there is much to learn from Burch's approach. Also, his treatment of so called track ends, evaluated in some detail by Burch 1957, has been adapted in later versions of the Spencer-Attix formulation of Bragg-Gray theory...|$|E
40|$|The cavity theory by Spencer and Attix {{treats the}} energy {{deposition}} in a Bragg-Gray (B-G) cavity (detector). Originally the theory {{was developed for}} {{the case of a}} B-G detector inside a medium irradiated with photons and assuming electronic equilibrium in the medium at the position of the cavity. The theory is also applicable in media irradiated with other types of uncharged ionizing particles (e. g., neutrons) and charged particles such as electrons and protons. The special case of photon irradiation under CPE (charged particle equilibrium) conditions was coupled to a model for calculating the energy spectrum of the equilibrium fluence of electrons in the undisturbed medium. For other situations, e. g., in a medium externally irradiated with electrons, the problem is to evaluate the energy spectrum of the electron fluence at the point considered in the medium. Today, this is mostly accomplished using Monte Carlo simulations. A <b>Bragg-Gray</b> <b>cavity</b> is regarded to be so small that: the energy imparted to the cavity from electrons released by photons in the cavity is negligible compared to the energy imparted from electrons released by photons in th...|$|E
40|$|A {{variable}} air-volume, parallel-plate, extrapolation chamber {{forming an}} integral part of a Solid-WaterTM phantom was built to determine the absorbed dose in Solid-WaterTM directly. The sensitive air-volume of the extrapolation chamber is controlled through the movement of the chamber piston by means of a micrometer mounted to the phantom body. The relative displacement of the piston is monitored by a mechanical distance travel indicator with a precision on the order of 0. 002 mm. Irradiations were carried out with cobalt- 60 gamma. rays, x-ray beams ranging from 4 to 18 MV, and electron beams between 6 and 22 MeV. The absorbed dose at a given depth in Solid-WaterTM is proportional to the ionization gradient measured in the <b>Bragg-Gray</b> <b>cavity</b> region with a Solid-WaterTM embedded extrapolation chamber. Measured charge is corrected for ion recombination and ion diffusion in the chamber air volume according to a comprehensive model for charge loss in an ionization chamber. The discrepancies between doses determined with our uncalibrated phantom-embedded extrapolation chamber and doses obtained with calibrated Farmer-type cylindrical ionization chambers following the AAPM-TG 21 and AAPM-TG 25 dosimetry protocols are less than 1 % for photon and electron beams at all clinical megavoltage energies. Uncalibrated extrapolation chambers thus offer a simple and practical alternative to other techniques used in output measurements of megavoltage photon and electron beams...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLast year, we {{demonstrated}} {{the feasibility of}} a new method to perform dosimetric quality control of Treatment Planning Systems in radiotherapy, this method is based on Monte-Carlo simulations and uses anatomical Digital Test Objects (DTOs). The pelvic DTO was used {{in order to assess}} this new method on an ECLIPSE VARIAN Treatment Planning System. Large dose variations were observed particularly in air and bone equivalent material. In this current work, we discuss the results of the previous paper and provide an explanation for observed dose differences, the VARIAN Eclipse (Anisotropic Analytical) algorithm was investigated. Monte Carlo simulations (MC) were performed with a PENELOPE code version 2003. To increase efficiency of MC simulations, we have used our parallelized version based on the standard MPI (Message Passing Interface). The parallel code has been run on a 32 - processor SGI cluster. The study was carried out using pelvic DTOs and was performed for low- and high-energy photon beams (6 and 18 MV) on 2100 CD VARIAN linear accelerator. A square field (10 x 10 cm 2) was used. Assuming the MC data as reference, Ï‡ index analyze was carried out. For this study, a distance to agreement (DTA) was set to 7 mm while the dose difference was set to 5 % as recommended in the TRS- 430 and TG- 53 (on the beam axis in 3 -D inhomogeneities). When using Monte Carlo PENELOPE, the absorbed dose is computed to the medium, however the TPS computes dose to water. We have used the method described by Siebers et al. based on <b>Bragg-Gray</b> <b>cavity</b> theory to convert MC simulated dose to medium to dose to water. Results show a strong consistency between ECLIPSE and MC calculations on the beam axis...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{toxicity}} of Ra and MsTh(Ra/sup 228 /) in humans was continued. Several Thorotrast cases were also examined. Physical and clinical studies were made on 151 persons. In all cases possible gamma ray measurements were made of Ra and MsTh decay products retained in the body, alpha -ray measurements of Rn and Rn/sup 220 / in breath, a complete medical history was taken, a complete x-ray examination {{was made of the}} skeleton, and urinalysis, hematological, and blood chemistry studies were made. Medical data are appended. An extensive intercomparison of Ra burden measurements on living subjects was carried out between M. I. T. and ANL. Results are tabulated. Complete measurements were made of tooth and bone MsTh/Ra ratios on 24 individuals. Comparison of results with data on Ra/Ca ratios of teeth and total skeleton and with data from whole-body measurements on the same individuals led to the conclusion that estimates of total skeleton Ra burden can be made with reasonable accurateness on the basis of data obtained from Ra gamma -counting a single tooth. Data are being recorded on punched cards for correlation with the incidence of various affects such as tumors, bone fractures, age at exposure, age at occurrence of effects, and other epidemicological conclusions. Whole-body radioactivity measurements weremade on 45 normal employees. Measurements on the halflife of Ra/sup 228 / gave a result of 5. 7 plus or minus 0. 2 years. Results are summarized from dosimetry measurements, the development of radiation detection instruments and techniques, and miscellaneous related projects. A scintillation-type fast neutron dosimeter based on the <b>Bragg-Gray</b> <b>cavity</b> principle was tested for absolute dose measurements using a Pu-Be neutron source and 2. 5 and 14 -Mev monoenergetic neutrons obtained from d-d and d-t reactions. Test results are also reported for an instrument designed for storing data in coded form on a magnetic tape loop for later transfer to an analyzer. A list is included of publications during the period. (C. H. ...|$|E
