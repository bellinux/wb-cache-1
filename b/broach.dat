5|$|A {{common type}} of {{internal}} <b>broach</b> is the keyway <b>broach</b> (C & D). It uses a special fixture called a horn to support the <b>broach</b> and properly locate the part with relation to the <b>broach.</b>|$|E
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a <b>broach,</b> to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the <b>broach</b> is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to <b>broach.</b> In rotary broaching, the <b>broach</b> is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary <b>broach</b> is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the <b>broach,</b> which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each <b>broach</b> is specialized to cut just one shape, either the <b>broach</b> must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard <b>broach</b> geometry. A customized <b>broach</b> is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the <b>broach</b> can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E
5|$|Vertical <b>broaching</b> {{machines}} can {{be designed}} for push <b>broaching,</b> pull-down <b>broaching,</b> pull-up <b>broaching,</b> or surface <b>broaching.</b> Push <b>broaching</b> machines are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of <b>broaching</b> machine. This style machine has the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface <b>broaching</b> is done on a vertical machine.|$|R
5|$|Slot <b>broaches</b> (G & H) are {{for cutting}} slots of various {{dimensions}} at high production rates. Slot <b>broaching</b> is much quicker than milling {{when more than}} one slot needs to be machined, because multiple <b>broaches</b> can be run through the part {{at the same time}} on the same <b>broaching</b> machine.|$|R
500|$|Straddle <b>broaches</b> use two slab <b>broaches</b> to cut {{parallel}} surfaces {{on opposite}} sides of a workpiece in one pass. This type of <b>broaching</b> holds closer tolerances than if the two cuts were done independently. It is named after the fact that the <b>broaches</b> [...] "straddle" [...] the workpiece on multiple sides.|$|R
5|$|A {{concentricity}} <b>broach</b> is {{a special}} type of spline cutting <b>broach</b> which cuts both the minor diameter and the spline form to ensure precise concentricity.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} <b>broach</b> is called a rotary <b>broach</b> or wobble <b>broach.</b> One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching {{is that it does not}} require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E
5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the <b>broach</b> are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the <b>broach</b> from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the <b>broach</b> is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the <b>broach</b> is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E

Slot <b>broaching</b> is much quicker than milling {{when more than}} one slot needs to be machined, because multiple <b>broaches</b> can be run through the part {{at the same time}} on the same <b>broaching</b> machine.|$|R

40|$|<b>Broaching</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{recognised}} machining processes that can yield high productivity and high quality when applied properly. One big disadvantage of <b>broaching</b> is that all process parameters, except cutting speed, are built into the <b>broaching</b> tools. Therefore, it is not possible to modify the cutting conditions during the process once the tool is manufactured. Optimal design of <b>broaching</b> tools has a significant impact to increase the productivity and to obtain high quality products. In this paper, an optimisation model for <b>broaching</b> design is presented. The model results in a non-linear non-convex optimisation problem. Analysis of the model structure indicates that the model can be decomposed into smaller problems. The model is applied to a turbine disc <b>broaching</b> problem which is considered as one of the most complex <b>broaching</b> operations...|$|R
5|$|If the <b>broach</b> {{is large}} enough the costs can be reduced by using a {{built-up}} or modular construction. This involves producing the <b>broach</b> in pieces and assembling it. If any portion wears out only that section has to be replaced, instead of the entire <b>broach.</b>|$|E
5|$|In general, a rotary <b>broach</b> {{will not}} cut as {{accurately}} as a push or pull <b>broach.</b> However, {{the ability to}} use this type of cutting tool on common machine tools is highly advantageous.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the <b>broach</b> above the workholder, then lowers the <b>broach</b> through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the <b>broach.</b> The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the <b>broach</b> through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the <b>broach</b> is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The <b>broach</b> usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E

5|$|Modular <b>broaches</b> are {{commonly}} used for large internal <b>broaching</b> applications. They are similar to shell <b>broaches</b> {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|R
5|$|The slab <b>broach</b> is the {{simplest}} surface <b>broach.</b> It {{is a general}} purpose tool for cutting flat surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the <b>broach</b> contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the <b>broach.</b> The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The <b>broach</b> can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the <b>broach,</b> no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A <b>broach</b> is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|The process {{depends on}} the type of {{broaching}} being performed. Surface broaching is very simple as either the workpiece is moved against a stationary surface <b>broach,</b> or the workpiece is held stationary while the <b>broach</b> is moved against it.|$|E
40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the <b>broaching</b> tools to machine the {{cylindrical}} holes. The purposes are {{to create and}} to substantiate the Computer-Aided Design Systeme (CADS) of <b>broaching</b> tool, {{which was based on}} the mathematical simulation of choice procedures of its main dimensions and of its operating conditions. The mathematical simulator of <b>broaching</b> tool and of <b>broaching</b> process, the system of structural and economic criteria have been created. The dependences to determine the displacements and to determine the stresses in the dangerous points of tooth flank have been showed. The interconnection of wear criteria has been described. The CADS of optimized construction of circular <b>broaching</b> tool, which was realized by the personal computer as the design program to be built in the general CADS of <b>broaching</b> tool, has been developed. The design system of optimized construction of circular <b>broaching</b> tool has been introduced at the "Matyrskoye" Repair Enterprise.

5|$|<b>Broaching</b> is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though <b>broaches</b> can be expensive, <b>broaching</b> is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|R
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive <b>broach,</b> which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the <b>broach</b> machines outward from there. All of these designs require a <b>broach</b> that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E
5|$|For {{defining}} {{the geometry of}} a <b>broach</b> an internal type is shown below. Note that the geometries of other broaches are similar.|$|E
5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid <b>broach,</b> except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the <b>broach</b> must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} <b>broaching</b> {{can be traced}} back to the early 1850s, with the first {{applications}} used for cutting keyways in pulleys and gears.

In the 1920s and 30s the tolerances were tightened and the cost reduced thanks to advances in form grinding and <b>broaching</b> machines.|$|R

5|$|Broaching speeds {{vary from}} 20 to 120surface feet per minute (SFPM). This {{results in a}} {{complete}} cycle time of 5 to 30seconds. Most of the time is consumed by the return stroke, <b>broach</b> handling, and workpiece loading and unloading.|$|E

5|$|Horizontal {{broaching}} machines {{are designed for}} pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary broaching. Pull style machines are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke. Surface style machines hold the <b>broach</b> stationary while the workpieces are clamped into fixtures that are mounted on a conveyor system. Continuous style machines {{are similar to the}} surface style machines except adapted for internal broaching.|$|E
40|$|Notches were {{machined}} in {{specimens of}} INCONEL 718 by a <b>broaching</b> process, where differing <b>broaching</b> runs led to differing extents of subsurface deformation and surface roughness.

The <b>broaching</b> process {{that led to the}} more severe subsurface deformation (but lower surface roughness) showed the worst fatigue performance. Analysis of total strain amplitude in the notch root with the aid of an elasto-plastic finite-element (FE) model showed that the work hardening related to the subsurface deformation caused by the different <b>broaching</b> can account for the difference in fatigue lives. Differences in initiation and growth behavior were seen for the two <b>broached</b> finishes as well as for <b>broached</b> and subsequently polished samples. These differences are discussed in terms of a change in crack growth initiation and growth mechanisms due to the presence of the work-hardened layer...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{several decades}} of {{theoretical}} support and empirical validation concerning Multicultural Counseling Competence (MCC), {{the mental health}} field {{has been criticized for}} a lack of measurable constructs that embody multicultural counseling skills (Sanchez-Hucles & Jones, 2005; Weinrach & Thomas, 1998). In an effort to contribute to the knowledge and understanding of observable multicultural counseling interventions, web-based survey research was used {{to examine the relationship between}} the counselor’s <b>broaching</b> behavior and multicultural counseling competence in a sample of middle school counselors. <b>Broaching</b> has been conceptualized as a measurable multicultural counseling skill and refers to a counselor’s effort to initiate and process discussions of race, ethnicity, and culture in the counseling relationship (Day-Vines, et al., 2007). Results revealed a statistically significant relationship between <b>broaching</b> and multicultural counseling competence.
