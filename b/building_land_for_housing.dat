The Potters Bar Urban District Council came into the possession of one desolate triangle of land. They offered it for sale by public auction as freehold <b>building</b> <b>land</b> <b>for</b> 13 <b>houses.</b> Parkside bought the land and built the houses, despite warnings from Wrotham Park Estate that they were violating the lay-out restrictions. When the houses were built, Wrotham Park Estate brought a claim against Parkside for breach of the restrictive covenant.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century Hackney {{suffered}} from increased demand <b>for</b> <b>building</b> <b>land,</b> both <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> and to extend the factories in Homerton. The marshes had always suffered periodic flooding from the Lea but with the introduction of mains sewerage a flood relief sewer was constructed beneath the marshes. Most common and Lammas lands were then preserved by an Act of Parliament and passed to the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works, but the marsh remained excluded from the MBW scheme because many of the lammas rights were still exercised, predominantly grazing. This was a period of increasing arguments between landowners and groups, such as the Eton Manor Mission, who were trying to use the marsh for recreation. The 337 acre of marshes were finally preserved by the London County Council in 1890, by purchasing the rights and landowners' interests for £75,000. They opened to the public in 1893 and were formally dedicated in 1894. The LCC undertook further flood prevention, straightening some of the bends in the River by introducing four 'cuts', the old channels being retained to form islands.|$|R
40|$|Rouen: spatial {{extension}} and quantitative slackening of counter-urbanization Central Pays de Caux (cantons of Fauville and Yvetot) is very {{representative of the}} inversion of population growth {{at the expense of}} towns and to the benefit of country, which occurred in France during the decade 1970 - 1980. Because demographic rural growth is basically the result of a positive migratory balance, the analysis of migrations is particularly instructive. The first stage of the study is a systemic exploratory model in which immigration mainly consists in «rurbanisation» (counterurbanisation) from large cities, in return of adults born in country and in population coming from "deep Caux" (the more rural and urban-distant part of Caux), while emigration is essentially made up of young people. Two communes (Allouville-Bellefosse and Alvimare) have been selected for an analysis of migrations based on several sources: a special survey (a quarter of the households), the study of election file and planning permission file. The nature of migrants is first investigated (where are they coming from? where are they going to?, what are their age structure and occupations?) before the analysis of their motivations. Considering the results r of surveys, some premises of the model must be challenged. Counterurbanisation from Rouen is quite negligible and migration from "deep Caux" has been strongly reduced recently. Three main immigration shifts may be observed: The settling of workers coming from Yvetot and small industrial towns in the neighbouring Seine valley and more recently from Le Havre, because of cheap <b>building</b> <b>land</b> <b>for</b> sale in <b>housing</b> estates; a return of adults born in country (expected in the model, but less important than the first flow) which are settling preferably outside the housing estates, particularly the "white collars"; at last the coming of tertiary population mainly employed in services induced in villages by the population growth. Emigrants are mainly the young less than 25 years old who are leaving considering the lack of cheap rental houses in rural space, but also the elderly, {{because of the lack of}} amenities in scattered hamlets. The paper ends with an interrogation on prospects of population growth in suburban rural spaces. It seems that paradoxically the movement is quantitatively and globally slowing down, but carries on its spatial extension. Fruit Jean-Pierre.

40|$|A housing {{developer}} needs land {{to develop}} it into housing development project. The land {{which is to be}} developed into housing development project may be originally owned by the housing developer itself or the developer got it through purchase from interested seller or through alienation of land disposed by the State Authority. The alienation of land is made on the approval of the State Authority the application to alienate land of the applicant housing developers. There are cases whereby the State Authority approved the applications to alienate land to applicant housing developers without taking into consideration, seriously, the capability of the applicant housing developers concerned in carrying out the intended housing development projects and the suitability of the project locations. These incapability and unsuitability, to the extreme cases, may result in the abandonment of housing development projects. The questions are: Why had the State Authority approved the applications to alienate lands to incapable housing developers and alienate unsuitable <b>lands</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> development projects? What are the powers, responsibility and liability of the State Authority in alienating lands to applicant <b>housing</b> developers <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> development projects? This paper discusses the scenarios happening in Malaysia in regard to the powers and responsibilities of the State Authority in alienating <b>lands</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> development projects to applicant housing developers. The method of research are by way of legal case studies of two abandoned housing projects in Malaysia. This paper also identifies the reasons leading to the problems and issues in alienation of <b>lands</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> development projects which had led to the housing abandonment. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the weaknesses in the machinery of the State Authority in approving application <b>for</b> alienation of <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>housing</b> development projects which might have led to the housing abandonment.
