40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Home {{healthcare}} systems {{have become a}} focus of research due to the shifting care requirements of the elderly. Malnourishment, independence and activity are becoming vital metrics when monitoring in patient’s illness. Monitoring devices described in research however express issues in the consistent remote capture of these metrics. This work presents the role of Bluetooth Low-Energy Beacons (BLE) in community based healthcare by examining how passive activity monitoring can assist patients coping with independence and disease management within their homes as an Indoor Proximity System (IPS). <b>BLE</b> <b>sensors</b> will {{be placed on the}} patient, in their home and on objects of interest (OOI) such as water bottles, kettles and microwaves. Research described in this paper will focus on accuracy of BLE beacons as an IPS for lifestyle monitoring and its application to intelligent healthcare. This is achieved by creating a model of patient care requirements structured using activities of daily living (ADL) which is evaluated using patient activity pattern recognition in captured sensor data. Pattern analysis uses the changing distance values between <b>BLE</b> <b>sensors</b> to determine movement, motion and location which contribute to the activity, sensor based care model. Results support efficacy when using BLE beacons as an IPS with patient activity patterns becoming observable through monitoring with a consistent ability to distinguish interactions in activity patterns captured. Future experiments will focus on analysing captured sensor metrics to determine care outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{advent of}} Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled Beacons {{is poised to}} {{revolutionize}} the indoor contextual aware services to the users. Due to the lower energy consumption and higher throughput, BLE could therefore be an integral pillar of an Internet of Things (IoT) Location Based Service (LBS). Tracking a user with high accuracy is known as Micro-Location. This is a requirement of many IoT user-centric applications for indoor environments. Although several technologies {{have been used for}} tracking purposes, the accuracy has always been a serious issue. At the same time, each vendor would install different technologies. In this work, we propose to use the cutting-edge and commercially available Apple’s iBeacon protocol and iBeacon <b>BLE</b> <b>sensors</b> for micro-location. We propose to leverage a control theoretic approach, namely particle filtering, in order to increase the tracking accuracy in an indoor environment. We performed extensive experiments and our results show that the proposed beacon based micro-location system can be used to locate a user in an indoor environment with an error as low as 0. 27 meters...|$|E
40|$|Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) {{has gained}} very high momentum, as {{witnessed}} by its widespread presence in smartphones, wearables and other consumer electronics devices. This fact can be leveraged {{to carry out}} opportunistic sensor data collection (OSDC) in scenarios where a sensor node cannot communicate with infrastructure nodes. In such cases, a mobile entity (e. g., a pedestrian or a vehicle) equipped with a BLE-enabled device can collect {{the data obtained by}} the sensor node when both are within direct communication range. In this paper, we characterize, both analytically and experimentally, the performance and trade-offs of BLE as a technology for OSDC, for the two main identified approaches, and considering the impact of its most crucial configuration parameters. Results show that a <b>BLE</b> <b>sensor</b> node running on a coin cell battery can achieve a lifetime beyond one year while transferring around 10 Mbit/day, in realistic OSDC scenarios.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an ultra-low-power (ULP) 2. 3 / 2. 4 GHz multi-standard transmitter (TX) for {{wireless sensor networks}} and wireless body area networks. Several 2. 3 / 2. 4 GHz wireless standards have been proposed for such applications, including IEEE 802. 15. 6 (BAN) for body area networks, IEEE 802. 15. 4 (Zigbee) and Bluetooth Low Energy (<b>BLE)</b> for <b>sensor</b> networks and IEEE 802. 15. 4 g (SUN) for smart buildings. Recent standard compliant short-range TXs [1 - 6] typically consume DC power {{in the range of}} 20 to 50 mW. This is rather high for autonomous systems with limited battery energy. Implemented in a 90 nm CMOS technology, the presented TX saves at least 75 % of power consumption by replacing several power-hungry analog blocks with the digitally-assisted circuits. This TX is compliant with all 4 of these standards, while dissipating only 4. 5 mA from a 1. 2 V supply...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Accelerometers and {{gyroscope}} {{are often}} referred to as inertial sensors. They detect movement and are used for motion tracking systems in many fields. In recent years they have become much smaller, lighter and cheaper which makes them attractive for use in consumer electronics. The goal of this research is to use all these advantages to create a cheap, low cost and accurate motion tracking system. The system that will be developed is using two pairs of accelerometer + gyroscope sensors which communicates with an iOS device using <b>BLE.</b> The <b>sensors</b> are attached to a persons leg to capture the orientation of the leg while walking or running. Studying the movements of a persons leg can be useful regarding both performance and health aspects. To create the system, usage of inertial sensors and how to combine their data using the complementary filter have been studied. Further, several experiments were made to optimize the filter design for this kind of movement. The results shows how the orientation estimation differs in accuracy depending on different values of how the filter is designed. However, by using the right values, a fairly accurate orientation of the leg can be estimated which is proved by the simple visualization of the iOS application.

40|$|This thesis has {{proposed}} a novel wearable wireless ECG system. With the consideration of long-term homecare application, it strives to control the size and power consumption of the sensor node. As a result, this thesis is devoted in three aspects: new electrode placements design, wireless ECG system design and multiple power control technologies. In the new electrode placements investigation, an experiment was designed to investigate the best limb electrode placements. The experiment compared 14 different placements for limb electrodes. The detected signals of different placements were compared with the standard lead system. The best placements for four limb electrodes were selected according to the correlation coefficients between the standard and new placements. In the wireless ECG system design, a low noise analog frontend was implemented for the ECG signals, considering practical issues like dc offset caused by body motion, EMI coupled from the power line and electrode impedance mismatch. The measurement result showed excellent performance even under body motion. With the new electrode placements and the low noise analog front end, two wireless ECG systems were implemented with ZigBee and BLE. The sizes of both sensor nodes were controlled in 5. 5 cm x 2. 5 cm, with which the sensor node {{was able to be}} conveniently worn on the body without affecting user's mobility. The ECG signals were displayed on PC or smartphone in real time. This work applied multiple power control technologies in both analog and digital ways to extend the battery life. Firstly, adjustable power mode control was operated in the ZigBee and <b>BLE</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes with battery lives of 52 hours and 55 hours respectively. Secondly, dynamic transmission power control in ZigBee system was utilized to adjust the Tx output power dynamically according to the received signal strength indicator. It saved 20 % - 30 % power during regular movements. Thirdly, Compressed Sensing (CS) was applied {{to reduce the size of}} the transmitted data. Digital CS was firstly implemented in the BLE system. ECG signals were successfully reconstructed in real time with little distortion under compression ratio of 2. The battery life was extended by 12 hours. Analog CS was also implemented by an integrated encoder using 0. 13 μm CMOS technology. Instead of using 64 parallel SAR-ADCs, only one SAR-ADC was employed. The total average power consumption was 23. 5 μW. Finally, an integrated analog front end was designed and implemented in 0. 13 μm CMOS technology. The offset and 1 /f noise of the first Gm were noted. Ac coupling circuit and chopped current coupled instrumentation amplifier were the solutions to reduce the noises appeared in ECG signals. The measurement results showed that, the chip only consumed 5 μA current and supplied 46. 3 dB gain and 0. 56 Hz – 90 Hz bandwidth. Furthermore, high range dc-electrode offset (500 mV) and common-mode voltage (0. 2 V - 1. 0 V) were achieved to provide high tolerance for body motion and electrode mismatch...|$|R
40|$|After {{a decade}} of {{worldwide}} CubeSat development, the Von Karman Institute took the lead, to proof {{the concept of a}} large swarm of fifty CubeSats which will be launched in early 2016. In addition, the QB 50 mission has the main objective to measure the characteristics of the lower thermosphere. In scope of the QB 50 project the TU Delft will develop two nanosatellites called Delta and Phi (DelFFi) which will perform formation flying experiments as well. The lessons learned of operating Delfi-n 3 Xt - the predecessor of DelFFi - and recommendations for future Delfi missions are outlined in this thesis. During the operations of Delfi-n 3 Xt the Command & Data Handling System (CDHS) performed well. In addition, a design is proposed to include flexible telemetry (FlexTLM) and a telemetry history playback functionality for DelFFi. This robust but flexible design will enable the DelFFi mission to transmit more relevant telemetry, {{while at the same time}} semi-autonomous FlexTLM configurations will reduce the time resources required of the mission operators. In the second part of this thesis, the feasibility of wireless intra-spacecraft communication for nanosatellites was investigated. An analysis of the performance and considerations of such an implementation is given, based on experiments conducted with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) modules in a representative nanosatellite environment. The on-ground experiments with BLE have proven the performance of the wireless link in a nanosatellite is excellent and the power consumption is moderate. Therefore an experiment to implement a completely wireless <b>BLE</b> temperature <b>sensor</b> on DelFFi is proposed. The wireless experiment on-board DelFFi will provide validation of the BLE technology in a space environment. This experiment will pave the way for more extensive wireless intra-spacecraft capabilities for future nanosatellites. Space Systems EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an IoT (Internet of Things) {{system designed to}} allow the monitoring and control of parameters of the users’ vehicles, anytime and anywhere in the world, through the Internet. The system prototype was developed and tested using an electric vehicle (EV) and the respective sensor systems. The main components of the proposed IoT system are: a Bluetooth Low Energy (<b>BLE)</b> intra-vehicular wireless <b>sensor</b> network (IVWSN); a mobile device that acts both as the vehicle’s gateway, connecting the IVWSN to the Internet, and as the vehicle’s human machine interface (HMI); an online server/database, based on Firebase; a client, which can be either a mobile device or a personal computer; and a residential wireless sensor network (WSN). The use of a wireless network to collect sensor data inside of the vehicle introduces some advantages when compared with conventional wired networks, whereas {{the inclusion of a}} residential WSNs in the proposed IoT architecture allows the provision of additional features, such as automatic control of the EV battery charging process. Experimental results are provided to assess the performance of the developed IVWSN and HMI.

40|$|Technology {{has been}} seen as a {{possible}} solution to the increasing costs of healthcare and the globally aging population. It is known that many elderly people prefer to stay in their homes {{for as long as possible}} and remote monitoring can be a solution, but often such systems lack useful information or are prohibitive due to cost, ease of use/deployment and wireless coverage. This work presents a novel gateway software architecture based on threads being managed by dictionary memory. The architecture has been deployed in a distributed interconnected set of low-cost consumer grade gateway devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) that are positioned around the home. The gateway devices can then be used to listen, monitor or connect to <b>BLE</b> based healthcare <b>sensors</b> to continually reveal information about the user with full residential coverage. A further novelty of this work is the ability to maintain handover connections between many sensors and many gateways as a user moves throughout their home, thus the gateways can route information to/from sensors across the consumer’s home network. The system has been tested in an experimental house and is now poised to be initially deployed to 100 homes for residential healthcare monitoring before any public mass consumer deployment...|$|R
