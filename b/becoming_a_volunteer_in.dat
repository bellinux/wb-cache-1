6000|$|The {{period in}} which the scene is laid is that of the English Civil War, in which the Cavalier fought on the side of King Charles I against the Puritans. But his adventures in this war belong to {{the second part of the}} book. In the first part, he tells of his birth and parentage, the foreign travel which was the fashionable {{completion}} of the education of a gentleman in the seventeenth century, and his adventures as <b>a</b> <b>volunteer</b> officer <b>in</b> the Swedish army, where he gained the experience which was to serve him well in the Civil War at home. Many a real Cavalier must have had just such a career as Defoe's hero describes as his own. After a short time at Oxford, [...] "long enough for a gentleman," [...] he embarked on a period of travel, going to Italy by way of France. The Cavalier, however, devotes but little space to description, vivid enough as far as it goes, of his adventures in these two countries for a space of over two years. Italy, especially, attracted the attention of gentlemen and scholars in those days, but the Cavalier was more bent on soldiering than sightseeing and he hurries on to tell of his adventures in Germany, where he first really took part <b>in</b> warfare, <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> <b>volunteer</b> officer <b>in</b> the army of Gustavus Adolphus, the hero King of Sweden, and where he met with those adventures the story of which forms the bulk of the first part of the Memoirs.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{bachelor}} thesis is University students volunteering - motivation, trends and development. The thesis {{is divided into}} theoretical and practical part. The theoretical one opens with some basic concepts related to volunteering, its historical developement is also described. Next the most frequent fields, that <b>volunteers</b> are involved <b>in,</b> are mentioned, mediators and organizers are also focused on. Volunteering is divided due to several criteria. The process of involving volunteers into voluntary activities is described too. The final capter of the theoretical part is devoted to human behaviour motivation. The emphasis is particularly placed on the motivation of volunteers. Two objectives were defined in the practical part. The first one was {{to find out what}} pins university students from České Budějovice and Jindřichův Hradec downt to voluntary activities. The other was to compare numbers, motivation and involvement of these students. To fulfil the aim of the thesis a quantitative research strategy, interviewing method and a technique of non-standardized questionnaire were applied. Respondents who study at University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, The Institute of Technology and Business, College of European and Regional Studies and the Faculty of Management at University of Economics in Jindřichův Hradec were addressed. The result showed that students were mostly motivated by gaining new experience and skills. The sense of self-importance while volunteering is also crucial. The results also denote that the percentage of <b>volunteers</b> <b>in</b> České Budějovice is not distinctively varied from the one in Jindřichův Hradec. Additionally, the attention was aimed at those who not yet engage <b>in</b> <b>volunteering,</b> primarily the reasons why it is so and the conditions that would make them to do so. According to the results of the investigation, these respondents do not take part <b>in</b> <b>volunteering</b> mostly due to lack of free time. Sufficiency of time {{is also one of the}} conditions to join <b>in</b> <b>volunteering</b> activities. One of the other frequent conditions that respondents impose is <b>volunteering</b> <b>in</b> their field of interest. Nevertheless <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> <b>volunteer</b> is possible <b>in</b> various fields and the range of activities to do in each are also manifold. It arise from the report that in a way students may lack information about the opportunities to volunteer. The research also ascertained what their overview of nonprofit organizations is like. The results show that 37, 88 % of respondents do not know any nonprofit organization. This data might also be caused by unfamiliarity with the term "nonprofit organization", or just by not knowing what the term covers. Two hypotheses were also set in the bachelor thesis. The first one was that the crucial motivation for university students to volunteer is gaining new experience. The hypothesis verified. The percentage of respondents who gave this answer predominated over the other possibilities. The other hypothesis was that university students dispose enough time to involve volunteering. This hypothesis did not verify. The lack of time is on the contrary one of the most common bar to joining voluntary activities. The results of the thesis may serve the volunteer centres and organizations working with <b>volunteers</b> as <b>a</b> resource material for volunteer promotion and recruiting volunteers among university students...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Volunteers</b> <b>in</b> {{palliative care}} {{play a key}} role, {{particularly}} in the hospice setting. The expansion of palliative care into developing countries {{has been accompanied by}} the emergence of volunteer workers, who are providing a main source of support and care for patients, many of whom never see a health professional. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the motivation for <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> <b>volunteer</b> and the personal impact of being a palliative care Community <b>Volunteer</b> Worker <b>in</b> Uganda. Design: A qualitative methodology using semi-structured individual and group digitally recorded interviews was adopted for the study. Data were analysed for emerging themes using thematic analysis. Setting/Participants: Forty-three interviews were undertaken, 32 with Community Volunteer Workers and 11 with the Hospice clinical teams, using semi-structured digitally recorded individual, group and focus group interviews at the Hospice Africa sites in Uganda. Results: The results identified the cultural wish to help people as a key motivator <b>in</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> <b>volunteer.</b> Additionally, the <b>volunteers</b> reported having <b>a</b> sense of pride <b>in</b> their <b>volunteering</b> role, and this role had a positive impact on their perceived status in their local community. Conclusion: This model of volunteering is clearly having an impact on the volunteers, both personally and also in terms of how they are treated in their communities. Further research to explore the long-term personal benefits of being <b>a</b> palliative care <b>volunteer</b> is recommended...|$|R
