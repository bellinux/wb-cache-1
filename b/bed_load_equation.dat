40|$|Bed load {{transport}} is {{of fundamental}} importance in river engineering.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a novel Process-based Distributed Sediment Dynamic Model (PDSDM) to {{estimate}} watershed sediment budgets at spatiotemporal scales, with due {{consideration of the}} suspended <b>loads,</b> <b>bed</b> <b>loads</b> and their interactions within the hillslope and channels. To overcome the limitations of existing approaches, in this model, hillslope and channel sediment dynamics have been modelled separately and the links between hillslope sediment processes and channel sediment dynamics have been strengthened. Fractional sediment <b>loads</b> (<b>bed</b> <b>load</b> and suspended load), their interactions and overall basin-scale sediment budgets have been investigated to represent in-stream sediment dynamics properly. Also, modelling of channel bed level variations has been linked with watershed sediment dynamics and an investigation of climate change conditions on watershed sediment dynamics has been carried out. The PDSDM has been developed by integrating an existing Distributed Hydrological Model (DHM) with newly developed sediment modules for: (i) suspended sediment dynamics at hillslope; (ii) suspended sediment dynamics at channel; (iii) <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> estimation and transport at channel; and (iv) channel bed level variations. In PDSDM, a transport capacity equation is used {{as one of the}} key parameters for estimating suspended sediment dynamics whilst the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate is calculated by a <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport <b>equation.</b> The PDSDM has been upgraded by incorporating options to select from and use different transport capacity <b>equations</b> and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport <b>equations</b> to simulate suspended and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport processes in catchment areas.

40|$|International audienceTo {{calculate}} <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> engineers {{often use}} flow resistance equations that provide estimates of bed shear stress. In these equations, {{on the basis}} of the estimate of the appropriate hydraulic radius associated with the bed only, the bed roughness k s is commonly set as a constant, whatever the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> intensity. However, several studies have confirmed the existence of feedback mechanisms between flow resistance and <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> suggesting that a flow-dependent bed roughness should be used. Therefore, using a data set composed of 2282 flume and field experimental values, this study investigated the importance of these feedback effects. New flow resistance equations were proposed for three flow domains: domain 1 corresponds to no <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> and a constant bed roughness k s = D (where D is a representative grain diameter), whereas domain 3 corresponds to a high <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate over a flat bed with a constant bed roughness k s = 2. 6 D. Between these two domains, a transitional domain 2 was identified, for which the bed roughness evolved from D to 2. 6 D with increasing flow conditions. In this domain, the Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient f can be approximated using a constant for a given slope. The results using this new flow resistance equation proved to be more accurate than those using equations obtained from simple fittings of logarithmic laws to mean values. The data set indicates that distinguishing domains 2 and 3 is still relevant for <b>bed</b> <b>load.</b> In particular, the data indicate a slope dependence in domain 2 but not in domain 3. A <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> model, based on the tractive force concept, is proposed. Finally, flow resistance and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>equations</b> were used together to calculate both shear stress and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> from the flow discharge, the slope, and the grain diameter for each run of the data set. Efficiency tests indicate that new equations (implicitly taking a feedback mechanism into account) can reduce the error by a factor of 2 when compared to other equations currently in use, showing that feedback between flow resistance and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> can improve field <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> modeling...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conducted}} surveys of gullies that {{developed in a}} small, steep watershed in the Idaho Batholith after a severe wildfire followed by intense precipitation. We measured gully length and cross sections to estimate the volumes of sediment loss due to gully formation. These volume estimates are assumed to provide an estimate of sediment transport capacity at each survey cross section from the single gully-forming thunderstorm. Sediment transport models commonly relate transport capacity to overland flow shear stress, which is related to runoff rate, slope, and drainage area. We have estimated the runoff rate and duration associated with the gully-forming event and used the sediment volume measurements to calibrate a general physically based sediment transport equation in this steep, high shear stress environment. We find that a shear stress exponent of 3, corresponding to drainage area and slope exponents of M = 2. 1 and N = 2. 25, match our data. This shear stress exponent of 3 is approximately 2 times higher than those for <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport in alluvial rivers but is {{in the range of}} shear stress exponents derived from flume experiments on steep slopes and with total <b>load</b> <b>equations.</b> The concavity index of the gully profiles obtained theoretically from the area and slope exponents of the sediment transport equation, θc = (M − 1) /N, agrees well with the observed profile concavity of the gullies.

There {{has not been}} any significant research to date regarding the behavior of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport nor the implications of bed forms upon the hydraulics associated with culvert flow. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to investigate how sediment transport occurs in a culvert and to then develop a methodology and test setup to successfully investigate this sediment transport.

This dissertation develops a semi-empirical <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport <b>equation</b> from existing open channel flow models to be used in predicting sediment yields in culvert applications. Incipient motion and critical shear stresses were investigated for application into eight empirically based models. The methods analyzed include the Meyer-Peter Müller, Engelund and Hansen, Shields, Toffaleti (as seen in the United States Army Corps of Engineers program HEC RAS), Schoklitsch, DuBoy, Yang, and Rottner methods. These methods were tested for predictive accuracy to physically modeled <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport data obtained from a 304. 8 mm (11. 89 in) diameter culvert. Tests involved fully pressurized, partially pressurized inlet controlled, and open channel flow regimes for a variety of bed elevations and bedforms.

Seventeen locations along the river estuary were selected started from about 1500 m upstream the coastline. The speed measurements were carried out in two points at each location, at 0. 6 of the river depth and on riverbed. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> measurements were done at points close to the riverbed (0. 4 to 0. 6 cm approaching the riverbed). The modeling of the river flow speed at the points near the riverbed {{as well as at the}} points 0. 6 of the depth during low tides showed a decrease in the speed distribution pattern with increasing distance up to the coastline. At the times of low tide, transports of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> takes place in the estuary region of Ranoyapo River. The increase of flow speed due to the increase of flow debit will result in the increase of flow velocity that may exceed the critical value. This allows the transportation of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> to increase. In the condition of high tide, the pattern of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> distribution showed <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport at locations one to eight. In the contrary, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> material at locations nine to seventeen were not transportable, meaning that the flow velocity at those locations was unable to transport <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> sediment towards the coast line.

And a climate change might lead to an increased frequency of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport and change in grain size trend in mountain river basins. The theme for this master thesis is of importance for the society, because possible effects of a climate change is more frequent flooding and landslide events that might cause the society unexpected stain. This master thesis {{is based on a}} comparison of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport and grain size trend between two locations situated upstream - and downstream for a dominating landslide in Vekveselva, Oppdal. The two locations and the dominating landslide are located in a 330 meter study rich which is dominated by a step – pool morphology. Four impact sensors was placed in the rich to measure the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport acceleration from June to July, and pebble counts in eight cross sections were carried out to find the grain size trend in the rich after numerous episodic <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> events, and gradient and step height and step length was measured. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> acceleration – and grain size trend study produced interesting data concerning <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> and grain size trend in Mountain Rivers.   The outcomes of the study were discussed in context with current theories concerning <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> acceleration and grain size trend in mountain river basins. </p...|$|R

In concrete terms, 68 measurements of stream discharge and <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate were carried out at a location, near the basin outlet. Apart from the measurements, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate was computed by means of Meyer-Peter and Müller formula, after calibrating the above formula in terms of roughness coefficient.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify the size and types of sediment at Lebir River after 2014 flood, to analyse the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> discharge of Lebir River using selected method and to identify the sediment pattern/bed load pattern due to sedimentation process. The study conducted at 5 stations at Lebir River. The rainfall precipitation in December 2014 showed that the maximum rainfall event will cause the high amount of rainfall precipitation and will increase the production of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport. Therefore, the surface erosion also gives contribution to the increase of sediment transport and had become the one of main problem at Lebir River after flood in December 2014. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> pattern at each point were identified through the sedimentation process. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> pattern gave the variation of sediment transport modes at Lebir River. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> discharge were evaluated using three different formulas which were Meyer Peter and Muller, Schoklitsch and Duboys equation. From the analysis of the results of each of the formula, Meyer Peter and Muller can be used to predict <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport for Lebir River...|$|R
40|$|Bed load {{transport}} {{in mountain}} streams {{is very difficult}} to be determined since it strongly correlates to streambed structure (roughness structure). Based on a specially designed underwater observation and video-capturing system, experiments on <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> movement under three streambed structure development scenarios, i. e., well developed, partially developed, and no streambed structures (plane bed), was conducted in a mountain stream in southwest China. Dynamic features of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport (starting mode, trajectory, velocity, and acceleration velocity) under these three typical streambed conditions were observed and analyzed. The streambed structure development degree was measured by a specially manufactured instrument to analyze correlation between <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport and streambed structure development. Bed load movement strongly depends on streambed conditions of mountain streams. For channels with well-developed streambed structures, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> mainly move in intermittent saltation, and almost no other motion form occur, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate is often very low under this condition. For channels with partially-developed streambed structure, saltation motion is still the main motion form, and contact motion also occurs. When no streambed structure develops (plane bed), both saltation and contact motion occur, contact motion gradually become the main motion form, and if flow intensity and incoming sediment reach the critical high values, laminated load motion occur and will be the main part of <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport. In essence, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport and streambed structures both form flow resistance (dissipate flow energy) and are inter-restricted. For a specific stream power, the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate is inversely proportional to the development degree of streambed structures in a logarithmic coordinate system for the same stream reach...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effects of}} boulder {{concentration}} on hydrodynamics and local and reach-averaged sediment transport properties with a flow over submerged boulder arrays are investigated. Four numerical simulations are performed in which the boulders' streamwise spacings are varied. Statistics of near-bed velocity, Reynolds shear stresses, and turbulent events are collected and used to predict <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rates. The results demonstrate {{that the presence of}} boulders at various interboulder spacings altered the flow field in their vicinity causing (1) flow deceleration, wake formation, and vortex shedding; (2) enhanced outward and inward interaction turbulence events downstream of the boulders; and (3) a redistribution of the local bed shear stress around the boulder consisting of pockets of high and low bed shear stresses. The spatial variety of the predicted <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate qs based on local bed shear stress is visualized and is shown to depend greatly on the boulder concentration. Quantitative <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport calculations demonstrate that the reach-averaged <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate may be overestimated by up to 25 times when including the form-drag-generated shear stress of the immobile boulders in the chosen <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> formula. Further, the reach-averaged <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate may be underestimated by 11 % if the local variability of the bed shear stress is not accounted for. Finally, it is shown that for the small-spaced boulder array, the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rates should no longer be predicted using a normal distribution with standard deviation of the shear stress distribution σ...|$|R
25|$|Bed load {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the <b>bed</b> material <b>load</b> (the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> especially in gravel-bed rivers. This <b>bed</b> material <b>load</b> is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.|$|R

The wash load is almost entirely made up of grains that are not found in quantity in the <b>bed.</b> Wash <b>load</b> grains tend to be very small (mostly clays and silts, but also some fine sands) and therefore have a small settling velocity, being kept in suspension by the flow turbulence. The {{composition of}} the wash load changes as the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> changes. According to Einstein, all particles that are not significantly represented in the deposits of the bed [...] "must be" [...] considered wash load. This means that as the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> moves down the river and the size of the <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> is reduced so is the size of the wash load. This is shown by Einstein’s [...] "suggestion that the largest sediment size may be arbitrarily chosen as the grain diameter of the D10 (wash load) of which 10% of the bed sediment is finer.” Wash load also has a different composition than the <b>bed</b> <b>load.</b> The <b>bed</b> <b>loads</b> parent material is from directly around the water feature, but the wash loads source of sediment is defined as [...] " [...] sediment in transport that is derived from sources other than the bed.

40|$|Tide-driven <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> {{transport}} is {{an important}} portion o f the net annual sediment transport rate in many shoreface and shelf environments. However, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport under waves cannot be measured {{in the field and}} <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport by currents without waves is barely measurable, even in spring tidal conditions. There is, consequently, a strong lack of field data and validated models. The present field site was on the shoreface and inner shelf at 2 to 8. 5 km offshore the central Dutch coast (far outside the surfzone), where tidal currents flow parallel to the coast. Bed load transports were carefully measured with a calibrated sampler in spring tidal conditions without waves at a water depth of 13 - 18 m with fine and medium sands. The near-bed flow was measured over nearly a year and used for integration to annual transport rates. An empirical <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> model was derived, which predicts <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transports that are a factor o f> 5 smaller than predicted by existing models. However, they agree with laboratory data of sand and gravel transport in currents near incipient motion. The damped transport rates may have been caused by cohesion of sediment or turbulence damping due to mud or biological activity. The annual <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate was calculated using a probability density function (pdf) derived from the near-bed current and orbital velocity data which represented the current and wave climate well when compared to 30 years o f data from a nearby wave station. The effect o f wave stirring was included in the transport calculations. The net <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> transport rate is a few m 2 /year. This is much less than predicted in an earlier model study, which is partly due to different <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> models but also due to th...|$|R
40|$|Understanding channel {{bifurcation}} mechanics is {{of great}} importance for predicting and managing multichannel river processes and avulsion in distributary river deltas. To date, research on river channel bifurcations has focused on factors determining the stability and evolution of bifurcations. It has recently been shown that, theoretically, the nonlinearity {{of the relation between}} sediment transport and flow discharge causes one of the two distributaries of a (slightly) asymmetrical bifurcation to grow and the other to shrink. The positive feedback introduced by this effect results in highly asymmetrical bifurcations. However, {{there is a lack of}} detailed insight into flow dynamics within river bifurcations, the consequent effect on <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> flux through bifurcating channels, and thus the impact on bifurcation stability over time. In this paper, three key parameters (discharge ratio, width-to-depth ratio, and bed roughness) were varied in order to examine the secondary flow field and its effect on flow partitioning, particularly near-bed and surface flow, at an experimental bifurcation. Discharge ratio was controlled by varying downstream water levels. Flow fields were quantified using both particle image velocimetry and ultrasonic Doppler velocity profiling. Results show that a bifurcation induces secondary flow cells upstream of the bifurcation. In the case of unequal discharge ratio, a strong increase in the secondary flow near the bed causes a larger volume of near-bed flow to enter the dominant channel compared to surface and depth-averaged flow. However, this effect diminishes with larger width-to-depth ratio and with increased bed roughness. The flow structure and division pattern will likely have a stabilizing effect on river channel bifurcations. The magnitude of this effect in relation to previously identified destabilizing effects is addressed by proposing an adjustment to a widely used empirical <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> nodal-point partition <b>equation.</b> Our finding implies that river bifurcations can be stable under a wider range of conditions than previously thought.
