5|$|In about 1853 {{a further}} three {{settlers}} {{arrived on the}} American whaling barque Belle, captained by Ichabod Handy. As well as George Campbell (who died in 1856) and Jack Brian (who left the island in 1854), the third, Nathan Thompson, brought three women (called Botanga, Bogoroo, and a girl named <b>Bogue)</b> from the Gilbert Islands. When his first wife Botanga died he then married <b>Bogue.</b> Thompson was the first resident to build a substantial house in the 1860s from mainland cedar washed up on the beach. Most of the residents with island ancestors have blood relations or are connected by marriage to Thompson and his second wife <b>Bogue.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1909 <b>Bogue</b> plan, this part of Lower Queen Anne had been {{considered}} for a civic center. The Civic Auditorium (later the Opera House, now McCaw Hall), the ice arena (later Mercer Arena), and the Civic Field (rebuilt in 1946 as the High School Memorial Stadium), all built in 1927 had been placed there based on that plan, as was an armory (the Food Circus during the fair, later Center House).|$|E
5|$|A {{shipbuilding}} boom in {{the early}} part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town; the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919, the first general strike in the country. A 1912 city development plan by Virgil <b>Bogue</b> went largely unused. Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era. Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic, which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bogues</b> {{was born}} on November 8, 1927, in Harlem, the son of Jamaican {{immigrants}} Frank Milholand <b>Bogues</b> and Rosa Louise <b>Bogues.</b> He attended Howard University, and graduated from Long Island University. Then he became a probation officer attached to the New York Supreme Court (1st D.). He married Dorothy, and they had two children.|$|R
5000|$|Despite his height, <b>Bogues</b> {{managed to}} block 39 shots {{throughout}} his NBA span including one on [...] tall Patrick Ewing. This happened on April 14, 1993 {{in the first}} quarter when Ewing was pulling the ball back to go up for the shot and <b>Bogues</b> stripped him of the ball. <b>Bogues</b> reportedly had a 44 in measured vertical leap, but his hands were too small to hold on to a ball to dunk one-handed. There have been rumors that in December 1990, <b>Bogues</b> dunked before the game, though this has never been confirmed.|$|R
5|$|Proposals {{for rapid}} transit service through the Roosevelt {{neighborhood}} {{date back to}} the early 20th century, when the area was near the northern city limits of Seattle. In 1911, Virgil <b>Bogue</b> proposed an extensive rapid transit system, including an underground subway following 10th Avenue Northeast from Northeast 85th Street south towards Latona (the present-day University District) and Downtown Seattle. The proposal was rejected by voters the following year, but an un-adopted 1926 plan from the Planning Commission included rapid transit service to Ravenna Park and the University District.|$|E
5|$|The NHC {{forecasts}} for Emily {{were generally}} accurate. On August29, {{two days before}} the storm's closest approach, the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Cape Romain, South Carolina, to Fenwick Island, Delaware, including the Albemarle and Pamlico sounds of North Carolina as well as the Chesapeake Bay south of the Patuxent River. The next day, the watch was discontinued south of Little River, South Carolina. A hurricane warning was issued from <b>Bogue</b> Inlet to the border of North Carolina and Virginia on August30, and was extended a day later to Cape Henlopen, Delaware. The watches and warnings were canceled as Emily turned out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were posted along the East Coast of the United States {{in advance of}} Arthur's impacts in Florida, the Carolinas, New England, and Atlantic Canada. Upon developing into a {{tropical cyclone}} early on July1, a tropical storm watch was issued in Florida from Fort Pierce to Flagler Beach. At 09:00UTC the next day, the tropical storm watch was discontinued south of Sebastian Inlet, while another one was posted from the Santee River in South Carolina to <b>Bogue</b> Banks in North Carolina. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued for Oregon Inlet to the North CarolinaVirginia state line. Later on July2, a tropical storm warning became in effect from the North Carolina side of the Little River Inlet to the state line with Virginia. Simultaneously, the tropical storm watch in Florida was removed.|$|E

In his rookie year, <b>Bogues</b> was a teammate of Manute Bol who stood [...] tall. They were the tallest and shortest players in NBA history at the time, with 28 in difference between them. Bol and <b>Bogues</b> appeared on three magazine covers together.|$|R
5|$|When Allison {{first made}} landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} flooded numerous houses and businesses. Minor wind gusts caused minor roof damage to 10houses in Cameron Parish, while its storm surge flooded portions of Louisiana Highway 82. When the system returned, more rainfall occurred, flooding over 1,000houses in St. Tammany Parish, 80 houses in Saint Bernard Parish, {{and hundreds of}} houses elsewhere in the state. The flooding also forced 1,800residents from their homes in East Baton Rouge Parish. The deluge left numerous roads impassable, while runoff resulted in severe river flooding. The <b>Bogue</b> Falaya River in Covington crested past its peak twice to near-record levels. The Amite and Comite Rivers reached their highest levels since 1983. In addition, the levee along the Bayou Manchac broke, flooding roadways and more houses. Damage in Louisiana totaled to $65million (2001USD, $84million 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|Governor Mike Easley {{declared}} a state of emergency in advance of the storm, and 200National Guard troops were dispatched to Charlotte, Raleigh, Kinston and Lumerton, while 800more were on standby. On Ocracoke Island, authorities ordered mandatory evacuations, while on <b>Bogue</b> Banks voluntary evacuations were in place. Officials in Wrightsville Beach drove along the streets with loudspeakers mounted on trucks, warning tourists that a storm was approaching. The storm forced the University of North Carolina at Wilmington to suspend a planned opening for students moving into residence halls. Campgrounds at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore were closed by the National Park Service and three boat ramps were closed. Duke Power Co. prepared for Charley by lowering the level of hydroelectric lakes to make room for excessive rainfall. The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources advised hog farmers to pump out their waste lagoon. About 60 Red Cross shelters were opened during the storm and during the peak of Charley, and roughly 1,600people sought protection.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, civil {{engineer}} Virgil <b>Bogue</b> presented {{a comprehensive plan}} {{for the city of}} Seattle, including an elevated rapid transit line running southeast from King Street Station through Chinatown towards the Rainier Valley. The plan was, however, rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, leaving it unimplemented. In 1957, Seattle City Engineer M. O. Anderberg and the Seattle Transit Commission proposed a rapid transit system utilizing the right-of-way cleared for Interstate 5 between Everett and Tacoma. The rapid transit line would travel through downtown Seattle in a tunnel under 5th Avenue, with one of its two stations at South Jackson Street at the site of Union Station. The proposal included redevelopment of Union Station into a multi-level transportation hub, with a bus terminal for intercity and suburban buses, a public parking garage, and a rooftop heliport. The proposal was rejected by the federal government, not wanting to jeopardize freeway construction, and was ultimately shelved.|$|E

5|$|The {{tropical}} storm warning from Surf City to Cape Fear was discontinued at 05:00UTC on July4. A few hours later, {{the portion of}} the hurricane warning south of <b>Bogue</b> Inlet was removed. At 09:00UTC on July4, the {{tropical storm}} warning in Massachusetts was extended westward to Woods Hole. Around that time, areas west of Cape Lookout in North Carolina were no longer under a hurricane warning. In North Carolina, the hurricane warning was canceled for areas south of Ocracoke Inlet at 11:00UTC. All hurricane warnings in the state were discontinued four hours later, as was the tropical storm warning at Albemarle Sound; in addition, all tropical storm watches issued by Environment Canada were then converted to tropical storm warnings. By 18:00UTC on July4, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Virginia, including the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, was discontinued. After passing by Nantucket and Cape Cod, the remaining tropical storm warnings in New England were rescinded.|$|E
5|$|After Gordon {{emerged into}} the Atlantic north of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas, and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast; this was extended to Bayport {{on the west coast}} and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching the Florida Keys. When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest, a hurricane warning was issued from <b>Bogue</b> Banks to the North Carolina/Virginia border. Florida governor Lawton Chiles activated the state's Emergency Operations Center. In the Florida Keys, state parks were closed, which forced some campers to leave, and all schools were closed. On the mainland, University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also closed. Space Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead of Kennedy Space Center. The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport, and nearly all flights were canceled to and from the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east-central Florida. In North Carolina, officials suggested people in low-lying areas to go to higher ground, but they did not issue evacuation orders.|$|E
5|$|In Charleston, South Carolina, the {{hurricane}} washed aground several ships and uprooted numerous trees, though {{damage to the}} city harbor was minimal. The lighthouse on North Island flanking Winyah Bay collapsed under high winds, and in Georgetown proper, {{the hurricane}} {{was considered to be}} the worst since the 1804 Antigua–Charleston hurricane, despite its storm surge being of a lesser size. A cotton field covering 94acres was ruined nearby. At Smithville, North Carolina, numerous ships experienced damage, while considerable destruction to structures was observed, with many wharves wrecked. Meanwhile, at Wilmington, the hurricane inflicted widespread damage, with many wharves severely damaged, and significant losses sustained by salt, sugar, rice, and lumber industries. The gable sections of three masonry houses were destroyed by wind or water, and wooden houses suffered especially badly, with many obliterated and those under construction flattened. One individual died after a wall collapsed and several slaves were killed, one by drowning, at local plantations. At Bald Head Island, the United States Revenue Cutter Service vessel Governor Williams was stripped of its foremast and subsequently ran ashore before being repaired and continuing on its journey. A second boat owned by the agency, the Diligence, was tethered at port in Wilmington and endured no damage; similarly, little impact occurred at New Bern. Throughout the storm, several vessels and supplies of stranded sailors were driven aground along the North Carolinan coast. On the <b>Bogue</b> Banks, the remains of the Adolphus and Atlantic were discovered, and at the Core Banks, a dead body was washed ashore, partially eaten by fish.|$|E
