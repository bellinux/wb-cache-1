The relative baffle height, relative pitch, relative <b>baffle</b> <b>hole</b> position, flow attack angle, and baffle open area ratio are 0. 6, 8. 0, 0. 42, 60 °, and 12 %, respectively. The Reynolds numbers {{considered in the}} study was in the range of 3000 – 10, 000. The re-normalization group (RNG) k-ε turbulence model has been used for numerical analysis, and the optimum relative baffle width has been investigated considering relative baffle widths of 1. 0 – 7. 0. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data for the range considered in the study. Multi V-type perforated baffles are shown to have better thermal performance as compared to other baffle shapes in a rectangular passage. The overall thermal hydraulic performance shows the maximum value at the relative baffle width of 5. 0...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a larger}} project aiming at {{development}} of a miniaturized hydrogen generator for small mobile/onboard fuel cell applications, a series of experiments was conducted on a novel micro-reactor to examine the effectiveness of its design in promoting the mixing of reactant agents. The reactor is essentially a tubular vessel fitted with a multi-holed baffle plate mounted on a central tube. The mixing phenomenon within the micro-reactor was studied using the micro-PIV (micro-particle image velocimetry) flow visualization technique. Experiments were conducted on a 1 : 1 scale replica of the reactor. Results indicate that the application of the multi-holed baffle plate considerably improves the mixing performance of the reactor when compared with a simpler co-axial jet tubular reactor. However, the geometrical characteristics of the baffle plate and central tube are found to have dramatic impacts upon the flow structure and mixing patterns within the reactor. Hence, the optimization of the reactor geometry is required to achieve the desirable mixing performance. For the range of Reynolds numbers studied here, the optimum reactor geometry is achieved when the central tube and <b>baffle</b> <b>holes</b> are of similar diameters and <b>baffle</b> <b>holes</b> are located half way between the stream-wise axis and the reactor wall...|$|R

The baffle cut ratio should affect the muffler performance analogous to a shell-and-tube heat exchanger. To the authors’ knowledge, there is no previous assessment reported in literature of the effects that the baffle cut ratio configuration has on acoustic response and back pressure. This investigation presents a parametric study {{on the effect of}} baffle configuration on transmission loss and pressure drop predicted. The effect of (i) the baffle cut ratio and baffle spacing, (ii) the number of <b>baffle</b> <b>holes,</b> and (iii) the hole distribution for their effect on transmission loss was investigated. Results show that decreasing the baffle cut ratio tends to increase the transmission loss at intermediate frequencies by up to 45 %. Decreasing the spacing between muffler plates was shown to enhance the muffler transmission loss by 40 %. To assess the baffle effect on flow, the OpenFoam CFD libraries were utilized using the thermal baffle approach model. Baffles were found to cause sudden drop in fluid temperature in axial flow direction.

40|$|Any {{motion of}} liquid surface is termed as a sloshing. It {{can be caused}} by any {{disturbance}} to partially filled liquid container. So to constitute a slosh dynamic of liquid, liquid must have free surface. The slosh dynamic of liquid alters the system dynamic or stability significantly when liquid is interact with the container. The motion of liquid with a free surface is of great concern in many engineering disciplines such as propellant slosh in spacecraft, rockets (especially upper stages), cargo slosh in ship and trucks transporting liquid (for example oil and gasoline) etc. To reduce the sloshing in moving container baffle is used as suppressing device.

The Webb performance evaluation criterion has been adopted for analysis purposes. It is found that the integrated characteristics of heat transfer and flow friction increase with the hole's diameter at the same hole density (which is equal to the ratio of the hole's total area to the baffle's area), and the heat transfer rate increases with the hole density at the same hole diameter.

40|$|Abstract—A {{numerical}} {{study on}} the turbulent flow and heat transfer characteristics in the rectangular channel with different types of baffles is carried out. The inclined baffles have the width of 19. 8 cm, the square diamond type hole having one side length of 2. 55 cm, and the inclination angle of 5 o. Reynolds number is varied between 23, 000 and 57, 000. The SST turbulence model is applied in the calculation. The validity of the numerical results is examined by the experimental data. The numerical results of the flow field depict that the flow patterns around the different baffle type are entirely different and these significantly affect the local heat transfer characteristics.

40|$|The {{optimization}} of {{flow control}} devices (FCDs) for a T-type five-strand billet caster tundish {{was carried out}} by water modeling and numerical simulation. In water modeling experiments, flow characteristics of the bare tundish and tundish configurations with designed U-type baffles and a round turbulence inhibitor were analyzed using residence time distribution (RTD) curves. Mathematical models for liquid steel in the real plant tundish were established using the fluid dynamics software package Fluent. The flow field, the temperature field, and the RTD curves of liquid steel in the proposed tundish configurations were obtained. The results of numerical simulation and water modeling were validated with each other by the predicted and experimental RTD curves. The results of flow field and temperature field were used to reflect the actual state of a real plant tundish and to choose the optimal FCD. Finally, from the whole performance of the multi-strand tundish, the optimal scheme was determined by combining the results of water modeling and numerical simulation.

The SAFL Baffle is a stormwater treatment device created at the University of Minnesota's St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. Previous research by Howard et al. 2011 showed {{that when the}} SAFL Baffle is retrofitted into a sump manhole, it improves {{the ability of the}} sump to collect sediment at low flow rates and retain captured sediment at high flow rates. The purpose of this research was to know how a SAFL Baffle performs when: 1. Clogged with debris like trash and vegetation 2. Installed in a sump manhole with an outlet pipe 90 degrees to the inlet pipe 3. Installed in a sump manhole with water entering through an inlet grate and inlet pipe Tests were performed at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory on a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 6 -ft (1. 8 m) deep sump, a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 3 -ft (0. 9 m) deep sump, a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 1 -ft (0. 3 m) deep scale model sump, and a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 0. 5 -ft (0. 15 m) deep scale model sump. All of the sumps were equipped with the SAFL Baffle, and were evaluated using two metrics: 1. How well the system captures sediment at low flow rates (Removal Efficiency Testing) 2. How well the system retains the previously captured sediment at high flow rates (Washout Testing) When a SAFL Baffle was clogged with stormwater debris, water traveled underneath of the SAFL Baffle. If the sump was deep, performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle did not change significantly. However, if the sump was shallow, significant washout was exhibited in the sump. This washout problem in shallow sumps was mitigated when a SAFL <b>Baffle</b> with <b>hole</b> diameters equal to 5 -in (12. 7 cm) was installed in the sump. Sumps with outlet pipes located 90 degrees to the inlet pipe exhibited significant washout of previously captured sediment during high flow rates. With a SAFL Baffle installed at an angle between 90 - 120 degrees of the inlet pipe, washout sharply decreased. At low flow rates, a SAFL Baffle installed at a 113 degree angle with respect to the inlet pipe captured more sediment than a SAFL Baffle installed in a standard, straight flow-through sump. In the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle that received water from an inlet pipe and an inlet grate from above, washout rates were highest when the flow rate from the inlet pipe was less than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Similarly, the ability of the device to capture sediment decreased when the flow rate from the inlet pipe was less than three times greater than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Through extensive testing, it was determined that the standard sumps equipped with the SAFL Baffle should be used downstream of stormwater sewers such that the drainage basin of the inlet pipe is at least three times the drainage basin of the inlet grate. Under this condition, the flow from an inlet grate from above does not impact the performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{different}} sensory modalities that {{play a role}} in sexual selection, acoustic communication plays an important one. Acoustic communication has been known to be used for male-male competition (territory maintenance, male aggression during mating),for advertisement to the opposite sex (mating status, body condition, genetic quality, nutritional status) and used by females to sample and choose conspecific preferred males. The use of acoustic communication for sexual display and information exchange has been extensively studied in multiple taxa, including insects, anurans, birds and mammals. Among insects, crickets have proven to be good model systems to study sexual selection based on acoustic communication as most species have an elaborate acoustic communication system, male advertisements, diverse types of mating incentives for females (such as glandular feeding) and a female dominated mating system. Generally, in crickets males produce species-specific calls which are used by females to localize conspecific males. Besides, calls show high levels of intraspecific variation and are energetically costly to produce. Moreover, as in crickets predominantly the females show phonotaxis towards male calls, calls also can {{play a role in}} mate sampling and choice by acting as indicators of preferred male quality. Despite being studied for many decades there are certain gaps in the studies examining mate choice in crickets. Some of them are, lack of understanding of the variation of male calling traits in nature and its role in signal evolution, lack of understanding regarding the ecological context of mate sampling and the evolution of alternative mating strategies. Hence, the tree cricket Oecanthus henryi was chosen as a study system to address these gaps in the understanding of female choice based on acoustic signals. In the tree cricket Oecanthus henryi, males call and females use calls to localize conspecific males and hence potentially females can choose males based on acoustic cues. To understand the evolution of female preference for male acoustic cues {{it is important to understand}} the variation in the calling songs in the field and identify repeatable call features that are reliable indicators of preferred male traits (morphological, developmental or genetic). I measured repeatability of male call traits in the field to understand their variation, reliability and consistency. Carrier frequency was the only call trait that was highly repeatable and hence was reliable and consistent. Following this I examined whether any of these call traits were indicators of male morphological traits (such as male size and fluctuating asymmetry) which are known to be preferred by females. It was found that carrier frequency was negatively correlated with body size; hence carrier frequency was both reliable and indicated male size. I also found that females preferred larger males during mating, as revealed by the longer mating durations and longer spermatophore retention time. Interestingly, though this study indicated that females could in principle use lower call carrier frequency to localize preferred larger males, simultaneous choice experiments done in the laboratory revealed that the females do not use this cue. These contrasting results may be because females are incapable of discriminating small differences in frequency or because they use non-acoustic cues for mate choice. However, whichever cues the females use to discriminate between males in the laboratory conditions, often these preferences are not realized in the field. The main reason behind this is that searching for preferred mates in the field can be costly and this might force females to choose sub-optimal males. Theoretical models predict that male movement and spacing in the field should influence female sampling tactics and in turn, females should drive the evolution of male movement and spacing to sample them optimally. Moreover, simultaneous sampling of males using the best-of-n or comparative Bayes strategy should yield maximum mating benefits to females. Many of the theoretical mate sampling strategies involves recall of the quality and location of individual males, which in turn requires male positions to be stable within a night. Calling males of O. henryi showed high site fidelity within a night, potentially enabling female sampling strategies that require recall. To examine the possibility of simultaneous acoustic sampling of males, I estimated male acoustic active spaces using information on male spacing, call transmission and female phonotactic threshold. Males were found to be spaced far apart and active space overlap was rare. I then examined female sampling scenarios by studying female spacing relative to male acoustic active spaces. Only 15 % of sampled females could hear multiple males, suggesting that simultaneous mate sampling is rare in the field. Moreover, the relatively large distances between calling males suggest high search costs, which may favor threshold strategies that do not require memory. Using the insights gathered from these two studies I examined a unique calling behaviour from leaf <b>holes,</b> <b>baffling,</b> observed in this species. Baffling behaviour has been found in multiple species of the genus Oecanthus where the males call from selfmade holes in leaves rather than calling from leaf edges (their natural calling surface) thus increasing their loudness many fold. I started by examining the natural history of baffling and found that baffling is an extremely rare behaviour in the field. However field observations and laboratory experiments revealed that many males can baffle and hence it is not an obligatory behaviour shown only by a few males. It was hypothesized that one reason for the rarity of baffling could be resource limitation. It was found that baffling males prefer larger leaves possibly due to higher SPL gains achieved by baffling on the larger leaves, which is a limited resource in the field. However this alone was insufficient to explain extreme rarity of bafflers in the field. Hence I examined which males were using this behaviour in the field. Using field observations and laboratory experiments it was found that less preferred males (smaller and quieter) baffled more which provided them with higher calling SPL and greater sound-field volume and thus a higher number of potential mates. Moreover, baffling also increased the mating duration for the less preferred males thus providing more time to these males for sperm transfer. The females could not differentiate between an inherently loud caller and a caller whose SPL was increased artificially (as if it was baffling). Hence I concluded that baffling is probably a cheater strategy used by the less preferred males to fool the females into approaching them and mating for longer durations. To my knowledge, this is the first study that has estimated male call variation in the field to understand its role in female choice in tree crickets. Moreover this is also the first study to examine the ecological context of mate choice in tree crickets. This is also the first study to examine the advantages of baffling behaviour and its potential evolutionary implications. {{the different}} sensory modalities that play a role in sexual selection, acoustic communication plays an important one.
