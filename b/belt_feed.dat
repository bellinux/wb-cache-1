25|$|In {{the buildup}} to the Second World War, the United Kingdom had {{embarked}} on a programme to develop cannon-armed fighters. They acquired a licence to build the HS.404, which entered production as the Hispano Mk.I intended as aeroplane armament. Its first use was in the Westland Whirlwind of 1940, {{and later in the}} more powerful Bristol Beaufighter, providing the Royal Air Force with powerful cannon-armed interceptors. The experience of the Battle of Britain had shown the batteries of eight rifle-calibre machine guns to be inadequate and prompted the adoption of auto cannon armament for the primary portion of Royal Air Force (RAF) fighters. The Beaufighter highlighted the need for a <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism; as a night fighter the 60-round drums needed to be replaced in the dark by the Radar/Wireless Operator, often while the aircraft was manoeuvering to keep sight of its quarry. In addition, the early trial installations in the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire had shown a tendency for the gun to jam during combat manoeuvres, leading to some official doubt as to the suitability of cannon as the sole main armament. This led to the Air Ministry for a brief period specifying 12-machine gun armament for new fighters.|$|E

To provide room for the <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> system of the cannon, the inner machine gun bays were moved outboard between ribs 13 and 14.

In the course of developing the system, several validation procedures have been performed on a prototype with four input stations that produced evidence for the occurrence of mutual impediment and gave insight into the origins of this phenomenon [12, 16].|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{the grit}} sizes {{of the sand}} <b>belt,</b> <b>feeding</b> speed and the feed power of {{the heads of the}} sander on the surface {{roughness}} of the particleboard panels were investigated. Two surface roughness parameters, average roughness (Ra) and mean peak-to-valley height (Rz), obtained from board surfaces were used in the analysis. Sanding factors were found to have a signifi-cant effect on the surface roughness of the particleboard. Better results were obtained with 40 m/min of feeding speed, 40 - 60 - 80 - 120 of grit sizes, and 67 kW of the feed power of the heads of the sander...|$|R
40|$|Oligochaetes (Annelida) {{are active}} bioturbators {{that can be}} present in high densities in the {{transition}} zone between intertidal flats and salt marshes, though their occurrence and functional role remain understudied. This study aimed to clarify the biogeomorphic role of oligochaete bioturbation in facilitating or hindering vegetation establishment. Two microcosm experiments were performed to assess the effect of oligochaete bioturbation on sediment properties, oxidation depth, algal biomass, seed distribution, and germination success of pioneer species Salicornia spp. Oligochaetes created burrow networks in the sediment matrix, which, together with upward conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>feeding,</b> lead to substrate mixing. Sediment reworking rates of oligochaetes were {{compared with those of}} polychaete macrofauna. Bioturbation and bio-irrigation of burrows can stimulate resource flows into the sediment. Oxidation depth increased almost tenfold in the presence of oligochaetes. Their bioturbation did not seem to affect sediment properties such as dry bulk density, porosity, and organic matter content. Sediment reworking, however, significantly reduced algal biomass at the surface with possible cascading effects on sediment stability and erodibility. Oligochaete conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> buried Salicornia spp. seeds until below the critical germination depth, thus negatively affecting Salicornia spp. germination and seedling establishment. Our study indicates that small, though numerous, oligochaete bioturbators may reduce lateral expansion potential of salt marshes by hindering the establishment of pioneer vegetation in the transition zone. Additionally, in dynamic fine-grained habitats, these oligochaetes have the feature to quickly oxygenate the sediment top layer...|$|R

50|$|At their peak, between {{thirty and}} forty million bison roamed the Great Bison Belt. Bison are {{excellent}} thermo-regulators, and successfully endured the harshest environmental conditions. The protein to carbohydrate ratio {{in the short}} grass provided an ideal diet for large numbers of bison. Humans had largely destroyed the megafauna of North America, eliminating the resource competition of bison. The droppings and grazing of the bison supported healthy grass maintenance, and prevented the intrusion of taller grasses. The Great Bison Belt supported numerous species and complex ecosystems. For instance, the bison were so plentiful that by the early 19th century, {{it is estimated that}} about 1.5 million wolves lived on the Great Bison <b>Belt,</b> <b>feeding</b> largely on the bison.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, Degtyaryov {{designed}} {{his heavy}} machine gun called ДС, or DS (Дегтярёва Станковый). The DS-39 was issued to the Red Army and used in the Winter War of 1939-1940. The <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism damaged the cartridge cases and the gun was found too complicated and liable to malfunctions and was withdrawn from service.|$|E
50|$|The gun was fed from a drum {{magazine}} of only thirty rounds, {{and had a}} poor rate of fire. Shpagin developed a <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism to fit to the DK giving rise, in 1938, {{to the adoption of}} the gun as the DShK 1938.

50|$|A {{machine gun}} is a fully {{automatic}} mounted or portable firearm designed to fire bullets {{in quick succession}} from an ammunition belt or magazine, typically {{at a rate of}} 300 to 1800 rounds per minute. Not all fully automatic firearms are machine guns. Submachine guns, rifles, assault rifles, shotguns, pistols or cannons may be capable of fully automatic fire, but are not designed for sustained fire. As a class of military rapid-fire guns, machine guns are fully automatic weapons designed to be used as support weapons and generally used when attached to a mount or fired from the ground on a bipod or tripod. Many (but not all) machine guns also use <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> and open bolt operation, features not normally found on rifles.|$|R
50|$|The Bailey Machine Gun used a <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> {{system that}} did not remove the {{cartridges}} from the belt as the weapon was fired. Other rapid-fire weapons of this era used a drum or hopper to hold the ammunition.

The linkless system, adopted after {{problems with the}} <b>belt</b> <b>feed,</b> is limited to 8,500 rpm. Fire control is electrical, using a 27 V DC system. The cannon has 10 pyrotechnic cocking charges, {{similar to those used}} in European gas-operated revolver cannons such as the DEFA 554 or Mauser BK-27.|$|E
50|$|In {{the factory}} museum at Kongsberg Weapon Factory, there is {{preserved}} an interesting prototype of a M1894 modified for <b>belt</b> <b>feed.</b> Although no documentation has been uncovered, it's {{clear that the}} rifle has been modified {{at an early stage}} in the manufacturing process to use the same feed belts that were used on the Hotchkiss heavy machine gun in use in the Norwegian Army at the time.|$|E
30|$|The {{main focus}} of this article has been the {{theoretical}} investigation of the divided conveyer belt based on the probabilistic treatment of an idealized model with two input stations. The reduction of input performance has been quantified in terms of the worst-case average idle time that can occur due to mutual impediment. In good agreement with the experimental results discussed in Sect.  3, the model predicts substantial reduction of the deficiency caused by mutual impediment, when the input stations of the divided conveyer belt are equipped with input areas that permit spatially variable input. In particular, with an optimal choice of the acceleration factor of the divided conveyer <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> system (a = 2) in combination with an optimal choice of the width of the input area (b_E = 3 l_min), the effect of mutual impediment can be completely eliminated.|$|R
5000|$|Pulleys were {{constructed}} of wood, iron, steel {{or a combination}} thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example a 40" [...] pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20" [...] pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached ("fast") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that turned freely ("loose") on the shaft (idlers). In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> power to a machine, a pair of stepped pulleys {{could be used to}} give a variety of speed settings for the machine.|$|R

5000|$|The design drew on many common {{concepts}} in firearms manufacture of the period, such as stamped sheet metal construction, <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> (a modified mechanism for <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> from the MG42 {{with a single}} pawl), quick barrel replacement, a pistol grip and stock, and a Semi bullpup design similar to the FG 42 (much of the action occupies the weapon's stock). The M60's operating system of an operating rod turning a rotating bolt {{was inspired by the}} FG 42, which was based on the much earlier Lewis Gun. The M60 was even constructed with a secondary assisting firing pin spring that is used in the FG 42 in semi-automatic mode even though it is actually unnecessary in the M60 (which operates only in full automatic mode). The M60's gas operation is unique, and drew on technical advances of the period, particularly the White [...] "gas expansion and cutoff" [...] principle also exploited by the M14 rifle. The M60's gas system was simpler than other gas systems and easier to clean.|$|E
50|$|The limited {{ammunition}} capacity was {{an important}} disadvantage. The Type 99 Mark 1 Fixed Model 3 could be equipped with a 100 round drum, but {{the size of the}} drum was itself a problem in fighter installations, although the Model 3 guns were installed on the initial production versions of the A6M3. A more practical solution was provided by the Type 99 Mark 1 Fixed Model 4, which featured a Kawamura-developed <b>belt</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism.|$|E

Worth to mention that the [...] "8mm FIAT" [...] designation was in fact a fancy name for the 7.7x56R cartridge (.303 British). Both types were completely interchangeable.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a design for agile manufacturing workcells intended for light mechanical assembly of products made from similar components (i. e. parts families). We define agile manufacturing {{as the ability}} to accomplish rapid changeover from the assembly of one product to the assembly of another product. Rapid hardware changeover is made possible through the use of robots, flexible part feeders, modular grippers and modular assembly hardware. The flexible feeders rely on <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> and binary computer vision for pose estimation. This has a distinct advantage over nonflexible feeding schemes such as bowl feeders which require considerable adjustment to changeover from one part to another. Rapid software changeover is being facilitated by the use of a real-time, object-oriented software environment, modular software, graphical simulations for off-line software development, and an innovative dual VMEbus controller architecture. These agile features permit new products to be introduced with minimal downtime and system reconfiguration...|$|R
50|$|A {{complex of}} fires also ignited around Morwell between 7-9 February, burning {{approximately}} 3300 ha and impacting the 1165 ha open cut {{portion of the}} Hazelwood coal mine managed by GDF Suez.

50|$|Boddington Bauxite Mine in Western Australia {{is officially}} {{recognised}} {{as having the}} world's longest and second-longest single belts with a 31 km <b>belt</b> <b>feeding</b> a 20 km (12.5 miles) long <b>belt.</b> This system <b>feeds</b> bauxite through the difficult terrain of the Darling Ranges to the Worsley Alumina refinery. The longest single-belt international conveyor runs from Meghalaya in India to a cement factory at Chhatak Bangladesh. It is about 17 km long and conveys limestone and shale at 960 tons/hour, from the quarry in India to the cement factory (7 km long in India and 10 km long in Bangladesh). The conveyor was engineered by AUMUND France and Larsen & Toubro. The conveyor is actuated by three synchronized drive units for a total power of about 1.8 MW supplied by ABB (two drives at the head end in Bangladesh and one drive {{at the tail end}} in India). The conveyor belt was manufactured in 300-meter lengths on the Indian side and 500-meter lengths on the Bangladesh side, and was installed on-site by NILOS India. The idlers, or rollers, of the system are unique in that they are designed to accommodate both horizontal and vertical curves along the terrain. Dedicated vehicles were designed for the maintenance of the conveyor, which is always at a minimum height of 5 m above the ground to avoid being flooded during monsoon periods.|$|R
