30|$|It {{is quite}} common that the bulk {{composition}} of alloys deviates considerably from <b>batch</b> <b>to</b> <b>batch,</b> and that polymers and polymer mixtures contain softeners and solvent residues. This means that an unexpected surface composition is not necessarily due to contaminations or segregation; {{it could be that}} the material is of different composition than expected. Hence, for commercial materials the composition information provided by the supplier should be checked for every batch of samples used.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} single-machine {{scheduling}} problems with Dejongs learning and forgetting effects in intermittent batch production. We consider {{the models of}} no transmission, partial transmission and total transmission of the Dejong's learning effects from <b>batch</b> <b>to</b> <b>batch.</b> The objective of scheduling problems is to minimize the total completion time. Firstly, in the model of no transmission from <b>batch</b> <b>to</b> batch,we provide the polynomial-time optimal algorithm, the complexity is O (nlog n). In addition, in the model of partial transmission from <b>batch</b> <b>to</b> <b>batch,</b> for the problem of batch sequence on the machine, we introduce 0 - 1 variable, and the problem can be formulated as an assinment problem. As we all know, an assignment problem exists in the polynomial algorithm, and {{the complexity of the}} polynomial algorithm is O (m 3). Further, we give the polynomial-time opimal algorithm, the complexity is O(nlogn + m 3). Finally, we show that SPT-sequence is the optimal sequence for the jobs within each batch, and present the polynomial time algorithm for the special case that the job numbers of all batches are cqual in the problem with the total transmission mod-nomial time algorithm for the special case that the job numbers of all batches are equal in the problem with the total transmission models, and the complexity of the algorithm is O(nlog n + m 3) ...|$|R
50|$|Other {{advantages}} of monoliths conferred by their individual construction include greater column <b>to</b> column and <b>batch</b> <b>to</b> <b>batch</b> reproducibility. One technique of creating monolith columns is to polymerize the structure in situ. This involves filling the mold or column tubing {{with a mixture}} of monomers, a cross-linking agent, a free-radical initiator, and a porogenic solvent, then initiating the polymerization process under carefully controlled thermal or irradiating conditions. Monolithic in situ polymerization avoids the primary source of column to column variability, which is the packing procedure.|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to determine trace concentrations {{of a range of}} individual PCB congeners in biological samples (serum, food and faeces) using GC-MS, to prepare a mass balance of PCBs in humans. A simple method for the analysis of PCBs in human serum, which excluded an extraction step, was first employed. Results indicated that the recoveries of 13 C 12 PCB spikes were variable. A soxhlet extraction step was added and was found to be efficient and reproducible. A quality control routine and method validation results are presented. In batch tests of the methods presented {{it was found that the}} serum analysis method gave within batch mean 13 C 12 spike recoveries of 98 – 120 % and standard deviations between 6 and 20 %. The food/faeces analysis method gave within-batch mean 13 C 12 spike recoveries of 88 – 100 %, and within batch standard deviations between 4 and 12 %. The <b>batch</b> <b>to</b> <b>batch</b> mean recovery for serum analysis was 100 %, with an RSD of 9 % for high spikes and 10 % for low spikes.
