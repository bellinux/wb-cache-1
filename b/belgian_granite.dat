5000|$|Petit Granit (also {{known by}} a variety of names including: Nero Belga, Granit de Flandre, Pierre Blue, Blue Stone, <b>Belgian</b> <b>Granite,</b> Belgian Blue Limestone, Arduin) is, despite its name, a grey-bluish limestone, rather than being a true Granite. It is mined {{exclusively}} in Belgium, where use of the name Petit Granit is subject to an Appellation dâ€™Origine Locale (Local Appellation of Origin) designation. [...] The stone becomes shiny black on polishing and is considered to be an easily worked and versatile dimension stone. It has also been used widely in sculpture and architecture, especially in Brussels and other Belgian cities.|$|E
5000|$|The Grant Building is 40-story, 147.8 m {{skyscraper}} at 310 Grant Street {{in downtown}} Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The building was completed and opened on February 1, 1929 {{at a cost}} of $5.5 million ($ million today). The Art Deco building's facade is built with <b>Belgian</b> <b>granite,</b> limestone, and brick. It was famous for a radio antenna that rose roughly 100 - 150 ft from the roof of the tower and had an aviation beacon that spelled out [...]--[...]. - - .......- [...]-. --. .... or P-I-T-T-S-B-U-R-G-H in Morse Code. The beacon could be seen as far away as 150 mi on clear nights. A smaller version of the beacon, still flashing out the name of the city remains to this day, although malfunctions with the relay switch caused it to spell [...] "P-I-T-E-T-S-B-K-R-R-H", and eventually [...] "T-P-E-B-T-S-A-U-R-G-H" [...] before being repaired on July 27, 2009.|$|E
5|$|As these {{secondary}} {{objectives were}} attacked, a single glider landed {{on top of}} the Fort, from which emerged Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig. After his glider had unintentionally landed in German territory, he had radioed for another tug, and it landed in the field with a replacement glider. Once the airborne troops had broken down fences and hedges obstructing the aircraft, they boarded the new glider and were towed through anti-aircraft fire to the fort. Having achieved their primary objectives of disabling the artillery pieces possessed by the fort, the airborne troops then held it against Belgian counter-attacks, which began almost immediately. These counter-attacks were made by Belgian infantry formations without artillery support and were uncoordinated. This allowed the airborne troops to repel them with machine-gun fire. Artillery from several smaller Forts nearby and Belgian field artillery units also targeted the airborne troops, but this too was uncoordinated and achieved nothing and often aided the airborne troops in repelling counter-attacks by Belgian infantry units. Patrols were also used to ensure that the garrison stayed in the interior of the fort and did not attempt to emerge and mount an attempt to retake the fort. Any attempt by the garrison to launch a counter-attack would have been stymied {{by the fact that the}} only possible route for such an attack was up a single, spiral staircase, and any embrasures looking out onto the Fort had either been captured or disabled. The plan for the assault had called for Group Granite to be relieved by 51st Engineer Battalion within a few hours of seizing the Fort, but the Group was not actually relieved until 7:00 on 11 May. Heavy Belgian resistance, as well as several demolished bridges over the River Meuse, had forced the battalion to lay down new bridges, delaying it significantly. Once the airborne troops had been relieved, the battalion, in conjunction with an infantry regiment that arrived shortly after the engineers, mounted an attack on the main entrance to the fort. Faced with this attack, the garrison surrendered at 12:30, suffering sixty men killed and forty wounded. The Germans captured more than a thousand <b>Belgian</b> soldiers. Group <b>Granite</b> suffered six killed and nineteen wounded.|$|R
