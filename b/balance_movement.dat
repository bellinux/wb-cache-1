Arm reaching movements are parametrized as a linear combination of basis elements, which are extracted via a principal component analysis of human motion capture data. Humanlike reaching movements are then generated by determining the minimum torque motion from this parametrized class of arm <b>movements.</b> The optimal <b>balancing</b> problem, in which {{the goal is to}} execute a desired <b>movement</b> without losing <b>balance,</b> is framed as second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem; it is also shown that many existing optimization-based balancing strategies reduce to special cases of this more general formulation.

A solid joint assembly (4) includes a solid joint arrangement (4 a) forming a lever (H 1), and is mechanically coupled {{to the movement}} unit. Another solid joint assembly (5) includes a solid joint arrangement (5 a), and is mechanically coupled to the movement unit and/or the former joint assembly. The joint arrangement of the latter joint assembly is deflectable by an actuator, and the movement unit is translatory deflectable in one of spatial directions due to coupling of the latter joint assembly. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The actuator {{is formed as a}} piezoactuator. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a device for positioning an object and/or for machining a workpiece (2) a method for executing translatory <b>balance</b> <b>movements</b> in spatial directions. USE - Balance actuating element for use in a device i. e. industrial robot system, for positioning an object and/or for machining a workpiece (all claimed), for executing translatory <b>balance</b> <b>movements</b> in spatial directions.

40|$|<b>Balance</b> {{underlies}} all <b>movements!</b> <b>Balance</b> {{is one of}} {{the fundamental}} movement skills. If you can’t <b>balance,</b> your <b>movements</b> will be awkward or even unsafe. Functional balance (dynamic equilibrium) is the interplay of imbalance and balance as the body constantly tries to regain balance to perform efficient movement using these senses: ocular (vision), vestibular (inner ear), kinesthetic (body position awareness), and auditory (hearing). There are two “zones ” of balance. Begin training the inner zone (close to center of gravity) before training the outer zone (beyond the static stance center of gravity). The amount of balance training volume should be small, but you should work on balance everyday...|$|R

This is particularly true for the hippocampus, a brain structure that plays an important role in learning and memory, and whose decline has been related to the development of Alzheimer´s disease. In the current study, we were interested in whether not only cardiovascular activity but also other types of physical activity, i. e., coordination training, were also positively associated with the volume of the hippocampus in older adults. For this purpose we first collected cross-sectional data on metabolic fitness (cardiovascular fitness and muscular strength) and motor fitness (e. g, <b>balance,</b> <b>movement</b> speed, fine coordination). Second, we performed a 12 -month randomized controlled trial. Results revealed that motor fitness but not metabolic fitness was associated with hippocampal volume. After the 12 -month intervention period, both, cardiovascular and coordination training led to increases in hippocampal volume. Our findings suggest that a high motor fitness level as well as different types of physical activity were beneficial to diminish age-related hippocampal volume shrinkage or even increase hippocampal volume...|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{an upcoming}} era in software industry. It’s a very vast and developing technology. Distributed file systems {{play an important}} role in cloud computing applications based on map reduce techniques. While making use of distributed file systems for cloud computing, nodes serves computing and storage functions at the same time. Given file is divided into small parts to use map reduce algorithms in parallel. But the problem lies here since in cloud computing nodes may be added, deleted or modified any time and also operations on files may be done dynamically. This causes the unequal load distribution of load among the nodes which leads to load imbalance problem in distributed file system. Newly developed distributed file system mostly depends upon central node for load distribution but this method is not helpful in large-scale and where chances of failure are more. Use of central node for load distribution creates a problem of single point dependency and chances of performance of bottleneck are more. As well as issues like movement cost and network traffic caused due to migration of nodes and file chunks need to be resolved. So we are proposing algorithm which will overcome all these problems and helps to achieve uniform load distribution efficiently.

40|$|Background/Purpose: Patients {{can develop}} {{peripheral}} neuropathies {{from a variety}} of causes: diabetes, poor circulation, cancer treatment, and in this case alcoholism. Peripheral neuropathy is a condition, and a risk factor for increased risk of falls, poor <b>balance,</b> <b>movement</b> disorders, and subsequently sedentary behavior lending to a cascade of problems. It is not clear whether perturbation balance training is effective in reducing fall risk of individuals in the acute care setting with neuropathies due to alcoholism. Case Discussion: A 47 year old homeless male was admitted to the hospital on 11 / 02 / 15 with symptoms of end stage liver disease, malnutrition, and alcohol dependence. The patient presented to Physical Therapy (PT) with impaired balance, sensory loss, decreased strength and poor endurance. Outcomes: Over the course of his stay at the hospital the patient demonstrated substantial improvement in his endurance, balance, and functional abilities as compared to his condition upon admission. All goals set by the Student Physical Therapist (SPT) were achieved by discharge on 11 / 08 / 15. Discussion: Balance training was more effective than other treatments in all of the articles analyzed. An extensive literature search found six of eight studies examined perturbation exercises compared to other exercise or no exercise. Perturbation balance training was shown to be effective in reducing fall risk and is recommended over other types of exercise in subjects with peripheral neuropathy...|$|E
40|$|Human gait {{is mainly}} {{related to the}} foot and leg {{movements}} but, obviously, the entire motor system {{of the human body}} is involved. We hypothesise that movement parameters such as dynamic <b>balance,</b> <b>movement</b> harmony of each body element (arms, head, thorax…) could enable us to finely characterise gait singularities to pinpoint potential diseases or abnormalities in advance. Since this paper deals with the preliminary problem pertaining to the classification of normal and abnormal gait, our study will revolve around {{the lower part of the}} body. Our proposal presents a functional specification of gait in which only observational kinematic aspects are discussed. The resultant specification will confidently be open enough to be applied to a variety of gait analysis problems encountered in areas connected to rehabilitation, sports, children’s motor skills, and so on. To carry out our functional specification, we develop an extraction system through which we analyse image sequences to identify gait features. Our prototype not only readily lets us determine the dynamic parameters (heel strike, toe off, stride length and time) and some skeleton joints but also satisfactorily supplies us with a proper distinction between normal and abnormal gait.

Research completed at the School of Community Affairs, College of Liberal Arts & SciencesTo determine how the First Step to Active Aging (FSAH) program impacts functional fitness (FF), balance, and daily physical activity (DPA) in older adults. The FSAH group consisted of 18 women. FSAH group met at a senior center for 11 wk, 2 d•wk for a 50 min. training program (flexibility, strength, balance, aerobic). The control group consisted of 15 women. Program effectiveness was assessed using measures of FF (chair stand, arm curl, sit & reach, up & go, scratch test, and 12 -min walk), <b>balance</b> (<b>movement</b> velocity (MVL), endpoint excursion (EPE), maximum EPE (MXE), and directional control (DCL) for forward (F), right (R), left (L) and back (B) movements), pedometer measured DPA, and weight. No baseline difference existed between groups. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed group x time interactions (p <. 05) on all measures except flexibility. After 11 weeks, FF improvements were noted in the FSAH group: Chair Stand 46 %, Arm Curl 25 %; Up-&-Go 8 %; 12 -min Walk 13 %. With respect to LOS, MXE improved in all directions (F 18 %, R 14 %, B 23 %,L 10 %) and DCL improved in the F direction 9 %. DPA also increased from 3, 108 to 5, 077 steps (38 %).
