50|$|The flint {{is held in}} a clamp {{at the end of}} a <b>bent</b> <b>lever</b> {{called the}} cock. Upon pulling the trigger, this moves forward under the {{pressure}} of a strong spring and strikes a curved plate of hardened steel (called simply the steel, or in 17th century English dialect the frizzen) to produce a shower of sparks (actually white-hot steel shavings). These fall into a flash pan holding priming powder. The flash from the pan travels through the touch hole to cause the main charge of gunpowder to explode. The steel is {{at the end of a}}n arm that can be moved independently of the pan cover.|$|E
5000|$|In all snaplocks, {{the flint}} {{is held in}} a clamp {{at the end of}} a <b>bent</b> <b>lever</b> called the cock. When the gun is [...] "cocked", the cock is held back, against the {{pressure}} of a spring, by a catch which is part of the trigger mechanism. When the trigger is pulled, the catch is released and the spring moves the cock rapidly forwards. The flint strikes a curved plate of hardened steel, called the [...] "steel". The flint strikes from the steel a shower of white hot steel shavings (sparks) which fall towards the priming powder held in the flash pan. The flash from the pan's ignited primer travels (unless there is only a [...] "flash in the pan") through the touch hole into the firing chamber at the rear of the barrel, and ignites the main charge of gunpowder.|$|E
40|$|Certain verbs (e. g. bend, break) can {{undergo the}} causative alternation, {{appearing}} both in a transitive form (John <b>bent</b> the <b>lever)</b> and an intransitive form (The <b>lever</b> <b>bent).</b> To explain this alternation, linguists {{have proposed that}} the transitive form of the alternation conveys an action with an explicitly causative structureâ€” for example that John <b>bent</b> the <b>lever</b> indirectly conveys the proposition John caused [the lever bent]. While this analysis is syntactically appealing, it makes strong assumptions about explicit representations of causality in the motor system that must be independently justified. In fact {{there is a large}} body of research within motor neuroscience showing that motor programmes can be defined by the perceptual effects they cause. In this paper we argue that the causative action representations posited by linguists are direct references to the effect-based action representations identified by motor neuroscientists. We develop a neural network model of how an agent can learn actions that are defined by the effects they bring about, and deploy this model in an account of the syntax of causative sentences...|$|R
5000|$|The M56 is the M26A1 with {{a larger}} 5/8-inch fuze well. It uses the M215 detonating fuse (with a delay of 4-5 seconds) and has a [...] "jungle clip" [...] like the M61. The M215 {{is similar to the}} M213 fuse used in the M33-series grenades except it has a curved lever rather than the <b>bent</b> {{straight}} <b>lever</b> of the M213.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} neural network model of motor {{learning}} structured around circuits which associate motor actions with their sensory effects, as proposed by Hommel et al. (2001). The network implements a novel model of causative actions, which bring about specified distal movements in manipulated target objects (e. g. bending a lever). It also serves {{as the basis for}} a novel embodied account of the syntax of causative sentences such as John <b>bent</b> the <b>lever...</b>|$|R
50|$|According to {{the account}} in the 1882 Music and Drama article, by 1870 Mathushek had {{returned}} to New York and was only nominally associated with the Mathushek Piano Manufacturing Company; Dolge dated this one year later, when he was listed there in unassigned patents he received for a system compensating wires arranged to counteract the bending strain of the main strings, and vertically <b>bent</b> key <b>levers</b> for upright pianos. Barlow & Mathushek, with Warren Sumner Barlow and are listed in 1869 directories, with listed at the same address.|$|R
5000|$|During its {{production}} run {{a few minor}} changes {{were made to the}} 3020 and other tractors of the New Generation series. These included moving the hydraulic levers from {{the left side of the}} dash to a console to the right of the operator, a narrower oval muffler for improved visibility, and a longer, <b>bent,</b> gear shift <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another of {{his early}} {{transmitters}} was a rough model of the human ear, carved in oak, and provided with a drum which actuated a <b>bent</b> and pivoted <b>lever</b> of platinum, making it open and close a springy contact of platinum foil in the metallic circuit of the current. He devised some ten or twelve different forms, each an improvement on its predecessors, which transmitted music fairly well, and even {{a word or two}} of speech with more or less fidelity.|$|R
5000|$|... 17 February 1964 - Australia: Launch of the Morris 1100 De Luxe. It had a {{total of}} thirty-seven {{different}} modifications to make it suitable for Australian terrain, including a modified interior for greater comfort. A bench front seat was fitted, with the handbrake moved to a position between the driver's side of the seat and the door. A long, <b>bent</b> gear <b>lever</b> was used to clear {{the middle of the}} seat. Externally, over-riders were fitted to both the front and rear bumper bars and, as an optional extra, a solid or metal mesh sun visor could be fitted to the top windscreen arch to help [...] "protect the front seat occupants from eye strain caused by direct sun rays." [...] Another optional extra was a metal horizontally slatted [...] "Venetian Shade" [...] which could be fitted internally to the back window. This was intended to prevent the interior becoming too hot.|$|R
