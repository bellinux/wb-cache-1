5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might <b>be</b> <b>after</b> a period of schooling or even university.|$|E

In 2014, Bellway Homes announced they would convert the former Ipswich Road factory into a housing estate named Avellana Place. Locals protested against the name, which is Spanish for hazelnut, saying a more appropriate name would <b>be</b> <b>after</b> the 1944 Lancaster Bomber crash.|$|E

We interviewed six site creators {{to understand the}} motivations they felt and the challenges they encountered.

Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R

5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to <b>be.</b> <b>After</b> Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E

When the show starts, Michael and Gabe get into an argument over how high the volume should <b>be.</b> <b>After</b> taking turns raising and lowering the volume, Michael retreats to Gabe's bedroom, hoping that his employees will follow him there. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) has been {{having a hard time}} with getting her daughter CeCe to go to sleep at night, so Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) picks her up to try to calm her down. Pam is stunned that CeCe becomes completely quiet in Dwight's hands.|$|E

The Manchester Airport to Blackpool route will also be electrified, allowing further diesel trains to be cascaded on to other TransPennine Express services. However, this will <b>be</b> <b>after</b> the end of the current TransPennine Express franchise.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} this time that the band's {{trademark}} plaid clothing came to <b>be.</b> <b>After</b> a show where Barrett wore plaid, fans started to show up wearing it as well. It was noticeable enough that the band was approached by the Converse sneaker company to promote their new line of Chuck Taylor sneakers. The band accepted the proposal and were seen in several television commercials promoting the sneakers.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with what}} had gone before and what {{followed}} it was a small, low-cost affair. The approach was from {{the north side of}} the mountain and the climbing was planned to <b>be</b> <b>after</b> the monsoon. The monsoon was unusually late that year and, beset by the weather and in difficult conditions of snow, little was achieved regarding the summit. However, a very large number of lesser peaks were climbed for the first time and a southern route up the Western Cwm was identified as a possible line of approach if Nepal could ever be persuaded to change its policy of not admitting climbers.|$|E
25|$|And {{even more}} bands ceased to <b>be.</b> <b>After</b> two {{successful}} albums that featured several would-be classics of the era, La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros hung up, as did Invisible, leaving as a legacy {{three of the}} greatest albums in Argentine rock's history: Invisible, Durazno Sangrando and Jardin de los Presentes. Pastoral, {{one of the last}} acoustic groups still successful, split by 1978, as did ALAS. With the country gripped by World Cup mania (Argentina was host in 1978), and the disco craze, rock music suffered the worst drought since its inception. The media was openly calling out 'the death' of Argentine rock.|$|E

Chowringhee Road <b>was</b> renamed <b>after</b> Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Park Street <b>was</b> renamed <b>after</b> Mother Teresa. Theatre Road <b>was</b> renamed <b>after</b> William Shakespeare. There was no street named after the poet during the long years of British rule in India.

25|$|The match {{began with}} a goal after just 20 seconds, scored by Jakub Klepiš from a pass by Jaromír Jágr. The goal was {{seemingly}} {{the result of a}} defensive mistake which led to a Czech offensive possession with Russian defensemen out of position. For the remainder of the period the Russians held almost complete possession of the puck, and veteran Sergei Fedorov hit the post after an odd man rush. Very late in the period the Russians put the puck in the net on a power play, but it was determined to <b>be</b> <b>after</b> the clock had run out and was ruled as no goal. There was some brief confusion however, as the buzzer sounds after the clock on the scoreboard runs out.|$|E
25|$|If an MP becomes {{subject to}} any {{disqualification}} specified in paragraph 1, 2, 5 or 7 above {{and it is}} open to the Member to appeal against the decision, the Member immediately ceases to be entitled to sit or vote in Parliament or any committee of it. However, he or she is not required to vacate his or her seat until the end of 180 days beginning with the date of the adjudication, declaration or conviction, as the case may <b>be.</b> <b>After</b> that period, the MP must vacate his or her seat if he or she continues to be subject to one of the previously mentioned disqualifications.

25|$|New Hydraulic Generation (Keeyask, Conawapa, Notigi) and HVDC Transmission.: Studies are {{continuing}} to permit eventual construction of new generating projects along the Nelson River. The Keeyask (formerly Gull) station will have a capacity of approximately 630 megawatts. Final design and construction have started. The 1380 megawatt Conawapa project was initiated but postponed indefinitely in 1992 when Ontario Hydro elected not to purchase firm energy from Manitoba. Planning activities {{are continuing}}, but no construction commitment has been made and no environmental hearings are currently scheduled. The in-service date would <b>be</b> <b>after</b> that for Keeyask, with current estimated load growth requiring first power in 2021. The station at Notigi would be rated approximately 100 megawatts, but no in-service {{date has been set}} for this project.|$|E

25|$|Following Tibet's {{unexpected}} offer, the Mount Everest Committee {{decided on}} an {{attempt on the}} summit for 1936 but preceded by a reconnaissance in the current year. Tom Longstaff had been very praising of the Nanda Devi trek and so this approach {{would be used for}} 1935 on Everest. The reconnaissance could be mounted quickly and paid for out of the existing funds of £1,400 so that all the new funds raised could be allocated to the 1936 bid for the summit. Shipton was offered the leadership of the 1935 slot with Ruttledge's approval. He {{would not be able to}} reach the region before July which was expected to <b>be</b> <b>after</b> the start of the monsoon but this would allow the team to find out whether the monsoon snow had sufficiently consolidated.|$|E

Later on in the series she matures into a blooming young lady and becomes a confident emerging lawyer. On finally has a chance to confront her with a proposal after Leung's death.|$|E
25|$|The first {{elevated}} {{level of}} the stations contains the ticket booths, some small kiosk-like shops, and access control gates. The second level (and third at Siam Station) is again accessed with stairs and escalators and contains the platforms and rails. With the exception of Siam Station and Samrong, the stations follow a side platform layout. Siam Station uses island platforms to facilitate cross-platform interchange between the two lines. Additionally, many stations have ramps and elevators to allow passengers who use wheelchairs to access the ticketing hall and platforms from the street. The distances between doors are equal throughout the train, {{regardless of whether they}} are in the same or different cars, and the locations where the doors will <b>be</b> <b>after</b> the train has stopped are marked on the platform. The platforms are built to accommodate trains of six cars, but trains of only four cars are in operation. Security personnel are stationed at every platform and ticketing hall.|$|E
