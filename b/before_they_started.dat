Flax plants, uprooted <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems. These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing. Papyrus growing {{on the banks of the}} Nile River was used to make paper. Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand. Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2012 season, the Mumbai Indians traded Dinesh Karthik from Kings XI Punjab and Pragyan Ojha from the Deccan Chargers for {{undisclosed}} sums. At the auction, the franchise bought five players including R. P. Singh, Thisara Perera (both for $600,000) and Mitchell Johnson. Tendulkar stepped down from captaincy hours before the season's first game following which Harbhajan was appointed as the captain. In {{the first half of the}} league stage, Mumbai had four wins and four defeats, including three losses at home. Mumbai did not have a fixed opening combination, with Tendulkar missing out four matches due to an injury and other opening batsmen failing to show consistency. Johnson was ruled out of rest of the season in late-April with an injury and Dwayne Smith was named his replacement in the squad. Mumbai fared better in the second half of the league stage, winning six of their eight matches. They finished third on the points table with 20 points from 16 matches and qualified for the Eliminator against the fourth-placed Chennai Super Kings at Bangalore. Mumbai won the toss and put Chennai in to bat first. After losing two wickets inside the first two overs, Chennai managed to put up 187/5 in 20 overs mainly because of their captain MS Dhoni's unbeaten 20-ball 51. Mumbai's chase had started solidly with the score reading 47/0 in the fifth over, <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> losing wickets at regular intervals to end at 149/9 and lose the match by 38 runs. They gained direct qualification to the 2012 Champions League Twenty20 in South Africa, along with the three IPL teams that finished at the top that season. Mumbai, placed in Group B, were winless in the tournament with three defeats and one no result.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E

Using Hybrid Theory as a template, the band composed and recorded it in context of modern times, in 2014 rather than 2000. Guitarist Brad Delson jokingly stated that the album was an [...] "alternative Hybrid Theory" [...] and [...] "maybe its prequel", with the album being inspired by artists the band listened to <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> their musical career. Shinoda told Rolling Stone about the ideas surrounding The Hunting Party: [...] "We're not 18-year-old kids making a loud record – we're 37-year-old adults making a loud record.

500|$|Fourteen riders {{representing}} twelve teams {{broke away}} after [...] They stayed {{clear as a}} group through the four climbs on course <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> to splinter. Danilo Di Luca's LPR team drove the peloton most of the day, because the finish figured to favor Di Luca more than race leader Denis Menchov or the man in third, Levi Leipheimer. However, one team pulling {{at the front of}} the peloton proved to be no match for a 14-man breakaway working cohesively, and by the time the peloton reached the descent of the fourth climb, the last before the summit finish, it was clear the breakaway would not be caught. The breakaway was still twelve strong as it began the last climb of the day. Andriy Hryvko was the first to attack for the stage win, but he was caught well before the summit, and wound up finishing in the pink jersey group a minute behind the stage winner. The decisive attack came from Simon Gerrans, who no one could match, giving the Cervélo rider the stage win. Leipheimer and Ivan Basso were both dropped from the pink jersey group just before the summit of the climb and the end of the stage, losing three potentially valuable seconds to the other highly placed riders in the GC. Michael Rogers was a further three seconds back of Leipheimer and Basso, causing him to drop from sixth to seventh in the GC.|$|E

The DVD is split into five chapters that documents {{the production of}} the album, its promotion, and the [...] "Feedback" [...] music video. The first chapter entitled [...] "Photo Shoots", shows Jackson creating a new image for the album and adopting different looks for different markets. She spent two days working on photos for the cover and credit booklet, revealing that she still feels uncomfortable {{in front of the camera}} despite two decades in the music industry. In the second chapter, [...] "The Studio", Jackson expressed her opinion on recording work, stating that although she usually enjoyed the experience, it was, at times, tedious. She discusses further how her songs are built up in layers and parts, from melodies and background vocals or sounds. The third chapter, [...] "Rehearsals", shows the rehearsals of the dance routine for the [...] "Feedback" [...] music video. The DVD reveals that the eight dancers had been practicing for over a week <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> working with Jackson. The dancers then had three days to rehearse with Jackson and a further two days to complete the video. Jackson described the video as a metaphor for sexual tension. The fourth chapter, [...] "Behind the Video", shows the making of the video itself. Jackson told the director that she wanted a futuristic, moody concept, and he came up with the idea of jumping between planets. The final chapter is the lead music video in its entirety. On March 31, 2008 an edition of Discipline in environmentally friendly packaging was released through Wal-Mart stores as part of a green promotion.|$|E

A week before shooting, they had still failed to cast Lorelai so they asked Graham to audition anyway. Sherman-Palladino cast her that day, on the hope that Graham's other show (M.Y.O.B.) would be cancelled, which it soon was. She later explained how Graham met all the criteria she had been looking for: [...] "Lorelai’s a hard fucking part. You’ve got to be funny, you’ve got to talk really fucking fast, you’ve got to be able to act, you’ve got to be sexy, but not scary sexy. You’ve got to be strong, but not like ‘I hate men,'".

Unlike the first study, they wanted all participants in the forum to be indistinguishable from other bystanders on the forum. Therefore, the manipulation of public self-awareness was induced independently from the Internet forum. The procedure was identical to the first study, with a few variations. To induce public awareness in this study, webcams were mounted on participant’s computers. Participants {{could not see the}} video feed, but to make this more salient, they asked participants <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> to check whether the camera was on by looking at a LED-indicator underneath the webcam. To make the conditions resemble each other as close as possible, they asked participants in the camera absent condition to check if the LED-indicator for Num-Lock was on. Similar to the first experiment, five different messages were presented to the participants and the number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants. [...] Once again, the results were as expected. When the camera was not present, the bystander effect existed with the average amount of help being 1.5. However, when a camera was present, the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help doubling to 3. That said, the findings revealed the importance of public self-awareness in the bystander effect.|$|E
2500|$|Kenseth {{was born}} in Cambridge, Wisconsin. He made an {{agreement}} with his father, Roy, that Roy should buy a car and race, and Matt would work on the car until {{he was old enough}} to race. Kenseth began stock car racing in 1988 at the age of 16 at Madison International Speedway. [...] "My dad bought a car when I was 13 and raced it at Madison," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Neither of us knew much and it was a learning experience. He continued to race in 1988 and 1989. My first car– what might be considered a sportsman– was a 1981 Camaro that Todd Kropf had driven to championships at Madison and Columbus 151 Speedway. On the third night out I won a feature. I ran 15 features in 1983 and won two of them." [...] "The first night out in the Kropf car Matt won a heat race," [...] said Kenseth's father Roy. [...] "The third night he won the feature by holding off two of the best drivers at the track, Pete Moore and Dave Phillips, for 20 laps. Matt was smooth. I knew then {{he was going to be}} a racer." [...] He ran for the points title on Saturday nights at Wisconsin Dells in 1989. He finished second in points and won eight features. On Friday nights, he ran about half of the races at Golden Sands Speedway and half at Columbus 151 Speedway. In 1990, he bought a late model from Rich Bickle. In the season-opening race at Slinger Super Speedway, Kenseth inherited the lead and won his only race of the season when track champion Tony Strupp had a flat tire. He finished sixth in season points and won the track's rookie of the year award. Kenseth entered fifteen ARTGO events that season and raced in 40 features that year. After graduating from [...] Cambridge High School that summer, Kenseth worked for four years selling and shipping parts for Left-hander Chassis, a late model racecar chassis manufacturer just south of Wisconsin in Illinois. In 1991 he won the ARTGO race at La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway to become the youngest winner in the series' history. He passed Joe Shear and Steve Holzhausen, and held off Steve and Tom Carlson for the win. 1992 was a difficult year for Kenseth. He won three races and blew up more engines than he could count. He was ready to quit racing after the season. [...] "I felt we were at a standstill", he said. [...] "I wasn't gaining. My dad and I had some major discussions at the end of the year. We had to find the dollars for a good program or I told him I would rather not race." [...] Kipley Performance loaned a motor to Kenseth for the season-final race at La Crosse and the team ran better. Kenseth built a new car for 1993 using a Kipley engine. He used the car at Madison to win eight features and finished second in the points. Mike Butz offered Kenseth the chance to race his late model, and it took some time for the combination to stop struggling <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>started</b> winning features. At the end of the season, they won the final short track series race at Madison, La Crosse, and I-70 Speedway.|$|E
