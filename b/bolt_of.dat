5|$|A polygamist, Idi Amin {{married at}} least six women, three of whom he divorced. He married his first and second wives, Malyamu and Kay, in 1966.

Malyamu was arrested in Tororo on the Kenyan border in April 1974 and accused of attempting to smuggle a <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> fabric into Kenya. She later moved to London where she operates a restaurant in East London. In 1974, Kay Amin died under mysterious circumstances, with her body found dismembered.

He finished in front of Daniel Bailey from Antigua and Barbuda (10.12 seconds) in a heat won by eventual gold medallist Usain <b>Bolt</b> <b>of</b> Jamaica (9.87 seconds). Overall he finished 15th out of 75th athletes overall and was unable to progress further because his time was 0.09 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced to the first round. After the event Phiri said he placed a large amount of pressure onto himself but was not good enough in the event. Nevertheless, he thanked the people who supported him.|$|E

5|$|For {{the civilians}} of San Francisco, Fletcher {{decided on a}} greater freedom in dress. Much of the {{materials}} for these casual clothes {{were found in the}} old storerooms at Paramount, where a large amount of unused or forgotten silks, crepes, and leathers lay in storage. One <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> material had been handpicked by Cecil DeMille in 1939, and was in perfect condition. The red, black, and gold brocade was woven with real gold and silver wrapped around silk thread; the resulting costume was used for a Betelgeusean ambassador and, at a price of $10,000 for the fabric alone, was the most expensive costume ever worn by a Hollywood extra. Fletcher also recycled suedes from The Ten Commandments for the Zaranite costumes. With the approval of Roddenberry, Fletcher fashioned complete backgrounds for the alien races seen in the Earth and recreation deck sequences, describing their appearances and the composition of their costumes.|$|E

A violent storm arrives, with a <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> lightning striking the ship, engulfing it in flames and eventually destroying it, tossing Eric overboard. She rescues Eric and brings him to shore. Ariel sings to Eric, but immediately leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Fascinated {{by the memory of}} her voice, Eric vows to find who saved and sang to him, and Ariel vows {{to find a way to}} join him and his world. When Triton discovers Ariel's love for Eric, Triton confronts her in the grotto and destroys most of the artifacts with his trident.

5|$|Onshore, winds reached 52mph (84km/h) in Norfolk, Virginia, with an {{unofficial}} report of 57mph (92km/h) near Virginia Beach. Similar observations occurred along the Outer Banks, with the winds knocking some tree limbs onto power lines; some isolated power outages were reported. Wind damage included some roofs losing shingles from the winds. In Elizabeth City, North Carolina, an outer rainband dropped 0.5inches (10mm) of precipitation in about twohours {{as well as}} several lightning strikes; one <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> lightning injured two firefighters. The winds covered portions of North Carolina Highway 12 with sand, and for a day the route was closed after waves from the storm washed out about 200feet (60m) of roadway. In some locations, the waves eroded up to 20feet (6m) of beach, leaving 70homes in imminent danger. On St. Simons Island in Georgia, the storm produced a storm tide of 8.09feet (2.43m). Trace amounts of rainfall occurred in the southeastern portion of the state.|$|E
5|$|Osborn had {{assembled}} {{a team of}} supervillains, which included Gargan, newly bonded with the Venom symbiote. However, Mary Jane had contacted SHIELD, and the villains were faced not only by Spider-Man, but the combined might of Captain America, Iron Man, Yellowjacket, Daredevil and the Fantastic Four. During the fracas, the Green Goblin manages to escape and kidnap Mary Jane Watson, taking her to the George Washington Bridge in order to replay his murder of Gwen Stacy. However, a drugged Doctor Octopus intervenes, attacking the Green Goblin. Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane after a <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> lightning sends the two villains into the river. Following some verbal clues from the Green Goblin, Peter also discovers where he had hidden Aunt May, and rescues her as well. It is revealed that Osborn sent Peter a letter before the fight, thanking Peter for giving his life meaning and purpose, but Peter never received the letter due to moving from his residence. After this battle, Osborn attempts to escape to Paris, but is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Crunch Bandicoot {{was designed}} by Craig Whittle of Traveller's Tales and Sean Krankel of Universal. The concept of battling mini-bosses within the game's levels was dropped to uphold the fast and frantic pace of the series' gameplay. Multiplayer capability was also considered before being dropped. An earlier draft of the story featured an alternate version of the game's climax and ending, which involved Crash battling Crunch in a mechanical robot suit. At {{the end of the}} fight, Crunch would destroy Crash's suit with a <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> electricity. The resulting debris would render Cortex unconscious, destroy the remote control device controlling Crunch and start an electrical fire in the space station. As the Bandicoots escape to resume their beach-going vacation, the ruins of the space station would crash-land onto the island of Cortex's original settlement, conveniently allowing Cortex and Uka Uka to resume their world domination bids.|$|E

5|$|The {{venue for}} Il ritorno's première {{was at one}} time {{thought to be the}} Teatro Cassiano, but {{scholarly}} consensus considers it most likely that both the 1639–40 and 1640–41 performances were at the Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo. This view is supported by a study of the performance schedules for other Venice operas, and by the knowledge that the Manelli company had severed its connection with the Teatro Cassiano before the 1639–40 season. The Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo, owned by the Grimani family, would also be the venue for the premières of Monteverdi's Le nozze d'Enea and Poppea. In terms of its staging Il ritorno is, says Carter, fairly undemanding, requiring three basic sets—a palace, a seascape and a woodland scene—which were more or less standard for early Venetian opera. It did, however, demand some spectacular special effects: the Phaecian ship turns to stone, an airborne chariot transports Minerva, a <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> fire transforms Ulisse.|$|E
5|$|Wizards & Warriors III: Kuros: Visions of Power {{takes place}} {{immediately}} after the events {{at the end of}} the previous game, , when Kuros has defeated his nemesis, the evil wizard Malkil, on the peak of IceFire Mountain. Unaware that Malkil's spirit has survived, Kuros is struck by a <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> magic from the spirit, knocking him out and removing his armor, memory, and honor. A weakened Malkil then flees and takes refuge in the peaceful city of Piedup, where he dethrones Good King James and takes control of the city. Meanwhile, Kuros has been left to wander in the wilderness without any weapons, armor, or food. After wandering for several months, he finally reaches the city of Piedup, where Malkil's spirit lies. While in the city, Kuros assumes several disguises of wizard, knight, and thief, in order to travel through town undetected and build strength and skill, rescue damsels, and prepare for his battle with Malkil.|$|E

He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from The Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares the oven to roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E
