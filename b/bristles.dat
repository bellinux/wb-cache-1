5|$|Another 2016 {{study used}} laser-stimulated {{fluorescence}} imaging {{to analyze the}} internal structure of the <b>bristles.</b> The highly cornified <b>bristles</b> are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual <b>bristles,</b> with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the <b>bristles</b> as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar <b>bristles</b> are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a skin flap.|$|E
5|$|Crystal fibres, formed of {{hexagonal}} {{arrays of}} hollow nanofibres, create the bright iridescent colours of the <b>bristles</b> of Aphrodita, the sea mouse, a non-wormlike genus of marine annelids. The colours are aposematic, warning predators not to attack. The chitin {{walls of the}} hollow <b>bristles</b> form a hexagonal honeycomb-shaped photonic crystal; the hexagonal holes are 0.51 μm apart. The structure behaves optically as if it consisted of a stack of 88 diffraction gratings, making Aphrodita {{one of the most}} iridescent of marine organisms.|$|E

40|$|While {{previous}} {{studies have shown that}} microtubules (MTs) are essential for maintaining the highly biased axial growth of the Drosophila <b>bristle,</b> the mechanism for this process has remained vague. We report that the MT minus-end marker, Nod-KHC, accumulates at the <b>bristle</b> tip, suggesting that the MT network in the <b>bristle</b> is organized minus end out. Potential markers for studying the importance of properly polarized MTs to <b>bristle</b> axial growth are Ik 2 and Spindle-F (Spn-F), since mutations in spn-F and ik 2 affect <b>bristle</b> development. We demonstrate that Spn-F and Ik 2 are localized to the <b>bristle</b> tip and that mutations in ik 2 and spn-F affect <b>bristle</b> MT and actin organization. Specifically, mutation in ik 2 affects polarized <b>bristle</b> MT function. It was previously found that the hook mutant exhibited defects in <b>bristle</b> polarity and that hook is involved in endocytic trafficking. We found that Hook is localized at the <b>bristle</b> tip and that this localization is affected in ik 2 mutants, suggesting that the contribution of MTs within the <b>bristle</b> shaft is important for correct endocytic trafficking. Thus, our results show that MTs are organized in a polarized manner within the highly elongated <b>bristle</b> and that this organization is essential for biased <b>bristle</b> axial growth...|$|R

5|$|Some spiders have a cribellum, a {{modified}} spinneret {{with up to}} 40,000 spigots, each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of <b>bristles</b> on the jointed tip of the cribellum, and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in snagging the <b>bristles</b> of insects. The earliest spiders had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of spiders have lost the cribellum.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the genetic architecture {{of variation in}} male sex comb <b>bristle</b> number, a rapidly evolving secondary sexual character of Drosophila. Twenty-four generations of divergent artificial selection for sex comb <b>bristle</b> number in a heterogeneous population of Drosophila melanogaster resulted in a significant response that was more pronounced {{in the direction of}} low <b>bristle</b> numbers. We observed a strong positive correlated response to selection in the corresponding female transverse <b>bristle</b> row. The correlated response in male abdominal and sternopleural <b>bristle</b> numbers, on the other hand, did not follow the same pattern as sex comb <b>bristle</b> number differences between selection lines. Relaxation-of-selection experiments along with mate choice and fecundity assays using the selection lines developed demonstrated the action of stabilizing selection on sex comb <b>bristle</b> number. Our results show (1) substantial genetic variation underlying sex comb <b>bristle</b> number variation; (2) a weak relationship between the sex comb and developmentally related, non-sex <b>bristle</b> systems; and (3) that sexual selection may be a driving force in sex comb evolution, indicating the potential of sex combs to diversify rapidly during population differentiation and speciation. We discuss the implications of these results for theories of genetic variation in display and nondisplay male sex traits...|$|R

5|$|As the Chinese Civil War was raging at {{the time}} and Communist forces were attacking river boats {{travelling}} from Chongqing, it was judged necessary to transport the pig <b>bristles</b> from the city by air. The Kuomintang government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only. After arriving in Hong Kong, the <b>bristles</b> would be shipped to Australia by sea. Both the Kuomintang government and the Communist forces were concerned about the presence of foreigners in China, and the Australian aircrew were warned that they would be imprisoned if they landed anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton.|$|E

40|$|We have mapped {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) harboring naturally occurring allelic variation for Drosophila <b>bristle</b> number. Lines with high (H) and low (L) sternopleural <b>bristle</b> number were derived by artificial selection {{from a large}} base population. Isogenic H and L sublines were extracted from the selection lines, and populations of X and third chromosome H/L recombinant isogenic lines were constructed in the homozygous low line background. The polymorphic cytological locations of roo transposable elements provided a dense molecular marker map with an average intermarker distance of 4. 5 cM. Two X chromosome and six chromosome 3 QTL affecting response to selection for sternopleural <b>bristle</b> number and three X chromosome and three chromosome 3 QTL affecting correlated response in abdominal <b>bristle</b> number were detected using a composite interval mapping method. The average effects of <b>bristle</b> number QTL were moderately large, and some had sex-specific effects. Epistasis between QTL affecting sternopleural <b>bristle</b> number was common, and interaction effects were large. Many of the intervals containing <b>bristle</b> number QTL coincided with those mapped in previous studies. However, resolution of <b>bristle</b> number QTL {{to the level of}} genetic loci is not trivial, because the genomic regions containing <b>bristle</b> number QTL often did not contain obvious candidate loci, and results of quantitative complementation tests to mutations at candidate loci affecting adult <b>bristle</b> number were ambiguous...|$|R

40|$|A {{restriction}} enzyme survey of a 110 -kb region including the achaete scute complex (ASC) examined 14 polymorphic molecular markers {{in a sample}} of 56 naturally occurring chromosomes. Large insertions as a class were associated with a reduction in both sternopleural and abdominal <b>bristle</b> number, supporting deleterious mutation-selection equilibrium models for the maintenance of quantitative genetic variation. Two polymorphic sites were independently associated with variation in <b>bristle</b> number measured in two genetic backgrounds as assessed by a permutation test. A 6 -bp deletion near sc alpha is associated with sternopleural <b>bristle</b> number variation in both sexes and a 3. 4 -kb insertion between sc beta and sc gamma is associated with abdominal <b>bristle</b> number variation in females. Under an additive genetic model, the small deletion polymorphism near sc alpha accounts for 25 % of the total X chromosome genetic variation in sternopleural <b>bristle</b> number, and the 3. 4 kb insertion accounts for 22 % of the total X chromosome variation in female abdominal <b>bristle</b> number. The observation of common polymorphisms associated with variation in <b>bristle</b> number is more parsimoniously explained by models that incorporate balancing selection or assume variants affecting <b>bristle</b> number are neutral, than mutation-selection equilibrium models...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} between sternopleural and abdominal <b>bristle</b> number and fitness in Drosophila melanogaster was determined for sublines of an initially highly inbred strain that were maintained by divergent artificial selection for 150 generations or by random mating for 180 generations. Replicate selection lines had more extreme <b>bristle</b> numbers {{than those that}} were maintained without artificial selection at the same census size for approximately {{the same number of}} generations. The average fitness, estimated by a single generation of competition against a compound autosome strain, was 0. 17 for lines selected for high and low abdominal <b>bristle</b> numbers and 0. 19 for lines selected for high and low sternopleural <b>bristle</b> number. The average fitness of unselected lines, 0. 46, was significantly higher than that of the selection lines. The fitnesses and the relationships of <b>bristle</b> number to fitness in progeny of all possible crosses of high X high (H X H), high X low (H X L) and low X low (L X L) selection lines were examined to determine whether the observed intermediate optima were caused by direct stabilizing selection on <b>bristle</b> number or by apparent stabilizing selection mediated through deleterious pleiotropic fitness effects of mutations affecting <b>bristle</b> number. Although <b>bristle</b> number was nearly additive for progeny of H X H, H X L and L X L crosses among sternopleural <b>bristle</b> selection lines, their mean fitnesses were not significantly different from each other, or from the mean fitness of the unselected lines, suggesting partly or completely recessive pleiotropic fitness effects cause apparent stabilizing selection. The average fitness of the progeny of H X H abdominal <b>bristle</b> selection lines was not significantly different from the fitness of unselected lines, but the mean fitness of the progeny of L X L crosses was not significantly {{different from that of the}} pure low lines. This is consistent with direct selection against low but not high abdominal <b>bristle</b> number, but the interpretation is confounded by variation in average degree of dominance for fitness (on average recessive in the high abdominal <b>bristle</b> selection lines and additive in the low abdominal <b>bristle</b> selection lines). Neither direct stabilizing selection nor pleiotropy, therefore, can account for all the observations...|$|R
40|$|Delta (Dl) and Hairless (H) are two {{chromosome}} 3 candidate neurogenic loci {{that might}} contribute to naturally occurring quantitative variation for sensory <b>bristle</b> number. To evaluate this hypothesis, we assessed quantitative genetic variation in abdominal and sternopleural <b>bristle</b> numbers among homozygous isogenic third chromosomes sampled from nature and substituted into the Samarkand (Sam) inbred chromosome 1 and 2 background; among homozygous lines in which the wild-derived Dl-H gene region was introgressed into the Sam chromosome 3 background; and among Dl-H region introgression lines as heterozygotes against the Sam wild-type strain and derivatives of Sam into which mutant Dl and H alleles had been introgressed. Variation among the Dl-H region introgression lines accounted for 36 % (8. 3 %) of the total chromosome 3 among line variance in abdominal (sternopleural) <b>bristle</b> number and for 53 % of the chromosome 3 sex x line variance in abdominal <b>bristle</b> number. Naturally occurring alleles in the Dl-H region failed to complement a Dl mutant allele for female abdominal <b>bristle</b> number and sternopleural <b>bristle</b> number in both sexes, and an H mutant allele for both <b>bristle</b> traits in males and females. These {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that naturally occurring alleles at Dl and H contribute to quantitative genetic variation in sensory <b>bristle</b> number...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative trait loci (QTL) {{affecting}} {{responses and}} correlated responses to selection for abdominal and sternopleural <b>bristle</b> number have been mapped with high {{resolution to the}} X and third chromosomes. Advanced intercross recombinant isogenic chromosomes were constructed from high and low selection lines in an unselected inbred background, and QTL were detected using composite interval mapping and high density transposable element marker maps. We mapped a total of 26 <b>bristle</b> number QTL with large effects, which were in or immediately adjacent to intervals previously inferred to contain <b>bristle</b> number QTL on these chromosomes. The QTL contributing to response to selection for high <b>bristle</b> number were {{not the same as}} those contributing to response to selection for low <b>bristle</b> number, suggesting that distributions of allelic effects per locus may be asymmetrical.
