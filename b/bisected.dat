40|$|Hierarchical text {{clustering}} plays {{a significant}} role in systematically browsing, summarizing and organizing documents into structure manner. However, the <b>Bisect</b> K-means which is a well-known hierarchical clustering algorithm is only able to generate local optimal solutions due to the employment of K-means as part of its process. In this study, we propose to replace the K-means with firefly algorithm, hence producing a <b>Bisect</b> FA for hierarchical clustering. At each level of the proposed <b>Bisect</b> FA, firefly algorithm works to produce the best clusters. For evaluation purposes, we performed experiments on 20 newsgroups dataset that is commonly used in text clustering studies. The results demonstrate that <b>Bisect</b> FA obtains more accurate and compact clustering than <b>Bisect</b> K-means, K-means and C-firefly algorithms. Such a result indicates that the proposed <b>Bisect</b> FA is a competitive algorithm for unsupervised learning...|$|R
5|$|The thin rhomb t {{has four}} corners with angles of 36, 144, 36, and 144 degrees. The t rhomb may be <b>bisected</b> along its short {{diagonal}} {{to form a}} pair of acute Robinson triangles.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} of PR30 {{begins at the}} entrance to the San Solomon Springs parking lot and proceeds to the east to the park campground.

5|$|Harmison prospered in Hampshire County, {{acquiring}} additional {{land and}} enlarging his Valley View estate. He later gave this acquired land {{to his children}} to establish their own homes when they married. In 1884, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad completed its South Branch, connecting the main line at Green Spring to Romney; this branch <b>bisected</b> the Valley View property. Charles Harmison lived at Valley View until his death on October31, 1896.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the Jezreel Valley railway's Afula station, itself a spur from the Hejaz railway. The {{extension}} of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12. During {{the beginning of the}} British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and Jenin. The railway was destroyed during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the route of the line <b>bisected</b> by the Green Line.|$|E
5|$|It passes {{north of}} the Meadowlands Centre mall and the {{interchanges}} with Mohawk Road / Golf Links Road. The route then becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions at Upper Horning Road, which was <b>bisected</b> by construction of the route. The route continues, passing beneath a pedestrian overpass and Upper Paradise Road before interchanging with Garth Street.|$|E
5|$|Stroma is <b>bisected</b> by a fault {{which runs}} in a north-south {{direction}} through its centre, intersected by another fault running in an east-northeast direction across {{the north of the}} island. The soil {{on either side of the}} fault line is significantly different; the eastern and southern parts of Stroma are covered by fertile clay fed by bedrock minerals, while less fertile boggy ground predominates on the west side.|$|E

5|$|The English {{county of}} Buckinghamshire is <b>bisected</b> by the Chiltern Hills, which rise sharply and cross the county from {{northeast}} to southwest. Although the fertile soil and good drainage of the Chilterns provides ideal conditions for farming, the steep hills historically made travelling difficult. Few sizeable settlements developed in Buckinghamshire, and what roads existed were of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Interstates 80, 480 and 680, {{along with the}} North Omaha Freeway, spurred development. There was also controversy, particularly in North Omaha, where several neighborhoods were <b>bisected</b> by new routes. Creighton University hosted the DePorres Club, an early civil rights group whose sit-in strategies for integration of public facilities predated the national movement, starting in 1947.|$|E
5|$|After initial resistance, Gibbs also {{successfully}} pushed {{legislation in}} 2007 to increase penalties for truck drivers {{who fail to}} comply with Colorado's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter, a move designed to improve accessibility and safety on I-70, which <b>bisected</b> Gibbs' house district. In later years, Gibbs and state officials attributed decreases in accidents and tickets issued for violating the chain law {{to the passage of}} the bill. Gibbs was named to the interim Transportation Legislation Review Committee {{at the end of the}} 2007 regular session.|$|E
50|$|The A315 is the {{historic}} WSW road out of London on which Hounslow's High Street is placed. To the east, it <b>bisects</b> Isleworth, Brentford and Chiswick. To the west it <b>bisects</b> North Feltham and Bedfont {{before joining the}} A30.|$|R
5000|$|A {{parallelogram}} is a quadrilateral with {{opposite sides}} parallel. One of its characterizations {{is that the}} diagonals <b>bisect</b> each other. This means that the diagonals in all parallelograms <b>bisect</b> each other, and conversely, that any quadrilateral where the diagonals <b>bisect</b> each other must be a parallelogram. The latter statement is only true if inclusive definitions of quadrilaterals are used (so that, for example, rectangles count as parallelograms), which is the dominant way of defining objects in mathematics nowadays.|$|R

5|$|Haifa has {{developed}} in tiers, {{from the lower}} to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been <b>bisected</b> by a major road and razed in part {{to make way for}} government buildings. Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.|$|E

5|$|On a {{strategic}} scale, a natural choke point was present between the northern shore of Lake Peipus and the Gulf of Finland. The 45 kilometre wide {{strip of land}} was entirely <b>bisected</b> by the Narva River and had large areas of wilderness. The primary transportation routes, the Narva–Tallinn highway and railway, ran on an east-west axis near and parallel to the coastline. There were no other east-west transportation routes capable of sustaining troop movement {{on a large scale}} in the region.|$|E
5|$|Route 413 {{begins at}} the state line, midway along the BurlingtonBristol Bridge, as a {{continuation}} of PA413. As the road descends from the bridge, a toll booth spans {{the width of the}} road though a toll is only collected for westbound traffic. The highway heads southward, heading along Keim Boulevard, and becomes maintained by Burlington County. For eastbound traffic, a right-in/right-out intersection with Veterans Drive is present while for westbound traffic, an exit for Reed Street is located before the toll booths. South of here, an oblong traffic circle, <b>bisected</b> by the River Line railroad, is found and has intersections with West Broad Street.|$|E
5|$|The Angel, Islington is a {{historic}} landmark {{and a series of}} buildings that have stood on the corner of Islington High Street and Pentonville Road in Islington, London, England. The land originally belonged to the Clerkenwell Priory and has had various properties built on it since the 16th century. The site was <b>bisected</b> by the New Road, which opened in 1756, and properties on the site have been rebuilt several times up to the 20th century. The corner site gave its name to Angel tube station, opened in 1901, and the surrounding Angel area of London.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{computational}} complexity {{of finding a}} line that <b>bisects</b> simultaneously two sets in the two-dimensional plane, called the pancake problem, using the oracle Turing machine model of Ko. We also study the basic problem of <b>bisecting</b> a set at a given direction. Our main results are: (1) the complexity of <b>bisecting</b> a nice (thick) polynomial-time approximable set at a given direction can be characterized by the counting class #P; (2) the complexity of <b>bisecting</b> simultaneously two linearly separable nice (thick) polynomial-time approximable sets can be characterized by the counting class #P; and (3) for either of these two problems, without the thickness condition and the linear separability condition (for the two-set case), it is arbitrarily hard to compute the bisector (even if it is unique) ...|$|R
