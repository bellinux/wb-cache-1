40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} novel {{methods for}} estimating the poses of a <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> from its reflections for specular surface recovery. Traditional methods for specular surface recovery usually introduce a second camera and an auxiliary calibration pattern to calibrate the poses of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> {{with respect to}} the camera. The calibration procedures are comparatively tedious. Auto-estimating the poses of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> is therefore an appealing problem. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, two novel and practical methods are proposed to recover the poses of a moving <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> from its reflections produced on the specular surface given its initial position. As for the first approach, the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> is constrained to undergo an unknown pure translation. By observing the reflections of the moving <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> produced on the specular surface, a closed form solution is derived for recovering the unknown translation. Degenerate cases in which the proposed method fails are studied. As for the second approach, the constraint on the motion of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> is removed, and the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> can move freely. Again, a closed form solution is derived for the unknown motion defined by a rotation matrix and a translation vector, and the degenerate cases are also presented. The thesis finally considers the problem for auto-calibrating the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> against the camera for specular surface recovery without prior knowledge of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane’s</b> initial position. By only observing its reflections produced on the specular surface, the poses of the <b>reference</b> <b>planes</b> can be recovered in two steps. First, by applying a collinearity constraint to the specular correspondences, a simple closed form solution is derived for recovering the poses of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> relative to its initial pose. Second, by applying a ray incidence constraint to the incident rays formed by the specular correspondences and the visual rays cast from the image, a closed form solution is derived for recovering the poses of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> relative to the camera. The shape of the specular surface then follows. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new linear method for reconstructing simultaneously 3 D features (points, lines and planes) and cameras from many perspective views by solving a single linear system. It assumes {{that a real}} or virtual <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> is visible in all views. We call it the Direct <b>Reference</b> <b>Plane</b> (DRP) method. It {{is well known that}} the projection relationship between uncalibrated cameras and 3 D features is non-linear {{in the absence of a}} <b>reference</b> <b>plane.</b> With a known <b>reference</b> <b>plane,</b> points and cameras have a linear relationship, as shown in [16]. The main contribution of this paper is that lines and cameras, as well as, planes and cameras also have a linear relationship. Consequently, all 3 D features and all cameras can be reconstructed simultaneously from a single linear system, which handles missing image measurements naturally. A further contribution is an extensive experimental comparison, using real data, of different <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> and non-reference plane reconstruction methods. For difficult <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> scenarios, with point or line features, the DRP method is superior to all compared methods. Finally, an extensive list of <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> scenarios is presented, which shows the wide applicability of the DRP method. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating the poses of a <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> in specular shape recovery. Unlike existing methods which require an extra mirror or an extra <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> and camera, our proposed method recovers the poses of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> directly from its reflections on the specular surface. By establishing reflection correspondences on the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> in three distinct poses, our method estimates the poses of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> in two steps. First, by applying a colinearity constraint to the reflection correspondences, a simple closed-form solution is derived for recovering the poses of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> relative to its initial pose. Second, by applying a ray incidence constraint to the incident rays formed by the reflection correspondences and the visual rays cast from the image, a closed-form solution is derived for recovering the poses of the <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> relative to the camera. The shape of the specular surface then follows. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed method. © 2011 IEEE. published_or_final_versionThe 2011 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), Barcelona, Spain, 6 - 13 November 2011.

Incomplete knowledge of the true <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> position may result in significant measurement errors, if calibration {{and use of the}} spectroradiometer take place at different distances from the source. We describe a method for determining the effective measurement plane of spectroradiometer diffusers, based on distance dependence of the measured signal. The angular responsivity of the diffuser needs {{to be taken into account}} in the data analysis, especially if there are large deviations from the ideal cosinusoidal responsivity.

40|$|Reconstructing a 3 -dimensional {{scene from}} a set of 2 -dimensional images is a {{fundamental}} problem in computervision. A system capable of performing this task can be used inmany applications in robotics, architecture, archaeology,biometrics, human computer interaction and the movie andentertainment industry. Most existing reconstruction approaches exploit one sourceof information to tackle the problem. This is the motion of thecamera, the 2 D images are taken from different viewpoints. Weexploit an additional information source, the reference plane,which {{makes it possible to}} reconstruct difficult scenes whereother methods fail. A real scene plane may serve as thereference plane. Furthermore, there are many alternativetechniques to obtain virtual <b>reference</b> <b>planes.</b> For instance,orthogonal directions in the scene provide a virtual referenceplane, the plane at infinity, or images taken with a parallelprojection camera. A collection of known and novel referenceplane scenarios is presented in this thesis. The main contribution of the thesis is a novel multi-viewreconstruction approach using a <b>reference</b> <b>plane.</b> The techniqueis applicable to three different feature types, points, linesand planes. The novelty of our approach is that all cameras andall features (off the <b>reference</b> <b>plane)</b> are reconstructedsimultaneously from a single linear system of imagemeasurements. It is based on the novel observation that camerasand features have a linear relationship if a <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> isknown. In the absence of a <b>reference</b> <b>plane,</b> this relationshipis non-linear. Thus many previousmethods must reconstructfeatures and cameras sequentially. Another class of methods,popular in the literature, is factorization, but, in contrastto our approach, this has the serious practical drawback thatall features are required to be visible in all views. Extensiveexperiments show that our approach is superior to allpreviously suggested <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> and non-reference planemethods for difficult <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> scenarios. Furthermore, the thesis studies scenes which do not have aunique reconstruction, so-called critical configurations. It isproven that {{in the presence of a}} <b>reference</b> <b>plane</b> the set ofcritical configurations is small. Finally, the thesis introduces a complete, automaticmulti-view reconstruction system based on the reference planeapproach. The input data is a set of images and the output a 3 Dpoint reconstruction together with the correspondingcameras. NR 2014080...|$|R
