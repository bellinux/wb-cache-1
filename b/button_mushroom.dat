5|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of fresh fruit bodies collected in Mexico {{showed them to}} have the following composition: moisture 94.53%; ash 0.323%; dietary fiber 3.024%; fat 0.368%; and protein 1.581%. The free fatty acid content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common <b>button</b> <b>mushroom</b> (Agaricus bisporus), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was oleic acid (1.95%), followed by linoleic acid (1.68%) and palmitic acid (1.69%).|$|E
5|$|A {{chemical}} analysis of Mexican specimens has shown L.indigo to contain moisture at 951mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3mg/g, protein at 13.4mg/g, and dietary fiber at 18.7mg/g, much higher {{in comparison to}} the common <b>button</b> <b>mushroom,</b> which contains 6.6mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also tested in the study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L.indigo contained the highest saturated fatty acids content, including stearic acid with 32.1mg/g—slightly over half of the total free fatty acid content.|$|E

40|$|Browning {{is one of}} {{the most}} common postharvest changes in <b>button</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> which often results in {{economic}} losses. Phenolic compounds, which are associated with browning, were extracted from the nonbruised and bruised skin tissue of various <b>button</b> <b>mushrooms</b> with a sulfite-containing solution and analyzed with UHPLC-PDA-MS. In total, 34 phenolic compounds were detected. Only small differences in the total phenolic content between bruising-tolerant and -sensitive strains were observed. The contents of ¿-l-glutaminyl- 4 -hydroxybenzene (GHB) and ¿-l-glutaminyl- 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzene (GDHB) correlated with bruising sensitivity; for example, R 2 values of 0. 85 and 0. 98 were found for nonbruised brown strains, respectively. In nonbruised skin tissue of the strains with brown caps, the GHB and GDHB contents in sensitive strains were on average 20 and 15 times higher, respectively, than in tolerant strains. GHB and GDHB likely participate in the formation of brown GHB–melanin, which seemed to be the predominant pathway in bruising-related discoloration of <b>button</b> <b>mushrooms...</b>|$|R

40|$|White <b>button</b> <b>mushrooms</b> are {{fragile and}} discolor soon after {{mechanical}} bruising. This hampers {{the development of}} mechanical harvesting for <b>button</b> <b>mushrooms</b> and causes loss of postharvest quality. The extent of discoloration can be affected by environmental conditions. A factorial design analysis was conducted to screen the effect of factors influencing the bruising sensitivity of <b>button</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> {{and to find out}} a combination of environmental factors generating the largest variation among bruising sensitive and bruising resistant strains. In this way a maximal variation of the trait ‘bruising sensitivity’ can be induced in segregating populations intended to map this trait. Three environmental factors were investigated on four genotypes (strains), i. e., thickness of the casing layer (2. 5 cm and 5 cm), wetness of casing (dry and normal), and relative humidity in the growing room (80 % and 87 %). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that genotype (strain) was a significant factor influencing bruising sensitivity as well as casing thickness. Significant factor interaction effects were observed. The factor combination generating the largest difference in bruising sensitivity between the four strains was identified, i. e., a thickness of the casing layer of 5 cm, normal humidity of the casing, and 87 % for relative humidity in the growing room. <br/...|$|R

25|$|The US has an elaborate, {{interdepartmental}} {{regulatory system}} to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops. For example, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 gives the USDA {{the authority to}} oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment and economy of the US. The act regulates any genetically modified organism that utilizes the genome of a predefined 'plant pest' or any plant not previously categorized. In 2015, Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the white <b>button</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Since he had not added any foreign DNA to his organism, the mushroom could not be regulated under by the USDA under Section 340.2. Yang's white <b>button</b> <b>mushroom</b> was the first organism genetically modified with the Crispr/cas9 protein system to pass US regulation. In 2016, the USDA sponsored a committee to consider future regulatory policy for upcoming genetic modification techniques. With {{the help of the}} US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next 5 years and potential policy regulations that would need to come into play. With the emergence of rogue genetic engineers employing the technology, the FDA has begun issuing new regulations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} for the name [...] "mushroom" [...] is the cultivated white <b>button</b> <b>mushroom,</b> Agaricus bisporus; hence the word [...] "mushroom" [...] is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) {{on the underside of}} the cap. [...] "Mushroom" [...] also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.|$|E
