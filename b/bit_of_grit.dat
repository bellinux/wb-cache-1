5000|$|Since {{the start}} of his career, O'Connell has mainly played young delinquents; The New York Times writer John Freeman noted retrospectively, [...] "If a British film called for a tough case, a grappler, someone with a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>grit,</b> chances were O'Connell got the part. He has {{delivered}} one gripping physical performance after another, bringing an electric authenticity to the portrayal of angry, troubled youth." [...] O'Connell made his professional acting debut in 2005 when he played a runaway with anger issues in an episode of Doctors, followed by a recurring role as a boy accused of rape in The Bill. His stage debut came that same year after a rendition of the play The Spider Men by the Television Workshop was selected to be performed at the Royal National Theatre in London. O'Connell played his debut film role in [...] "This Is England" [...] (2006), a critically acclaimed coming-of-age drama set in the skinhead subculture of the early 1980s. At age 15, he was deemed too old to play the main character, leading filmmaker Shane Meadows to write the supporting role of the belligerent Pukey specifically for him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} was undertaken to elucidate the mechanisms for the fracture failure of brazed diamonds in wire sawing. Diamonds were brazed by high-frequency induction in vacuum. The changes of compressive {{strength and the}} appearances of the diamonds at different brazing temperatures were obtained. The morphologies of the diamonds after sawing were also observed. Together with the stress analysis <b>of</b> a brazed <b>grit,</b> {{it is found that}} the fracture failure <b>of</b> brazed <b>grit</b> {{is the result of the}} brittle fracture happening on the root section <b>of</b> the <b>grit,</b> the interface between the grit and the brazing alloy. The degradation of mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>grits</b> in brazing is a key factor to the reduction of their resistance to fracture. Lower machining forces as well as grit exposure are in favor <b>of</b> preventing <b>grits</b> from fracture...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, wheat {{has spread}} {{all over the world}} due to its {{extensive}} usability. The colour <b>of</b> wheat <b>grits</b> is very important for the milling and baking industry because it determines the colour of the products made from it. The instrumental colour measuring is used, first of all, for durum wheat. We investigated the relationship between colour characteristics and grain size in the case of different hard aestivum wheats. We determined the colour using the CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) 1976 L*, a*, b* colour system measured by MINOLTA CR- 300 tristimulus colorimeter. After screening the colour of the wheat fractions of different grain size, grits was measured wet and dry. We determined the L*, a*, b* colour co-ordinates and the whiteness index, too. To evaluate the values we had obtained, we used analysis of variance and regression analysis. We pointed out that the colour <b>of</b> wheat <b>grits</b> <b>of</b> different grain size is dependent on the hardness index of wheat. The lightness co-ordinate (L*) <b>of</b> <b>grits</b> <b>of</b> the harder wheat is smaller, while a* and b* co-ordinates are higher. We also found that while grain size rises, the L* co-ordinate decreases and a*, b* values increase in the case of every type of wheat. The colour <b>of</b> <b>grits</b> is determined by the colour of fractions of 250 - 400 μm in size, independently from the average grain size. The whiteness index and the L* colour co-ordinate have a linear relation (R 2 = 0. 9151); so, the determination of whiteness index is not necessary. The L* value right characterizes the whiteness <b>of</b> <b>grits...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The effect <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> {{particle}} size on frictional characteristics was investigated using a vertically oriented brake test rig. Silica sand <b>of</b> <b>grit</b> sizes 50 - 180 µm, 180 - 355 µm and 355 - 500 µm {{were used in}} drag mode application. Results showed {{that the presence of}} hard particles from environment can influence the friction response significantly. Basically, once the hard particles enter the gap, the value and amplitude of friction coefficient tend to decrease. However, slight increase in friction with smaller particles was recorded due to more hard particles involved in mixing and changing the effective contact area. Better friction stability was related to the presence <b>of</b> smaller <b>grit</b> particles and compacted wear debris to form frictional film on the braking interface...|$|R
