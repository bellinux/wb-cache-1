40|$|International audienceThe {{modern society}} is always {{producing}} {{more and more}} wastes. Some of them, mainly organic ones, can be valued to be in accordance with sustainable practices. Among organic wastes, agricultural, municipal and industrial organic materials (AMIOM) are intended {{to be used in}} agriculture. According to the numerous origins of these materials, the input of undesirable pollutants can't be avoided. Therefore it has been found necessary to assess their potential deleterious effects on the environment prior to their use. For that purpose, ecotoxicological characterization of different AMIOM was set up using routine terrestrial and aquatic <b>bio-assays.</b> In addition, two new model organisms (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the predaceous mite Hypoaspis aculeifer) were included in the test batteries in order to conclude on their relevance in comparison with routine tests.

50|$|In 1990, {{assistant}} {{plant operator}} Daniel George Maston was charged {{after he took}} a sample of heavy water, contaminated with tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, from the moderator system and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. One individual who was engaged in heat stress work, requiring alternating work, rest, and re-hydration periods consumed significantly more than the others. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving <b>bio-assay</b> urine samples with elevated tritium levels, one with particularly unusually high levels. The quantities involved were well below levels which could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from the tritium and activated chemicals in the water.

40|$|How whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) {{make the}} choice for a host plant prior to landing, is not {{precisely}} known. Here we investigated whether they respond to specific volatiles of tomato. Zingiberene and curcumene were purified from Solanum habrochaites (PI 127826), characterised by NMR and X-ray analysis and identified as 7 -epizingiberene and R-curcumene. In contrast, oil from Zingiber officinalis contained the stereoisomers zingiberene and S-curcumene, respectively. Using a combination of free-choice <b>bio-assays</b> and electroantennography, 7 -epizingiberene and its dehydrogenated derivative R-curcumene were shown to be active as semiochemicals to B. tabaci adults, whereas the stereoisomers from ginger were not. In addition, R-curcumene elicited the strongest electroantennographic response. <b>Bio-assays</b> showed that a cultivated tomato could be made less attractive to B. tabaci than its neighbouring siblings {{by the addition of}} the tomato stereoisomer 7 -epizingiberene or its derivative R-curcumene. These sesquiterpenes apparently repel adult whiteflies prior to landing, presumably because it informs them that after landing they, or their offspring, may be exposed to higher and lethal concentrations of the same compounds...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the origins of}} the logistic function and its history up to its adoption in <b>bio-assay</b> and the beginning of its wider acceptance in statistics, ca. 1950.

Its adoption in an altogether different role in <b>bio-assay</b> has been determined decisively by the individual actions and personal histories of a few scholars: the widespread acceptance of the growth function is due to Pearl and Reed, the general recognition of Verhulst¿s primacy to Yule, and the introduction of the function in <b>bio-assay</b> to Berkson...|$|E

40|$|The distribution, {{molecular}} {{form and}} release of cholecystokinin (CCK) -like activity in extracts of rat small intestine was studied with an in vitro gall-bladder <b>bio-assay.</b> In {{contrast to the}} reported heterogeneity of CCK-like immunoreactivity in the intestine, only a single molecular form of CCK-like activity was detected using the <b>bio-assay.</b> 2. The CCK-like activity eluted from Sephadex G 50 with a Kav of 0. 69, after the triacontriapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK 33) and before cholecystokinin octapeptide 2500, may represent the 22 amino acid peptide of CCK (CCK 22).

40|$|Whereas {{laboratory}} {{investigations have}} elucidated {{the mechanism of}} sorption of residual insecticides and demonstrated that their persistency is determined {{by a number of}} physico-chemical factors and is therefore theoretically calculable, the variables encountered in the field may produce results in apparent conflict with those theoretically expected.

40|$|This review {{considers}} {{the problem of}} the serious concomitant side effects of powerful anti-inflammatory drugs modelled upon the principal human glucocorticoid hormone, cortisol. The very nature of the original <b>bio-assays</b> to validate their cortisol-like hormonal and anti-inflammatory activities ensured that pleiotropic toxins were selected for clinical studies. Other complicating factors have been (1) considerable reliance on <b>bio-assays</b> conducted in laboratory animals that primarily secrete corticosterone, not cortisol, as their principal anti-inflammatory adrenal hormone; (2) some differences in the binding of xenobiotic cortisol analogues (vis á vis cortisol) to transport proteins, detoxifying enzymes and even some intra-cellular receptors; (3) the "rogue" properties of these hormonal xenobiotics, acting independently of-but still able to suppress-hormonal mechanisms regulating endogenous cortisol; and (4) problems of intrinsic/acquired "steroid resistance", diminishing their clinical efficacy, but not necessarily all their toxicities. The rather gloomy conclusion is that devising new drugs to reproduce the effect of multi-potent hormones may be a recipe for disaster, in contexts other than simply remedying an endocrine deficiency. Promising new developments include "designed" combination therapies that allow some reduction in total steroid doses (and hopefully their side effects); sharpening strategies to limit the actual duration of steroid administration; and resurgent interest in searching for more selective analogues (both steroidal and non-steroid) with less harmful side effects. Some oversights and neglected areas of research are also considered. Overall, it now seems timely to engage in some drastic rethinking about (retaining?) these "licensed toxins" as fundamental therapies for chronic inflammation...|$|R
