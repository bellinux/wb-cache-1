This came after federal judge Frederic Block of the District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled that the artists could have a jury trial, as opposed to a bench trial where only judges would hear the artists' and Wolkoff's arguments. The trial, which began in mid-October 2017, was seen as an important case since it would decide whether graffiti could be categorized as art that could be federally protected.

40|$|A major hurdle {{of recent}} x 86 superscalar {{processor}} designs is limited instruction issue rate {{due to the}} overly complex x 86 instruction formats. To alleviate this problem, the machine states must be preserved and the instruction address routing paths must be simplified. We propose an instruction address queue, whose queue size has been estimated to handle saving of instruction addresses with three operations: allocation, access, and retirement. The instruction address queue will supply the stored instruction addresses as data for three mechanisms: changing instruction flow, updating BTB, and handling exceptions. It {{can also be used}} for internal snooping to solve self-modified code problems. Two CISC hazards in the x 86 architectures, the variable instruction length and the complex addressing mode, have been considered in this design. Instead of the simple full associative storing method in lower degree (< 4) superscalar systems, the line-offset method is used in this address queue. This will reduce by 1 / 3 the storage space for a degree- 5 superscalar x 86 processor with even smaller access latency. We use synthesis tools to analyze the design, and show that it produces optimized results. Because the address queue design can keep two different line addresses in an instruction access per cycle, this method can be extended for designing a multiple instruction <b>block</b> <b>issue</b> system, such as the trace processor...|$|E

40|$|The {{airspace}} operations demonstration (AOD) {{is intended}} {{to show that the}} Access 5 Step 1 functional requirements can be met. The demonstration will occur in two phases. The initial on-range phase will be carried out in restricted airspace to demonstrate the cooperative collision avoidance (CCA) functional requirements and to provide risk-reduction for the AOD by allowing the test team to rehearse some elements of the demonstration mission. The CCA system to be used in these flights is based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) which is a commercially-available system by which airplanes constantly broadcast their current position and altitude to other aircraft and ground resources over a dedicated radio datalink. The final phase will occur in the national airspace (NAS) and will be the formal demonstration of the remainder of the proposed functional requirements. The general objectives of the AOD are as follows: (1) Demonstrate that the UAS can aviate in the NAS (2) Demonstrate that the UAS can navigate in the NAS (3) Demonstrate that the UAS can communicate with the NAS (4) Demonstrate that the UAS can perform selected collision avoidance functions in the NAS (5) Demonstrate that the UAS can evaluate and avoid weather conflicts in the NAS (6) Demonstrate that the UAS can provide adequate command and control in the NAS In addition to the stated objectives, {{there are a number of}} goals for the flight demonstration. The demo can be accomplished successfully without achieving these goals, but these goals are to be used as a guideline for preparing for the mission. The goals are: (1) Mission duration of at least 24 hours (2) Loiter over heavy traffic to evaluate the data <b>block</b> <b>issue</b> identified during the Access 5 Airspace Operations Simulations (3) Document the contingency management process and lessons learned (4) Document the coordination process for Ground Control Stations (GCS) handoff (5) Document lessons learned regarding the process of flying in the NAS Preliminary planning for a notional mission to achieve the objectives and goals has been prepared.

40|$|Record linkage is {{the process}} of {{matching}} records across data sets that refer to the same entity. One issue within record linkage is determining which record pairs to consider, since a detailed comparison between all of the records is impractical. <b>Blocking</b> addresses this <b>issue</b> by generating candidate matches as a preprocessing step for record linkage. For example, in a person matching problem, blocking might return all people with the same last name as candidate matches. Two main problems in blocking are the selection of attributes for generating the candidate matches and deciding which methods to use to compare the selected attributes. These attribute and method choices constitute a blocking scheme. Previous approaches to record linkage address the <b>blocking</b> <b>issue</b> in a largely ad-hoc fashion.
