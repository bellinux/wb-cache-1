5|$|Oslac (fl. 966–975) is {{regarded}} as the first ealdorman (or earl) of York and its dependent territories. These included but may not have <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the southern half of Northumbria. His background is obscure because of poor source documentation. The latter has facilitated disagreement amongst historians regarding his family and ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 110 papal {{elections}} that have produced popes currently {{recognized by the}} Catholic Church as legitimate. There was no fixed process for papal succession before 1059 and popes were often selected with substantial secular involvement, if not outright appointment. Since the promulgation of In nomine Domini (1059), however, suffrage has <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the College of Cardinals.|$|E

There is also a plan to rebuild Camp Todee in Todee District, upper Montserrado. The Barclay Training Center (BTC) was handed back to the Government of Liberia on July 31, 2009 at a ceremony attended by the Minister for National Defense and the United States Ambassador {{after four years of}} management by DynCorp.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and {{environmentally}} friendly, but has historically <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded {{the range and}} size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{began the}} {{physical}} {{exploration of space}} during the 20th century {{with the advent of}} high-altitude balloon flights, followed by manned rocket launches. Earth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned spaceflight has <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> low Earth orbit and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, President Clinton {{signed into}} effect the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which {{included}} the largest {{capital gains tax cut}} in U.S. history. Under the act, the profits on the sale of a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5. (This had previously <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over the age of 55.) There were also reductions {{in a number of other}} taxes on investment gains.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{project of the}} Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have {{facilitated}} the speedy deployment of troops—for example, {{the remnants of a}} Mycenaean road, along with what {{appears to have been a}} Mycenaean defensive wall on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the Argive plain.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism {{as early}} as 14.5million years ago {{has been linked to}} the Anahim hotspot, with the latest {{eruption}} having taken place in the last 8,000years.

5|$|XF-104 53-7786 {{was lost}} in a crash on 11July1957 when it {{developed}} an uncontrollable fin flutter while flying chase for F-104A flight tests. The entire tail group was ripped from the airframe, and Lockheed test pilot Bill Park was forced to eject. Fin flutter was a known problem and the aircraft had <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> speeds {{of no more than}} Mach0.95 {{at the time of the}} accident. Tony LeVier had attempted to have the aircraft removed from flight status and placed in a museum, arguing that its performance was not suitable for chase duties.|$|E
5|$|A second war in Bernicia, {{probably}} in 1018, was more successful. The Battle of Carham, by the River Tweed, {{was a victory}} for the Scots led by Malcolm II and the men of Strathclyde led by their king, Owen the Bald. By this time Earl Uchtred may have been dead, and Eiríkr Hákonarson was appointed Earl of Northumbria by his brother-in-law Cnut the Great, although his authority seems to have <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the south, the former kingdom of Deira, and he took no action against the Scots so far as is known. The work De obsessione Dunelmi (The siege of Durham, associated with Symeon of Durham) claims that Uchtred's brother Eadwulf Cudel surrendered Lothian to Malcolm II, presumably {{in the aftermath of the}} defeat at Carham. This is likely to have been the lands between Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian had been under Scots control before this time. It has been suggested that Cnut received tribute from the Scots for Lothian, but as he had likely received none from the Bernician Earls this is not very probable.|$|E
5|$|By early 1934, {{the focus}} {{shifted away from}} funding work {{creation}} schemes and toward rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended {{to speed up the}} rearmament programme. In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.|$|E

5|$|During a {{televised}} {{address to the}} nation on 7 September 2004, Lukashenko announced plans for a referendum to eliminate presidential term limits. This was held on 17 October 2004, the same day as parliamentary elections, and, according to official results, was approved by 79.42% of voters. Previously, Lukashenko had <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> two terms and thus would have been constitutionally required to step down after the presidential elections in 2006. Opposition groups, the OSCE, the European Union, and the US State Department stated that the vote fell short of international standards. An example of the failure, cited by the OSCE, was the pre-marking of ballots. Belarus grew economically under Lukashenko, but much of this growth was due to Russian crude oil which was imported at below-market prices, refined, and sold to other European countries at a profit.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, she and two Orjen-class motor torpedo boats evaded capture by Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor, arriving at Suda Bay, Crete, on 23 April, after eight days at sea. Despite this, the Italians {{claimed that they}} had sunk all the Yugoslav vessels. Nebojša then sailed to Alexandria, but the Royal Navy considered her unfit for combat duties. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested her crew might be retrained and used to operate the recently captured German Type VIIC U-boat U-570, but this idea was soon abandoned. She was based at Valletta in Malta as an anti-submarine warfare training vessel, serving with the British 2nd Submarine Flotilla in 1942 and the British 3rd Submarine Flotilla in 1943. She continued working in the Mediterranean {{until the end of}} the war, but her service with the Royal Navy appears to have <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a training role.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{hailed as}} one of the {{greatest}} upsets in college football history, the game served as the lead story of SportsCenter and was the cover story for the following week's edition of Sports Illustrated. Appalachian State became the second FCS team to defeat a ranked FBS team, and as a result of the game Michigan dropped out of the top 25 of the AP Poll entirely, marking the first time a team had fallen from the top five to out of the poll entirely as the result of a single game. In the aftermath of the game, the Associated Press amended their polling policy to make FCS teams eligible for the AP Poll, which had previously <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> FBS teams.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} the hadith's {{prohibition}} against creating images of sentient living beings, which is particularly strictly observed with respect to God and Muhammad, Islamic religious art {{is focused on the}} word. Muslims generally avoid depictions of Muhammad, and mosques are decorated with calligraphy and Quranic inscriptions or geometrical designs, not images or sculptures. Today, the interdiction against images of Muhammad– designed to prevent worship of Muhammad, rather than God– is much more strictly observed in Sunni Islam (85%–90% of Muslims) and Ahmadiyya Islam (1%) than among Shias (10%–15%). While both Sunnis and Shias have created images of Muhammad in the past, Islamic depictions of Muhammad are rare. They have, until recently, mostly <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the private and elite medium of the miniature, and since about 1500 most depictions show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from summer grazing. The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E
