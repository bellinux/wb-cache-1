5|$|The A4 {{motorway}} is {{a significant}} northsouth motorway in the northern Croatia connecting the nation's capital, Zagreb, to the Hungarian M7 motorway at the Goričan border crossing The southern terminus of the A4 motorway at the interchange in Ivanja Reka represents its junction {{with the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network via the A3 motorway. As a part of the road network of Croatia, the motorway is a part of European route E65 and European route E71. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of the development of its economy, notably tourism, as it represents the shortest and the most comfortable route between Budapest, Hungary and the Adriatic Sea. This particularly applies to tourist resorts on the Istria and Kvarner Gulf islands and to the Port of Rijeka, but it is also true for resorts in the Dalmatia region, served via the A1 motorway. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of the proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node. This expansion is planned to encompass the growth of the Port of Rijeka's cargo handling capacity, improved railroad links and a new Rijeka <b>bypass</b> <b>motorway</b> linking the A6, via a new interchange, to the present routes of the A7 and A8 motorways. The project is, among other goals, aimed to increase traffic along the Croatian part of Pan-European corridor Vb, of which the A4 motorway is a part.|$|E
25|$|Stockholm {{is at the}} {{junction}} of the European routes E4, E18 and E20. A half-completed motorway ring road exists on the south, west and north sides of the City Centre. The northern section of the ring road opened for traffic in 2015 while the final subsea eastern section is being discussed as a future project. A <b>bypass</b> <b>motorway</b> for traffic between Northern and Southern Sweden will be built west of Stockholm 2013–2023. The many islands and waterways make extensions of the road system both complicated and expensive, and new motorways are often built as systems of tunnels and bridges.|$|E
500|$|The A6 {{motorway}} is {{a significant}} northsouth motorway in Croatia connecting the largest seaport of the country, Rijeka, to its hinterland and {{to the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network via the A1 motorway Bosiljevo2 interchange. The motorway follows a route through the Gorski Kotar region. Part of the road network of Croatia, the motorway is also part of European route E65 NagykanizsaZagrebRijekaZadarSplitDubrovnikPodgorica. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of development of the economy; it is especially important for tourism and as a transit transport route. The road serves tourist resorts in Istria and the Kvarner Gulf islands. Because of the link formed between Zagreb and Rijeka, tourism-related traffic originating from the countries neighbouring Croatia to the north flows via this road to the Adriatic coast on the south. The road also serves tourists originating in the northern inland areas of Croatia. The A6 route predominantly follows an eastwest orientation, but the motorway is locally regarded as a northsouth communication. The ultimate importance of the motorway as a transit route shall be achieved upon completion of the proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and the [...] Rijeka transport node. The expansion is planned to encompass an enhancement of the cargo handling capacity of the Port of Rijeka; improved railroad links; and a new Rijeka <b>bypass</b> <b>motorway</b> linking the A6, via a new interchange, with the present routes of the A7 and A8 motorways. One of the aims of the project is to increase traffic along the A6 route. As of the June 1997 Pan-European Transport Conference in Helsinki, the motorway is a part of the Pan-European corridor Vb.|$|E
50|$|The A8 {{motorway}} (Autostradowa Obwodnica Wrocławia, abbreviated AOW) or Wrocław <b>Motorway</b> <b>Bypass</b> or Autostrada A8 is a 26.8 km <b>motorway</b> <b>bypass</b> of {{the city}} of Wrocław, Poland. The motorway includes the 122 m high Rędziński Bridge over the Oder river.|$|R

2500|$|The ground's final regular {{capacity}} {{was around}} 30,000, but has hosted crowds {{as high as}} 42,000 in the past with temporary seating. Until 1998 {{the sides of the}} Caversham <b>bypass</b> <b>motorway</b> allowed a free view of the ground and was known as the [...] "Scotsman's Grandstand". Occasionally trains would slow to a crawl or stop on the track above the stadium to allowing passengers to watch an entire event. In 1998 a new stand and corporate boxes were built that blocked the view. Partly due to Dunedin's relatively large number of tertiary students (20,000 of the city's 120,000 population), Carisbrook has a unique atmosphere. This is enhanced by the terraces, an uncovered concrete embankment at the eastern end of the ground.|$|E
2500|$|After the Athlone <b>bypass,</b> <b>motorway</b> {{restrictions}} are re-enforced and the route continues as the M6. The route bypasses Ballinasloe over River Suck into County Galway. The N6 bypasses [...] west through Aughrim and Kilreekil. Further west at Kilmeen, the N65 commences, leaving the M6 to the south. Loughrea is bypassed {{to the north}} by a route opened in November 2005. The River Dunkellin is crossed by the M6 at Craughwell as it continues west towards Galway. Outside the city itself, Oranmore is bypassed {{to the west and}} north, where the N18 crosses the M6. This dual carriageway bypass brings the route into Galway itself, where it meets the N17 along Bóthar na dTreabh. The Headford Road, Quincentenary Bridge across the River Corrib and Quincentenary Bridge Approach Road bring the N6 through Galway itself to meet the N59 on the western side of the city.|$|E

50|$|A {{long-term}} plan {{exists to}} build a new outer bypass road around Zagreb. The outer bypass would {{be a part of the}} tolled motorway network thus permitting vehicles not to stop at two toll plazas near Zagreb as they enter and leave the present bypass, decreasing congestion on the inner <b>bypass</b> <b>motorway.</b> 2009-2012 motorway and road construction plan entails funds for development of design documents for the outer <b>bypass</b> <b>motorway</b> and specifies its route: It is to be a 106 km long motorway originating from the A2 motorway Luka interchange, connecting the A3 motorway Gradina interchange near Samobor, the A1 motorway Horvati interchange, the A11 motorway Mraclin interchange, once again the A3 motorway Ivanić Grad interchange and finally the A4 motorway Zelina interchange. A total of 14 interchanges are planned on the new bypass, including the ones connecting it to the other motorways already specified, connecting the outer bypass to all major roads intersected.|$|E

Two years later, on 29 October 2015, the last remaining section of Maritsa motorway (A4), branching off from A1 nearby Chirpan and connecting with the border of Turkey at Kapitan Andreevo checkpoint, entered in service. Sofia Northern <b>Bypass</b> <b>motorway,</b> an important thoroughfare north of Sofia, was inaugurated in 2015.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposal}} commenced in {{the vicinity}} of Dutton Park station, with two new underground stations at Woolloongabba (adjacent to the Gabba) and George Street (in the CBD) adjacent to a proposed casino redevelopment site. The balance of the proposal involved the previously proposed underground station at Roma Street and the line connecting to the Exhibition line near Bowen Hills. The Underground stations were to also be busway stations. The southern end of the busway was proposed to connect directly to the existing Eastern Busway, with the northern end then proposed to connect to the Northern Busway via a bridge over the railway and adjacent Inner City <b>Bypass</b> <b>motorway.</b>|$|E
