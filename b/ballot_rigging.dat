Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging</b> by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security.

5|$|Yet such flaws {{were not}} {{immediately}} obvious {{and by the}} second half of 1967 the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province seemed to have melted away, abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long Tan and Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted Graham to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. He reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy.

25|$|Two days later, on 27 October, the Supreme Soviet {{selected}} Akayev - who {{was effectively}} a compromise candidate - {{to serve as}} the republic's first president. In 1991, he was offered the post of vice-president of the Soviet Union by President Mikhail Gorbachev, but refused. Akayev was elected president of the renamed Republic of Kyrgyzstan in an uncontested poll on 12 October 1991.

Wendy begins investigating and discovers that the <b>ballots</b> were <b>rigged</b> in Clyde's favor: Since Clyde's father owns a shoe store, {{some of the}} girls wanted to make Clyde popular to justify dating him and getting free shoes. They hid the real list and forged a new one, meaning that the girls let Cartman and Kenny steal the list. Wendy steals the real list from them and she and Stan run off to find Kyle, who is about to set the school on fire.|$|R
50|$|After the 2002 elections, electoral {{workers in}} the Stockholm area {{expressed}} concerns about how Social Democratic campaign workers had collected large amounts of voting cards from voters and voted on their behalf. To collect large amounts of voting cards and vote {{in such a way}} is unconstitutional and therefore gained some initial media attention. The county and city of Stockholm, governed by a coalition led by the Moderate Party, became subject to change of leadership {{as a result of the}} election and the criticism was quickly silenced. The circumstances of the suspected <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging</b> was never investigated. There have been other cases that have led to evictions at 2002 elections for <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging</b> by Social democratic party members working in the election offices. Many reports of other <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging</b> have also been announced throughout the country by other parties but in lack of proof none has gone to court.|$|E

5000|$|Haynes held a Semi-Centennial Celebration for Newark on 5 January 1886, and {{its success}} led to him {{being called the}} [...] "Semi-Centennial Mayor".

2500|$|In 1977, several {{thousand}} anti-KMT demonstrators led by Hsu Hsin-liang rallied {{in the town}} of Chung-li to protest the use of paper ballots in the upcoming elections, for fear that the KMT would use the <b>ballots</b> to <b>rig</b> the election. [...] When the protesters realized that the KMT had likely carried out the fraud that they had feared, they rioted, ultimately burning down the Chung-li police station. [...] The riot – the first such large-scale protest in Taiwan since 1947 – was subsequently called the Zhongli incident. The Kuomintang believed that Lee Huan's placatory approach to the Tangwai movement had caused the incident and forced him to resign.|$|R

50|$|After the Treaty of Turin {{was signed}} in 1860 between the Sardinian king and Napoleon III, the County was again and {{definitively}} ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the Second Italian War of Independence against Austria, which saw Lombardy united with Piedmont-Sardinia. The cession was ratified by a regional referendum: over 25,000 electors {{out of a total}} of 30,700 were in favour of the attachment to France. Savoy was also transferred to the French crown by similar means. Giuseppe Garibaldi, born in Nice, opposed the cession to France, arguing that the <b>ballot</b> was <b>rigged</b> by the French. Italian irredentists considered the acquisition of Nice to be one of their main nationalist goals, along with Istria, Dalmatia, Corsica and Trentino. In 1942-1943 the city was occupied and administered by Italy.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{splitting}} of his Aston seat, Wyatt {{was unable}} to find a more promising option than the Conservative held Grantham constituency, which he nonetheless fought in 1955, being defeated by 2,375 votes. During his period out of parliament, Wyatt was a reporter for the BBC's Panorama current affairs programme, in which a November 1957 report of Wyatt's revealed <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging</b> in the then communist-influenced Electrical Trades Union (ETU).|$|E
50|$|One of the Tamil parties, the Tamil United Liberation Front, {{issued a}} {{statement}} indicating that it suspects the EPDP, a government aligned {{political and military group}} of carrying out the murder.

The EPDP has denied any involvement, saying that the TULF's statement was a baseless allegation.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{irregularities}} alleged {{was that}} almost 100 voters in Central used registered offices and hotels as their home addresses.

25|$|On 10 April 2009, Voronin {{called on}} the Constitutional Court of Moldova to {{authorise}} a recount of the votes. On 12 April 2009, it decided {{that there would be}} a recount. The recount was then set to take place on 15 April 2009. On 14 April, Serafim Urechean announced that the three main opposition parties would boycott the recount, citing fears that the government would use it to increase its majority to the 61 seats required to elect the next president. The recount is scheduled to finish by 16 April 2009 and results will be submitted by 21 April 2009 to the CEC. The result of the election was not changed through the recount, as no serious errors were determined.

Although often quoted as fact, this repeated claim is impossible. Kennedy won with 303 electoral college votes and needed only 269, meaning Nixon would have lost even had he won Illinois' 27 votes.

40|$|On 2 February, the {{regional}} authorities in Gagauzia - an autonomous {{region of the}} Republic of Moldova - carried out two simultaneous referenda. In the first, local residents were asked to declare {{their support for the}} country’s integration either with the EU or with the Moscow-led Customs Union (CU); the second referendum sought their opinion on the draft law “On the deferred status of the Autonomous Region of Gagauzia”. Under the proposed legislation, if Moldova were to lose its sovereignty (for example, through the unification of Moldova and Romania, or even as some politicians have argued, through Moldova’s further integration with the EU), the autonomous region would automatically become the independent Republic of Gagauzia. As expected, the outcome of the vote has shown overwhelming support for both the CU and for the draft law. According to the figures released by Gagauzia’s Central Electoral Commission, 98. 5 % of the voters supported Moldova’s integration with the Customs Union, while 98 % voted in favour of the ‘deferred independence’ bill. Support for closer integration with the EU was marginal, reaching just over 2 %. Despite the one-sided outcome of the referendum, there is no reliable evidence to suggest that the <b>ballot</b> was <b>rigged.</b> It {{should also be noted that}} voter turnout was very high, reaching about 70 %. Representatives of the Moldovan Central Electoral Commission, however, believe that the figure may have been artificially inflated by excluding many of the voters currently residing abroad from the count...|$|R

5000|$|Always a {{firm believer}} in the {{existence}} of the Loch Ness Monster, he co-founded the [...] "Loch Ness Phenomena Investigation Bureau" [...] with naturalist Sir Peter Scott in 1962. In the 1964 election when he lost his Brighton seat, the narrowness of the result led to speculation that his stance on this 'issue' had been used against him by his political opponents, and may have proved decisive. His own view was that his campaign was sabotaged by extreme left wing infiltrators, in revenge for the assistance he had given to the exposure of <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging</b> in the Electrical Trades Union.|$|E
25|$|The runoff count took a week, {{handled by}} the Democratic State Central Committee (because this was a party primary).

There were many allegations of voter fraud; one writer alleges that Johnson's campaign manager, future Texas governor John B. Connally, was connected with 202 ballots in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County where the names had curiously been listed in alphabetical order with the same pen and handwriting, just at the close of polling. Some of these voters insisted that they had not voted that day. Robert Caro argued in his 1989 book that Johnson had thus stolen the election in Jim Wells County, and that 10,000 <b>ballots</b> were also <b>rigged</b> in Bexar County alone.

2500|$|The next day, Aguinaldo surreptitiously {{took his}} {{oath of office}} as President in a chapel officiated by a Catholic priest Cenon Villafranca who was under the {{authority}} of the Roman pope. According to Gen. Santiago Alvarez, guards were posted outside with strict instructions not to let in any unwanted partisan from the Magdiwang faction while the oath-taking took place. Artemio Ricarte also took his office [...] "with great reluctance" [...] and made a declaration that he found the Tejeros elections [...] "dirty or shady" [...] and [...] "not been in conformity with the true will of the people." [...] Meanwhile, Bonifacio met with his remaining supporters and drew up the Acta de Tejeros (Act of Tejeros) wherein they gave their reasons for not accepting the Election results. Bonifacio alleged the Election was fraudulent due to cheating and accused Aguinaldo of treason due to his negotiations with the Spanish. In their memoirs Santiago Álvarez (son of Mariano) and Gregoria de Jesús both alleged that many ballots were already filled out before being distributed, and Guillermo Masangkay contended there were more ballots prepared than voters present. Álvarez writes that Bonifacio had been warned by a Cavite leader Diego Mojica of the <b>rigged</b> <b>ballots</b> before the votes were canvassed, but he had done nothing.|$|R

50|$|In 1959, Williams {{was elected}} to the {{national}} executive of the CPGB, serving on it for three years before standing down. This was perhaps in order to distance himself from allegations that CPGB members in the Electrical Trades Union had engaged in <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging.</b> He remained on the executive of the AUBTW and its successors, through a series of mergers which formed the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT), and was prominent in the national strike of 1972 which led to the jailing of the Shrewsbury Two.

50|$|The {{government}} {{must be in}} a position to guarantee that online communications are secure and that they do not violate people's privacy. This is especially important when considering electronic voting. An electoral voting system is more complex than other electronic transaction systems and the authentication mechanisms employed must be able to prevent <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging</b> or the threat of rigging. This may include the use of smart cards that allow a voter's identity to be verified whilst at the same time ensuring the privacy of the vote cast. Electronic voting in Estonia is one example of a method to conquer the privacy-identity problem inherent in internet voting systems. However, the objective should be to provide equivalence with the security and privacy of current manual systems.|$|E

5000|$|The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities is a 1998 book by American {{philosopher and}} {{mathematician}} William A. Dembski, {{a proponent of}} intelligent design, which sets out to establish approaches by which evidence of intelligent agency could be inferred in natural and social situations. In the book he distinguishes between 3 general modes of competing explanations in order of priority: regularity, chance, and design. The processes in which regularity, chance, and design are ruled out one by one until one remains as a reasonable and sufficient explanation for an event, are what he calls an [...] "explanatory filter". It is a method that tries to eliminate competing explanations in a systematic fashion including when a highly improbable event conforms to a discernible pattern that is given independently of the event itself. This pattern is Dembski's concept of specified complexity. Throughout the book he uses diverse examples such as detectability of spontaneous generation and occurrence of natural phenomena and cases of deceit like <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging,</b> plagiarism, falsification of data, etc.|$|E

The explanation offered is essentially historical-institutional. Non-impartial (that is, biased) types of governance have a tendency to reproduce themselves over time due to the advantages that they offer to the powerful. However this observation, while true, does not explain why democracy has not done more to bring about the rule of law. The research focuses on Mexico, Peru and Venezuela because these are all cases in which democracy has failed spectacularly to discipline political competition within a framework of law. The Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party maintains significant popular support despite conclusive evidence of previous <b>ballot</b> <b>rigging,</b> and continuing evidence of large-scale corruption. Peru's Fujimori was re-elected as president in 1995 despite previously using force to close the national Congress.
