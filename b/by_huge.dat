5|$|The {{action was}} {{illuminated}} in brief, blinding flashes by Jap searchlights which were shot {{out as soon}} as they were turned on, by muzzle flashes from big guns, by fantastic streams of tracers, and <b>by</b> <b>huge</b> orange-colored explosions as two Jap destroyers and one of our destroyers blew up... From the beach it resembled a door to hell opening and closing... over and over.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate {{much faster than}} the amount of visible matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter {{is not enough to}} hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the galaxy is held together <b>by</b> <b>huge</b> quantities of dark matter. Similarly, clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed <b>by</b> <b>huge</b> majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E

5|$|The Partition of Bengal in 1905 {{initiated}} the Swadeshi movement, {{which led to}} the boycotting of British goods in India. On 22 July 1908, Lokmanya Tilak, the principal advocate of the Swadeshi movement in Bombay, was sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment, on the charge of writing inflammatory articles against the Government in his newspaper Kesari. The arrest led to huge scale protests across the city. The Bombay Chronicle started by Pherozeshah Mehta, the leader of the Indian National Congress, in 1910, {{played an important role in}} the national movement until India's Independence. Lord Willingdon convened the Provincial War Conference at Bombay on 10 June 1918, whose objective was to seek the co-operation of the people in the World War I measures which the British Government thought it necessary to take in the Bombay Presidency. The conference was followed <b>by</b> <b>huge</b> rallies across the city. The worldwide influenza epidemic raged through Bombay from September to December 1918, causing hundreds of deaths per day. The Lord Willingdon Memorial incident of December 1918 saw the handicap of Home Rulers in Bombay. The first important strike in the textile industry in Bombay began in January 1919. Bombay was the main centre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha movement started by Mahatma Gandhi from February— April 1919. The movement was started as a result of the Rowlatt Act, which indefinitely extended emergency measures during World War I in order to control public unrest.|$|E
5|$|While {{moving through}} the Philippines, Linfa caused {{flooding}} and four separate landslides. The storm's heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise in reservoirs, prompting officials to drain some excess waters from the Binga Dam in Benguet province. Schools were closed in Metro Manila for three days due to flooding and landslides. The storm damaged 18sections of roads, {{as well as two}} bridges and an irrigation canal in San Gabriel, La Union. Slick roads and a fallen tree caused a bus accident in Quezon City, injuring ten people. Portions of Luzon lost power during the storm, including the entirety of La Union province, and Bacnotan briefly lost water access. In the Ilocos region, a Chinese fishing vessel docked at Currimao port ran aground after being battered <b>by</b> <b>huge</b> waves. Three days of high waves washed 30tons of mussels ashore Valladolid, Negros Occidental, prompting officials to use trucks to bury the rotting shells {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. Rough waves also disrupted rescue efforts for an unrelated ferry disaster in the country that killed 54. The storm interacted with the monsoon to spawn two tornadoes in Negros Occidental, as well as strong winds that knocked down trees and billboards. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven. The storm damaged ₱34million ($71,000 USD) worth of crops, and total damage reached ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD). Most of the power outages were repaired within a few days of Linfa's passage. After the storm, officials distributed meals to affected residents.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy is}} € 25billion (2001 GDP figures). The islands {{experienced}} continuous growth during a 20-year period, up until 2001, {{at a rate}} of approximately 5% annually. This growth was fueled mainly <b>by</b> <b>huge</b> amounts of Foreign Direct Investment, mostly to develop tourism real estate (hotels and apartments), and European Funds (near €11billion euro in the period from 2000 to 2007), since the Canary Islands are labelled Region Objective 1 (eligible for euro structural funds). Additionally, the EU allows the Canary Islands Government to offer special tax concessions for investors who incorporate under the Zona Especial Canaria (ZEC) regime and create more than 5 jobs.|$|E
