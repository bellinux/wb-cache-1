25|$|The trilogy {{describes}} the day-to-day problems of adaptation and survival {{and the emotional}} and social trauma of losing connection with the modern world. Much of the plot deals with ongoing conflicts between the different factions of the island's population. Some Nantucket residents wish to dominate the world for their own benefit, others wish to interact with local populations through trade and cultural development, while most just want to survive, work hard, and claw their way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> approaching their pre-Event way of life.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, whilst his county form on overgrassed pitches was <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> {{close to}} his best, on the less grassy {{surfaces}} in the First Test against the West Indies his bowling lacked its old venom, and he was surprisingly replaced by the veteran Derek Shackleton {{for the rest of}} the series – a move criticised heavily in the press because it was known fast bowlers would do well at Lord's. A highlight that year came when Statham took five wickets in the first-ever Gillette Cup match against Leicestershire.|$|E
25|$|The {{visit to}} Bolton Wanderers was {{postponed}} after severe {{weather in the}} north-west left the ground waterlogged, so the next game was at home to Preston North End on 23 November. Wheldon, <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> approaching his best, scored twice from distance to lead 2–1 at half-time. During the interval, Preston's goalkeeper John Wright {{was found to have}} broken his wrist and could not continue. Lester turned the ball into his own net to bring the scores level, but despite the brilliance of Bob Holmes, playing on his own at back after Sandy Tait had gone in goal, Preston could not prevent Small Heath exploiting their numerical advantage. The third goal ended with ball, goalkeeper and all five Small Heath forwards in the net, after which Jones scored twice to make the final score 5–2. Walton, now playing at centre half, drew particular praise for his judgment and the quality of his passing. The two points gained took Small Heath off the bottom of the table for the first time.|$|E

500|$|August Strindberg was {{familiar}} with Either/Or and this book made him [...] "forever a champion of the ethical as juxtaposed to the aesthetic life conception and he always remained faithful {{to the idea that}} art and knowledge must be [...] to life, and that life itself must be lived as we know best, chiefly because we are part of it and cannot escape from its promptings." [...] Strindberg was obviously attracted to Either/Or Part II where Kierkegaard developed his categorical imperative. He wrote the following in Growth of a Soul published posthumously in 1913 about Kierkegaard’s Either—Or: [...] "it was valid only for the priests who called themselves Christians and the seducer and Don Juan were the author himself, who satisfied his desires in imagination". Part II was his [...] "Discourse on Life as a Duty, and when he {{reached the end of the}} work he found the moral philosopher in despair, and that all this teaching about duty had only produced a Philistine." [...] He then states that Kierkegaard's discourses might have led him closer to Christianity but he didn't know if he could come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> [...] "which had been torn out, and joyfully thrown into the fire". However, after reading the book he [...] "felt sinful". Then another writer began to influence his life. This is how he described Either/Or: ...|$|E
500|$|On August 19, 2003, Twain's concert film Up! Live in Chicago premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) {{and drew}} in over 8.87 million viewers, {{therefore}} becoming the second-most-viewed concert film on television, behind Celine Dion's A New Day... Live in Las Vegas (2003). Following its success on television, NBC was interested again in collaborating with Twain {{for a second}} prime time special. Twain accepted the offer, but desired to deviate from high-elaboration, and perform a show much more stripped and intimate than the one filmed for Up! Live in Chicago or those included in her Up! Tour (2003–04). She explained, [...] "I wanted to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> stripped-down and rootsy. I've been doing big concerts {{for quite a long}} time, and I love it, but I just want that contrast." [...] Ergo, she turned to singer and fiddler Alison Krauss, head of the bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station, whom she had collaborated with on numerous instances; Krauss and her band backed Twain in her performance of [...] "Forever and for Always" [...] at the 2003 CMT Music Awards, and recorded a duet with Twain for [...] Twain described her decision to be completely influenced by her desire to [...] "break the music down", and that Alison Krauss and Union Station were her only choice for the television special.|$|E
500|$|When Levi {{was first}} {{cast as the}} voice of Flynn, the {{character}} had been scripted as a British farmer at the time, requiring Levi to voice him with a British accent until Flynn was eventually developed into a bandit with an American accent. Although Flynn and Rapunzel share several scenes together during the film, Levi and singer Mandy Moore, his co-star who provides the voice of Rapunzel, recorded virtually none of their dialogue together due to scheduling conflicts, which Levi cited as one of the challenges he endured while working on the film, in addition to having to star in the television series Chuck simultaneously. Levi's starring role on Chuck required the actor to constantly [...] "shed a character and take on another character and shed that character and then go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> else". However, Levi and Moore did meet on one occasion to record their romantic duet [...] "I See the Light", Levi was not intimidated by the thought of recording the song, describing the experience as [...] "an added bonus". However, he admitted to having been nervous to sing with Moore, a professional singer, and working with composer Alan Menken. Although the actor identifies himself as [...] "no stranger to singing" [...] due to his background in musical theatre, Levi's performance of [...] "I See the Light" [...] is considered to be his [...] "big singing debut" [...] because it was his first time recording a song professionally.|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed {{by a lot of}} people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E

2500|$|Berry's {{fiction to}} date {{consists}} of eight novels and forty-seven short stories (forty-three {{of which are}} collected in That Distant Land, 2004 and A Place in Time, 2012) which, when read as a whole, form a chronicle of the fictional small Kentucky town of Port William. Because of his long-term, ongoing exploration {{of the life of}} an imagined place, Berry has been compared to William Faulkner. Yet, although Port William is no stranger to murder, suicide, alcoholism, marital discord, and the full range of losses that touch human lives, it lacks the extremes of characterization and plot development that are found in much of Faulkner. Hence Berry is sometimes described as working in an idealized, pastoral, or nostalgic mode, a characterization of his work which he resists: [...] "If your work includes a criticism of history, which mine certainly does, you can't be accused of wanting to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>something,</b> because you're saying that what we were wasn't good enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|Freeman {{was a man}} of {{deeply held}} convictions, which he expounded in the History of the Norman Conquest and other works with vigour and enthusiasm. [...] These {{included}} the belief, common to many thinkers of his generation, in the superiority of those peoples that spoke Indo-European languages, especially the Greek, Roman and Germanic peoples, and in their genetic cousinhood; also in the purely Teutonic nature of the English nation. [...] He asserted that the Anglo-Saxon invaders of England had largely killed or driven out the original Celtic inhabitants, though he admitted that [...] "the women would doubtless be largely spared", an exception which fatally flawed his argument. His conviction of the racial purity of the Anglo-Saxon people was highly influential on later generations of writers. [...] His enthusiasm for Anglo-Saxondom knew few bounds when it came to their social and political institutions, and to his greatest heroes. [...] These included Alfred the Great, Earl Godwin and Harold Godwinson, though he also began increasingly to admire William for his policy of protecting his revolution by retaining Old English institutions wherever possible. [...] Freeman placed much greater faith in Anglo-Saxon historical writings than in the Norman chronicles, which he considered vitiated by sycophancy to the Norman court. [...] He had learned from Thomas Arnold a belief in the continuous and cyclical nature of history in general. [...] Taking his cue from Francis Palgrave, Freeman applied this to early medieval history by making the thoroughly Whig claim that the first parliaments of the reigns of Henry III and Edward I had brought the country <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> like the Anglo-Saxon institution of the Witenagemot, or national council, and that the constitution of the country had evolved through the Conquest period rather than being entirely remade. [...] An unbroken line thus connected the Witenagemot with Victorian democracy. [...] This all had the effect of diminishing the significance of his own subject, since it meant that 1066 had for Freeman [...] "not the importance either of a beginning or of an ending, but the importance of a turning point". [...] Hammering the point home, he wrote that, ...|$|E
