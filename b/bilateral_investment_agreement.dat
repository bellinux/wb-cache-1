40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} the {{evolution}} of European Union law in the matter of foreign direct <b>investment</b> on <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> concluded by the Member States before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon brought foreign direct investment under the exclusive European Union competence. The impact of this new competence on <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> between Member States and third countries might not be strong. First, it only covers protection of direct investments, strictly conceived, whereas <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> also concern all investments and their promotion. Second, the new exclusive competence of the Union should not affect the validity of the <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> concluded before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Nonetheless, the Member States have lost their competence in foreign direct investment although the European Union has not exercised its competence yet. That's why a new regulation establishes transitional arrangements for <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> between Member States and third countries. It allows maintaining <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> notified to the Commission until the European Union concludes treaties with the same foreign countries but the Member States must cooperate with the Commission and obtain the authorizations to open formal negotiations and to sign the amended agreements. Those agreements will probably be maintained in force but the Commission might use its powers to obtain a modification of the <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> which makes them compatible with European Union law and assures the coherence with the European external policy, before those agreements are replaced by future agreements of the European Union relating to the same subject matter. Le traité de Lisbonne a élargi la compétence de l'Union en matière de politique commerciale commune au domaine des investissements directs étrangers. Cette compétence apporte des éléments de réponse à l'interrogation sur l'avenir des nombreux traités bilatéraux de protection et de promotion des investissements (TBI) conclus par les États membres avec des États tiers, notamment ceux conclus avec les pays de l'ASEAN. La version publiée est actualisée pour tenir compte de l'adoption en décembre 2012 du règlement établissant des dispositions transitoires pour les accords bilatéraux d'investissement conclus entre des États membres et des pays tiers, qui donne à la Commission moins de pouvoirs que ce qu'elle proposait. On peut penser qu'elle les utilisera pour inciter les États à renégocier ces TBI qui devraient donc être maintenus mais éventuellement modifiés par les États membres dans l'attente de nouveaux accords, probablement mixtes...|$|R

40|$|Since January 2014 China and the European Union (EU) {{have been}} {{negotiating}} a comprehensive <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreement.</b> In {{contrast to the}} EU-US negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the ongoing negotiations between China and the EU have received little public attention so far. Still, a successful conclusion of these negotiations may be of great importance even beyond the EU-China investment relations. This holds {{in at least two}} respects. Firstly, a successfully concluded <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreement</b> may pave the way for a future EU-China free trade agreement. And secondly, looking beyond the bilateral relationship, the negotiations between the EU and China may make an important contribution to the establishment of a more liberal global investment framework.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explain why Norway has {{recently}} changed its policy on <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> with emerging economies. To do so, the preferences and interests surrounding negotiations between small open economy Norway and large emerging economy China for a <b>bilateral</b> trade and <b>investment</b> <b>agreement</b> are studied. Departing from Robert Putnam’s model of the two-level game, the thesis discusses the relevant actors and mechanisms in changing this policy at three analytical level (domestic, bilateral and systemic) : i) the role of domestic corporate interests, ii) the shift in interest and policy among emerging economies, and iii) the failure of multilateralism in international trade and investment policy. The main methodological approach is an embedded case study of the China-Norway negotiations, drawing on empirical insights from other bilateral relationships, particularly between small open economies and large emerging economies (e. g. India-Efta, Brazil-Norway, China-New Zealand). The interests and strategies on <b>investment</b> and <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> of domestic Norwegian corporations, and their possible channels of influence on public policy, are examined through interviews with key informants in the Norwegian business sector and interest groups. The interests in and policy of <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> of China and other emerging economies are examined through reviews of former agreements, as well as statements of influential Chinese foreign policy think tanks. Norway’s position as a small power {{in a world of}} increasing bilateralism, and the way this influences the relationship with large emerging powers is examined against the overall trends in global trade and <b>investment</b> <b>agreements.</b> The thesis argues that the Norwegian policy change should be viewed in light of the changed interests of China and other emerging economies in investing abroad. While the Norwegian business lobby and telecoms industry is pushing this policy change in general, the domestic corporations are not found to be the primary initiators of this policy change towards China...|$|R

40|$|Once the Lisbon Treaty {{entered into}} force on 1 January 2009, the {{regulatory}} competences over Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) were {{transferred from the}} Member States to the European Union.

The effect of this development has a dual paradigm: first, the above change affects the existing legal regime of foreign direct investment in the Member States, which is primarily based on the rules of <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Investment</b> Treaties (BITs) concluded by those States; second, the new CCP format calls for a precise regulation of some open questions and issues pertaining to its implementation in the post-Lisbon FDI regulation process by means of secondary legislation of the Union.

40|$|Introduction. ] This paper {{discusses}} the uncertain future of Member State BITs with third {{countries in the}} light of the developing EU investment policy. The question will be examined on the basis of the proposed Regulation establishing transitional arrangements for <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements</b> between Member States and third countries presented by the Commission on 7 July 20101 and the European Parliament’s Position adopted at first reading on 10 May 2011. 2 The proposed Regulation and the Commission Communication of the same day are meant to be the “first steps in the development of an EU international investment policy”. 3 The first chapters present the legal framework relevant for this question and its evolution to better understand the particular challenges of this transition process. The second chapter examines the relationship of EU law and investment law, with a brief introduction of the notion of investment law and the scope of the EU’s new investment competence. The third chapter outlines the legal framework for the continuation and termination of treaties under international and EU law. The fourth chapter concerns BITs, first covering the particular nature of BITs and then the CJEU’s judgments in the BIT Cases of 2009.

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of this thesis are to clarify and distinguish {{the existence of}} regulatory expropriation from other types of indirect expropriation and to propose alternative ways to rescrutinise regulatory expropriation in light of its establishment and justification in international law. In pursuing the first objective, the research delves into certain national, regional, and international contexts, identifying the key features of regulatory expropriation – for instance, regulatory autonomy and regulatory interference – and conducts an extensive exploration of the relevant principles of international law. This exploration concentrates especially on the doctrine of police power and on principles that can contribute to an elaborated application of the doctrine for the identification of regulatory expropriation. With regard to the second objective, the research examines the principle of necessity in international law that functions to preclude the wrongfulness of a state’s act and also {{takes into account the}} interacting relationship between customary international law and <b>bilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>agreements.</b> In addition, the research goes a step further by means of its analysis of the necessity exception in WTO law. This thesis puts forward the conclusion that an arbitral approach to bona fide regulatory expropriation that can be justified in international law, if {{it is based on the}} elaborated application of the doctrine of police power and on the application of the principle of proportionality within the framework of the ends-means and the cause-effect, will be more desirable for investment treaty arbitration given that arbitration is a type of public law adjudication...|$|R
