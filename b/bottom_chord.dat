25|$|A truss can {{be thought}} of as a beam where the web {{consists}} of a series of separate members instead of a continuous plate. In the truss, the lower horizontal member (the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord)</b> and the upper horizontal member (the top chord) carry tension and compression, fulfilling the same function as the flanges of an I-beam. Which chord carries tension and which carries compression depends on the overall direction of bending. In the truss pictured above right, the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> is in tension, and the top chord in compression.|$|E
25|$|The igloo {{is a form}} {{of light}} nailed {{hardwood}} timber arch construction, where each arch is made up of two half arches more or less freely pinned at two abutments close to ground level and at a central or crown pin. Each half arch consists of two adjacent trusses laced together at top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> level and each truss consists of a top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> laced together in arch form. As a result, each half truss is made up of four main timber chords sprung into arch form, and light timber bracing nailed in position to form a curved open-latticed box truss.|$|E
500|$|The Blackledge River Railroad Bridge was rebuilt to {{increase}} the flood clearance and the load-bearing capacity of the bridge, but its abutments were integrated into the new bridge. Completed c. 1912, the replacement Blackledge River Railroad Bridge is a riveted steel, double-intersection Warren deck truss. The original granite stone abutments which supported the previous bridge {{was reported to be}} five feet lower, were integrated with the brownstone abutments of the rebuilt bridge. The <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> of the span is [...] above the Blackledge River. The truss is [...] long and about [...] deep. The top and bottom chords are typical box girders with diagonal members and the deck is open. At some point, the bridge was altered {{with the addition of a}} sewer pipe.|$|E
5000|$|The scissor truss {{gets its}} name from being shaped {{like a pair of}} shears (scissors). Two {{defining}} features of a scissor truss are: 1) the joint where the <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> pass (the hinge of a pair of scissors) must be firmly connected and 2) the rafter (top chord) feet must land on the <b>bottom</b> <b>chords.</b> If the <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> join to the under-side of the top chords the assembly is said to be [...] "scissor braced" [...] rather than a scissor truss.|$|R
25|$|The {{parallel}} chord truss, or flat truss, {{gets its}} name from its parallel top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords.</b> It is often used for floor construction.|$|R
40|$|Using of subdiagonals {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods to {{decrease}} the materials consumption of the beams in the case of increased spans. Two variants of the trussed steel beam with the span in 12 m were considered. The considered beams are the main load bearing elements of the roof structure. The trussed beams consist of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords,</b> struts and pillars. Rational from the point of view of materials consumption distances from the support to the joint of the edge strut with the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords,</b> height of trussed beam and vertical dimension of the edge strut were evaluated by the response surface and inspection methods. The dependences of materials consumption and distances from the support to the joint of the edge strut with the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords,</b> height of trussed beam and vertical dimension of the edge strut were obtained as the second order polynomial equation on the base of numerical experiment. Rational from the point of view of materials consumption structure of the trussed beam was suggested...|$|R
2500|$|The two spans are {{lenticular}} trusses {{with the}} top chord of each truss comprising a heavy tubular arch in compression, while the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> comprises a pair of chains. Each of the trusses is simply supported and therefore no horizontal thrust is exerted on the piers, which is crucial {{in view of the}} curved track on either side. Between these two chords are supporting cross-bracing members and suspension standards which hang beneath the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> to carry the railway deck which is a continuous plate beam. There are also seventeen much shorter and more conventional plate-girder approach spans on the shore. On the Cornish side there are ten which measure (from Saltash station towards the river): , , , , , , , , , , and seven on the Devon side of (from the river towards St Budeaux): , , , , , , [...] This gives a total length for the nineteen spans of [...]|$|E
50|$|The top {{members of}} a truss are known generically as the top chord, bottom members as the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord,</b> and the {{interior}} members as webs. In historic carpentry the top chords are often called rafters, and the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> is an often a tie beam. There are two main types of timber roof trusses: closed, in which the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> is horizontal and {{at the foot of}} the truss, and open, in which the bottom chords are raised to provide more open space, also known as raised <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> trusses.|$|E
50|$|An Inverted Fink Truss has a <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> {{without a}} top chord.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1896, {{one of the last}} known to be built in the 19th century in Vermont. Its {{construction}} is somewhat unusual, with distinctively thicker <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> on the trusses, built out of twelve layers of planking.|$|R
50|$|Latitudinal and {{longitudinal}} I-beams {{supported by}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> provide a deck frame. They are trussed with two ⅞-inch wrought iron rods and braced by tie rods. Wooden planks laid horizontally across the frame serve as the deck. Modern box girder guardrails run along both sides.|$|R
2500|$|Early European truss bridges used {{king post}} and queen post configurations. Some early German bridges {{included}} diagonal panel bracing in trusses with parallel top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords.</b> [...] To {{solve the problem}} of deterioration of the wood upon exposure to weather, various forms of covering came to be employed.|$|R
5000|$|Common jazz parlance {{refers to}} upper {{structures}} {{by way of}} the interval between the root of the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> and the root of the triad juxtaposed above it. For instance, in example one above (C79) the triad of E major is a (compound) minor 3rd away from C (root of the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord).</b> Thus, this upper structure can be called upper structure flat three, or USIII for short.|$|E
50|$|A truss can {{be thought}} of as a beam where the web {{consists}} of a series of separate members instead of a continuous plate. In the truss, the lower horizontal member (the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord)</b> and the upper horizontal member (the top chord) carry tension and compression, fulfilling the same function as the flanges of an I-beam. Which chord carries tension and which carries compression depends on the overall direction of bending. In the truss pictured above right, the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> is in tension, and the top chord in compression.|$|E
50|$|All four igloos are {{of similar}} construction, and utilise nailed timber arch construction, where each arm {{is made up}} of two half arches pinned at two {{abutments}} close to the ground level, and at a central or crown pin. Each half arch consists of two adjacent trusses laced together at top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> level and each truss consists of a top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> laced together in arch form. Each truss is therefore made up of four main timber chords sprung into arch form, and light timber bracing nailed into position to form a curved open-latticed box truss.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{solution of}} trussed beams {{is with the}} vertical edge struts. But it was shown, that the inclined edge struts are preferable {{from the point of}} view of materials consumption in some cases. The composite trussed beams with the inclined and vertical edge struts were considered. The trussed beams consist from the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords,</b> one central vertical and two inclined or vertical edge struts. Steel, timber and reinforced plastics are considered as the structural materials of composite trussed beam. Rational {{from the point of view}} of materials consumption distances from the support to the joint of the edge strut with the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> so as height of trussed beam and vertical dimension of the edge strut were evaluated by the response surface method for the main load bearing elements of the roof structure. The dependences of materials consumption and distances from the support to the joint of the edge strut with the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> so as height of trussed beam and vertical dimension of the edge strut were obtained on the base of numerical experiment. Rational from the point of view of materials consumption structure of composite trussed beam was suggested. It was shown, that the using of reinforced plastics for some structural sub elements of trussed beam allows to decrease the materials consumption...|$|R
50|$|The trusses have {{horizontal}} and parallel top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords,</b> 24 ft apart with inclined posts at each end. Diagonals {{are designed for}} tension with greater stress expected toward the span's end. A single counterbrace in the third panel and a pair in the fourth, each of 0.75 in round rods with turnbuckles.|$|R
30|$|Beam B 2, {{which was}} tested to failure without strengthening, failed at a load 50 % {{lower than that}} of the control beam B 1. Failure {{occurred}} by shear off of the concrete. The first shear crack appeared at a load of 40 kN, followed by the first flexural crack at 55 kN located at mid-span. As the load increased, a diagonal crack passing {{through the center of the}} opening was formed at 90 kN. Two additional cracks formed in the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> of the opening during the application of load. As the loading continued to progress, the cracks widened with several minor cracks appearing along the façade of the beam, as shown in Fig.  6. Finally, the beam failed due to the presence of these cracks in the <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> of the opening at a load of approximately 124  kN.|$|R
50|$|The {{chains are}} {{suspended}} 2 metres (6 ft 6 in) beneath each <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> {{of the bridge}} and tensioned after building, by pulling the reinforcing posts into the vertical position. This creates a fully reinforced structure.|$|E
50|$|The deep profile {{corrugated}} fibrous cement {{main roof}} is supported on single span steel trusses {{which have a}} segmentally curved <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> and have been manufactured from riveted angle iron sections. The <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> of the trusses are clad in fibrous plaster that sweeps down the walls and over iron supporting stanchions. The ceiling which follows the curve is lined with Craftex, a proprietary fibrous board. This material has been used extensively {{on the walls and}} ceilings inside the auditorium for its sound absorption qualities. Perforated fibrous plaster vents are located down the centre of the auditorium ceiling that connect to five ridge vents.|$|E
50|$|Longspan and Deep Longspan Steel Joists can be {{furnished}} with either underslung or square ends, with parallel chords or with single or double pitched top chords to provide sufficient slope for roof drainage. Square end joists are primarily intended for <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> bearing.|$|E
2500|$|Lenticular trusses, {{patented}} in 1878 by William Douglas (although the Gaunless Bridge of 1823 was {{the first}} of the type), have the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> of the truss arched, forming a lens shape. [...] A lenticular pony truss bridge is a bridge design that involves a lenticular truss extending above and below the roadbed.|$|R
5000|$|Town and Howe truss {{designs were}} {{patented}} by Ithiel Town in 1820 and William Howe in 1840, respectively. [...] The Shushan Bridge employs [...] "the patented Town lattice truss, consisting of top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> of laminated wood plank, and {{a web of}} diagonal wood planks connected by wood trunnels at each point of intersection".|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a {{rational}} analysis model to evaluate shear strength of reinforced concrete beams with stirrups has been developed. To develop the analysis model, a reinforced concrete beam was idealized with top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> {{and a single}} web shear element, which were designated to resist flexural bending moment and shear force, respectively. With consideration of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords,</b> simple flexural analysis was employed, which gave longitudinal strain at the mid depth in a shear critical section. With the strain at the mid-depth, shear analysis was conducted for the single web shear element which {{was treated as a}} cracked orthotropic reinforced concrete element. For the shear analysis, finite element analysis procedure based on the MCFT was modified accordingly to consider the strain at the mid-depth. Thus, interaction between flexural and shear behaviors in a reinforced concrete beam could be rationally considered.|$|R
5000|$|A tied-arch {{bridge is}} an arch bridge {{in which the}} outward-directed {{horizontal}} forces of the arch, or top chord, are borne as tension by the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> (either tie-rods or the deck itself), {{rather than by the}} ground or the bridge foundations.|$|E
5000|$|In {{music and}} music theory, a bichord or polychord {{consists}} {{of two or more}} chords, {{one on top of the}} other. In shorthand they are written with the top chord above a line and the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> below, for example F upon C: [...]|$|E
50|$|In 2006 {{the bridge}} saw minor {{structural}} repairs to its <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> at the upstream north corner, the bolsters were replaced {{for the first}} time since the hurricane of 1938, and the bed timbers were replaced by granite pedestals. The work was paid for by a donation from the National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges.|$|E
50|$|Two sets {{of heavy}} 3 by 12 in timber planks {{serve as the}} top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords,</b> with a {{secondary}} lower chord at deck level. Twelve-inch (30 cm) diagonals, fastened at each intersection by two-inch (5 cm) treenails, radiate out from the middle to either end. They are supplemented by additional diagonals at the ends and four wooden buttresses along the exterior on either side.|$|R
25|$|A planar truss is {{one where}} all members and nodes lie within a two {{dimensional}} plane, while a space truss has members and nodes that extend into three dimensions. The top beams in a truss are called top chords and are typically in compression, the bottom beams are called <b>bottom</b> <b>chords,</b> and are typically in tension. The interior beams are called webs, and the areas inside the webs are called panels.|$|R
50|$|The {{flood of}} August 19, 1955, did {{considerable}} damage to Washington Crossing Bridge. Floating debris {{in the form}} of whole trees, steel barrels and even houses smashed against the bridge, resulting in damage to all six spans. More than half the bridge's <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> were bent or twisted beyond repair. These members were replaced with new fabricated steel members and the bridge was reopened to traffic on November 17, 1955.|$|R
50|$|A {{scissors}} truss {{is a kind}} of truss {{used primarily}} in buildings, in which the <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> members cross each other, connecting to the angled top chords at a point intermediate on the top chords' length, creating an appearance similar to an opened pair of scissors. Scissors trusses are used almost entirely in building construction to support a pitched roof, where a sloping or raised ceiling surface is desired.|$|E
50|$|The basic bridge {{consists}} of three main parts. The bridge's strength {{is provided by the}} panels on the sides. The panels are 10 ft, 5 ft, cross-braced rectangles that each weigh 570 lb, and can be lifted by six men. The panel was constructed of welded steel. The top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> of each panel had interlocking male and female lugs into which engineers could inset panel connecting pins.|$|E
50|$|The then-new {{technique}} of arc welding allowed considerable weight savings: its overall weight is 56 metric tons, while a riveted version would have weighted over 70 tons. Apart from construction method, the construction itself is an ordinary truss bridge with two main truss beams, a straight <b>bottom</b> <b>chord</b> and a parabolic top chord. In addition to two lanes for road traffic, the bridge also includes two side-walks for pedestrians.|$|E
40|$|For {{developing}} innovative construction techniques, {{extensive research}} {{has been carried out}} on the behavior characteristics for shaping formation of space structures by means of cable-tensioning method. This paper discusses the shaping formation of space structures by means of post-tensioning of the cable in <b>bottom</b> <b>chords.</b> It is a fast and economical construction method used in many types of space structures. Test models presented herein consist of uniform pyramids with multi-directional ball type joint, the space structure is shaped and erected into its final shape by cabletensioning in the <b>bottom</b> <b>chords.</b> The feasibility of the proposed post-tensioning technique and the reliability of the established geometric model were confirmed by finite element analysis and tests on a small-scale test model.

It proved to be an economic and reasonable method compared to conventional construction method including the heavy crane and scaffoldFull Tex...|$|R
30|$|The {{orientation}} of AFRP sheets used for shear strengthening (reducing the stress concentration {{on the top}} and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> of the opening) and the crack width both {{play a significant role in}} the behavior of RC beams with openings. The AFRP sheets installed at 60 ° to the axis of the beam are found to be most efficient for shear-strength enhancements, whereas the vertical AFRP sheets are less effective (B 4 and B 5).|$|R
50|$|The {{steel trusses}} have fixed {{supports}} {{on top of}} twin columns. The top and <b>bottom</b> <b>chords</b> {{are made up of}} circular hollow sections, which form a triangular shape. There are three main trusses and secondary circular girders that rest on them, which builds up the skeleton structure, while trapezoidal steel sheet covers complete the roofing system. The steel roof and its supports are separate from the tribune structure, constituting an independent structure by itself.|$|R
