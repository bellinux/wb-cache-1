40|$|The {{evolution}} of column instabilities {{that lead to}} <b>break</b> <b>up</b> of a microscale liquid jet is studied experimentally using shadowgraph technique. The jet formation is investigated over a range of Reynolds number, Pressure Ratio, and Ohnesorge number which are varied by the driving pressure, observation chamber pressure, and the jet liquid. Over the range of these parameters, the jet experiences different <b>break</b> <b>up</b> mechanisms {{as a result of}} different dominant instabilities. The present investigation discusses both <b>break</b> <b>up</b> mechanisms that are similar to the <b>break</b> <b>up</b> of macroscale jets and some new microscale <b>break</b> <b>up</b> phenomena.

After launching her third record Hilary Duff (2004), she experienced an eventful personal life, including a stalking incident, her parents' separation, and <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> with her boyfriend. Consequently, Duff assumed an integral position in its production, co-writing almost every track with longtime collaborator Kara DioGuardi instead of her previously-limited involvement.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|Frank's Cock is a 1993 Canadian {{short film}} written and {{directed}} by Mike Hoolboom. The eight-minute production stars Callum Keith Rennie as an unnamed narrator who discusses his relationship with his partner, Frank. The two met while the narrator was a teenager and spent nearly ten years together. Frank has since been diagnosed with AIDS, and the narrator fears his death. The story was based on the experience of one of Hoolboom's friends at People With AIDS, which Hoolboom adapted after receiving a commission to create a short film about <b>breaking</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> the regular summer meetings of the artists as they could no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} produce a Horn instance, no two {{variables}} that appear in the same clause of the renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint {{on a pair of}} variables is a 2-satisfiability constraint. By finding a satisfying assignment to the resulting 2-satisfiability instance, Lewis shows how to turn any renamable Horn instance into a Horn instance in polynomial time. By <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> long clauses into multiple smaller clauses, and applying a linear-time 2-satisfiability algorithm, it is possible to reduce this to linear time.|$|E

5|$|Io's {{colorful}} {{appearance is}} the result of materials deposited by its extensive volcanism, including silicates (such as orthopyroxene), sulfur, and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide frost is ubiquitous across the surface of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials. Sulfur is also seen in many places across Io, forming yellow to yellow-green regions. Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often damaged by radiation, <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> the normally stable cyclic 8-chain sulfur. This radiation damage produces Io's red-brown polar regions.|$|E
