5|$|Schaub {{took care}} of Hitler's {{personal}} belongings, papers and travel journeys, making him a notable figure in Hitler's inner circle. In 1924, he was imprisoned with Hitler for {{his involvement in the}} coup d'état attempt of November 1923 in Munich. In time he closely befriended Hitler. Later in July 1944, Schaub was present during the military briefing during which a <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded,</b> killing four people and injuring others; Hitler escaped with minor injuries.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's {{importance}} {{as a major}} port saw it become a target for the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded</b> in the basement, {{on the eastern side}} of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant that much of the building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of November 21, 1970, a dynamite-fueled <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded</b> {{underneath}} the portico, doing $170,000 in damage.

On 21 February 2001 a bomb disguised as a torch (flashlight) left outside a Territorial Army base in Shepherd's Bush seriously injured a 14-year-old cadet, who was blinded and had his hand blown off. A second attack in Shepherd's Bush, the 4 March BBC bombing, injured a civilian outside the BBC Television Centre. The explosion was captured by a BBC cameraman, and the footage was broadcast on TV stations worldwide, and gained mass publicity for the group. On 14 April a <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded</b> at a postal sorting office in Hendon, causing minor damage but no injuries. Three weeks later on 6 May a second <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded</b> at the same building, causing slight injuries to a passer-by.

The bombing {{occurred}} on the 10th anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya.

5|$|On July22, 1916, a <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded</b> {{during the}} San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade, killing ten people and {{wounding}} 40. Police suspected Berkman, {{although there was}} no evidence, and ultimately their investigation focused on two local labor activists, Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. Although neither Mooney nor Billings were anarchists, Berkman came to their aid: raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and beginning a national campaign on their behalf. Mooney and Billings were convicted, with Mooney sentenced to death and Billings to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Mugabe survived two {{assassination}} attempts. In the first, {{which took}} place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden wall. In the second, on 10 February, a roadside <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded</b> near his motorcade as he left a Fort Victoria rally. Mugabe himself was unharmed. Mugabe accused the Rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks. In an attempt to quell the possibility that Rhodesia's security forces would launch a coup to prevent the election, Mugabe met with Peter Walls, the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, {{and asked him to}} remain in his position {{in the event of a}} ZANU-PF victory. At the time Walls refused.|$|E

5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded</b> at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E
5|$|Later during World War II, with Germany {{suffering}} major defeat on all fronts, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and {{his fellow}} conspirators decided to eliminate Hitler and the Nazi leadership, establish a new government and save Germany from total destruction. Stauffenberg had his opportunity on 20 July 1944 at a military briefing at Hitler's East Prussian headquarters known as the Wolf's Lair (Wolfsschanze). He managed to get through security and plant a briefcase bomb under the conference table. The <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded,</b> fatally wounding three officers and a stenographer who died shortly thereafter. Hitler survived with only minor injuries, as did everyone else who was shielded from the bomb blast by the conference table leg.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1998 the RIRA left a car {{containing}} 500lb of home-made explosives in {{the centre}} of Omagh, County Tyrone. The bombers {{could not find a}} parking space near the intended target of the courthouse, and the car was left 400 metres away. As a result, three inaccurate telephone warnings were issued, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed the bomb was located outside the courthouse. They attempted to establish a security cordon to keep civilians clear of the area, which inadvertently pushed people closer to the location of the bomb. Shortly after, the <b>bomb</b> <b>exploded</b> killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the single deadliest strike of the Troubles.|$|E
