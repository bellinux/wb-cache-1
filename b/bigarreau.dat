6000|$|Sageret {{describes}} a remarkable variety, LE GRIOTTIER DE LA TOUSSAINT, which bears {{at the same}} time, even as late as September, flowers and fruit of all degrees of maturity. The fruit, which is of inferior quality, is borne on long, very thin footstalks. But the extraordinary statement is made that all the leaf-bearing shoots spring from old flower-buds. Lastly, {{there is an important}} physiological distinction between those kinds of cherries which bear fruit on young or on old wood; but Sageret positively asserts that a <b>Bigarreau</b> in his garden bore fruit on wood of both ages. (10/82. These several statements are taken from the four following works, which may, I believe, be trusted: Thompson in 'Hort. Transact.' see above; Sageret 'Pomologie Phys.' 1830 pages 358, 364, 367, 379; 'Catalogue of the Fruit in the Garden of Hort. Soc.' 1842 pages 57, 60; Downing 'The Fruits of America' 1845 pages 189, 195, 200.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Royal Ann or Royal Anne (also called Napoleon, Napoleon <b>Bigarreau</b> and Queen Anne) is {{a variety}} of cherry, similar in {{appearance}} and taste to the 'Rainier cherry'. In 1847, Henderson Lewelling brought 700 fruit trees of 'Napoleon Bigarreau' from Iowa to Oregon’s Willamette Valley and to start a cherry orchard. Seth Lewelling joined his brother Henderson in 1850, he renamed the tree 'Royal Ann' Seth later developed the 'Bing cherry'.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the impact of seven variants of organic and mineral preplanting fertilization on the content of the main macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) in the leaves of sour cherry trees, Erdi B&# 246 term&# 246 cv., grafted on two types of rootstocks - seedling forms of Mahaleb (IK-M 9) and Droganyellow <b>bigarreau.</b> The investigation was carried out during the period 2001 - 2003 in an experimental orchard at the Institute of Agriculture, Kyustendil. There was no significant effect of the different preplanting fertilization variants on leaf nitrogen content. The trees on rootstock Droganyellow <b>bigarreau</b> responded more pronouncedly to phosphorous and potassium fertilization, which corresponded to the higher leaf phosphorous and potassium content, compared to those on IK-M 9. In all variants, there was a trend for a higher calcium concentration in the leaves of the trees on Droganyellow <b>bigarreau.</b> Leaf magnesium level decreased over experimental years, which was more strongly manifested by the trees on Droganyellow <b>bigarreau,</b> whereas in the variants on the Mahaleb rootstock it was of higher values. </div...|$|E
40|$|The {{sequence}} of events which occurs during the ripening of the Passe-Crassane pear fruit have been previously studied. In this work, we have investigated the ripening of another climacteric fruit (Pyrus malus L. cv Golden Delicious) and of a nonclimacteric fruit (Prunus avium L. cv <b>Bigarreau</b> Napoléon). We show that both climacteric fruits exhibit the same preclimacteric {{sequence of}} events. Differences exist, however, between the Golden Delicious apple and the Passe-Crassane pear in that the protein synthesis capacity of the two fruits {{is not the same}} during the over-ripening period. On the other hand, a nonclimacteric fruit, the <b>Bigarreau</b> Napoléon cherry, does not show an increase in its protein synthesis capacity during the over-ripening period...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} species {{of which have}} origin many populations, land-races and local varieties: wild cherry, wild pears, wild almond, wild medlar, etc. This study was focused in many important rootstocks of P. avium x P canascens - Gisela 6, P. avium x P. pseudocerasus - Colt (nano), P. mahaleb x P. avium (Maxma), P. Mahaleb and cultivar Prunus avium L. (Cerasus avium L. var. sativa Ser., P. cerasus) : <b>Bigarreau</b> Hatif. Are used two important media in the micro propagation of the horticultural species above, MS (Murashige &Skoog) and LP (Quoirin & Lepoivre). Nutrients of MS media have affected with sensible changes compare with LP media, in the explants proliferation for differentiations of the buds, shoots and leafs. Inoculation of explants in LP media, results with lower result on the qualitative indicators of the research. Average growing of the shoots on the MS media, resulted 10. 1 mm while on the LP media was 6. 0 mm. Average number of leafs 2. 47 on the MS media, while on the media LP was 1. 34 leaf. In the statistic analyses for the min and max, in all the cases it has predominance of the MS media. Intensity of the growing has cv (coefficient of variation) = 63 % and on the MS media results 1. 88 highest of LP media...|$|E
40|$|The {{adaptability}} {{of cherry}} plants to salinity conditions was investigated using {{the two most}} commonly cultivated varieties (‘Τragana Edessis’ and ‘Bigarreau Burlat’) and two rootstocks (Mazzard and CAB- 6 P), different salts (CaCl 2 and NaCl) as also non salt external medium of high osmotic potential. Three greenhouse experiments were carried out to {{study the effects of}} salinity on plant growth, nutrient composition, water relations, chlorophyll concentration, as well as to study the ability of cherry trees to recover after a period of salt and non-salt osmotic stress. Furthermore an in vitro experiment was carried out to study the effect of NaCl and CaCl 2 on plant growth, nutrient composition, as well as the activity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds. The results of this thesis showed that: a) salinity produces a decrease on plant growth, an increase on the toxic ions (Na and Cl) concentration in all plant parts, and a decrease on macronutrients concentration, b) salinity produces a decrease of chlorophyll concentration and water and osmotic potential of leaves, c) salinity induces the activities of peroxidase and non-enzymatic antioxidants, whereas it depresses the activity of catalase, d) the level of salinity tolerance of the different cultivars depends on restriction of both uptake and translocation to leaves of the toxic ions Na and Cl, e) cherry plants have the ability to recover after {{a relatively short period of}} mild NaCl stress, f) the studied varieties can be classified according to their tolerance to salinity: Tragana Edessis > <b>Bigarreau</b> Burlat. ...|$|E
40|$|Sweet cherry {{breeding}} {{programs are}} interested in developing new cultivars that are very early or very late in ripening, high yielding, with excellent fruit size and quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate new, promising, sweet cherry genotypes (G- 1 and G- 2) for ripening time, fruit morphology and fruit chemical content, and compare it with the standard sweet cherry cultivars (<b>Bigarreau</b> Jaboulay, B. H. Burlat, Seneca, Hedelfiger Riesenkirsche, Germersdorfer Grosse Kirsche, Emperor Francis and Bing). Experiment was done during four consecutive years (2006 - 2009) in Grocka, near Belgrade. The earliest fruit ripening was recorded in G- 2 (22 nd April) while the latest in `Bing` (2 nd June). Fruit weight varied from 5. 83 g (G- 2) up to 8. 93 g (G- 1). Soluble solid content and total sugar content were the lowest in genotype G- 2 (10. 48 %; 8. 45 %, respectively) but the highest in Emperor Francis (18. 28 %; 15. 98 %, respectively). No matter the fact that some standard cultivars showed better results for some traits, genotypes G- 1 and G- 2 are considered very promising. So, genotype G- 1 could be intended for table consumption since it ripens 2 - 3 days after cv. B. H. Burlat, but have much higher fruit weight. Also, genotype G- 2, the earliest in this trial, showed satisfactory fruit weight for this ripening time, which makes it very interesting for fresh market production.
