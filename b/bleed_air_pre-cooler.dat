40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the six-decade use of unfiltered aircraft <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> taken from jet engines to supply breathing {{air in the}} flight decks and passenger cabins of commercial and military transport aircraft. During this time, numerous flight safety issues and adverse effects from exposure to contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> have been reported. The research undertaken in this thesis examined previous investigations into these matters {{and the consequences of}} using <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on flight safety and crew and passenger health. This research examined: (a) health issues reported by aircrew as a consequence of exposure to contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> whilst flying by way of several descriptive surveys; (b) various aviation air monitoring studies previously undertaken were reviewed to assess the knowledge base of the chemicals present during contaminated air events; (c) air sampling data were evaluated for their usefulness in determining any potential adverse health effects; (d) a review was undertaken of the frequency of contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> events; (e) a review was undertaken of some of the information known by the aviation industry and others about contaminated <b>bleed</b> <b>air.</b> Analysis of the evidence that <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> contaminated by synthetic jet engine oils and hydraulic fluids, is a regular and normal occurrence and far more common than previously accepted and is a consequence of the current <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> system design. There are significant short and longterm health effects being reported {{as a direct result of}} documented exposure events that validate claims of adverse health effects in exposed individuals. The thesis argues that the precautionary principle, occupational health and safety guidelines and aviation regulations are being ignored by the aviation industry, who continue to claim that cabin air is safe. The systemic misuse of available data is widespread, secondary to commercial objectives, and places passenger and crew health and flight safety at serious risk. The thesis concludes that the use of <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> on commercial aircraft with no form of contaminated air detection or filtration system present should be discontinued. The risk to health and flight safety is no longer acceptable...|$|R

While previous work has explored the chemical {{makeup of the}} contaminants in the aircraft cabin during these events, {{little is known about}} the characteristics of the aerosol resulting from oil contamination of <b>bleed</b> <b>air.</b> This paper presents particle counter data (giving both size distributions and concentration information) of the oil droplets from simulated jet engine <b>bleed</b> <b>air.</b> Four particle counters—a scanning mobility analyzer, an aerodynamic particle-sizer, an optical particle counter, and a water-based condensation particle counter—were used in the study encompassing a size range from 13 nm to 20 μm. The aerosol characterization is given for different <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> temperatures and pressures. The data show a substantial increase of ultra-fine particles as the temperature is increased to the maximum temperatures expected during normal aircraft operation. This increase in ultra-fine particles is consistent with smoke generated from the oil.

[...] <b>Bleed</b> <b>air</b> from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, cabin pressurization, pneumatic actuators, air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks. Some engine maintenance manuals refer to such systems as [...] "customer <b>bleed</b> air". <b>Bleed</b> <b>air</b> is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high temperature and high pressure (typical values are 200–250°C and 275 kPa (40 PSI), for regulated <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> exiting the engine pylon for use throughout the aircraft).|$|R

40|$|In a {{commercial}} aircraft, ventilation {{to the cabin}} is normally through environmental control system normal <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> system, ECS emergency back-up pressurization system and ram <b>air.</b> <b>Bleed</b> <b>air</b> is primarily used to provide pressurization by supplying air to the environmental control system. Additionally, <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is used for de-icing of aircraft leading edges. The <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> needs to be tapped from engine and conveyed to the ECS pack through pipe routings. The <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> pipes that tap the air from engine would experience a varying pressure load (as high as 140 psi) and varying temperature (as high as 340 °C) at different segments. This would obviously produce the expansion/ contraction of pipes which will result in axial moment and swaying of pipelines from their nominal configuration. These movements should be compensated by means of providing suitable expansion joints/thermal compensators to avoid undesirable loads at the support points which may affect the overall functioning of the system. The real challenge lies in designing such a complex system where suitable expansion joints need to be provided within stipulated airframe configuration satisfying the installation requirements, yet cost and weight effective. In the present work, a methodology has been developed for design of ECS pipe routings, using flexible hose- metallic bellows as a thermal compensator, {{with the aid of}} finite element analysis.

No {{previous research has}} been conducted using working jet engines to simulate a <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> system and characterize the oil particulate contamination. Oil was injected into a <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> simulator and an Allison 250 CC 18 turbine engine in order to observe the particle size distributions resulting from thermal degradation and was measured with three particle sizing counters and an FTIR. The aerosol size distributions are given for various temperature and pressure ranges consistent with the process conditions associated with the <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> in a commercial aircraft. Particle sizes of approximately 80 nm to 100 nm were observed at temperatures over 200 °C while particles similar to injection distributions and smaller than measureable size were observed at lower power settings. Temperature is thought to be the controlling factor affecting particle size above 200 °C while blade shear is likely the dominant factor for lower temperatures. The <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> simulator produced results similar to the gas turbine engine results at higher temperatures, but did not replicate the size characteristics at lower temperatures.

The <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> from the propulsion engines or an auxiliary compressor, must be used efficiently. In designing with CC, the propulsion and control aspects are just as important as aerodynamics.
