5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E

500|$|Allison Mack was {{disappointed}} that the character [...] "lost some of her backbone" [...] in the second season.

[...] He was also mixed towards the episode's subplots, enjoying Mac's romantic storyline but disliking Logan's continued interest in Veronica. He also referred to Vinnie running for Sheriff as [...] "a bit ridiculous". Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode, particularly Rudd's performance. He stated that Rudd, despite playing a stock character, [...] "made me feel like I hadn't seen it a thousand times before." [...] He also enjoyed the pairing of Mac and Max, while {{he believed that the}} impact of Vinnie and Leo's reappearances was blunted by the knowledge that the show would likely not return for a fourth season.

50|$|Gamma {{encoding}} {{of images}} {{is used to}} optimize the usage of bits when encoding an image, or bandwidth used to transport an image, {{by taking advantage of}} the non-linear manner in which humans perceive light and color. The human perception of brightness, under common illumination conditions (not pitch black nor blindingly bright), follows an approximate power function (note: no relation to the Gamma function), with greater sensitivity to relative differences between darker tones than between lighter ones, consistent with the Stevens' power law for brightness perception. If images are not gamma-encoded, they allocate <b>too</b> many <b>bits</b> or <b>too</b> <b>much</b> bandwidth to highlights that humans cannot differentiate, and <b>too</b> few <b>bits</b> or <b>too</b> little bandwidth to shadow values that humans are sensitive to and would require more bits/bandwidth to maintain the same visual quality. Gamma encoding of floating-point images is not required (and may be counterproductive), because the floating-point format already provides a piecewise linear approximation of a logarithmic curve.|$|R
500|$|In {{the popular}} {{music of the}} early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and {{engineers}} to freely experiment with musical form, arrangements, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some {{of the best known}} examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production formula and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronics for acts like the Tornados. XTC's Andy Partridge interprets the music of psychedelic groups as a [...] "grown-up" [...] version of children's novelty records, believing that many acts were trying to emulate those records that they grew up with; [...] "They use exactly the same techniques—sped-up <b>bits,</b> slowed-down <b>bits,</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> echo, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> reverb, that <b>bit</b> goes backwards. ... There was no transition to be made. You go from things like 'Flying Purple People Eater' to 'I Am the Walrus'. They go hand-in-hand." [...] Music critic Richie Unterberger says that attempts to [...] "pin down" [...] the first psychedelic record are therefore [...] "nearly as elusive as trying to name the first rock & roll record". Some of the [...] "far-fetched claims" [...] include the instrumental [...] "Telstar" [...] (produced by Meek for the Tornados in 1962) and the Dave Clark Five's [...] "massively reverb-laden" [...] "Any Way You Want It" [...] (1964). The first mention of LSD on a rock record was the Gamblers' 1960 surf instrumental [...] "LSD 25". A 1962 single by The Ventures, [...] "The 2000 Pound Bee", issued forth the buzz of a distorted, [...] "fuzztone" [...] guitar, and the quest into [...] "the possibilities of heavy, transistorised distortion" [...] and other effects, like improved reverb and echo began in earnest on London's fertile rock 'n' roll scene. By 1964 fuzztone could be heard on singles by P.J. Proby, and the Beatles had employed feedback in [...] "I Feel Fine", their 6th consecutive No. 1 hit in the UK.|$|R

He also said the idea was unoriginal and compared it to Spears' fragances commercials. [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun said, [...] "forget PVC catsuits and teeny weeny air hostess outfits. Britney Spears has gone all sophisticated on us" [...] and positively commented on the fashion, saying [...] "Britney dons a hat more suited to Ascot than a music video". Peter Gicas of E! commented that the video was a nice departure from her recent more choreographed videos, such as [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "If U Seek Amy". He commended it for its [...] "more straightforward approach in telling a so-called story", but felt it was [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> like one of those overly dramatic fragrance commercials".

The review {{described}} the episode as a [...] "test of patience" [...] due to Merlin's inability to use magic and the [...] "hideously jaunty, distinctly non-medieval soundtrack". Tom Shales of The Washington Post criticised the [...] "sluggish pace" [...] of the premiere, noting that the episode was only [...] "brightened" [...] by the dragon, though similar creatures were common in the genre and it [...] "lacks personality as well as panache". Shales felt that the series took [...] "the stuff of legend and imagination and makes it dry and commonplace". Den of Geek reviewer Mark Pickavance felt that the episode was [...] "uneven and often very stilted", and failed at introducing both the characters and telling the story of the first meeting of Arthur and Merlin. He was displeased with the deviation from established mythology and the lapses in logic. The Times AA Gill described Merlin as [...] "bland", writing that it was for [...] "a large untapped audience that yearns for Abercrombie & Fitch drama". Hermione Eyre of The Independent called it [...] "horrible", disliking the [...] "modern" [...] feeling, the [...] "awful" [...] make-up, and commented that [...] "Guinevere looks like a supply teacher".|$|E

[...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E
