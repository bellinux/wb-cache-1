They are also effective in training small dogs, however they tend to lift the dog off the ground when giving corrections while the dog is distracted or in high adrenal mode.

The second problem is the weak shear performance of the CLT wall by the connection. As a first step {{of the research on}} the small CLT panel (1.2 by 2.4  m) for structural use, the shear performance of the multiple-panel shear wall was investigated in this study.|$|R

40|$|Bistable {{morphing}} composite laminates {{have been}} studied over the recent years because of their exquisite applications in energy harvesting and aerodynamic performance. A bistable laminate has two passive, stable positions that require an actuating bending moment for snap through. Different techniques {{have been developed to}} obtain bi-stability in composite laminates by using thermally or mechanically induced strain. Little study has been done around the more accessible method of laminate bi-stability through elastic buckling.

30|$|Taken together, {{these seven}} tests {{demonstrated}} many {{important aspects of}} the full-structure response of composite steel-framed buildings during fire. In particular, they shed light on the secondary load carrying mechanisms which can be activated during fire to prevent collapse, the potential importance of restraint to thermal expansion on heating (and thermal contraction on cooling) on localized <b>buckling</b> and/or <b>connection</b> failures, and the fact that full-structure response in fire is markedly different than that observed in standard fire resistance tests performed in furnaces. In the case of regular grid plan composite steel-framed buildings such as the one tested at Cardington, the fire resistance appears to be far greater than is normally assumed on the basis of furnace tests. This conclusion has been used to great advantage in recent years by the Steel Construction Industry (in particular in Europe) to justify removal of passive fire protection from secondary steel beams and steel decking in composite framed steel buildings, with considerable aesthetic, economic, sustainability, and constructability benefits.|$|R

We combined the superlayer method with thickness gradients for high-throughput adhesion measurements In this way, the effect of small modifications of interface chemistry on adhesion in multilayers was assessed in a single test. We used this methodology for an optimisation of the Ti interlayer thickness for adhesion at the SiO 2 /Ag interface.

The basic structure is made of elements with equilateral angle profiles. The columns are assembled of two profiles at an angle 60 ° that enables the connection between horizontal and diagonal on the column. The horizontal member is box profile which prevents large deflections. The staircase is extended in {{the rim of the}} triangle, which ends at the top with the observation platform 1 m over the structure. Wind had the biggest influence and is calculated according two standards SIST EN 1991 - 1 - 4 and SIST EN 1993 - 3 - 1 : 2007. The last one is relevant for the design. Internal forces are calculated by finite elements software Scia Engineer. The angle profiles are separately checked for buckling, because programe does not consider all parameters to properly calculate <b>buckling.</b> Typical <b>connections</b> are designed. They are mostly pinned. The detailed drawings are collected at the end...|$|R

40|$|Networks of {{interactions}} between competing species {{are used to}} model many complex systems, such as in genetics, evolutionary biology or sociology {{and knowledge of the}} patterns of activity they can exhibit is important for understanding their behaviour. The emergence of patterns on complex networks with reaction-diffusion dynamics is studied here, where node dynamics interact via diffusion via the network edges. Through the application of a generalisation of dynamical systems analysis this work reveals a fundamental connection between small-scale modes of activity on networks and localised pattern formation seen throughout science, such as solitons, breathers and localised <b>buckling.</b> The <b>connection</b> between solutions with a single and small numbers of activated nodes and the fully developed system-scale patterns are investigated computationally using numerical continuation methods. These techniques are also used to help reveal a much larger portion of of the full number of solutions that exist in the system at different parameter values. The importance of network structure is also highlighted, with a key role being played by nodes with a certain so-called optimal degree, on which the interaction between the reaction kinetics and the network structure organise the behaviour of the system...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} members of steel structure’s connection region is beam-to-column connection. Rigid connection in steel moment frame has special role in the behavior of these structures and the fire resistance of these connections can be important. In this paper the behaviors of three common types of rigid connections in Iran under the effect of heat were studied by the use of numerical finite element methods through ABAQUS software. The models were verified by the use of an experimental model through elastic and plastic amplitudes up to collapse and during numerical results, and the effect of large deformation in the nonlinear region has also been considered. The results show that the connection with the end plate had a better performance against heat than other connections. Also reduced stiffness and lateral <b>buckling</b> in this <b>connection</b> were less than other connections...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} {{thirteen}} full-scale {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the compressive behavior and strength of gusset plate connections. The test parameters included gusset plate thickness, size, and brace angle. In addition, the effects of frame action on the compressive behavior of gusset plate connections were also investigated. In general, the gusset plate specimens were failed by sway <b>buckling</b> of the <b>connection</b> since no out-of-plane restraint was provided from the bracing member. The test results indicated that, in general, significant yielding of the gusset plate specimens occurred prior to reaching the ultimate load. However, only limited yielding was observed for the thin specimens with a plate thickness of 6. 5 mm. The ultimate load of the specimens increased almost linearly proportional to the gusset plate thickness and decreased with increasing plate size. A slight decrease in the ultimate load of the specimens was observed when a 30 ° brace angle was used instead of a 45 ° one. The beam and column moment had only negligible effects on the ultimate load of the specimens; however, yielding of the specimens was detected at a load level significantly lower than that had no framing moment. The numerical simulation provided good agreement with the test results. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
40|$|Buildings {{composed}} of cold-formed steel (CFS) framing systems have become popular {{in many parts}} of the world. Light-gauge CFS frames can be built up from C-shaped sections and laterally braced with tension-only thin strap members. Recent research has raised many concerns about the lateral performance of these light wall systems in regions of high seismic activity. This paper focuses on the failure modes of different systems and on the main factors contributing to the ductile response of the CFS walls. The aim is to ensure that the diagonal straps yield and respond plastically with a significant drift, thereby preventing any risk of brittle failure such as connection failure or column <b>buckling.</b> Several superior <b>connection</b> details are then proposed, which provide a reliable lateral performance even in large lateral deformations by using perforated straps and/or bracket members in four corners of the wall. Performance of the proposed systems is evaluated by experimental tests on full-scale 2. 4 m x 2. 4 m and 1. 2 m x 2. 4 in specimens under a particular cyclic load regime. Method B of ASTM E 2126 - 05 standard was selected as lateral loading regime, which introduces a progressively increasing cyclic loading with two stabilized cycles at each displacement amplitude. In order to maximize the precision of the result, each specimen was connected to the testing rig by high strength bolt. The tests showed that all of the new proposed systems can provide reliable response with good ductility and maintain their lateral and vertical load-bearing abilities up to a relative lateral displacements of 3. 3 %, which was the limit of the testing rig...|$|R
