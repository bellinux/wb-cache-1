In 1320, Andronicus II's grandson, Andronicus III, was disinherited following the death of his father, Michael IX, the Emperor's son and heir apparent. The following year, Andronicus III retaliated by marching on Constantinople and was given Thrace as an appanage. He kept on pressing for his inheritance and, in 1322, was made co-emperor. This culminated in the Byzantine civil war of 1321–1328, in which Serbia <b>backed</b> Andronicus II and the Bulgarians <b>backed</b> his grandson. Eventually Andronicus III emerged triumphant on May 23, 1328. As Andronicus III consolidated his hold on Byzantium, the Ottomans succeeded in taking Bursa from the Byzantines in 1326.|$|E

40|$|<b>Back</b> to <b>back</b> can {{be defined}} as a rule of {{construction}} by which in appropriate circumstances the wording of the reinsurance agreement is to be construed {{in the same way as}} the wording of the underlying policy. The discussion on whether or not two contracts are <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> is always interconnected with the contract wording. That way, the most suitable way to discuss the <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> principle is to discuss firstly the full reinsurance clause, incorporation, and then <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> principle conditions, scope, and limits. <b>Back</b> to <b>back</b> overlaps incorporation. If two contracts are rendered <b>back</b> to <b>back,</b> one contract incorporates terms of other one, and the incorporated terms in the reinsurance contract will hold the same meaning as in the underlying policy. Some clauses that can have their meaning altered by <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> presumption are follow the settlements, follow the fortunes, claims control and claims cooperation...|$|R
