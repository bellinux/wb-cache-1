For this purpose, a rope used in a helicopter rescue hoist, subjected to swinging of the recovery hook, present in anomalous working conditions, is considered.

40|$|Mooring {{lines that}} are used on {{floating}} offshore units are subjected to bending at the end termination. Over-bending in some cases may cause the mooring line to suffer damage from fatigue. A countermeasure for this over-bending has been to implement bend stiffeners at the end terminations. National Oilwell Varco procures wire <b>ropes</b> and two <b>bend</b> stiffeners from 3 rd party suppliers. The scope of this thesis is to study {{the effect of these}} bend stiffeners and their impact on the fatigue life of the wire rope mooring lines. Models of spiral wire <b>rope,</b> <b>bend</b> stiffeners and wire sheathing were created in CAD software Inventor™. Finite element analysis was performed using FAE software ANSYS™. The analysis was conducted using two different loads at three different load angles for both types of existing bend stiffeners. The results indicate that the implementation of a bend stiffener has a positive effect on the fatigue life of the wire ropes investigated. However, there is an insignificant difference between the two types of bend stiffeners currently in production. A third type of bend stiffener was designed and FEA analysis was conducted in the same fashion as for the existing bend stiffeners.

40|$|Throughout the world's oceans a {{wide variety}} of {{floating}} plastics are found, among which buoys stand out for their high floatability and diversity and abundance of associated organisms. Between 2001 and 2005, we conducted 25 ship surveys in the Bay System of Coquimbo (BSC), during which we registered 34 detached buoys floating between 1 and 45 km from the coast. The objective {{of this study was to}} infer the possible origin of these buoys, identify the associated biota and characterize their biological traits. Short-term drift experiments (30 min) showed that <b>buoys</b> without <b>rope</b> responded primarily to the velocity and direction of the wind, while <b>buoys</b> with <b>ropes</b> (3 m length) followed surface currents. Using the wind velocity and direction during the 12 h before capture of the detached buoys, we estimated the hypothetical trajectories of these buoys during that time period. Results indicated that most buoys originated from aquaculture facilities in the BSC. A total of 134 different species from 14 phyla was found on 18 anchored (91 species) and 22 detached (116 species) buoys sampled. Community composition was similar among buoys - 54 % of all species were common for anchored and detached buoys - but a higher number of rare species occurred on detached buoys. Buoys do not seem to lose but rather gain organisms after detachment. The most common functional groups on these buoys were mobile species, suspension-feeders and species with sexual reproduction, separate sexes, internal fertilization and direct or very short larval development. Fouling communities on detached buoys were mostly in advanced successional stages, comprising diverse species (including several non-indigenous species) adapted to the conditions at the sea surface. These results suggest that floating buoys may transport associated species over extensive distances, thereby also contributing to the spread of non-indigenous species. © Inter-Research 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Wire ropes {{are one of}} {{the most}} heavily used {{components}} in a dragline. They are subjected to harsh conditions during the regular usage of a dragline in a mining operation. Hoist ropes are subjected to fatigue due to the cyclic nature of load handling as well as due to <b>rope</b> <b>bending</b> over the sheaves and the drum under load. This leads to wire breaks due to fatigue. Accumulation of a number of wire breaks close to each other can have a detrimental effect on the rope. Furthermore, to allow for the increasing demand for higher load capacity coupled with the inconvenience of having very large ropes, the factor of safety is often compromised, which increases the wear rate. Drag ropes are also subjected to heavy loads. More importantly, they are allowed to drag along the rough mine surface subjecting them to external physical abrasion. This makes the life of drag ropes one of the lowest among those used in a dragline. Suspension and IBS ropes are relatively uniformly loaded during their regular usage although they need to withstand dynamic load cycles as well as bending. Hence they tend to last for a number of years on average. The paper analyses the wear types and their severity of each of these rope applications, and suggests methods to determine rope wear rates and the resulting rope life. The paper further gives suggestions for good operating and maintenance practice that can extend the rope life and help reduce the large expenditure associated with every major rope change in a dragline...|$|R
40|$|Spiral strands are {{lightweight}} and flexible structural elements, widely employed {{in many different}} applications, moreover, they are the basic components of stranded wire <b>ropes.</b> <b>Bending</b> behavior {{can play an important}} role in modeling slack cables and in "critical" regions of flexible ropes, such as in the neighborhood of clamping devices. When a strand is bent, wires tend to slip relatively one to each other. In the present work, the critical conditions for the onset of inter-layer sliding are investigated by defining the limit domain for wire slipping (the domain of "admissible values" for the axial force of a generic wire, accounting also for the contribution due to bending of the strand). The special case of uniform bending of the strand is considered and a closed form expression of the limit domain is presented. The non-holonomic nature of the strand mechanical model developed in this work leads to a lacking of symmetry for the tangent stiffness matrix. In the paper it is proved that this condition can be de facto relaxed in practical applications and that an elastic potential function, relating the generalized stress and strain variables of the strand in bending, can be defined only under the limit kinematic hypotheses of "full stick-state" or of "full slip-state". The aforementioned results are used as the starting block from which the strand full mechanical behavior for coupled axial force and bending is derived. Knowledge in closed form of how the limit domain depends upon the strand construction parameters and current stress conditions paves the way to design optimization of the strand...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{fundamental}} study of air-particle flow fields where the experimental parameters are characteristics of coal-fired electricity generating stations. The optical flow field measurement technique Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was adapted to study the particle flow fields and, {{in addition to the}} velocity vector map, particle concentration information was obtained. On phenomenon under investigation was the formation of ropes (high density ribbons of pulverised coal) in a small scale model of the pneumatically driven pulverised fuel transport lines of coal-fired power staions. The main findings of the study were that <b>ropes</b> form in <b>bends</b> and, when in contact with the <b>bend</b> wall, <b>ropes</b> are slowed by frictional forces. After they leave the <b>bend,</b> <b>ropes</b> fall throught he main airflow, maintaining their coherence. If the length of horizontal pipework is sufficiently long, the ropes will form a deposit. The Froude number is the relevant scaling parameter for the deposit's equilibrium position since the dominant influence on this position is the distance, L(f,s), for the rope to slow to zero when it is travelling along the bottom of the duct. The equilibrium position of the deposit, for a given Froude number is dependant upon the air-to-particle ratio: the higher this ratio then the further downstream the deposit. The factors influencing particle jet dispersal were investigated in view of their relevance to the coherence of the ropes. This study is also of relevance to the behavior of coal burner systems where an air-coal mixture is injected into a complex, usually swirling, airflow. The broad conclusions of the experimental results are as follows: 1. For a given particle loading and background velocity, the behavior trends of air-particle jets issued into a background airflow at velocities comparable to the mainstream values are similar to the theoretical description of singlee-phase jets which was derived by Squire and Troucer (1944). These general trends are as follows: (a) As the issuing velocity of the jet increases, its concentration half-width increases. (b) As the issuing veloccity of the jet increases, the rate of decrease of the centre-line velocity decreases, almost linearly with injection velocity. 2. For a given jet velocity, the higher the air-particle loading of the jet, the less the jet disperses and the less rapid the acceleration of the jet. 3. For a given relative velocity ratio between the jet and the background airflow, the higher the background airflow velocity, the more the jet disperses, the greater the rate odd acceleration of the jet and the more uniform the cross-sectional velocity profile...|$|R
40|$|INGINE Inc. {{developed}} its own {{wave energy}} converter (WEC) named INWAVE and has currently installed three prototype modules in Jeju Island, Korea. This device is an on-shore-type WEC that consists of a buoy, pulleys fixed to the sea-floor and a power take off module (PTO). Three ropes are moored tightly {{on the bottom of}} the buoy and connected to the PTO via the pulleys, which are moving back and forth according to the motion of the buoy. Since the device can harness wave energy from all six degrees of movement of the buoy, it is possible to extract energy efficiently even under low energy density conditions provided in the coastal areas. In the PTO module, the ratchet gears convert the reciprocating movement of the rope drum into a uni-directional rotation and determine the transmission of power from the relation of the angular velocities between the rope drum and the generator. In this process, the discontinuity of the power transmission occurs and causes the modeling divergence. Therefore, we introduce the concept of the virtual torsion spring in order to prevent the impact error in the ratchet gear module, thereby completing the PTO modeling. In this paper, we deal with dynamic analysis in the time domain, based on Newtonian mechanics and linear wave theory. We derive the combined dynamics of the buoy and PTO modules via geometric relation between the <b>buoy</b> and mooring <b>ropes,</b> then suggest the ratchet gear mechanism with the virtual torsion spring element to reduce the dynamic errors during the phase transitions.

40|$|With growing {{economies and}} better living {{standards}} {{in many parts}} of the world today, there is a need of expanding the capacity of generating electricity. The alternatives for renewable energy technologies are not fully developed and have still some problems to conquer. The company Minesto has developed a technology that is called Deep Green. It is designed to gain electricity from tidal currents. Deep Green works in a similar way as a kite that is attached to the seafloor with a moving wire. It contains of a wing that moves due to the water current. The path of the movement is circular or a shape of an “ 8 ”. The turbine under the wing is powered by the water flow which in turn leads to generation of electricity by the generator. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the potential of using the Deep Green technology in ocean currents with respect to construction and economy. The site for the investigation is off the east coast of Florida where the Florida current streams with a speed of about 1, 5 m/s close to the surface. The major difference compared to the use in tidal currents is the deep waters of about 300 m and a oneway current direction. A mooring construction was developed and optimized and with the use of carbon fiber <b>ropes,</b> <b>buoys</b> and foundations lets 9 Deep Greens operate between 20 and 79 m depth. The idea is to install 7 such clusters with a total of 63 Deep Greens on the site in Florida. This configuration generates a power of 24 MW and gives a production of 185 GWh/year. Economic accounts were made with support of earlier made calculations regarding a park of 60 Deep Greens in a tidal current application. The results for the clustered configuration in ocean currents indicated a cost of 0, 67 SEK/kWh with a discount rate of 8 %. The required capital for the installation is about 780 mSEK (CAPEX). The operating costs (OPEX) are 43, 3 mSEK. The design seems reasonable in many respects and it operates in a continuous ocean current with good electricity generation. The use of Deep Green in ocean currents speaks for being a profitable application. Though, it will be a large‐scale economic project, mainly because installations in a small scale will not be profitable due to costs such as grid connection. Critical issues to look at in a further development was considered to be surveys of the installation site, the displacement and movements of the mooring, the buoyancy‐system and the installation procedure...|$|R
