This situation {{has led to the}} research and development of new materials with increased performance, such as polymer-modified asphalt (PMA). This study was conducted to investigate the use of epoxidised natural rubber (ENR) mixed with asphalt, both unaged and aged. The physical and rheological properties of <b>base</b> <b>asphalt</b> and ENR-modified asphalt (ENRMAs) were measured. Fundamental parameters were used to describe the significant benefits of ENR as a modifier. However, it was observed that the rheological properties differ considerably between the <b>base</b> <b>asphalt</b> and ENRMAs. The rheological parameters of complex modulus and phase angle indicate that the presence of ENR increases the stiffness and elasticity behaviour of the binder, particularly at high temperatures. For the aged binders, the dynamic mechanical analysis of the effect of ageing on the rheological performance of the binders indicated that there is a considerable difference in behaviour between the <b>base</b> <b>asphalt</b> and PMAs. Based on the dynamic mechanical analysis of the binders, it can be concluded that the asphalt component of the modified binders ages {{in a manner similar to}} that of the <b>base</b> <b>asphalt.</b> However, the rheological changes that occur after ageing differ from the <b>base</b> <b>asphalt</b> in regions where the polymer is the dominant component.

Six asphalt binders were subjected to sinusoidal loading at 30 C- 90 C within the linear viscoelastic limits, and master curves of complex modulus (G) and phase angle (δ) could be constructed {{by means of the}} time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP).

40|$|Increasing the HMA base {{thickness}} and {{modifying the}} HMA mixture properties {{to improve the}} resistance to fatigue cracking {{are among the most}} popular methods for achieving long-lasting pavements. Such methods are based on the idea of reducing the tensile strain {{at the bottom of the}} HMA layer below the Fatigue Endurance Limit (FEL), a level of strain below which no cumulative damage occurs to the HMA mixture. This study investigates the effectiveness of several design strategies involved in long-life, perpetual pavement design. A 3 D Finite Element model of the pavement involving a linear viscoelastic constitutive model for HMA materials and non-uniform tire contact stresses is developed using ABAQUS 6. 11. The effects of <b>asphalt</b> <b>base</b> course thickness and mixture type, rich binder layer, and aggregate subbase layer are examined. Four <b>asphalt</b> <b>base</b> course mixture types, namely dense graded, polymer modified, high modulus, and standard binder, are studied as a function of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>base</b> course thickness. The results underline a better performance of the high-modulus <b>asphalt</b> <b>base,</b> as compared to the other base course mixtures.

40|$|Cold {{recycling}} with emulsified or foamed asphalt {{has been}} widely used in China to convert the existing asphalt surface layer to an <b>asphalt</b> <b>base</b> layer. A new asphalt surface layer between 12 and 18 cm is then paved. Since these semi-rigid pavements were originally built with cement treated base, this reconstruction practice {{has resulted in a}} special pavement structure: cement treated subbase + cold recycled <b>asphalt</b> <b>base</b> + new <b>asphalt</b> surface. This paper reports the long-term performance of such pavement structure on two expressways located in Jiangxi, China. In-situ distress survey and coring were conducted, as well as data collection of traffic and load spectra. Laboratory testing was then carried out on materials collected from the site. Numerical modelling was also conducted to investigate the possible influence from different materials and design options. Results from this study indicated that the main reason of premature failure of this type of pavement structure was the weakening and fatigue of the cold-recycled <b>asphalt</b> <b>base</b> layer. Poor quality control during construction might be the cause since the air voids of the cold-recycled base layer was found to be much higher than the limit. Structural analysis showed that increasing the new asphalt surface layer from 14 cm to 16 cm on top of a 12 cm cold-recycled <b>asphalt</b> <b>base</b> layer could increase the fatigue life and traffic endurance (in terms of equivalent single axle load) 1. 6 - 3. 2 times.

Soybean oil used as an alternative in place of soft and rubbery elastomers polybutadiene derived from crude oil was synthesized to bio-based polymers via chemical synthesis methods reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). In this study, bio-based polymers (PS-PAESO and PS-PAESO-Cl) with different styrene parameters were blended at a dosage of 3 % by weight to a <b>base</b> <b>asphalt</b> binder by the solvent blending approach and three different shear blending methods. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the rheological properties of bio-based polymer modified asphalt blends by conducting dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), rolling thin film oven (RTFO), pressurized aging vessel (PAV), and bending beam rheometer (BBR) based on the Superpave performance graded asphalt binder specifications. The complex modulus (G*), phase angle (δ), mass losses, creep stiffness were determined to evaluate the rheological properties of the modified blends. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the related factors that may influence the test results and to develop statistical modeling for predicting the bio-based polymers with appropriate styrene parameters that would optimize the rheological performance of the modified blends. Results from high temperature performance tests show that the addition of bio-based polymer (PS-PAESO and PS-PAESO-PS) used in this study increase the critical high temperature of the base binder that indicate an improvement on the resistance of rutting at high temperature. The similar results are observed from the master curves and the black diagrams which both exhibit stiffer behavior of the <b>base</b> <b>asphalt</b> at higher temperatures after modification, which indicates a rubber-elastic network establishment within the blends. Whereas, these bio-based polymers do not substantially improve the resistance to low temperature thermal cracking based on the critical low temperature results.

Furthermore, the statistical analysis on laboratory test results show no statistically significant difference between the three shear blending methods used in this study and no statistically significant difference between the polymer synthesis reaction durations.
