They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} effect of shade selection on resin cement’s color stability. Materials and Methods: Ten resin cement samples in dimensions of 10 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness for each group [group 1 : Translucent <b>base</b> <b>and</b> translucent catalyst, group 2 : Bleach XL (B 1) <b>base</b> <b>and</b> yellow (A 3) catalyst, group 3 : White (A 1) <b>base</b> <b>and</b> A 3 catalyst] totally 30 samples were prepared. Color coordinates of each sample were recorded after polymerization and 5000 thermal cycles. Color variation (ΔE) was calculated for each sample and statistical analyses were performed. Results: The lowest ΔE values were obtained for group 1. Group 2 showed higher ΔE values than group 3 however there were no statistical difference. Conclusion: Translucent <b>base</b> <b>and</b> translucent catalyst mixture showed clinically acceptable color stability while B 1 <b>base</b> <b>and</b> A 3 catalyst <b>and</b> A 1 <b>base</b> <b>and</b> A 3 catalyst mixtures did not show clinically acceptable color stability.

5|$|German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian corvids plus {{other species}} {{as far as}} India into a single species, C. coronoides, as he {{believed}} there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather <b>bases</b> <b>and</b> plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official RAOU checklist listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970.
