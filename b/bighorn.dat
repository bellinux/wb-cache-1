5|$|Native herbivores such as {{the moose}} are found in small numbers near waterways, {{especially}} at lower elevations. Moose populations in northwestern Wyoming and other areas of North America {{have been on the}} decline {{since the end of the}} 20th century, possibly due to a parasite. There were an estimated 739 moose in the forest in 2006 which is almost 300 fewer than there were 20 years earlier. Other ungulate species are much more common and there are over 20,000 elk (also known as wapiti) and 40,000 mule deer. <b>Bighorn</b> sheep and mountain goats inhabit the rocky terrain and highest elevations. During the winter, one of the largest <b>bighorn</b> sheep herds in the lower 48 states congregate in the region around Dubois, Wyoming; however, their numbers since 1990 have been diminished due to disease transmitted from contact with domesticated sheep and goats. An estimated 5,000 <b>bighorn</b> sheep are found throughout the forest and a small but stable population of 200 mountain goats reside in the northernmost portions of the forest. Bison and pronghorn antelope are two other ungulates that live on the forest and have sustainable populations.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Marquis urged his daughters, Octavia and Minnie-Ellen, {{to try and}} {{preserve}} his Custer museum collection.

5|$|<b>Bighorn</b> sheep, {{which were}} driven locally extinct through hunting and disease, have been reintroduced {{in the east}} of the park. The Park Service and the Yosemite Fund have also helped {{peregrine}} falcons and great gray owls to re-establish themselves. Tule elk, which had been hunted almost to extinction, were housed in a pen in Yosemite before being moved to the Owens Valley in eastern California.|$|E
5|$|Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), <b>bighorn</b> sheep, {{mountain}} goats, {{and mountain}} lions, while the streams and lakes contain {{several species of}} trout.

The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines, including ponderosa and lodgepole pines, as well as spruces. Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), <b>bighorn</b> sheep, mountain goats, pine marten, and mountain lions, while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.|$|E

30|$|On 2 and 3 December 2011, 20 F and 5 M <b>bighorns</b> were {{captured}} {{in the study area}} via helicopter net-gunning, processed, and released on-site following ASM guidelines (Sikes and Gannon 2011), University of Wyoming Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols (no. 12012011), and WGFD Chapter 33 â€“ 750 permit. Twenty-five refurbished GPS collars (Telonics = 4, ATS = 21) were deployed on these animals to collect location data until they remotely detached in June 2013. This capture included <b>bighorns</b> that were previously collared and released in translocation efforts (n = 16), <b>bighorns</b> not fitted with GPS collars when translocated (n = 4), and <b>bighorns</b> born in the study area (n = 5).|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} hypothesized that Pachycephalosaurus and its relatives were the bipedal equivalents of <b>bighorn</b> sheep or musk oxen, where male individuals would ram each other headlong, {{and that they}} would horizontally straighten their head, neck, and body in order to transmit stress during ramming. However, there have also been alternative suggestions that the pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way.|$|E
5|$|On November 15, 1826, Crittenden married Maria Knox Todd, a widow {{who was the}} {{daughter}} of Judge Harry Innes. Crittenden took Todd's three children as his own, and the couple had two more children: John and Eugene. Todd's daughter Catherine married her stepbrother, Crittenden's son Thomas; their son, John Jordan Crittenden III, was killed at the Battle of the Little <b>Bighorn.</b> Maria Knox Todd Crittenden died on September 8, 1851 of an unknown illness.|$|E

The Smithsonian Institution and The Little <b>Bighorn</b> National Monument museum hold a few other Marquis negatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} Custer's {{soldiers}} committed suicide en masse {{toward the end}} of the Battle of the Little <b>Bighorn</b> has been controversial from the moment it was first suggested, and the discussion continues. The notion was so controversial that Marquis could not find a publisher for Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, his main vehicle for promoting the theory, and the book did not appear in print until 1976, forty years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the finest megafauna wildlife habitat in the lower 48 states.
