5|$|The Glamorgan sausage is a Welsh {{vegetarian}} sausage. It {{contains no}} meat or skin, instead {{it is made}} with cheese, generally Caerphilly, but sometimes cheddar, along with leek or spring onion. This mixture is then coated in breadcrumbs and rolled into a sausage shape <b>before</b> <b>cooking.</b> Glamorgan sausages date back to at least the early 19th century, {{at which point the}} sausages would have contained pork fat.|$|E

25|$|Rice is {{typically}} rinsed <b>before</b> <b>cooking</b> to remove excess starch. Rice {{produced in the}} US is usually fortified with vitamins and minerals, and rinsing {{will result in a}} loss of nutrients. Rice may be rinsed repeatedly until the rinse water is clear to improve the texture and taste.|$|E

25|$|Cooks {{may need}} to learn special cooking {{techniques}} to fry common foods, such as fried eggs or flatbreads like chapatis and tortillas. It {{may not be possible}} to safely or completely cook some thick foods, such as large roasts, loaves of bread, or pots of soup, particularly in small panel cookers; the cook {{may need to}} divide these into smaller portions <b>before</b> <b>cooking.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{device called}} the CrustaStun has been invented to electrocute {{shellfish}} such as lobsters, crabs, and crayfish <b>before</b> <b>cooking.</b> The device works by applying a 110-volt, 2 to 5 amp electrical charge to the animal. The CrustaStun renders the shellfish unconscious in 0.3 seconds and kills the animal in 5 to 10 seconds, compared to 3 minutes {{to kill a}} lobster by boiling.|$|E
25|$|Bacon, or bacon fat, {{is often}} used for barding roast fowl and game birds, {{especially}} those that have little fat themselves. Barding consists of laying rashers of bacon or other fats over a roast; a variation is the traditional method of preparing filet mignon of beef, which is wrapped in rashers of bacon <b>before</b> <b>cooking.</b> The bacon itself may afterwards be discarded or served to eat, like cracklings.|$|E

25|$|In Sri Lanka, {{probably}} the most popular type of roti is pol roti (coconut roti), made of wheat flour, kurakkan flour, or a mixture of both, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chillies and onion {{are added to the}} mixture <b>before</b> <b>cooking.</b> These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of sambol or lunu miris and considered a main meal rather than a supplement.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{became a}} leader in the {{development}} and publication of waffle recipes during the 18th century, introducing coffee waffles, the specific use of Hefeweizen beer yeast, cardamom, nutmeg, and a number of zuickerwaffeln (sugar waffles). At the same time, the French introduced whipped egg whites to waffles, along with lemon zests, Spanish wine, and cloves. Joseph Gillier even published the first chocolate waffle recipe, featuring three ounces of chocolate grated and mixed into the batter, <b>before</b> <b>cooking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most Japanese use suihanki (rice cookers) {{to which}} {{measured}} amounts of washed rice and water are added. The rice is first washed to release excess starch. Then, <b>before</b> <b>cooking</b> {{it is usually}} soaked in water for between half an hour in summer, and two hours in winter. Soaking times also depend on the quality and freshness of the rice. The rice is then boiled using a ratio of about five parts of water to four parts of rice – though with fresher rice, the ratio can go down to 1-to-1. After this, it is steamed until {{the centre of the}} rice becomes soft. Salt is not added to the rice.|$|E

500|$|Bara brith is a fruit loaf {{originating}} from rural Wales, where {{they used a}} mortar and pestle to grind the fresh sweet spices. Historically it was made with yeast and butter, though recently {{it is likely to be}} made with bicarbonate of soda and margarine. The fruit included would be dried raisins, currants and candied peel, which would be soaked in cold tea <b>before</b> <b>cooking.</b> Generally served sliced with butter during afternoon tea, it is often known as Welsh tea bread. Bara Brith translates to [...] "speckled bread", but it is also known as teisen dorth in South Wales, where sultanas are included in the recipe, or as torta negra when Welsh settlers brought it to Argentina.|$|E
500|$|Slippery jacks do {{not keep}} for long after picking, {{nor are they}} {{suitable}} for drying, as their water content is too high. They are suited for frying, or cooking in stews and soups, either alone or with other mushroom species. Puréeing the mushroom is not recommended, however: [...] "We once {{made the mistake of}} running it through a blender to make a soup. The result was a substance recommending itself for use when hanging wallpaper." [...] S.luteus and other Suillus species may cause allergic reactions in some people or digestive problems that appear to result from consuming the slimy skin. The fungus is better cooked before eating, and some authors recommend discarding the glutinous cuticle and tubes <b>before</b> <b>cooking.</b> Moreover, the skin can spoil other fungi with which slippery jacks are collected.|$|E
500|$|Auricularia auricula-judae has a soft, jelly-like texture. Though edible, it was {{not held}} in high culinary regard in the west for many years. It has been likened to [...] "eating an Indian rubber with bones in it", while in 19th-century Britain, {{it was said that}} [...] "it has never been {{regarded}} here as an edible fungus". It has a mild flavour, and is useful for mixed mushroom recipes, but is still considered bland in the west. It can be dried and rehydrated, sometimes swelling to a very large size. Young specimens are best, but the species is not edible when raw, needing to be cooked thoroughly. The whole fruit body can be eaten, but should be thoroughly washed <b>before</b> <b>cooking.</b> Cooking can sometimes take a comparatively long time. The nutritional content of 100g (3.5oz) of dried fungus includes 370kcal, 10.6g of protein, 0.2g of fat, 65g of carbohydrate, 5.8g ash, and 0.03%mg of carotene. Fresh mushrooms contain about 90% moisture. [...] Dried specimens may be ground up into a powder and used to absorb excess liquid in soups and stews, as it rehydrates into tiny fragments.|$|E
50|$|With the {{adequate}} {{combination of}} temperature and cooking time, pathogens, such as bacteria will be killed, and pasteurization can be achieved. Because browning (Maillard reactions) can only occur at higher temperatures (above {{the boiling point}} of water), these moist techniques do not develop the flavors associated with browning.

[...] Historian Ram Sharan Sharma arrived at the same conclusion: [...] "Where, as in the popular hung, drawn and quartered [...] (meaning facetiously, of a person, completely disposed of), drawn follows hanged or hung, it is to be referred to as the disembowelling of the traitor." [...] The historian and author Ian Mortimer disagrees. [...] In an essay published on his website, he writes that the separate mention of evisceration is a relatively modern device, and that while it certainly took place on many occasions, the presumption that drawing means to disembowel is spurious. [...] Instead, drawing (as a method of transportation) may be mentioned after hanging because it was a supplementary part of the execution.|$|E

If the shell is open, the oyster is dead, and cannot be eaten safely. Cooking oysters {{in the shell}} kills the oysters and causes them to open by themselves. Traditionally, oysters that do not open have been assumed to be dead <b>before</b> <b>cooking</b> and {{therefore}} unsafe. However, according {{to at least one}} marine biologist, Nick Ruello, this advice may have arisen from an old, poorly researched cookbook's advice regarding mussels, which has now become an assumed truism for all shellfish.
