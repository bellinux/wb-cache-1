50|$|Water color {{can reveal}} physical, {{chemical}} and bacteriological conditions. In drinking water, green can indicate copper leaching from copper plumbing {{and can also}} represent algae growth. Blue can also indicate copper, or might be caused by syphoning of industrial cleaners in the tank of commodes, commonly known as <b>backflowing.</b> Reds can be signs of rust from iron pipes or airborne bacteria from lakes, etc. Black water can indicate growth of sulfur-reducing bacteria inside a hot water tank set to too low a temperature. This usually has a strong sulfur or rotten egg (H2S) odor and is easily corrected by draining the water heater and increasing the temperature to 49 C or higher. The odor will always be in the hot water pipes if sulfate reducing bacteria are the cause and never in the cold water plumbing. The color spectrum with water indicators is wide and, if learned, can make solving cosmetic, bacteriological and chemical problems easier to identify.|$|E
50|$|One of Wyeth's most {{prominent}} early commission was the Tidal Basin Inlet Bridge connecting East Potomac Park and West Potomac Park. Both parks were formerly {{part of the}} waters of the Potomac River. Beginning in 1881, material dredged from the river was placed in the tidal flats west and south of the city, creating the western half of the National Mall, the Washington Channel, and the Tidal Basin. The Tidal Basin was designed so that fresh water would flow in via its southern strait, and then flush outward into the Washington Channel. In 1907, the United States Army Corps of Engineers decided that gates were needed at the southern inlet to prevent the basin's water from <b>backflowing</b> into the Potomac (thus ensuring a flush into the channel). The Corps decided that a bridge should be built along with the gates, so that the roadway around the Tidal Basin would make a complete circuit. Wyeth was the only architect considered for the bridge job. His employment was approved in early February 1908, and by early April he'd completed the bridge plans. Although his design for a two-tier bridge was only partially implemented (the top tier was removed for budget reasons), work on the bridge was largely complete by June 1909.|$|E

40|$|I {{propose a}} {{scenario}} {{to account for}} the fast polar outflow detected to be blown by Eta Carinae in 2000. The scenario accounts also for the lack of this flow in 1998 and 1999. The scenario is based on the binary nature of Eta Carinae. The collision of the winds blown by the two stars, in particular near periastron passages, slows down about 5 per cent of the wind blown by Eta Carinae, i. e., the massive primary star, such that it stays bound to the system. I assume that most of this mass is accreted back through the equator by Eta Carinae during apastron passage, when its orbital velocity is much lower. The mass accretion rate of this <b>backflowing</b> material may become about 25 per cent of the wind's mass loss rate near apastron passages. If the <b>backflowing</b> matter has enough specific angular momentum it can form an accretion disk and may lead to the formation of a polar collimated fast wind (CFW) on top of the stellar wind.

40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility that a mass of ~ 10 ^{- 5 }- 10 ^{- 3 } Msun flows back from the dense shell of planetary nebulae and is accreted by the central star during the planetary nebula phase. This <b>backflowing</b> mass is expected to have a significant specific angular momentum even in (rare) spherical planetary nebulae, such that a transient accretion disk might be formed. This mass might influence the occurrence and properties of a very late thermal pulse (VLTP), and might even trigger it. For example, the rapidly rotating outer layer, and the disk if still exist, might lead to axisymmetrical mass ejection by the VLTP. Unstable burning of accreted hydrogen might result in a mild flash of the hydrogen shell, also accompanied by axisymmetrical ejection. Comment: Submitted to New Astronom...|$|E

Upon passing the annular shock, the gas quickly expands and enters a <b>backflowing</b> cocoon surrounding the jet. The overall speed of advance of the jet is reduced; matter near the jet axis which passes through the terminal Mach disk accumulates in a plug, and gas is discharged into the cocoon by the intermittent shedding of vortices.

40|$|We present here a phenomenological solid quark star pulsar {{model to}} {{interpret}} the observed thermal X-ray emission of isolated pulsars. The heat capacity for solid quark stars {{was found to be}} quite small, so that the residual internal stellar heat gained at the birth of the star could be dissipated in an extremely short timescale. However, the bombardment induced by <b>backflowing</b> plasma at the poles of solid quark stars would get the stars be reheated, so that long term soft X-ray emission can be sustained. Such a scenario could be used for those X-ray pulsars with significant magnetospheric activities, and their cooling processes would thus be established. Dim X-ray isolated neutron stars (XDINs) as well as compact central objects (CCOs) have been observed with dominant soft X-ray radiation combined with little magnetospheric manifestations. Such sources could be solid quark stars accreting in the propeller regime.

40|$|We derive the {{conditions}} for a backflow toward the central star(s) of circumstellar material to occur during the post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. The <b>backflowing</b> material may be accreted by the post-AGB star and/or its companion, if such exists. Such a backflow may {{play a significant role}} in shaping the descendant planetary nebula, by, among other things, slowing down the post-AGB evolution, and by forming an accretion disk which may blow two jets. We consider three forces acting on a slowly moving mass element: the gravity of the central system, radiation pressure, and fast wind ram pressure. We find that for a significant backflow to occur, a slow dense flow should exsist, such that the relation between the total mass in the slow flow, M, and the solid angle it covers, Omega, is given by (4 *pi*M/Omega) > 0. 1 Mo. The requirement for both high mass loss rate per unit solid angle and a very slow wind, such that it can be decelerated and flow back, probably requires close binary interaction.

40|$|We report two {{different}} types of <b>backflow</b> from jets by performing 2 D special relativistic hydrodynamical simulations. One is anti-parallel and quasi-straight to the main jet (quasi-straight <b>backflow),</b> and the other is bent path of the <b>backflow</b> (bent <b>backflow).</b> We find that the former appears when the head advance speed is comparable to or higher than the local sound speed at the hotspot while the latter appears when the head advance speed is slower than the sound speed bat the hotspot. Bent <b>backflow</b> collides with the unshocked jet and laterally squeezes the jet. At the same time, a pair of new oblique shocks are formed {{at the tip of the}} jet and new bent fast <b>backflows</b> are generated via these oblique shocks. The hysteresis of <b>backflow</b> collisions is thus imprinted in the jet as a node and anti-node structure. This process also promotes broadening of the jet cross sectional area and it also causes a decrease in the head advance velocity. This hydrodynamic process may be tested by observations of compact young jets. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{framework}} for understanding how justice-related claims {{play a role in}} the dynamics of controversy in energy projects. We do so by distinguishing two interacting trajectories of assessment: a formal trajectory that is embedded in the legal system and an informal trajectory that is mainly embedded in public discourse. The emergence of an informal assessment trajectory can be seen as a response to a (perceived) lack of attention to particular concerns or values in the formal trajectory, i. e. '. overflowing'. The emerging informal assessment may subsequently lead to adaptations in the formal trajectory, which we refer to as '. backflowing'. Based on insights from case studies on Dutch energy projects and literature on energy justice we identify three justice-related attributes that facilitate understanding of the emergence of controversies. These attributes are based on differences between the two trajectories in terms of 1) the way in which values are expressed, 2) the dimension of energy justice that is taken as a starting point, and 3) the democratic legitimization of assessment trajectories. In order to allow for legitimate and effective energy policy, overflowing and <b>backflowing</b> need to be addressed as interrelated rather than as separate processes. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} suprathermal particles, termed pick-up ions (PUIs), might reduce the postshock {{temperature}} of the fast wind and jets in some planetary nebulae (PNs) and in symbiotic systems. The goal is to explain {{the finding that the}} {{temperature of the}} hot bubble formed by the post-shock gas in some PNs and symbiotic nebulae is lower, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude, than the value expected from simple hydrodynamical calculations. Although various explanations have been proposed, there is as yet no prefered solution for this low tempeature problem. PUIs have been invoked to explain the low temperature behind the termination shock of the solar wind. While {{in the case of the}} solar wind the neutral atoms that turn into PUIs penetrate the pre-shock solar wind region from the interstellar medium (ISM), in PNs the PUI source is more likely slowly moving clumps embedded in the fast wind or jets. These clumps are formed by instabilities or from <b>backflowing</b> cold gas. Our estimates indicate that in young PNs these PUIs will thermalize before leaving the system. Only in older PNs whose sizes exceed ~ 5000 AU and for which the fast-wind mass loss rate is below ~ 10 ^{- 7 } Mo/yr do we expect the PUIs to be an efficient carrier of energy out of the postshock region (the hot bubble).

40|$|Relativistic jets in Galactic superluminals and extragalactic AGN may be {{surrounded}} by a wind near to the central engine. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation reveal considerable stabilization of relativistic jet flow by a wind to helical and higher order asymmetric modes of jet distortion. When velocities are measured in the source (inlet) frame, reduction in the absolute velocity difference between jet and wind, ∆v = vjet − vwnd, provides stabilization in addition to stabilization provided by a high jet Lorentz factor, but a high Lorentz factor wind is not needed to stabilize a high Lorentz factor jet. However, the fundamental pinch mode is not similarly affected and knots with spacing a few times the jet radius are anticipated to develop in such flows. Thus, we identify a mechanism that can suppress large scale asymmetric structures while allowing axisymmetric structures to develop. Relativistic jets surrounded by outflowing winds will be more stable than if surrounded by a stationary or <b>backflowing</b> external medium. Knotty structures along a straight jet like that in 3 C 175 could be triggered by pinching of an initially low Mach number jet surrounded by a suitable wind. As the jet enters the radio lobe, suppression of any surrounding outflow or backflow associated with the high pressure lobe triggers exponential growth of helical twisting.

40|$|We {{simulate}} {{and study}} the microphysics of combustion (flame burning) of two flavored quark matter (u, d) to three flavoured quark matter (u,d,s) in a trapped neutrino regime applicable to conditions prevailing in a hot proto-neutron star. The reaction-diffusion-advection equations for (u,d) to (u,d,s) combustion are coupled with neutrino transport, which is modelled through a flux-limited diffusion scheme. The flame speed is proportional to initial lepton fraction because of the release of electron chemical potential as heat, and reaches a steady-state burning speed of (0. 001 - 0. 008) c. We find that the burning speed is ultimately driven by the neutrino pressure gradient, given that the pressure gradient induced by quarks is opposed by the pressure gradients induced by electrons. This suggests, somewhat counter-intuitively, that the pressure gradients that drive the interface are controlled primarily by leptonic weak decays {{rather than by the}} quark Equation of State (EOS). In other words, the effects of the leptonic weak interaction, including the corresponding weak decay rates and the EOS of electrons and neutrinos, are at least as important as the uncertainties related to the EOS of high density matter. We find that for baryon number densities nB <= 0. 35 fm- 3, strong pressure gradients induced by leptonic weak decays drastically slow down the burning speed, which is thereafter controlled by the much slower burning process driven by <b>backflowing</b> downstream matter. We discuss the implications of our findings to proto-neutron stars. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures. Article updated to reflect the published version of Physics Letters...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} approximate axisymmetric computations of the dynamical {{evolution of}} material inside radio lobes and X-ray cluster gas cavities in Fanaroff-Riley II {{sources such as}} Cygnus A. All energy is delivered by a jet to the lobe/cavity via a moving hotspot where jet energy dissipates in a reverse shock. Our calculations describe the evolution of hot plasma, cosmic rays (CRs) and toroidal magnetic fields flowing from the hotspot into the cavity. Many observed features are explained. Gas, CRs and field flow back along the cavity surface in a "boundary backflow" consistent with detailed FRII observations. Computed ages of <b>backflowing</b> CRs are consistent with observed radio-synchrotron age variations only if shear instabilities in the boundary backflow are damped and we assume this is done with viscosity of unknown origin. Magnetic fields estimated from synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) X-radiation observed near the hotspot evolve into radio lobe fields. Computed profiles of radio synchrotron lobe emission perpendicular to the jet are dramatically limb-brightened in excellent agreement with FRII observations although computed lobe fields exceed those observed. Strong winds flowing from hotspots naturally create kpc-sized spatial offsets between hotspot inverse Compton (IC-CMB) X-ray emission and radio synchrotron emission that peaks 1 - 2 kpc ahead where the field increases due to wind compression. In our computed version of Cygnus A, nonthermal X-ray emission increases from the hotspot (some IC-CMB, mostly SSC) toward the offset radio synchrotron peak (mostly SSC). A faint thermal jet along the symmetry axis {{may be responsible for}} redirecting the Cygnus A non-thermal jet. Comment: 24 pages, 10 figures, accepted by Ap...|$|E
