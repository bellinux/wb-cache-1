40|$|Formulas for the {{asymptotic}} <b>biases</b> <b>of</b> the estimators of {{the normal}} theory standard errors in factor analysis are given with and without the assumption of multivariate normality for observed variables. The biases are derived from the asymptotic variances of standard error estimators and the asymptotic <b>biases</b> <b>of</b> the estimated variances of parameter estimators. The latter biases are derived from the asymptotic variances/covariances and asymptotic <b>biases</b> <b>of</b> the parameter estimators. The formulas cover the cases for unstandardized and standardized variables. Numerical examples using factor analysis models show {{the accuracy of the}} formulas.

Excessive transfer of affective value to instrumental action is thought to contribute to psychiatric disorders. The brain region most commonly implicated in overriding such affective <b>biasing</b> <b>of</b> instrumental action is the prefrontal cortex. ObjectiveThe aim {{of the present study}} was to reduce affective <b>biasing</b> <b>of</b> instrumental action using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in young healthy human volunteers. MethodsIn a double-blind, randomized between-group design, 120 participants received anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS while at the same time (online) performing a task that assessed affective <b>biasing</b> <b>of</b> instrumental action. We placed tDCS electrodes over the anterior part of the prefrontal cortex based on evidence from brain stimulation work demonstrating the role of this brain region in controlling affective <b>biasing</b> <b>of</b> instrumental action. ResultsWe showed that prefrontal tDCS reduced affective <b>biasing</b> <b>of</b> instrumental action. Specifically, prefrontal tDCS reduced the degree to which aversive (versus appetitive) cues potentiated instrumental avoidance and suppressed instrumental approach. Contrary to our hypothesis, this effect was seen for cathodal tDCS rather than anodal tDCS. ConclusionThe results demonstrate the potential utility of prefrontal tDCS as a tool for reducing affective <b>biasing</b> <b>of</b> instrumental behavior, thus opening avenues for interventional research on psychiatric disorders that implicate excessive transfer of affective value...|$|R

5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} cyclones {{that formed}} {{on the open}} sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910.

5|$|After {{discussing}} Supreme Court precedent, Heins {{recounts the}} jury verdict which decided against her client by ruling that Richardson's firing was not illegal. Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; {{it found that}} Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury also determined that the administration did not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects the <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> individual jurors rather than {{an interpretation of the}} law as applied to Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they felt that it was the duty of employees (such as Richardson) respect their superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as {{dean of the school of}} theology.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preliminary}} hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house {{and spent most of}} his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of water and electricity at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> the witnesses against him.|$|E

5|$|Often in {{part because}} of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse {{population}} between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect. Christopher Landsea et al. estimated an undercount <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E
5|$|The 1859 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured seven hurricanes, the most recorded during an Atlantic {{hurricane season}} until 1870. However, {{in the absence}} of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated. Of the eight known 1859 cyclones, five were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez-PartagÃ¡s and Henry Diaz, which was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for hurricane data such as track and intensity, although due to sparse records, listings on some storms are incomplete.|$|E
5|$|The 1862 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured six tropical cyclones, {{with only one}} making landfall. The season had three tropical storms and three hurricanes, none of which became major hurricanes. However, {{in the absence of}} modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated. Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz initially documented five tropical cyclones in a 1995 report on this season. A sixth system was added by Michael Chenoweth in 2003 from records taken in ColÃ³n, Panama.|$|E

5|$|The 1863 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured five landfalling tropical cyclones.

An undercount <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated. There were seven recorded hurricanes and no major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the modern day Saffirâ€“Simpson scale. Of the known 1863 cyclones, seven were first documented in 1995 by JosÃ© FernÃ¡ndez-PartagÃ¡s and Henry Diaz, while the ninth tropical storm was first documented in 2003. These changes were largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some adjustments.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, {{the type and}} extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> the treating surgeonâ€”entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E
5|$|The final {{storm was}} last noted on October17. These dates {{fall within the}} period with the most {{tropical}} cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Only two tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously. The hurricane brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica, resulting in eight deaths. This storm also left damage to crops and vessels in portions of the Bahamas and Cuba. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive. An undercount <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated.|$|E

5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to the time the signal from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that the signal is sent from the ground station begins the time slot. The burst timing offset (BTO) is the time difference between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for the ground station's signal then aircraft's response) from the ground station to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving the signal and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time the signal arrives at the ground station and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; the ground station bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to the ground station can be calculated, while the combined <b>bias</b> <b>of</b> the SDU and ground station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while it was on the ground at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E
