50|$|The laurel {{forests of}} the region are known as the Laurisilva Misionera, after Argentina's Misiones Province. The Araucaria moist forests occupy {{a portion of the}} {{highlands}} of southern Brazil, extending into northeastern Argentina. The forest canopy includes species of Lauraceae (Ocotea pretiosa and O. catharinense), Myrtaceae (Campomanesia xanthocarpa), and Leguminosae (Parapiptadenia rigida), with an emergent layer of the conifer <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Araucaria</b> (Araucaria angustifolia) reaching up to 45 m in height. The subtropical Serra do Mar coastal forests along the southern coast of Brazil have a tree canopy of Lauraceae and Myrtaceae, with emergent trees of Leguminaceae, and a rich diversity of bromeliads and trees and shrubs of family Melastomaceae. The inland Alto Paraná Atlantic forests, which occupy portions of the Brazilian Highlands in southern Brazil and adjacent parts of Argentina and Paraguay, are semi-deciduous.|$|E

50|$|The {{central part}} of the state is home to the Araucaria moist forests, {{dominated}} by emergent <b>Brazilian</b> pines (<b>Araucaria</b> angustifolia). The drainage of the plateau is westward to the Paraná River, the rivers being tributaries of the Iguaçu, which forms its northern boundary, and of the Uruguay River, which forms its southern boundary. The semi-deciduous Paraná-Paraíba interior forests occupy the westernmost valleys of the Iguaçu and Uruguay rivers.|$|R
40|$|Evidence of phylogenetic {{conservatism}} {{in plant}} ecological traits has accumulated {{over the past}} few years, suggesting an interplay between the distribution of phylogenetic clades and major environmental gradients. Nonetheless, determining what environmental factors underlie the distribution of phylogenetic lineages remains a challenge because environmen-tal factors are correlated with spatial gradients where the latter might indicate some degree of dispersal limitation in phylogenetic pools. We analyzed the phylogenetic structure of plant assemblages across the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Araucaria</b> forests and assessed how phylogenetic structure responds to environmental and spatial gradients. We compiled data on plant occurrence in 45 plots across the Araucaria forest biome. The phylogenetic structure of the plots was characterized using phylogenetic fuzzy-weighting followed by principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure (PCPS). We used distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) to analyze the relationships between phylogenetic clades and environmental and spatial factors. Variation partitioning showed that the phylogenetic structure of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Araucaria</b> forests was better explained by environment factors (altitude and annual mean temperature) than by space. Yet, spatially-structured environmental variation explained about one-third of total variation in the phylogenetic structure. Thus, the influence of spatial filters on the phylogenetic structure was more related to environmental gradients across the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Araucaria</b> forest biome than to dispersal limitation of phylogenetic lineages. Furthermore, the influence of explanatory factors on the phylogenetic structure was concentrated in few nodes, the one splitting tree ferns from seed plants, and a second splitting malvids fro...|$|E

Em geral, considera-se que h?? uma forte rela????o entre a produ????o de sementes (pinh??es) pela Araucaria angustifolia e a abund??ncia desses animais. Isso devido ao alto conte??do energ??tico dos pinh??es e alta produ????o dessas sementes, concentrada principalmente nos meses de inverno, quando h?? um decr??scimo na disponibilidade de outros recursos tr??ficos. No presente estudo, avaliei a import??ncia da A. angustifolia na dieta de pequenos roedores silvestres em ??rea de Floresta com Arauc??ria (Esta????o Ecol??gica de Aracuri-Esmeralda, no munic??pio de Muitos Cap??es, RS, Brasil). Realizei sete s??ries mensais ou bimestrais de captura de pequenos roedores (sete noites de captura por s??rie), de outubro/ 2008 a julho/ 2009, representando per??odos sem (out/ 08 a fev/ 09) e com (abr a jul/ 09) o recurso pinh??o dispon??vel na floresta.

It is suggested {{that there is a}} strong relation between seed production of the araucaria ???pine&# 8223; Araucaria angustifolia and small-rodent abundance. Such relation would be due to the high energetic content of this conifer&# 8223;s seeds (known as ???pinh??es&# 8223;) and also high seed production. Such production is concentrated during autumn and winter months, when there is reduction in overall resource availability. In the present study I evaluated the importance of A. angustifolia in the diet of wild small rodents in an area of Araucaria Forest in southern Brazil (Ecological Station of Aracuri-Esmeralda, Muitos Cap??es, RS, Brazil).

The {{effects of}} MC on longitudinal, radial, and {{tangential}} ultrasonic wave velocity {{and on the}} respective terms of the stiffness matrix were examined for <b>Brazilian</b> pine (<b>Araucaria</b> angustifolia) and cupiúba (Goupia glabra). The ultrasonic wave velocity tended to increase with a decrease in MC, {{and the effect of}} MC on the ultrasonic wave velocity below the FSP was greater than above. Below the FSP, the stiffness terms tended to decrease with increasing MC, but above the FSP, they increased with increasing MC because of the influence of water on the bulk density. This result may be corrected by using the effective density above FSP, which depends on the mobility of free water and differs for the two species...|$|R

50|$|Several {{ecoregions}} cover {{portions of}} the state. In the northeastern corner of the state, between the Serra do Mar/Serra Geral and the Atlantic, lies the southern extension of the Serra do Mar coastal forests, a belt of evergreen tropical moist forests that extend north along the coastal strip as far as Rio de Janeiro state. The high plateau behind the Serra do Mar is occupied by the Araucaria moist forests, a subtropical forests characterized by evergreen, laurel-leaved forests interspersed with emergent <b>Brazilian</b> Pines (<b>Araucaria</b> angustifolia). The Paraná-Paraíba interior forests lie on the lower slopes of the plateau south and east of the Araucaria forests, including much of the lower basin of the Jacuí and its tributaries. These forests are semi-deciduous, with many trees losing their leaves in the winter dry season. The Atlantic Coast restingas, distinctive forests which grow on nutrient-poor coastal dunes, extend along the coast, {{as far as the}} Uruguayan border.|$|R

Using a predicted protein sequence database that was derived from A. angusafolia RNA-Seq data, 2398 non-redundant proteins were identified. The log(2) of the spectral count values of 858 proteins of these proteins showed a normal distribution, and were used for statistical analysis. Statistical tests indicated that 106 proteins were significantly differentially abundant between the two EC lines, and that 35 were more abundant in the responsive genotype (EC line SE 1) and 71 were more abundant in the blocked genotype (EC line SE 6). An increase in the abundance of proteins related to cell defense, anti-oxidative stress responses, and storage reserve deposition was observed in SEL Moreover, in SE 6 we observed an increased abundance of two proteins associated with seed development during the embryogenic cell proliferation stage, which we suggest is associated with genotypes showing a low responsiveness to embryo formation. Differences in protein abundance between the EC lines are discussed in terms of carbohydrate metabolism, cell division, defense response, gene expression, and response to reactive oxygen species.

40|$|Chaotic {{dynamical}} {{systems with}} two or more attractors lying on invariant subspaces may, provided certain mathematical conditions are fulfilled, exhibit intermingled basins of attraction: Each basin is riddled with holes belonging to basins of the other attractors. In order to investigate the occurrence of such phenomenon in dynamical systems of ecological interest (two-species competition with extinction) we have characterized quantitatively the intermingled basins using periodic-orbit theory and scaling laws. The latter results agree with a theoretical prediction from a stochastic model, and also with an exact result for the scaling exponent we derived for the specific class of models investigated. We discuss {{the consequences of the}} scaling laws in terms of the predictability of a final state (extinction of either species) in an ecological experiment.

40|$|<b>Brazilian</b> pine (<b>Araucaria</b> angustifolia (Bert) O. Ktze) is {{the only}} native conifer species with {{economic}} importance in Brazil. Recently, due to intensive exploitation Brazilian pine {{was included in the}} official list of endangered Brazilian plants, under the "vulnerable" category. Biotechnology tools like somatic embryogenesis (SE) are potentially useful for mass clonal propagation and ex situ conservation strategies of commercial and endangered plant species. In spite of that, numerous obstacles still hamper the full application of SE technology for a wider range of species, including Brazilian pine. To enhance somatic embryogenesis in Brazilian pine and {{to gain a better understanding}} of the molecular events associated with somatic embryo development, we analyzed the steady-state transcript levels of genes known to regulate somatic embryogenesis using semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (sqRT-PCR). These genes included Argonaute (AaAGO), Cup-shaped cotyledon 1 (AaCUC), wushel-related WOX (AaWOX), a S-locus lectin protein kinase (AaLecK), Scarecrow- like (AaSCR), Vicilin 7 S (AaVIC), Leafy Cotyledon 1 (AaLEC), and a Reversible glycosylated polypeptide (AaRGP). Expression patterns of these selected genes were investigated in embryogenic cultures undergoing different stages of embryogenesis, and all the way to maturation. Up-regulation of AaAGO, AaCUC, AaWOX, AaLecK, and AaVIC was observed during transition of somatic embryos from stage I to stage II. During the maintenance phase of somatic embryogenesis, expression of AaAGO and AaSCR, but not AaRPG and AaLEC genes was influenced by presence/ absence of plant growth regulators, both auxins and cytokinins. The results presented here provide new insights on the molecular mechanisms responsible for somatic embryo formation, and how selected genes may be used as molecular markers for Brazilian pine embryogenesis.

40|$|<b>Brazilian</b> pine or <b>araucaria</b> (Araucaria angustifolia) is a {{coniferous}} tree with great economic, {{social and environmental}} importance in southern Brazil, being exploited for both wood production and for its edible pine nuts. However, no efficient cloning techniques are available and, therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vegetative rescue methods for cuttings propagation of the species. Shoots/cuttings were generated in two ways: 26 years old trees underwent coppicing and 20 years old trees had the primary branches on the upper third of crown pruned at 2, 20 and 50 cm from the main trunk. Orthotropic shoots were rooted after application of indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) at 0, 2, 4 and 6 g. L- 1. Coppicing produced 47 cuttings per plant with 90 % orthotropic shoots, while pruning resulted in 182 cuttings per plant with 44 % orthotropic shoots. Rooting success indexes were low with no influence of IBA, although they are slightly superior to the ones available in the literature for the species, ranging from 12 to 30 % for the coppice shoots and from 0 to 28 % for the branches shoots. We conclude that both vegetative rescue techniques are viable and have potentially important applications. Coppicing is recommended for the propagation aiming the production of wood, while shoots derived from the side branches of the crown are more appropriate for seeds orchards formation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Araucaria</b> angustifolia (<b>Brazilian</b> Pine or <b>Araucaria)</b> is a {{potential}} native species to Brazilian forestry. However, a number of challenges and technical restraints still persist, making difficult its expansion as a species for forest plantations, among which the lack of cloning technologies evaluation in field conditions. So the present study aimed to evaluate the potential use of Araucaria plants produced by cuttings and grafting for wood production in comparison to those produced by seeds, by assessing field vigor and establishing a form factor for plantations with equivalent age. Plants from cuttings and seeds were planted in a 3 x 3 m spacing, {{being part of the}} last intended to be rootstocks for grafting. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three treatments and plots of a plant (one tree plot). Plants from cuttings had higher growth in diameter at breast height (7. 4 ± 2. 41 cm) and total height (4. 2 ± 1. 08 m) at 74 months after planting, followed by grafted plants and from seeds, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings and grafting are potential techniques for Araucaria plants formation for wood production, and, in particular, grafting is recommended by the easiness of in its application, besides the fact that it can be used for seed orchards formation and presents volumetric increase and form factor similar to seedlings...|$|R
40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} is {{an important}} biotechnological tool in the large-scale propagation of elite genotypes and ex situ conservation of conifer species. Protocols for the induction and proliferation of embryogenic cultures (ECs) of <b>Brazilian</b> pine (<b>Araucaria</b> angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze) are well established, although the proper formation of mature somatic embryos (SEs) is still problematic. Thus, the identification of molecular markers for the screening of ECs {{able to respond to}} maturation conditions (abscisic acid and osmotic agents) is highly desirable. To develop molecular markers for the early detection of ECs able to develop well-formed SEs under maturation conditions, we analyzed the proteins found during the proliferation phase of A. angustifolia cell lines with different embryogenic capabilities, with one cell line being responsive to maturation conditions (R cell line), and one cell line that presented blocked development of SEs (B cell line). In addition, based on the peptides identified, polyamine levels (free and conjugate), ethylene production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission were analyzed using both EC lines (R and B cell lines). A marked difference in the biochemistry of ECs between these two cell lines was observed. Eleven proteins that were differentially expressed in the cell lines were identified by the combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Among these, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, the enzyme associated with polyamines and ethylene biosynthesis, was observed exclusively in the R cell line, while a protein linked to the oxidative stress subunit F of NADH dehydrogenase was observed exclusively in the B cell lines. Additionally, B cell lines showed higher levels of diamine putrescine and lower levels of ethylene. Higher values of ethylene and ROS were observed for the cell line that showed normal development of SEs. Altogether, our results open new perspectives in the optimization of culture conditions for A. angustifolia somatic embryogenesis, as well as establishing biochemical markers for the early selection of ECs during maturation trials.

This copolymer was proposed due to its D-A characteristic produced {{by the presence of}} the electron-donating methoxy moiety and the electron-withdrawing dicyano moiety. the copolymer was electrochemically synthetized by cathodic reduction of the convenient starting materials dissolved in a DMF/LiClO 4 using a mercury pool acting as working electrode. the copolymer was characterized by infrared (IR), UV-Vis and fluorescence (FL) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (CV). All the results were compared to the MB-PPV homopolymer. the analysis of electrochemical measurements and IR indicated that the cop-MB-PPV/DCN-PPV was obtained through the formation of blocks containing DCN-PPV units linked by blocks containing MB-PPV units. the electronic structure, performed by CV, UV-Vis and FL showed that the conduction band is more stabilized in the copolymer than in homopolymer. Furthermore, the FL spectra indicated that the light emission of the cop-MB-PPV/DCN-PPV in chloroform solution occurs by means of excimer formation.
