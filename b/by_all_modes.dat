In ADS, an aircraft determines {{its position on}} board by using satellite navigational data from a system such as the Global Positioning System (GPS).

40|$|In this paper, an ElectroMagnetic-Power-based Characteristic Mode Theory (CMT) for PEC systems (PEC-EMP-CMT) is built. The PEC-EMP-CMT {{is valid}} for the PEC systems which are {{surrounded}} by any electromagnetic environment, and it can construct the complex characteristic currents and non-radiative Characteristic Modes (CMs). In this paper, some traditional concepts, such as the system input impedance and modal input impedance etc., are redefined; the traditional characteristic quantity, Modal Significance (MS), is generalized; a series of new power-based CM sets are introduced. It is proven in this paper that various power-based CM sets of a certain objective PEC structure are independent of the external environment and excitation; the non-radiative space constituted <b>by</b> <b>all</b> non-radiative <b>modes</b> {{is identical to the}} interior resonance space constituted <b>by</b> <b>all</b> interior resonant <b>modes</b> of closed PEC structures, and the non-radiative CMs constitute a basis of the space.

Purified quiescent human blood T lymphocytes were subjected to: (i) acute exposure to hydrogen peroxide; (ii) chronic exposure to hydrogen peroxide; and (iii) acute exposure to ionizing radiation. The cells were then stimulated for 6 h. DNA-binding activities (determined by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay) of three transcription factors: NFÎºB, AP- 1 and NFAT, were abolished in the lymphocytes <b>by</b> <b>all</b> three <b>modes</b> of {{oxidative stress}}.

Terrorist explosive, triacetone triperoxide (TATP), difficult to detect by IMS in E-mode, was detected in N-mode (for narcotics). Three modes of sample introduction to IMS vapor desorption unit were used: (i) placement of hair directly into the unit, (ii) swabbing of hair and placement of swabs (i. e., paper GE-IMS sample traps) into the unit, and (iii) aceto-nitrile extracts of hair positioned on sample traps and placed into the unit.
