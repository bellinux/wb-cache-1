50|$|The <b>braided</b> <b>sheath</b> has a {{high number}} of {{interwoven}} strands for its size, giving it a relatively smooth texture. The all-nylon construction makes paracord fairly elastic.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{corrugated}} hoses can {{be manufactured}} {{by a special}} method that {{is closely related to}} the manufacture of stripwound hoses. In this procedure, the starting strip is given a corrugated profile in a longitudinal direction. This profile strip is then wound helically and the overlapping coils are tightly welded along the helical seam. After corrugation, the hose may be equipped with a <b>braided</b> <b>sheath</b> (see below). In this case, the hose then passes through a braiding machine that has circumferential wire coil holders, or so-called bobbins.|$|E
40|$|A {{high-temperature}} hybrid seal {{is constructed}} of multiple elements {{to meet the}} many demands placed on the seal. The primary elements are: a central high-temperature bellows, a <b>braided</b> ceramic <b>sheath</b> covering the bellows, an outer abrasion resistant sheath covering the ceramic sheath, and a structurally-sound seal-end termination...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to test the claims by Rex L. Schlicher, et al., (Patent 5, 142, 86 1) that a certain antenna geometry produces thrust greatly exceeding radiation reaction, when driven by repetitive, fast rise, and relatively slower decay current pulses. In order to test this hypothesis, the antenna was suspended by strings as a 3 in pendulum. Current pulses were fed to the antenna along the suspension path by a very flexible coaxial line constructed from loudspeaker cable and copper <b>braid</b> <b>sheath.</b> When driving the antenna via this cabling, our pulser was capable of sustaining 1200 A pulses {{at a rate of}} 30 per second up to a minute. In this way, bursts of pulses could be delivered in synch with the pendulum period in order to build up any motion. However, when using a laser beam passing through a lens attached to the antenna to amplify linear displacement by a factor of at least 25, no correlated motion of the beam spot could be detected on a distant wall. We conclude, in agreement with the momentum theorem of classical electromagnetic theory, that any thrust produced is far below practically useful levels. Hence, within classical electrodynamics, there is little hope of detecting any low level motion that cannot be explained by interactions with surrounding structural steel and the Earth's magnetic field...|$|R
50|$|Kernmantle rope has a core (kern) of long twisted fibres in the center, with a <b>braided</b> outer <b>sheath</b> or {{mantle of}} woven fibres. The kern {{provides}} {{most of the}} strength (about 70%), while the mantle protects the kern and determines the handling properties of the rope (how {{easy it is to}} hold, to tie knots in, and so on). In dynamic climbing line, core fibres are usually twisted, and chopped into shorter lengths, which makes the rope more elastic. Static kernmantle ropes are made with untwisted core fibres and tighter braid, which causes them to be stiffer in addition to limiting the stretch.|$|R
40|$|A {{resilient}} {{braided rope}} seal {{for use in}} high temperature applications includes a center core of fibers. a resilient canted spring member supporting the core {{and at least one}} layer of <b>braided</b> <b>sheath</b> fibers tightly packed together overlying the spring member. The seal provides both improved load bearing and resiliency. Permanent set and hysteresis are greatly reduced...|$|E

Cable typically elongates to 90 {{percent of its}} potential, but is surrounded by <b>braided</b> <b>sheath</b> to absorb remaining energy should it break prematurely. Applications of arrester include passenger restraint in air and land vehicles, parachute risers, and ground snatch by aircraft. Possible cable material is type 302 stainless steel...|$|E

The resilient braided rope seal includes a center core of fibers, a resilient 5 member overbraided {{by at least one}} layer of <b>braided</b> <b>sheath</b> fibers tightly packed together. The resilient member adds significant stiffness to the seal while maintaining resiliency. Furthermore, the seal permanent set and hysteresis are greatly reduced. Finally, improved load capabilities are provided...|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in hose construction. Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner hose wrapped in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer <b>sheath,</b> <b>braided</b> stainless steel hoses typically consist of a Teflon® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner hose wrapped in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner hose wrapped in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|R
40|$|Future {{turbine engines}} and {{industrial}} systems will be operating at increased temperatures to achieve more demanding efficiency and performance goals. In the highest temperature {{sections of the}} engine new material systems such as ceramics and intermetallics are being considered to withstand the harsh thermal environment. Components constructed of these low expansion-rate materials experience thermal strains and a resulting reduction of life when rigidly attached to high expansion-rate, superalloy support structures. Seals are being designed to both seal and to serve as compliant mounts allowing for relative thermal growths between high temperature but brittle primary structures and the surrounding support structures. Previous seal research yielded several braided rope seal designs which demonstrated the ability to both seal {{and serve as a}} compliant mount. The hybrid seal was constructed of an all-ceramic (alumina-silica) core overbraided with a superalloy wire sheath (cobalt based superalloy). The all ceramic seal was constructed of an all-ceramic (alumina-silica) core overbraided with multiple ceramic (alumina-silica) sheath layers. Program goals for braided rope seals are to improve flow resistance and/or seal resilience. To that end, the current report studies the test results of: baseline and modified hybrid seals; two stage hybrid and two stage all-ceramic seal configurations; and single stage hybrid and single stage all-ceramic seal configurations for a range of seal crush conditions. Hybrid seal modifications include increasing the <b>sheath</b> <b>braid</b> angle and core coverage. For the same percent seal cross-sectional crush, results show that increasing the hybrid seal braid angle increased seal stiffness and seal unit load, resulting in flows approximately one third of the baseline hybrid seal flows. For both hybrid and all-ceramic seals, two stage seal configurations significantly outperformed single stage configurations. Two stage seal flows were at least 30 % less than the single stage seal flows for the same seal crush. Furthermore, test results of single stage seals indicate that for both all-ceramic and hybrid seals, a specific seal crush condition exists at which minimum flows are achieved (i. e. increasing seal crush beyond a certain point does not result in better flow performance). Flow results are presented for a range of pressures and temperatures from ambient to 1300 F, before and after scrubbing. Compression tests results show that for both all-ceramic and hybrid seals, seal preload and stiffness increase with seal crush, but residual seal interference remains constant...|$|R
40|$|In {{orthopaedic}} surgery the reattachment of tendon to bone requires suture materials that have stable and durable properties to allow healing at the tendon-bone interface. Failure rates {{of this type}} of surgery can be as high as 25 %. While the tissue suture interface is a weak link, proportions of these failures are caused by in-vivo abrasion of the suture with bone and suture anchor materials. Abrasion of the suture material results from the movement of the suture through the eyelet by the surgeon during surgery, or with limb movement after surgery as the suture is not rigidly restrained within the eyelet. During movement the suture is subjected to bending and frictional forces that can lead to fatigue induced failure. This paper investigates the mechanism of bending abrasion fatigue induced failure of number two grade <b>braided</b> <b>sheath</b> only and braided sheath/multifilament core sutures. Sutures were oscillated over a stainless steel wire at low frequency under load in a dry state to simulate the bending and frictional forces between suture and eyelet. Failure mechanism was determined by video microscopy of the suture during abrasion combined with optical microscopy analysis of partially and fully abraded sutures. Braided only structures had high friction loading on the small number of fibres at the abrasion interface. This caused rapid single fibre breakages that accumulate to cause suture failure. The addition of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene core fibres to a braided suture distributed the applied load across multiple fibres at the abrasion interface. This improved abrasion resistance by 15 - 20 times that of <b>braided</b> <b>sheath</b> alone. <br /...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, soft {{robotics}} {{technologies have}} aroused increasing {{interest in the}} medical field due to their intrinsically safe interaction in unstructured environments. At the same time, new procedures and techniques {{have been developed to}} reduce the invasiveness of surgical operations. Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) has been successfully employed for abdominal interventions, however standard MIS procedures are mainly based on rigid or semi-rigid tools that limit the dexterity of the clinician. This paper presents a soft and high dexterous manipulator for MIS. The manipulator was inspired by the biological capabilities of the octopus arm, and is designed with a modular approach. Each module presents the same functional characteristics, thus achieving high dexterity and versatility when more modules are integrated. The paper details the design, fabrication process and the materials necessary {{for the development of a}} single unit, which is fabricated by casting silicone inside specific molds. The result consists in an elastomeric cylinder including three flexible pneumatic actuators that enable elongation and omni-directional bending of the unit. An external <b>braided</b> <b>sheath</b> improves the motion of the module. In the center of each module a granular jamming-based mechanism varies the stiffness of the structure during the tasks. Tests demonstrate that the module is able to bend up to 120 ° and to elongate up to 66 % of the initial length. The module generates a maximum force of 47 N, and its stiffness can increase up to 36 %...|$|E
40|$|A haptic virtual {{borescope}} {{is developed}} {{for the purpose of}} air-craft engine inspection training, similar in spirit to borescope train-ers intended for use in gas turbine maintenance training schools. Such devices consist of engine section mockups for use with a real borescope. Our approach instead simulates engine sections in vir-tual reality, replacing the need for physical mockups. We model the engine casing as a “black box ” where a simulated borescope tip is inserted (in practice a real borescope is used to provide tactile veridicality of the probe’s <b>braided</b> <b>sheath</b> but the camera at its tip is not used). The probe’s translational movement is mapped to the vir-tual camera’s. The graphical engine representation can conceivably generalize to any engine section that can be modeled graphically. Since the interior chamber of the “black box ” casing is empty, the critical component of our simulator is correct borescope tip navi-gation as well as force feedback response based on a mathematical model of collision detection of the tip in the computer generated environment. Haptic response is thought to be a key component of the sim-ulator as it provides non-visual tactile awareness of the borescope tip within the engine under inspection and, more importantly, its contact with engine surfaces. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we design a novel motor-powered clamp that provides collision re-sponse to collision of the camera detected in virtual space. Second, we attempt to isolate the effect of the system’s tactile response and provide empirical evaluation of its utility. In line with previous results, our empirical analysis reveals a trend toward a benefit in performance (speed), but suggests that the provision of haptic feed-back, while preferred over a solely visual interface, may be per-ceived as extraneous in a visually-dominated discrimination task...|$|E
