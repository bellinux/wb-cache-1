5|$|In 1878, Argentina made {{inquiries}} in Britain to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> ocean-going capital {{ship for}} its navy, which to that point, had consisted of only coastal and riverine forces, {{centered on the}} two small s. Almirante Brown, the first large ironclad of the Argentine Navy, was ordered from the Samuda Brothers shipyard of London. She was launched on 6 October 1880, and cost the Argentine government £270,000. On 14 June 1881, she conducted speed trials on the Maplin Mile, and achieved her designed speed of 14knots at full power. Upon her delivery to Argentina, she was the largest vessel in the Argentine fleet, and remained so until the four Garibaldi-class armored cruisers were acquired in the late 1890s. Almirante Brown was present during the ceremonies {{for the opening of}} the south basin in the harbor of Buenos Aires on 28 January 1889.|$|E
5|$|Lenny invites {{his friends}} in Springfield to a party at his apartment, where he tells them that he has adopted a new faith {{in the form of}} a brand new plasma screen television. Homer {{immediately}} falls in love with its high-definition picture, and begins to spend all his time at Lenny's home watching television. Marge sends over Bart and Lisa to convince him to come back but they too become enthralled. After a few days, Homer is kicked out by Lenny, and when he returns home he no longer enjoys watching his regular CRT television. Marge tells him that she has entered the family in a contest where first prize is a plasma screen television. Later, they get a call and discover that instead of first prize, they won the third prize: a trip to the studios of Fox Broadcasting Company. There, Homer learns of a reality show called Mother Flippers in which the mothers of two families switch places, and the grand prize happens to be enough money to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> plasma screen television.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> television set.|$|E

The church had been built without a bell in 1960 with a large campanile. Bell instructed Pastor Cornelius O'Connor not to place the bell in the tower, but to buy a proper church bell instead.

25|$|The T-X {{program has}} been {{established}} to enable the United States Air Force to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> two-seat jet trainer for fast-jet training to replace the Northrop T-38 Talon; {{the average age of}} the T-38 fleet is over 50 years. About 350 aircraft are expected to be ordered to replace the T-38, but further purchases could push the overall purchase to over 1,000. The notional in-service date for the replacement trainer was 2017, but shrinking budgets have pushed initial operating capability to around 2023. The program is expected to begin in FY 2017.|$|E
25|$|Chilean {{software}} engineer Jorge Arellano Cid conceived the Dillo project in late 1999, publishing {{the first version}} of Dillo in December of that year.

To this end, he designed Dillo to be small, fast, and efficient, capable of performing well even on an Intel 80486 CPU with a dial-up Internet access.|$|E

25|$|Once these {{expansions}} {{were made}} the company fell more {{into a state}} of operation. From 9 July 1880 all routes terminating at Stortorvet were merged, resulting in direct services from Homansbyen to Oslo and from Grünerløkka to Vestbanen. This also meant that passengers no longer had to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> ticket for a transfer. Between 1887 and 1892 the company took delivery of seventeen new vehicles from Skabo. During the 1890s the company carried out some double tracking. The final batch of fifteen horsecars, built by Falkenried, were delivered in 1897. They were so heavy they needed to be hauled by two horses and were designed with the intension of being used as trailers for the electric trams.|$|E
25|$|The {{desire to}} {{document}} the jekt as a vessel was still there {{and after the war}} the Nordland fylkesmuseum was urged to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> jekt. Anna Karoline was chosen because she was in a relatively original condition and she is the only Nordlandsjekt in such condition that has been preserved. As of 2014 here are three other jekts in Norway. It is the newly built copy of the jekt Brødrene and the jekt Pauline of Steinkjer, the latter is so much repaired and rebuilt that she is far from her original condition. Both are carvel built and sailing, contrary to Anna Karoline which is on land. The Holvikejekta located at Sandane in Western Norway is also ashore and as Anna Karoline she is also clinker built.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, the Art Institute of Chicago sold 11 {{works at}} auction, {{including}} paintings by Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Maurice Utrillo and Edgar Degas, {{to raise the}} $12 million purchase price of a bronze sculpture, Golden Bird, by Constantin Brâncuși. At the time, the sculpture was owned by the Arts Club of Chicago, which was selling it to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> gallery for its other works. In 2005, the museum sold two paintings by Marc Chagall and Auguste Renoir at Sotheby's. In 2011, it auctioned two Picassos (Sur l'impériale traversant la Seine (1901) and Verre et pipe (1919)), Henri Matisse's Femme au fauteuil (1919), and Georges Braque's Nature morte à la guitare (rideaux rouge) (1938) at Christie's in London.|$|E

25|$|Fa'ours {{leadership}} role was resuscitated after {{an incident in}} 1960 in which his car broke down, forcing him to seek assistance from the nearest village inhabited by his tribesmen. The sight of the emir being forced to walk while all other tribal leaders drove trucks provoked a sense of dishonor among the tribesmen of the village, who launched efforts to pool funds from Al Fadl's members to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> car for Fa'our. Some tribesmen sent sheep and goats as compensatory gifts to Fa'our as well. The reaction of the tribesmen to his dire financial situation spurred Fa'our, who was based in Beirut, to reassert his political leadership of Al Fadl. To that end, he increased contacts with his tribesmen and negotiated on their behalf.|$|E
25|$|In {{built up}} {{cities around the}} world, urban {{planning}} uses cycling infrastructure like bikeways to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. A number of cities {{around the world have}} implemented schemes known as bicycle sharing systems or community bicycle programs. The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in Amsterdam in 1965. It was followed by yellow bicycles in La Rochelle and green bicycles in Cambridge. These initiatives complement public transport systems and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting is common. In Copenhagen, a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> bicycle tax free to use for commuting.|$|E
25|$|Craddock {{planned a}} career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Triumph motorcycle. In July 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was {{shattered}} in a motorcycle crash. He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a limp and pain. He wore a steel sheath around the leg {{for the rest of his}} life. Most accounts relate the accident as the fault of a drunk driver who struck him, but some claim Craddock had been riding drunk. Years later in some of his music biographies, there is no mention of an accident, but it was claimed that his injury was due to a wound incurred in combat in Korea. He spent time in the Portsmouth Naval Hospital and was medically discharged from the Navy shortly thereafter.|$|E
