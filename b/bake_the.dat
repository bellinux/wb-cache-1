5|$|Marriage {{plans were}} {{confirmed}} and Poe returned to Baltimore {{to file for}} a marriage license on September 22, 1835. The couple might have been quietly married as well, though accounts are unclear. Their only public ceremony was in Richmond on May 16, 1836, when they were married by a Presbyterian minister named Rev. Amasa Converse. Poe was 27 and Virginia was 13, though her age was listed as 21. This marriage bond was filed in Richmond and included an affidavit from Thomas W. Cleland confirming the bride's alleged age. The ceremony {{was held in the}} evening at the home of a Mrs. James Yarrington, the owner of the boarding house in which Poe, Virginia, and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm were staying. Yarrington helped Maria Clemm <b>bake</b> <b>the</b> wedding cake and prepared a wedding meal. The couple then had a short honeymoon in Petersburg, Virginia.|$|E

25|$|Qianzhang (skimmed {{soy bean}} cream) – Qianzhang is the cream skimmed from soybean milk. In order to create, this several steps must be {{followed}} very carefully. First, soybeans are soaked in water, ground, strained, boiled, restrained {{several times and}} spread over gauze until delicate, snow-white cream is formed. The paste can also be hardened, cut into slivers and seasoned with sesame oil, garlic and chili oil. Another variation is to <b>bake</b> <b>the</b> cream and fry it with bacon, which is described as soft and sweet.|$|E
25|$|Discriminating {{between an}} {{intrusive}} sill and a lava flow in ancient rock sequences can be difficult. However, some sills do not usually have brecciated margins, and may show a weak metamorphic aureole {{on both the}} upper and lower surface, whereas a lava will only <b>bake</b> <b>the</b> substrate beneath it. However, it is often difficult in practice to identify these metamorphic phenomenon because they are usually weak and restricted in size. Peperitic sills, intruded into wet sedimentary rocks, commonly do not bake upper margins and have upper and lower autobreccias, closely similar to lavas.|$|E
25|$|Only 27 intrepid French {{settlers}} {{were able}} to make the final leg of the trip from the farm designated as a resting place to their new Texan utopia, a site located in today's Denton County in Texas (northwest of Dallas). The small group arrived June 2, 1848, and immediately began a frenzied effort to construct dwellings in order to stake their land claims, attempting {{at the same time to}} plow and farm the prairie. Virtually no time remained to meet the terms of the land concession. The hot summer sun began to <b>bake</b> <b>the</b> ground. Poorly fed, poorly housed, overworked and exhausted, the Icarian colonists next fell victim to an outbreaks of cholera and malaria, illnesses which killed four and sickened the rest. Making a bad situation still worse, the one medical doctor in the company broke down into a state of insanity and deserted his fellows.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "casting robot" [...] {{would use}} {{sculpting}} tools and templates to make plaster molds. Plaster {{was selected because}} the molds are easy to make, can make precise parts with good surface finishes, and the plaster can be easily recycled afterward using an oven to <b>bake</b> <b>the</b> water back out. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from nonconductive molten rock (basalt) or purified metals. A carbon dioxide laser cutting and welding system was also included.|$|E

2500|$|The Ottoman armies were {{distinguished}} from their contemporaries in the West not by numerical predominance {{of its military}} forces but by the thoroughness of the administrative backup and general support that maintained them in the field. The auxiliary support system also set Classic Army apart from their contemporaries. The janissaries waged war as {{one part of a}} well-organized military machine. [...] The Ottoman army had a corps to prepare the road, a corps to pitch the tents ahead, a corps to <b>bake</b> <b>the</b> bread. The cebeci corps carried and distributed weapons and ammunition. The janissary corps had its own internal medical auxiliaries: Muslim and Jewish surgeons who would travel with the corps during campaigns and had organized methods of moving the wounded and the sick to traveling hospitals behind the lines.|$|E
2500|$|Bread was {{the basic}} diet of the Parisian workers. There was one bakery for every 1349 Parisians in 1867, up from one bakery for every 1800 in 1853. To avoid popular unrest, {{the price of}} bread was {{regulated}} {{by the government and}} fixed at about 50 centimes per kilo. The fast-baked baguette was not introduced until 1920, so bakers had to work all night to <b>bake</b> <b>the</b> bread for the next day. In order to make a profit, bakers created a wide variety of what were known as [...] "fantasy" [...] breads, made with better quality flours and with different grains; the price of these breads ranged from 80 centimes to a franc per kilo. The average daily consumption of bread of Parisians dropped during the Second Empire from 500 grams per day per person in 1851 to 415 grams in 1873.|$|E

2500|$|In New Orleans, Louisiana, {{parts of}} {{southern}} Texas, and surrounding regions, a similar ring-shaped cake {{known as a}} [...] "King Cake" [...] traditionally becomes available in bakeries from Epiphany to Mardi Gras. The baby Jesus figurine is inserted into the cake from underneath, {{and the person who}} gets the slice with the figurine is expected to buy or <b>bake</b> <b>the</b> next King Cake. There is wide variation among the types of pastry that may be called a King Cake, but most are a baked cinnamon-flavoured twisted dough with thin frosting and additional sugar on top in the traditional Mardi Gras colours of gold, green and purple. To prevent accidental injury or choking, the baby Jesus figurine is frequently not inserted into the cake at the bakery, but included in the packaging for optional use by the buyer to insert it themselves. Mardi Gras-style beads and doubloons may be included as well.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the dough}} was placed {{directly}} on the heated stones of a cooking fire or in a griddle or pan made of clay or iron (...) [...] In {{the time of the}} First Temple, two types of oven were used for baking bread: the jar oven and the pit-oven. The jar-oven was a large pottery container, narrowing into an opening toward the top; fuel was burned on the inside to heat it and the dough was pressed against the outside to <b>bake.</b> <b>The</b> pit-oven was a clay-lined excavation in the ground in which the fuel was burned and then pushed aside, and the loaves were baked on the heated surface. People also began placing a convex dome, initially earthenware and later metal, over the pit-oven and cooking the flatbreads on the dome instead of on the ash-covered surface; this type of oven is probably what was meant by the biblical machabat, often translated as “griddle”.|$|E
