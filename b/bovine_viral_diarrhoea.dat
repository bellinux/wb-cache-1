She then worked with ornithologist Chris Perrins trying to identify the virus responsible for puffinosis, a disease that affects the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) sea bird.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of bovine pestivirus disease, {{in which there}} was high mortality (37 %) in 102 calves, was investigated. It was postulated that the severity of the outbreak may have been due to the presence of a highly virulent strain of <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus. Nine calves from the field outbreak were transported to Massey University for detailed clinical, post-mortem and laboratory examination. Samples were also submitted from a further three animals on the farm. The results of immunological and virological studies indicated that seven calves had acute <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus infection and five calves had mucosal disease. Although the mucosal disease cases showed more severe clinical signs, lesions were widespread in both groups. A non-cytopathic <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus isolate from one calf was used as the challenge virus in a transmission experiment designed to investigate the pathogenicity of this strain. The 11 calves used in this experiment comprised of four unvaccinated, challenged calves, four vaccinated calves (two challenged, two in-contact), two unvaccinated, in-contact calves and a control (neither vaccinated nor in-contact). The experiment took place over a month, allowing multiple clinical examinations and sampling procedures to be carried out before necropsy. The challenge virus caused mild disease, with lesions similar to those reported in experiments in which Type 1 <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus isolates were used. Following experimental challenge, virus was not recovered from the calves, but a serological diagnosis of <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus infection was made by demonstrating a greater than fourfold rise in titre of <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus antibody in all challenged calves. There were only minor changes in haematological indices in challenged calves. The six challenged calves showed two distinctive lesions in intestinal sections. These were crypt necrosis (of glands of Lieburkuhn) and cryptal prolapse (herniation of crypts into the submucosal site of Peyer's patches depleted of lymphocytes). In the disease outbreak, these lesions were only observed in the mucosal disease cases. Focal haemorrhages at sites of lymphocytic nodules were found in the nasal cavity of all challenged and vaccinated calves in the transmission experiment, but not in the unvaccinated, in-contact calves or the control calf. These lesions have not been reported in natural infections. Vaccination was only partially protective, and there was evidence of spread of <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus infection to one vaccinated, in-contact calf. Scoring of histological lesions allowed a measurement of the effect of vaccination. There was a 60 % reduction in the total histological lesion score in the four vaccinated calves (two challenged, two in-contact) when compared with the four unvaccinated, challenged animals. It was concluded that the high mortality seen in the calves in the field outbreak was due to mucosal disease, and that this was consequential to a high infection rate in the dams during pregancy {{at a time when the}} foetuses were at risk of becoming persistently infected (45 - 125 days of gestation). The pathological "fingerprint" for <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus infection was found to be the concomitant finding of three lesions at necropsy. Firstly, erosive lesions in the squamous epithelium of the upper alimentary tract. Secondly, catarrhal enteritis, with the distinctive and characteristic microscopic lesions of crypt necrosis and cryptal prolapse. Thirdly, lymphoid tissue lesions, especially lymph node enlargement, lymphoid depletion and inflammation of Peyer's patches. Despite the difficulties in pathotyping the challenge virus in the transmission experiment, there was little evidence that it was a Type 2 strain. Genetic typing of this virus, by sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products, would be useful in determining its place in the phylogeny of bovine pestiviruses...|$|E

Eight {{clinically}} healthy calves were inoculated intranasally, four with either noncytopathic or four with cytopathic <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> diarrhea virus, and were necropsied 5 or 12 days post-inoculation.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{studies on}} epidemiological aspects of infection of a dairy herd with <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus. Serum neutralizing antibodies were measured and isolation of virus was attempted from animals in one commercial dairy farm and from bobby calves collected from dairy {{farms in the}} Manawatu Region for slaughter at a local abattoir. The work is presented in six chapters. The first chapter is {{a review of the}} literature relevant to the present work. The second is a description of the general materials and methods. The third, fourth and fifth give the results of the investigations carried out and the sixth is summary, a general discussion and conclusion of the major findings. References are cited at the end of the thesis. Appendices I and II describe the preparation of the media for cell culture, reagents and solutions, and publications related to the work. All of the replacement heifers and 97. 1 % of the adult milking herd had serum neutralizing antibodies to <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus. There was no significant difference (p > 0. 05) in the geometric mean titres of each age group of the animals in the herd. The serum antibody titres of the cohort of one to four day old calves reflected those of their dams and declined steadily, with a half life of 25 days, so that by eight months of age, all calves tested negative. The serum neutralizing antibody titres in a group of bobby calves at a local abattoir were significantly lower (p < 0. 001) than those of the cohort of calves on the farm. <b>Bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus was isolated from blood samples from 21 of 340 (6. 1 %) animals and five (1. 4 %) of these animals were still infected when retested 12 months later. The distribution of serum neutralizing antibodies in infected animals ranged from < 0. 6 to 2. 7. Three of the persistently infected animals had no detectable neutralizing antibodies (titres < 0. 6) but two had titres of 0. 9 and 1. 8. The age of the infected animals ranged from one to more than eight years. Persistently infected animals provided an adequate mechanism for the maintenance of <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus in the herd. It is postulated that animals, in contact with persistently infected animals, may be reinfected when their antibody titres decline below protective levels. The viral interference assay and fluorescent antibody test were used to detect virus in cultures of blood samples. These two methods were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity and appeared to be equally suitable for virus isolation. In the present work there was 88. 4 % agreement between the two tests, while the viral interference assay was found to be relatively more sensitive but less specific than the fluorescent antibody test. The results of this work indicate that infection with <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus is endemic on the farm studied and that most animals become infected by the time they are twelve months old. However, depending on the particular management practices used, some groups of heifer calves may not be exposed to virus before they reach breeding age. It also appears that infection with <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus is common on many dairy farms in the Manawatu Region. If identification and elimination of persistently infected animals is an option for the control of <b>bovine</b> <b>viral</b> <b>diarrhoea</b> virus in an endemically infected population, a laboratory test with high specificity and sensitivity and which is easy to perform will be required. If eradication of BVDV from the farm is not practical then immunization of heifers around the age of 12 months, either by exposure to persistently infected animals in the herd or by using inactivated vaccines, may protect them against infection during the first breeding period thus minimizing foetal infection...|$|E
