40|$|A small active in-vacuum beamstop {{has been}} {{developed}} to monitor the flux of intense third-generation synchrotron X-ray beams protecting the downstream detector from the direct beam. Standard active beamstops, where a <b>built-in</b> <b>diode</b> directly absorbs the beam, have limitations in size and lifetime. In the present design, a silicon PIN diode detects the photons back-scattered from a cavity in the beamstop. This approach drastically reduces the radiation dose on the diode and thus increases its lifetime. The beamstop with a diameter of 2 mm has been fabricated {{to meet the requirements}} for the P 12 bioSAXS beamline of EMBL Hamburg at PETRA III (DESY). The beamstop is in regular user operation at the beamline and displays a good response over the range of energies tested (6 - 20 keV). Further miniaturization of the diode is easily possible as its size is not limited by the PIN diode used...|$|E

50|$|The Shockley {{ideal diode}} {{equation}} characterizes the current across a p-n junction {{as a function}} of external voltage and ambient conditions (temperature, choice of semiconductor, etc.).

40|$|Objectives. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a new device that provides a simple, noninvasive method of measuring accurate lesion size while using an endoscope. Methods. We developed a rigid laryngoscope with a built-in laser-ruler using a one-light emitting diode and an acrylic plate. The invention incorporates a <b>built-in</b> laser <b>diode</b> that projects an auto-parallel beam into the optical path of the rigid laryngoscope to form two spots in the field of view. Results. While the interspot distance remains consistent despite changes in focal plane, magnification, or viewing angle of the laryngoscope, projection to an uneven surface introduces certain variations in the shape, and size of the spots, and the distance between the two spots. Conclusion. The device enables a laryngologist to easily measure the distance between landmarks, as well as the change in real size, and the progressive change of vocal fold lesions in an outpatient setting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{continuously}} shrinking device {{structures and}} increasing densities of FPGAs, thermal aspects {{have become the}} new focus for many research projects over the last years. Most researchers rely on temperature simulations to evaluate their novel thermal management techniques. However, {{the accuracy of the}} simulations is to some extent questionable and they require a high computational effort if a detailed thermal model is used. For experimental evaluation of real-world temperature management methods, often synthetic heat sources are employed. Therefore, in this paper we investigated the question if we can create significant rises in temperature on modern FPGAs to enable future evaluation of thermal management techniques based on experiments in contrast to simulations. Therefore, we have developed eight different heat-generating cores that use different subsets of the FPGA resources. Our experimental results show that, according to the <b>built-in</b> thermal <b>diode</b> of our Xilinx Virtex- 5 FPGA, we can increase the chip temperature by 134 degree C in less than 12 minutes by only utilizing about 21 % of the slices.

To that end, we have developed seven different heat-generating cores that use different subsets of FPGA resources.

40|$|Given large circuit sizes, high clock frequencies, and {{possibly}} extreme operating environments, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) {{are capable of}} heating beyond their designed thermal limits. As new circuits are developed for FPGAs and deployed remotely, engineers are challenged to determine in advance if the device will operate within recommended thermal ranges. The amount of power consumed by the circuit depends on how an algorithm is compiled into hardware, how the circuit is placed and routed, and the patterns of data that pass through the system. The amount of heat that can be dissipated depends on the thermal transfer characteristics of the package, the air flow that passes over the package, and the ambient temperature of the remote systems. Rather than designing a system to handle unreasonable worst-case situations, we have implemented a thermal management system that continuously monitors {{the temperature of the}} FPGA and reprograms the device if the temperate approaches the outer limits of safe operating conditions. Our system measures the junction temperature of a Xilinx Virtex FPGA using a <b>built-in</b> thermal <b>diode.</b> Using the temperature monitoring mechanism, we have studied the steadystate and transient conditions of multiple benchmark circuits implemented in an FPGA logic on the Field-programmable Port Extender (FPX) development platform. We observed properties of these benchmark circuits that enable us to predict power and thermal characteristics for real applications. We propose a Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) strategy for FPGAs based on temperature feedback. 1...|$|R
