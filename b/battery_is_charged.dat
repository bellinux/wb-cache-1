2500|$|Plug-in hybrids' greenhouse-gas emissions, during {{operation}} in their all-electric range mode, {{depend on the}} type of power plant used to feed the electrical grid when the <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> <b>charged.</b> (See [...] "Greenhouse gas emissions", below.)

Other benefits include improved national energy security, less frequent fill-ups at the filling station, the convenience of home recharging, opportunities to provide emergency backup power in the home, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications. Several countries, including the United States, China, and several European countries, have enacted laws to ease the introduction of PHEVs through grants and tax credits, emissions mandates, and financing research and development in advanced batteries and related technology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{president}} of Ultralight Flying Machines, Larry Mauro, created the Solar Riser by converting a stock UFM Easy Riser hang glider to solar power.

The solar cells are not sufficient to provide power in flight and all flights were made by recharging the battery on the ground from the solar cells and then flying using energy stored in the battery.

50|$|Charge and {{discharge}} rates are often denoted as C or C-rate, {{which is a}} measure of the rate at which a <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> <b>charged</b> or discharged relative to its capacity. As such the C-rate is defined as the charge or discharge current divided by the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge. While rarely stated explicitly, the unit of the C-rate is h−1, equivalent to stating the battery's capacity to store an electrical charge in unit hour times current in the same unit as the charge or discharge current. The C-rate is never negative, so whether it describes a charging or discharging process depends on the context.|$|E
5000|$|Battery: Credo uses an {{internal}} battery, and Aptus uses an external battery. Credo can't operate without a charged battery inside it. When Aptus is tethered {{it can work}} only without battery, as the battery port and cable port are overlapping. The Credo <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> <b>charged</b> when using powered FW800, but not when using USB. It is possible to use low powered Windows tablets to tether Credo, while Aptus generally requires tethering to a laptop which has a FW port that is powered from AC. Aptus can load a double capacity and size battery, which Credo can't, since the battery goes into a slot in the Credo body.|$|E

50|$|Stage 2 {{is called}} the Uo-phase, constant-voltage boost stage, {{absorption}} stage, or topping charge. In this stage, the battery is continued being charged at a constant (over)voltage Uo, but the charge current is decreasing. The decrease is imposed by the battery. The voltage in the Uo-phase is too high to be applied indefinitely (hence, overvoltage), but it allows charging the battery fully {{in a relatively short}} time. The Uo-phase is concluded when the charge current goes below a threshold Imin, after which the U-phase is entered. This happens when the <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> <b>charged</b> to around 95% of its capacity. Some manufacturers follow this stage by a second constant-current stage (with a gradually increasing voltage) before continuing with the U-phase. The voltage Uo may be the same as Umax in the previous stage, or it may be taken slightly higher.|$|E
50|$|In all cases, a <b>charge</b> {{regulator}} <b>is</b> needed. This {{ensures that}} the <b>batteries</b> <b>are</b> <b>charged</b> at the maximum rate that they safely can stand when the power is available. It also {{ensures that the}}y are not overcharged when nearing full charge and not overheated when a large charge current becomes available.|$|R

50|$|Stage 1 {{is called}} the I-phase, constant-current stage, or bulk charge stage. This phase occurs when an IUoU charger is {{connected}} to a deeply discharged battery. The charger provides a constant current, typically the maximum current that the charger is capable of producing. As {{a result of the}} current, the battery absorbs the charge and its voltage rises. The charger limits the maximum voltage to Umax, a constant or temperature-dependent maximum, typically around 2.4 V per cell. Once the Umax voltage is reached, typically when the <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> <b>charged</b> to 70-80% of its capacity, the charger enters the Uo-phase. In case of a battery that is more than 80% full, this may happen immediately once the charger is switched on. Some chargers may keep the voltage at Umax for some time and allow the current to drop to 80% of the constant-current value, before proceeding to the next stage.|$|E
50|$|A laptop's <b>battery</b> <b>is</b> <b>charged</b> {{using an}} {{external}} power supply which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically {{in the range of}} 7.2—24 volts. The power supply is usually external, and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the {{external power supply}}, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about 400 g to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a smart battery, a rechargeable battery pack with a built-in battery management system (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and SoH (State of Health) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.|$|E
