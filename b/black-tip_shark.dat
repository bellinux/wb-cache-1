40|$|An unusual {{catch of}} sharks in a purse seine fishery at Malpe on the Dakshlna Kannada coast in Karnataka On 10 - 10 - 1990 was observed. A single purse seine boat landed {{approximately}} 3. 5 tonnes of sharks {{together with the}} seerflsh Scomberomorous commerson, (400 kg), catfish Tachysurus serratus (100 kg) and the kingfish Rachycentron canadus (100 kg). The sharks were identified as the <b>black-tip</b> <b>shark</b> Carcharhtnus limbatus...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{microsatellite}} DNA markers {{were isolated}} in the spot-tail shark (Carcharhinus sorrah) and nine were isolated in Australian <b>black-tip</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus tilstoni). These loci plus 18 others developed for sharks from the genera Negaprion, Ginglymostoma, Carcharodon and Isurus were tested for amplification success on four species of Carcharhinus (including C. sorrah and C. tilstoni) and four other species representing three diverse families. Cross-amplification was most common within families. Five loci were subsequently tested for polymorphism on 50 C. sorrah and 60 C. tilstoni. The number of alleles per locus was two to 24 and the average heterozygosity was 0. 54 (range 0. 16 - 0. 87) for C. sorrah and 0. 64 (range 0. 44 - 0. 78) for C. tilstoni. These loci may be useful tools for genetic analyses of the Carcharhinidae...|$|E

50|$|The best {{conditions}} for diving here are during October and November, {{when the weather}} is generally calm and during the start of southeast monsoon, which typically extends from May to July. In addition {{to a wide variety of}} corals and invertebrates on the wreck itself, large fish frequent the wreck in some seasons, most popularly Mola mola and whale sharks, as well as <b>Black-tip</b> reef <b>sharks.</b> Professional divers have praised local residents for minimizing local fishing activity.|$|R
40|$|Interspecies {{hybridisation}} {{in nature}} is a well-studied phenomenon, {{but it has}} not been analysed using genetic markers in the class Chondrichthyes (sharks, rays and chimeras). Two black-tip whaler shark species (Australian, Carcharhinus tilstoni; Common, C. limbatus) have overlapping distributions in Australia, distinct mitochondrial DNA sequence (ND 4, COI, control region) and distinct morphological features such as length at sexual maturity, length at birth and number of vertebrae. A mismatch was observed between species identification using mtDNA sequence and species identification using morphological characters. To test whether hybridisation between the two species was responsible, a nuclear gene with species-specific mutations was sequenced. Extensive interspecies hybridisation was found to be occurring. Hybrids were found from five locations on the eastern Australian coastline, spanning 2, 000 km. If hybrid fitness is low and hybrids are common, then fisheries recruitment may be overestimated and the productivity of the <b>black-tip</b> <b>shark</b> fishery may be well below that required to support commercial exploitation. To guard against identification errors, the likelihood of hybridisation and subsequent introgression should be assessed prior to using mtDNA (e. g. barcoding) to identify shark species. The C. limbatus-C. tilstoni species complex provides a unique opportunity to investigate the ability of sharks to adapt to environmental change, in particular, the impact of hybridization on species distributions which favour C. tilstoni along the north and C. limbatus along the south eastern Australian coastline...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the ability of sharks and rays to sense pain, the {{proportion}} of myelinated versus unmyelinated sensory fibres in the dorsal roots and the diameter spectrum of cells in the dorsal root ganglia of three species of elasmobranch fish were ascertained. Electron micrographs were used to count the numbers of myelinated and unmyelinated fibres in montages of whole dorsal roots of the long‐tailed stingray (Himantura sp.), the shovelnose ray (Rhinobatus battilum), and small specimens of the <b>black‐tip</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharhinus melanopterus). The diameters of dorsal root ganglion cells in each species were measured by using the light microscope. Less than 1 % of the dorsal root axons in the long‐tailed stringray and a large specimen of the shovelnose were unmyelinated, whereas in smaller shovelnose rays and in the small black‐tipped sharks, from 14 % to 38 % of axons were unmyelinated. Unmyelinated fibres differed from those in mammalian nerves in {{that there was a}} one‐to‐one association of the fibre with a Schwann cell. We conclude from these observations that myelination was incomplete in the black‐tipped sharks and the smaller specimens of the shovelnose rays. The distribution of the diameter of cells of the dorsal root ganglia of these species was unimodal, resembling the diameter range that has been reported for the somata of myelinated fibres in the cat. We interpret these results as indications that sharks and rays lack the neural apparatus essential for the sensation of pain and we suggest that, to these life forms, the perception of pain might have little relevance to survival. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

40|$|The {{typically}} slow {{life histories}} of sharks make them susceptible to overexploitation. However, this characteristic {{also means that}} shark populations are more amenable to mark-recapture estimation of vital rates and to population viability analysis, compared to many teleost (bony) fishes. We applied this novel approach to inform fisheries management for 2 shark species (Carcharhinus tilstoni and C. sorrah) in northern Australia. We calculated survival estimates based on a current mark-recapture study and age-frequency distributions from historical catch data, and used these along with other estimates of vital rates to construct an individual-based population viability analysis (using VORTEX software). We estimated total current mortality (natural and fishing-related) from tagging data using Brownie models (mean ± SE: 0. 532 ± 0. 097 and 0. 487 ± 0. 136) and recapture rate (fisheries-related mortality) (0. 023 ± 0. 005 and 0. 008 ± 0. 003) for C. tilstoni and C. sorrah, respectively. Based on historical age-at-length and age-frequency data, mean survival across ages after historical overexploitation was similar for both species (~ 0. 43, or ~ 0. 33 as an age frequency-weighted mean). After correcting for capture-related mortality and permanent emigration, VORTEX population projections including incrementing simulated harvest suggest that the current rates of harvest of both species result in population trajectories that are approximately stable (20 yr predicted average rate of population change r ≅ 0), but this is complicated by a variable contribution of the slower-reproducing species C. limbatus within the <b>black-tip</b> <b>shark</b> complex (C. limbatus is commonly misidentified as C. tilstoni in the fishery). VORTEX projections also clearly indicated that the fishery was overexploited in the past. Using multiple datasets and an individual-based modelling framework to estimate harvest limits for a commercial fishery provides novel insights into management. This is especially pertinent to shark populations given the relative tractability of marking and recovering individuals and the inherent susceptibility of shark populations to overexploitation...|$|E
