5|$|At other times, Krichell {{collected}} {{some of the}} <b>best</b> <b>prospects</b> in an area, normally 300 or more, and {{put them}} through a four-day workout. It normally consisted of practice {{in the morning and}} a full game in the afternoon. There, Krichell and his staff sorted though players they believed could become useful in the organization, and dropped those they thought lacked motivation. The few players who survived the workout were assigned by Krichell to the Yankees Minor League hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|At Stanford, Hammonds {{was named}} an All-American. The Orioles {{selected}} Hammonds with the fourth overall {{selection of the}} 1992 MLB Draft. Though he was seen {{as one of the}} <b>best</b> <b>prospects</b> in baseball, injuries limited his performance with Baltimore. After he was traded to Cincinnati and then to Colorado, he emerged with the Rockies in 2000, and was selected to appear at the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He signed a three-year, $21.75 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers that off-season, but continued to struggle with injuries. He had a resurgence with the Giants in 2003, after he was released by the Brewers, but struggled with the Giants in 2004 and Nationals in 2005 before retiring.|$|E

25|$|Most Lystrosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Balfour and Katberg Formations of the Karoo basin in South Africa; these {{specimens}} offer the <b>best</b> <b>prospects</b> of identifying species because they are the most numerous and have been studied for the longest time. As so often with fossils, there is debate in the paleontological community as to exactly how many species {{have been found}} in the Karoo. Studies from the 1930s to 1970s suggested a large number (23 in one case). However, by the 1980s and 1990s, only six species were recognized in the Karoo: L. curvatus, L. platyceps, L. oviceps, L. maccaigi, L. murrayi, and L. declivis. A study in 2011 reduced that number to four, treating the fossils previously labeled as L. platyceps and L. oviceps as members of L. curvatus.|$|E
25|$|On November 28/29, Maj. Gen. D.I. Stankevskii took {{command of}} the division. He would remain in command, apart from one week as acting {{commander}} of 58th Rifle Corps, until nearly the end of 1944. The division took over the bridgehead at Varlamov from 122nd Cavalry, while four to five companies of one regiment seized another bridgehead at Siniapkin, 11km to the south, but this was soon contained. Romanian 1st Armored, at 30 percent strength, moved to block the Varlamov bridgehead, joining the 2nd Battalion of the German 403rd Security Division's 354th Grenadier Regiment. This led the commander of 5th Tank Army, Lt. Gen. P.L. Romanenko, to reinforce the position with the remaining tanks of 8th Guards and 216th Tank Brigades, along with two regiments of 47th Guards Division, as he sensed this sector offered the <b>best</b> <b>prospects</b> for a breakout across the Chir. In fighting from November 29 through to December 1, the several Soviet bridgeheads were consolidated, but no breakthrough occurred. At this time, the division likely numbered fewer than 6,000 men.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, Kennedy {{appeared}} {{along with}} Leaf defenseman of the 1970s, Jim McKenny, in an educational video for the Ontario Government {{on the dangers}} to athletes of drug and alcohol abuse.

500|$|She would {{describe}} her time at Princeton as a life-changing experience. Initially, {{she felt like}} [...] "a visitor landing in an alien country" [...] as her exposure had been limited to the Bronx and Puerto Rico. Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20). She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year; her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics. She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence. She became a moderate student activist and co-chair of the Acción Puertorriqueña organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students. She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her <b>best</b> <b>prospects.</b>|$|E
500|$|Beckett {{impressed}} the Marlins {{in his first}} spring training with the team in March 2000, with a fastball clocked at [...] and a good curveball. [...] He also showed {{his commitment to the}} team by donating $100,000 to the team's charitable foundation, more than any other player had donated. He was assigned to the Kane County Cougars of the Class A Midwest League to make his professional debut. As the Opening Day starter for the Cougars, he pitched four innings and allowed only one run, on a double by Albert Pujols. Beckett suffered from injuries that season, including shoulder tendinitis and a frayed rotator cuff, injuries which took longer to heal because he did too much weight lifting while on the disabled list. He would later say, [...] "I tried to get too strong too quick and ended up making things worse." [...] He pitched in 13 games for the Cougars and finished with a record of 2–3 with a 2.12 ERA and 61 strikeouts. He was selected by Baseball America as the Marlins best prospect and the 19th best in the entire minor leagues as well as having the best fastball in the Midwest League. He was also selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game, a showcase for the <b>best</b> <b>prospects.</b>|$|E

500|$|After {{attending}} {{an industry}} screening in April 2008 Michael Cieply from The New York Times {{stated that the}} film was [...] "...shaping up as one of 's <b>best</b> <b>prospects</b> for the summer." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film a positive review, writing [...] "There are some wildly funny scenes, a few leaden ones and others that are scattershot, with humorous satire undercut by over-the-top grisliness. Still, when it's funny, it's really funny." [...] A review in Variety by Todd McCarthy was critical: [...] "Apart from startling, out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, however, the antics here are pretty thin, redundant and one-note." [...] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail gave the film a negative review, calling it [...] "...an assault {{in the guise of}} a comedy—watching it is like getting mugged by a clown." [...] J.R. Jones of Chicago Reader stated [...] "The rest of the movie never lives up to the hilarity of the opening, partly because the large-scale production smothers the gags but mostly because those gags are so easy to smother." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave 3.5/4 and wrote, [...] "The movie is, may I say, considerably better than Stiller’s previous film, Zoolander (2001). It’s the kind of summer comedy that rolls in, makes a lot of people laugh and rolls on to video." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the controversy, Duncan {{stuck to}} his guns, {{stressing}} {{that one of the}} original charges of the Extension Service was to advise farm organizations.

60|$|They {{had been}} {{travelling}} {{with a large}} party for mutual security against Indians and Mormons, and {{so long as the}} journey lasted Dick had got on fairly well. He was always ready to do odd jobs, and as the draught cattle were growing weaker and weaker, and every pound of weight was of importance, no one grudged him his rations in return for his services; but when the company began to descend the slopes of the Sierra Nevada they began to break up, going off by twos and threes to the diggings, of which they heard such glowing accounts. Some, however, kept straight on to Sacramento, determining there to obtain news as to the doings at all the different places, and then to choose that which seemed to offer the <b>best</b> <b>prospects</b> of success.|$|E
60|$|In the darkness, Wallenstein drew off {{his army}} {{and fell back}} to Leipzig, leaving behind him his colours and all his guns. In thus doing he threw away the {{opportunity}} of turning what his retreat acknowledged to be a defeat into a victory on the following morning, for scarcely had he left the field when the six regiments of Pappenheim's infantry arrived from Halle. Had he held his ground he could have renewed the battle in the morning, with the <b>best</b> <b>prospects</b> of success, for the struggle of the preceding day had been {{little more than a}} drawn battle, and the accessions of fresh troops should have given him a decided advantage over the weary Swedes. The newcomers, finding the field deserted, and learning from the wounded lying thickly over it that Wallenstein had retreated, at once marched away.|$|E
