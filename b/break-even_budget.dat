40|$|A feeder-calf price {{model is}} {{estimated}} which incorporates elements of <b>break-even</b> <b>budget</b> analysis, including estimates of placement weights, slaughter weights, ration cost, and feed-conversion rates. From this model, a corn price multiplier is calculated which quantifies the cornlfeeder-calf price relationship. Because the multiplier includes information on cattle weight, feed conversion, and ration cost, {{it also provides}} insight into how feeding programs are altered in response to com price changes. Changes in feeding programs which occur in response to com price changes are illustrated with dynamic simulation based on weight, ration cost, and price models presented here. Key Words: corn, com price multiplier, dynamic simulation, feeder cattle. The use of break-even budgeting analysis has frequently been extended by agricultural econ-omists and others to describe and forecast feeder cattle market reactions to various ex-ogenous shocks. This method of forecasting has appeal for use with producers since they readily understand its logic. However, there {{would appear to be}} inherent potential dangers in using what is essentially a comparative stat-ic micro-level tool as a macro/market-level analysis tool. One potential danger or weak-ness is that <b>break-even</b> <b>budget</b> analysis ap-pears to ignore the dynamics of the cattle in-dustry. A second danger is that break-even analysis assumes perfectly competitive market responses to all exogenous shocks...|$|E

40|$|Telemetry is a {{hospital}} service which is delivered by many different hospital professionals acting in concert. These inter-connections challenge telemetry work designs {{to account for}} each actor’s role and his effect on the system. Other difficulties in designing safe, efficient telemetry arise from the nature of telemetry. The ergonomics of device interfaces and operational idiosyncrasies {{can contribute to the}} instability of systems when employees react to stresses by departing from the ideal protocol. If that occurs too frequently, organized quality improvement becomes necessary to resolve the aggregate uncertainty surrounding the structure-process relationship. Thus, an equilibrium may be restored between caregivers and hospital structures. A structured method is proposed to facilitate front-line employee participation in collaborative decision-making throughout all stages of quality improvement. Employees are encouraged to conduct improvements within a decision space between the minimum regulatory requirement (resource minimum) and <b>break-even</b> <b>budget</b> constraint (resource maximum.) Decision-making occurs in two stages after employees are grouped by department. A nominal group technique is conducted within departments to generate ideas. These are sent to the hospital level. There, a modified Delphi technique includes a representative from each department. After consensus has been established, the group delineates an implementation path consistent with its other needs. Because a larger number of employees has participated in their creation, the structures resulting from this improvement initiative are likely to decay more slowly. But once they do, there will be a need for further modifications. Then, formal and informal infrastructure for quality improvement collaboration will still exist. Non-profit healthcare organizations create quality improvement infrastructure with partial subsidization by the community. Thus, the opportunity cost in the marketplace must be outweighed by decision-making infrastructure’s benefits to the total welfare. These benefits range across subjective and objective dimensions. More individuals’ preferences may be addressed, increasing aggregate utility. If the breadth of data collection contributes to a net allocative efficiency, objective outcomes may improve in the furtherance of public health...|$|E

40|$|In {{order for}} {{managers}} {{to be able}} to estimate <b>break-even</b> numbers for <b>budgeting</b> purposes, historical total costs must be able to be separated into their fixed and variable cost components. There are generally two methods for teaching this: the high-low method, and the method of least squares regression. The high-low method is considered theoretically inferior to the method of least squares, yet it continues to be taught in accounting courses. The argument for its continuation has been that it is “quick and easy”. However, with the proliferation of electronic spreadsheets, this advantage can also be attributed to the method of least squares. The high-low method’s continued coverage in accounting textbooks would seem to indicate that educators feel that the results generated by each method are not significantly different. This paper compares these methods by using a bootstrapping technique. Bootstrapping facilitates the simulated generation of entire distributions from a sample and allows statistical comparisons to be made between the distributions. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the high-low method, while easy to use, may be giving results that are significantly different from results obtained from regression. Because students now have the ability to do regression easily and inexpensively using a spreadsheet, and because of the theoretical shortcomings of the high-low method, it may be that educators should discontinue using and teaching the high-low method altogether...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} it would be financially feasible for Altamura Winery to build and operate a wine tasting room in Napa Valley {{over the course of a}} 30 year period. This report used a feasibility study to examine the investment of the tasting room. The study used the cost approach of valuation to value the construction costs. Then capital budgeting was used as a method to determine if the tasting room should be constructed. The capital budgeting methods of this study include the use of a cash flow <b>budget,</b> <b>break-even</b> analysis, and a net present value analysis of the investment using different variables to complete a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis examined changes in the interest rate, quantity of wine sold in the tasting room, margin per bottle of wine sold, and variable costs. Under the set variables, building the tasting room proved to be financially feasible, resulting in a net present value of $ 3, 663, 670. 88. A great majority of the sensitivity analyses resulted in positive net present values. To break-even on the investment, Altamura Winery must sell 317. 28 cases of wine each year. Under these circumstances, and even with some variations in key variables, building the tasting room would be a financially feasible investment for Altamura Winery...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of conservation agriculture (CA) {{is discussed in}} the context of producing food for a growing population while, at the same time, conserving and improving the natural resource base: sustainable crop production intensification. CA requires mechanization, and the necessary equipment may be {{beyond the reach of the}} majority of smallholder farmers, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. A logical solution to this situation is to provide CA mechanization services from private sector entrepreneurs. These will be well-equipped with appropriate CA equipment and will usually benefit from specific training on the technical aspects of CA machinery operation and on the business skills needed to run a profitable venture. The technical skills to be reinforced include: equipment selection, calibration of planters, seeders and sprayers, field operation, maintenance and repair. Business skills needed include: market research and feasibility studies, business planning, calculation of operational costs, partial <b>budgets,</b> <b>break-even</b> points and cash flows. The case is made for local manufacture to reduce the costs of machinery acquisition and to encourage local adaptation. Start-up costs are discussed together with the options of obtaining finance. Guidelines for marketing and managing the mechanization service provision business are developed. These include the {{importance of}} contracts, work planning, regular maintenance schedules and record keeping. Finally the most appropriate vehicle for delivering the training and sustaining support is considered. Formal training courses are a good starting point, but can be expensive to organize and execute. Individual counselling from extension sources is a viable option when the quality of the service is high enough. Study groups of involved entrepreneurs should be encouraged and supported to overcome the problems that will inevitably arise in new business ventures...|$|R
