50|$|Crushing at {{the actual}} {{construction}} site using portable crushers reduces construction {{costs and the}} pollution generated when compared with transporting material to and from a quarry. Large road-portable plants can crush concrete and asphalt rubble at 600 tons per hour or more. These systems normally consist of a rubble crusher, side <b>discharge</b> <b>conveyor,</b> screening plant, and a return conveyor from the screen to the crusher inlet for reprocessing oversize materials. Compact, self-contained mini-crushers are also available that can handle up to 150 tons per hour and fit into tighter areas. With the advent of crusher attachments - those connected to various construction equipment, such as excavators - the trend towards recycling on-site with smaller volumes of material is growing rapidly. These attachments encompass volumes of 100 tons/hour and less.|$|R

In 1995, Benton County, Iowa initiated a program to cost effectively recycle torn off waste shingles. Nine hundred tons of waste shingles were ground using a Maxigrind. A magnetic roller on the <b>discharge</b> <b>conveyor</b> removed most of the nails. Five hundred tons of the ground waste shingles were blade mixed into 0. 6 km (0. 4 mi) of a crushed stone granular surfaced Benton County rural secondary roadway. A magnet attached to the motor grader removed another 1 / 3 kg (3 / 4 lb) of nails during the spreading and mixing operation on the 0. 6 km (0. 4 mi) section of roadway. The bitumen of the waste shingles was very effective in providing a dust free granular surfaced roadway. It remains relatively dust free one year after treatment...|$|R

40|$|Powder flow {{appears in}} many {{industrial}} processes, including pharmaceuticals, food, detergents etc. Understanding the parameters affecting powder flow {{is necessary for}} rational product and process design. This research examines powder-air interactions for three powder handling systems: <b>bin</b> <b>discharge,</b> linear shoe-die system and rotary paddle feeder. As a starting point the flow behaviour of powders was characterised using established procedures to provide basic set of properties for assessing flowability. Powder permeability {{and the influence of}} small levels of compaction on permeability were determined. The influence of differential pressure on flow initiation from arching state was examined for powders <b>discharging</b> from <b>bins.</b> A dimensional model was developed to predict the differential pressure required to initiate powder flow as a function of orifice diameter and height of the powder above the exit. The mass flow rate of the powders were measured under a range of differential pressures. A dimensional model was developed to predict the mass flow rate as a function of differential pressure and exit diameter. The effect of processing parameters on the mass of the powder delivered into the die in linear shoe-die systems under the gravity and suction fill mechanism were investigated. The system was accommodated with differential pressure transducers and the evolution of the pressure inside during the process was monitored. Dimensional models were developed to predict the mass delivered into the die as a function of powder differential pressure developed during gravity and suction fill, shoe velocity and the velocity of the punch in the die. The influence of paddle rotational speed, exit diameter and differential pressure on the mass flow rate of powders in rotary feeding system was examined. This research identified the dimensionless groups relevant for the understanding of the flow of fine and cohesive powders under differential air pressure conditions. The dimensional models developed account for air pressure effects for 1) flow initiation and 2) flow rate during <b>bin</b> <b>discharge,</b> 3) gravity and 4) suction fill mechanisms in linear shoe-die filling systems. These models can be used to aid the design of powder flow processes where air pressure effects are influential...|$|R

Next, the obtained mathematical descriptions for the mentioned material groups have been compared. The usefulness of the equations in determining the velocity of the material beyond the point, which enable to omit the indirect equations, has been demonstrated. Finally, the difference between the values of the velocities obtained with the proposed and indirect equations as well as the relative error for the proposed method have been calculated...|$|R

50|$|Screen scroll centrifuges, {{which are}} also known as worm screen or the <b>conveyor</b> <b>discharge,</b> {{instigate}} the solids to move along the cone through an internal screw conveyor. The conveyor in the centrifuge spins at a differential speed to the conical screen and centrifugal forces approximately 1800g - 2600g facilitate reasonable throughputs. Some of the screen scroll centrifuges are available with up to four separate stages for improved performance. The first stage is used to de-liquor the feed which {{is followed by a}} washing stage, with the final stage being used for drying. In an advanced screen scroll centrifuge with four stages, two separate washes are employed in order to segregate the wash liquors.|$|R

The theory examines the various loading conditions due to the stored bulk solids focusing on the determination of the lateral or bending load distribution on the trestle support legs.

In horizontal condition drag chain conveyors can handle material up to 45 - 50 % of cross sectional area of the trough. In between the drive and non drive ends of drag conveyor an endless chain, having wide links carrying projection or wings are drags a bed of bulk material from feeding end to <b>discharge</b> end. Drag <b>conveyor</b> chains are work under the very extreme conditions such as high tensile load, friction and some time hazardous operating environment (e. g. presence of humidity, chemicals). Due to versatile application various failures are occurred in the drag conveyor chain and causes loss of productivity and corrective maintenance in the system.

40|$|This paper firstly {{reviews the}} {{requirements}} for container and hopper design for reliable discharge. Discussion is then directedt o the evaluationo f the consolidations tressesa cting in both in both the cylinder and hopper sectionsd uring both initial and flow conditions. Here the vast difference, especially in vicinity of the bin outlet, between the initial or filling and flow conditions is highlighted. This vast difference has major design and operation implications. A further major implication is that all bulk solids must dilate to flow. The opportunity to simultaneously attain reliable discharge and partial moisture removal is also examined. The selection of design parameters to maximise the consolidation stresses in both the cylindrical and hopper sections is detailed. In regard to the latter, it is recommended fine coal <b>bins</b> be <b>discharged</b> using low friction lined transition hoppers with large outlet spans. Such outlets will discharge fine coal in a relatively compacted state. This compaction state should exhibit minimum water retention and short term moisture uptake. The multiphase attributes of fiDe damp coal flow is then considered. Here is it noted, {{as a consequence of}} the dilation in the hopper negative or suction interstitial fluid pressures form. It is noted such pressures generate an adverse pressure gradient which significantly retards the discharge. One technique to conveniently eliminate the adverse pressure gradient is to install low pressure high volume air sparging to the hopper. It is suggested this air sparging will have the added benefit of effecting partial moisture reduction. This technique should prove far more reliable than post feeder compaction using relatively complex mechanical systems...|$|R
40|$|While {{calculation}} {{procedures for the}} design of storage bins for dry bulk materials have been long acknowledged, the design of wet solids storage vessels is an on-going issue. Because the effects of the wet solids properties such as consolidation behavior, water permeability and viscosity on the material discharge have not been investigated yet, existing design procedures employ the principles of Jenike for dry bulk materials to describe the stress fields in a surge bin during initial filling and discharge. This paper focuses on both theoretical and experimental investigations of the discharge mechanisms and loads acting on the wall of a tank filled with a mixture of solids and water. The objective is to confirm whether the Jenike principles can be applied {{for the design of}} wet solids concentrator vessels. Tekscan® tactile pressure pads were applied to measure the profile of normal stress acting on the hopper wall of a wet solids <b>bin,</b> especially during <b>discharge.</b> Results are compared with the stresses calculated by applying standard calculation methods for dry bulk materials hopper design in conjunction with the effect of hydrostatic pressure. The results indicate that wet solids are behaving like dry bulk materials. However, the Jenike design method may be too conservative, leading to hopper half angles steeper and tanks higher than necessary...|$|R
40|$|Measures {{are being}} {{developed}} and implemented enabling the co-existence of conventional, genetically modified (GM) and organic cropping systems. In order to segregate GM from conventional crops in the entire supply chain, a food or feed company has to reorganise its production. This may involve for dedication of the production line to non-GM, or production can be organised on the same plant, using spatial or temporal segregation. In practice, only the latter method {{is used in the}} feed industry, as no investments in new machinery are necessary in the case. The segregation and identity preservation of GM and non-GM crops has to be well organised. An important tools used to proof the identity of the imported raw materials is the batch or product declaration and in some cases, a supplementary certificate of analysis for the raw materials is provided. In compound feed production, specific procedures to reduce carry-over are introduced and described in a book of charge, such as rinsing of transportation and production line, empty declaration of transport systems or storage <b>bins</b> and specific <b>discharge</b> and production orders. All these measures however imply supplementary costs to the manufacturer. A major additional cost is the price difference between GM and non-GM raw materials. Other extra costs result from losses in flexibility, a devaluation of the rinsing product, analysis and audits. As a result, the cost of a compound feed using non-GM is higher than with GM. Benefits to the segregation measures are an increased gamut of products and an improved organisation and management of the production. Together with an improved traceability system, consumers’ confidence is also increased. GMO, co-existence, costs, segregation, identity preservation, compound feed, Agribusiness,...|$|R
