Although naturally a guard, she jumped center, and lead the team in many categories, despite being the freshman on the team. She decided she needed a bigger challenge so she talked some of her friends into attending the AIAW National Championship, where she watched many teams, took notes, and decided where she wanted to go. She chose Indiana where she transferred and spent three years, making the Dean's List {{each of the three}} years. In her sophomore year, 1973 she helped the team reach the Final Four of the AIAW championship, losing in the semi-finals to Queens College.|$|E

25|$|Relative dating {{techniques}} (based on {{a presumption}} that technology progresses over time) suggest that Acheulean tools followed on from earlier, cruder tool-making methods, {{but there is}} considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries, with evidence in some regions that Acheulean tool-using groups were contemporary with other, less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonian and then later with the more sophisticated Mousterian, as well. It is therefore important not to see the Acheulean as a neatly defined period or one that happened {{as part of a}} clear sequence <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> tool-making technique that flourished especially well in early prehistory. The enormous geographic spread of Acheulean techniques also makes the name unwieldy as it represents numerous regional variations on a similar theme. The term Acheulean does not represent a common culture in the modern sense, rather it is a basic method for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World.|$|E

500|$|Elms {{suggests}} Bettelheim {{may have}} missed the anal aspect of the tale {{that would make it}} helpful to the child's personality development. In Handbook of Psychobiography Elms describes Southey's tale not as one of Bettelheimian post-Oedipal ego development <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of Freudian pre-Oedipal anality. He believes the story appeals chiefly to preschoolers who are engaged in [...] "cleanliness training, maintaining environmental and behavioral order, and distress about disruption of order". His own experience and his observation of others lead him to believe children align themselves with the tidy, organized ursine protagonists rather than the unruly, delinquent human antagonist. In Elms's view, the anality of [...] "The Story of the Three Bears" [...] can be traced directly to Robert Southey's fastidious, dirt-obsessed aunt who raised him and passed her obsession to him in a milder form.|$|E
500|$|In 1934 Walpole {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios to go to Hollywood to write the scenario for a film adaptation of David Copperfield. He enjoyed many aspects of life in Hollywood, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> who rarely revised any of his own work he found it tedious to produce sixth and seventh drafts {{at the behest of}} the studio. He enjoyed his brief change of role from writer to bit-part player: in the film he played the Vicar of Blunderstone delivering a boring sermon that sends David to sleep. Agate was doubtful of the wisdom of this: [...] "Does not Hugh see that to bring a well-known character from real life into an imaginary sequence of events is to destroy the reality of that imaginary sequence?" [...] Nevertheless, Walpole's performance was a success. He improvised the sermon; the producer, David O Selznick, mischievously called for retake after retake to try to make him dry up, but Walpole fluently delivered a different extempore address each time.|$|E
500|$|Many {{supposedly}} traditional English {{dishes are}} relatively new {{and can be}} dated to the century, and sometimes to the year, of their introduction. Thus piccalilli was introduced from India in the 18th century, as recorded by Hannah Glasse who gave a recipe for it in 1758. Conversely, dishes and sauces still considered foreign, such as fish in sweet and sour sauce, have been in English recipe books since the Middle Ages. Other dishes took their present form only gradually, as with the so-called [...] "Full English breakfast". Breakfasts of this kind are indeed described in later editions of [...] "Mrs Beeton", <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of many variations. Thus her list of [...] "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Winter" [...] has for Wednesday something that looks fairly modern: [...] "bread, muffins, butter, brawn, grilled bacon, boiled eggs"; but on other days less modern-looking breakfasts include mince, mutton cutlets, grilled kidneys, baked fresh herrings, and hash of cold game or poultry, while suggestions for [...] "Family Breakfasts for a Week in Summer" [...] included sardine toast, cold tongue, kedgeree and rissoles, and [...] "Guests' Breakfast (Autumn)" [...] included cold pheasant, game pie, and pressed beef.|$|E

500|$|By September 1948, the Red Scare {{began to}} take hold, and Conant called for a ban on hiring {{teachers}} who were communists, although not for the dismissal {{of those who had}} already been hired. A debate ensued over whether communist educators could teach apolitical subjects. Conant {{was a member of the}} Educational Policies Commission (EPC), a body to which he had been appointed in 1941. When it next met in March 1949, Conant's push for a ban was supported by the president of Columbia University, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower. The two found common ground in their belief in ideology-based education, which Conant called [...] "democratic education". He did not see public education as a side effect of American democracy, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of its principal driving forces, and he disapproved of the public funding of denominational schools that he observed in Australia during his visit there in 1951. He called for increased federal spending on education, and higher taxes to redistribute wealth. His thinking was outlined in his books Education in a Divided World in 1948, and Education and Liberty in 1951. In 1952, he went further and endorsed the dismissal of academics who invoked the Fifth under questioning by the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
500|$|The {{power and}} {{prestige}} that Offa attained {{made him one}} of the most significant rulers in Early Medieval Britain, though no contemporary biography of him survives. A key source for the period is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals in Old English narrating the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The Chronicle was a West Saxon production, however, and is sometimes thought to be biased in favour of Wessex; hence it may not accurately convey the extent of power achieved by Offa, a Mercian. That power can be seen at work in charters dating from Offa's reign. Charters were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by the kings who had the authority to grant the land. A charter might record the names of both a subject king and his overlord on the witness list appended to the grant. Such a witness list can be seen on the Ismere Diploma, for example, where Æthelric, son of king Oshere of the Hwicce, is described as a [...] "subregulus", or subking, of Æthelbald's. The eighth-century monk and chronicler the Venerable Bede wrote a history of the English church called Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum; the history only covers events up to 731, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the major sources for Anglo-Saxon history it provides important background information for Offa's reign.|$|E
500|$|On the {{programming}} front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by [...] physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The {{program was a}} new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, [...] "dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code." [...] Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his work—he had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments. In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performers—Mercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network {{for more than a}} decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of The Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston. He played the part anonymously at first. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> chronicler put it, [...] "nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{scene is}} {{remarkable}} {{not only for}} its vividness <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> of the few parts of the Book of the Dead with any explicit moral content. The judgment of the dead and the Negative Confession were a representation of the conventional moral code which governed Egyptian society. For every [...] "I have not..." [...] in the Negative Confession, it is possible to read an unexpressed [...] "Thou shalt not". While the Ten Commandments of Judeo-Christian ethics are rules of conduct laid down by a perceived divine revelation, the Negative Confession is more a divine enforcement of everyday morality. [...] Views differ among Egyptologists about how far the Negative Confession represents a moral absolute, with ethical purity being necessary for progress to the Afterlife. John Taylor points out the wording of Spells 30B and 125 suggests a pragmatic approach to morality; by preventing the heart from contradicting him with any inconvenient truths, it seems that the deceased could enter the afterlife even if their life had not been entirely pure. Ogden Goelet says [...] "without an exemplary and moral existence, there was no hope for a successful afterlife", while Geraldine Pinch suggests that the Negative Confession is essentially similar to the spells protecting from demons, and that the success of the Weighing of the Heart depended on the mystical knowledge of the true names of the judges rather than on the deceased's moral behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Beretta E. Smith-Shomade, {{author of}} Shaded Lives: African-American Women and Television (2002), wrote that [...] "Jackson's {{impact on the}} music video sphere came largely through music sales successes, which afforded her more visual liberties and control. This {{assuming}} of control directly impacted the look and content of her music videos, giving Jackson an agency not assumed by many other artists—male or female, Black or White." [...] Parallel Lines: Media Representations of Dance (1993) documents that her videos have often been reminiscent of live concerts or elaborate musical theater. However, in her 30-minute Rhythm Nation 1814 film, Jackson utilizes street dancing techniques in contrast to traditional choreography. The group dynamic visually embodies a gender neutral equality, with Jackson [...] "performing asexually and anonymously in front of, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> {{of the members of}} the group." [...] Her music videos have also contributed to a higher degree of sexual freedom among young women, as Jean M. Twenge, author of Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled—and More Miserable Than Ever Before (2007), wrote [...] "usic videos by female artists have contributed to the trend" [...] of young women enganging in oral sex with Jackson [...] "heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man's head until he's in exactly the right position." [...] However, accusations of cosmetic surgery, skin lightening, and increasingly hypersexual imagery have led to her being viewed as conforming to a white, male-dominated view of sexuality, rather than liberating herself or others. Jackson received the MTV Video Vanguard Award for her contributions to the art form, and became the first recipient of the MTV Icon tribute, celebrating her impact on the music industry as a whole. In 2003, Slant Magazine named [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "Got 'til It's Gone" [...] among the 100 Greatest Music Videos of all time, ranked at number 87 and number 10, respectively. In 2011, [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] was voted the tenth best music video of the 1980s by Billboard.|$|E
500|$|Parallel Lines: Media Representations of Dance (1993) {{observed}} that in Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson represents a [...] "modern good fairy" [...] attempting to guide troubled youth {{to a more}} positive way of life. Each of the three segments serve a different purpose, beginning with affinity and companionship in [...] "Miss You Much", followed by anger and frustration in her rooftop solo and ending with [...] "Rhythm Nation", in which Jackson and her dancers [...] "have become a uniformed, formidable army, whose controlled energetic moves and shouts project a disciplined resolution to inspire others through dance and music." [...] Their group dynamic visually depicts a gender neutral equality, with Jackson [...] "performing asexually and anonymously in front of, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> {{of the members of}} the group." [...] It is also noted that the success of the film is not only the final product, but in the commercial and social implications of its development. In selecting an unknown street dancer, Anthony Thomas, to develop her choreography, [...] "Janet Jackson secures a threefold achievement: she satisfies the dictates of the commercial pop music industry by creating a dance image which is significantly different from her earlier work; she demonstrates that, despite fame, she is still in touch with contemporary youth pop culture and its fashions; and finally, she , not the dance traditions of Hollywood musical... but the work of a young black man whose training is outside the institutions of Western theatre and clearly an Afro-American cultural expression of the late 1980s." [...] The film received positive reception. Jefferson Graham in USA Today commented that [...] "she dances up a storm in the moody black-and-white video's three songs... and plays the role of a mystical figure to young kids." [...] Jon Pareles remarked that [...] " [...] juxtaposes her dance routines with grim urban imagery and a plot line about drugs versus dreams." [...] It was later released on VHS as the Rhythm Nation 1814 Compilation, and reissued the following year with each of the album's promotional music videos. Jackson received two MTV Music Video Award nominations for [...] "Best Dance Video" [...] and [...] "Best Choreography" [...] for [...] "Rhythm Nation", winning the latter.|$|E
