25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>duty</b> of the {{receiver}} was to realise {{value for the}} floating charge holder, although all preferential debts, or those with priority, {{would have to be}} paid. For other unsecured creditors, the possibility of recovering money was remote. The floating owed no duty to other creditors with regard to the timing of the appointment of a receiver, even if it could have an effect on negotiations for refinancing the business. It was accepted that a receiver had a duty to act only for the proper purpose of realising debts, and not for some ulterior motive. In Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd, a company had given floating charges to two banks (Westpac first, and First City Corp second). The directors, wishing to install a friendly figure in control asked Westpac to assign its floating charge to their friend Mr Russell, who proceeded to run the business with further losses of $500,000, and refused to pass control to First City Corp, even though they offered the company discharge of all the money owed under the first debenture. The Privy Council advised that Mr Russell, as administrative receiver, had acted for an improper purpose by refusing this deal. A further case of breach of duty occurred in Medforth v Blake where the administrative receiver of a pig farm ignored the former owner's advice on how to get discounts on pig food of £1000 a week. As a result, larger debts were run up. Sir Richard Scott VC held this was a breach of an equitable duty of exercising due diligence. However, a more general duty to creditors was tightly constrained, and general liability for professional negligence was denied to exist. In Silven Properties Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland a receiver of a property business failed to apply for planning permission on houses that could have significantly raised their value, and did not find tenants for the vacant properties, before selling them. It was alleged that the sales were at an undervalue, but the Court of Appeal held that {{the receiver}}'s power of sale was exercisable without incurring any undue expense. Everything was subordinate to the duty to the receiver to realise a good price. In this respect, an administrator is not capable of disregarding other creditors, at least in law. One {{of the reasons for the}} partial abolition of administrative receivership was that after the receiver had performed his task of realising assets for the floating charge holder, very little value was left in the company for other creditors because it appeared to have fewer incentives to efficiently balance all creditors' interests. Ordinarily, once the receiver's work was done, the company would go into liquidation.|$|E
2500|$|The 1923 {{advent of}} Primo de Rivera {{dictatorship}} brought national political {{life to a}} standstill: all parties have been dissolved. It seems that initially Larramendi welcomed the coup as doing away with a long overdue liberal democracy and a stepping stone towards Traditionalist monarchy, position fairly popular among the Carlists; his friend, Víctor Pradera, wholeheartedly engaged in building the regime structures. In late 1924 Larramendi addressed the military directorate with a letter; it contained congratulations on [...] "patriotic work" [...] and offered personal services. Another letter denied lack of understanding for [...] "movimiento regenerador de 13 de Septiembre"; written from clearly Jaimist positions, it praised the military for cracking down on [...] and bureaucracy, considered support for the government [...] "most <b>basic</b> <b>duty</b> of a citizen" [...] and even declared Alfonso XIII [...] "más fecunda encarnación de España".|$|E

5000|$|While {{corporate}} constitutions typically set out {{the balance}} of power between directors, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, additional duties are owed by members of the board to the corporation as a whole. First, rules can restrain or empower the directors in whose favor they exercise their discretion. While older corporate law judgments suggested directors had to promote [...] "shareholder value", most modern state laws empower directors to exercise their own [...] "business judgment" [...] in the way they balance the claims of shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders. Second, all state laws follow the historical pattern of fiduciary duties to require that directors avoid conflicts of interest between their own pursuit of profit, and the interests of the corporation. The exact standard, however, may be more or less strict. Third, many states require some kind of <b>basic</b> <b>duty</b> of care in performance of a director's tasks, just as minimum standards of care apply in any contract for services. However, Delaware has increasingly abandoned substantive objective duties, as it reinterpreted the content of the duty of care, allows liability waivers.|$|E

According to article 2 of the fund’s statute the primary objective of Lasso fund was: the upkeep of the common Schools in the city for the dissemination of Greek letters and enlightenment to all classes of citizens of both sexes, only from its interest, with the capital remaining untouched. Its harmonious management was presented as a <b>basic</b> <b>duty</b> of the community. In 1875, the [...] "General Regulations of the Common Foundation of the Town Korytsa (Korçë)" [...] were drafted and put into effect the next year.

5000|$|Replaced as Carlist {{political}} leader by marqués de Villores, Larramendi remained {{engaged in the}} party executive; his activity was related to dynastical issues rather than to daily business. In 1922 he represented Don Jaime’s sister, Doña Blanca, in court; wife {{to a member of}} the imperial Habsburg house she refused to recognize the Austrian republic and sought shelter in Spain. Larramendi presented her case when claiming the Spanish citizenship, resulting in a booklet titled Dictamen referente a la nacionalidad de S.A.R. Doña Blanca de Borbón y Borbón. His efforts were crowned with success and Doña Blanca with her family settled in Barcelona. In the future the episode would prove of great value for the Carloctavista dynastic claim, but no source clarifies whether in the early 1920s Larramendi considered her sons would-be claimants to the Spanish throne. It is confirmed, however, that he was acutely aware of the looming dynastical crisis. As Don Jaime, at that time in his early 50s, had no offspring, the Carlist branch was endangered with extinction. Larramendi kept advocating last-minute rescue mission by Don Jaime’s marriage with his niece; the scheme crashed when in 1922 Fabiola Massimo married an Italian aristocrat.The 1923 advent of Primo de Rivera dictatorship brought national political life to a standstill: all parties have been dissolved. It seems that initially Larramendi welcomed the coup as doing away with a long overdue liberal democracy and a stepping stone towards Traditionalist monarchy, position fairly popular among the Carlists; his friend, Víctor Pradera, wholeheartedly engaged in building the regime structures.

These particles can cause various harmful side effects when they circulate in the body. Injected glass particles can travel through the blood vessels to arrive at various organs, and cause inflammatory responses. They are known to cause blockages, embolism, tissue necrosis, and sepsis (Brewer and Dunning 1947; Shaw and Lyall 1985; Carbone-Traber and Shanks 1986; Preston and Hegadoren 2004).
