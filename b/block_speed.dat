Primary {{goal of the}} procedure is {{the determination of the}} jig shape of the wing necessary so that it deforms into its optimum shape in cruise flight. The wing twist and camber distribution is optimized for the cruise condition using WINGDES, a code based on a linearized potential flow solution for zero-thickness lifting surfaces. The structural design is decomposed into three levels. The top level uses the FLOPS aircraft synthesis program to generate preliminary weights, mission, and performance information. The optimization criterion is productivity expressed by a productivity index for the specified mission.

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} Drs. Giri and Vazquez's letter to the editors, "'Pick and Smear' Tissue Concentration Technique for Bloody Aspirates" (Acta Cytol 2001; 45 : 889 - 890). For some time now we have been practicing a similar technique. When we encounter bloody aspirates, we squirt a drop {{or two of the}} blood onto a glass slide and use the same needle to aspirate back as much blood in as little time as possible. Usually one sees tissue fragments, which we then "pick" off with the tip of the needle and transfer to fixative for preparation as a cell <b>block.</b> <b>Speed</b> is important {{to the success of the}} technique because if the blood clots, tissue fragments cannot be picked out, and the smears will be of inferior quality. Once the technique is mastered, the aspirator can usually repeat the procedure before rinsing the aspirate in formalin fixative. In this way, four smears and a cell block can be prepared. The advantages of this technique are threefold. First, squirting the material onto the glass slides means that no material is lost to the watch glass. Two, for the purpose of smearing, large tissue fragments are often inferior to minute, invisible ones. However, visible tissue fragments are superb for the cell block and reveal a surprising amount of architectural details, particularly when a 21 -gauge needle is used.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that bilingualism helps to offset age-related losses in certain executive processes such as inhibitory control, task switching and divided attention. The two studies presented in this dissertation investigated possible mechanisms underlying this bilingual advantage in executive control by examining the role of expectancies and goal maintenance in monolingual and bilingual younger (30 to 40 years) and older adults (60 to 80 years). In Chapter 2, the fadeout paradigm (Mayr & Liebscher, 2001) was used to examine differences in the ability to disengage from an irrelevant task cue. Testing began with single task blocks of shape and colour classifications presented separately, followed by a task switching block in which the two tasks alternated randomly. On trial 49, one of the tasks became irrelevant, leaving only a single task to perform. The critical variable was the point at which participants performance reflected this change by examining the number of trials required to return to single task <b>block</b> <b>speed.</b> Results showed that both younger and older bilinguals returned to single task block speeds sooner than monolinguals. The results were interpreted as showing that bilinguals were better able to use task cues to improve task performance and that outsourcing control to task cues may be beneficial. In Chapter 3, a dual modality classification paradigm was used to determine the speed at which two tasks could be executed {{at the same time as}} a means of measuring the ability to sustain task goals. The task required participants to simultaneously respond manually to visual stimuli and verbally to auditory stimuli. Results revealed that younger and older bilinguals showed smaller costs in responding to two tasks whereas monolinguals experienced larger delays in making their responses. Proportion analysis of dual task costs and pairs of responses revealed a bilingual advantage and did not show any age-related increases in costs. The results were interpreted as demonstrating the strength in goal maintenance in bilinguals, allowing them to establish a task goal, control interference from stimulus pairings in order to uphold the goal, and to manage multiple streams of information, and these abilities are sustained in aging...|$|E
40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the accuracy}} of the estimated mechanical speed and electromagnetic torque in a Direct Torque Controlled (DTC) induction motor drive with no speed measurement. A literature study has been performed in order to reveal new areas where the DTC technology can expand to, and this knowledge was compared with the accuracy data to determine the most feasible areas of expansion. The most promising new technique is to combine the DTC technique, with its estimation of speed, torque and power, with a model based method of estimating load state variables. If the load is observable using the DTC estimates, and the estimates are considered accurate enough for control purposes, this could potentially replace load process measurements such as mass flow or process pressure. A model based method could also increase the knowledge available about the load, leading to more efficient control methods and reduced energy consumption. A MATLAB Simulink model of the DTC drive was implemented using a DTC drive block from the SimPowerSystems library as basis. The original <b>block</b> <b>speed</b> controller relied on a speed measurement feedback, but a new speed, torque and flux estimator using only current and voltage measurements was implemented, and the speed measurement feedback replaced with a speed estimate feedback. Lab measurements from a preliminary project were analyzed and compared to the simulation setup results. A simplified transfer function from measured speed to DTC estimated speed is suggested. It is equal to the speed estimate low pass filter transfer function. Several analyses show this to be a good approximation. The unfiltered speed estimation is shown to have a very high accuracy of better than 0. 3 % error for applied load torque frequencies of up to 10 Hz, when the estimated data is used as input to frequency analyses. But the unfiltered speed signal also has a very high ripple, explaining the need for the low pass speed filter. The filtered speed estimate has some measurement errors, due to the damping in the speed filter. The estimated electromagnetic torque is very accurate, {{which is one of the}} strengths of DTC. The different parameters in the DTC setup, and their impact on the speed and torque estimates, were analyzed. The speed filter setting and the DTC speed sampling time was found to be the most important settings considering {{the accuracy of}} the speed estimation. Some improvements in the speed estimate calculation in the simulation model are suggested to improve the speed estimate. Improvements are also suggested for the ACS 800 DTC drive in the lab setup.

40|$|The {{recent and}} the {{proposed}} entry of new airlines both in the ‘no-frills’ and in the “full service” categories has completely changed the aviation scenario in India. Obviously this explosive increase in capacity will {{have a profound effect}} on the economy of the airlines both in the short term as well as in the long term. A growth of over 25 % per annum in passenger traffic may not be sustainable for long; thus galloping increase in capacity may result in mergers and strategic alliances of airlines on one side and closing down of some of the airlines on the other side. A point to be noted is that most of the new entrants also operate in the major trunk routes and serve the metros and the major cities. What appears to have not been tapped is the equally large potential in the regional and short haul sectors, which serve major, and small city pairs and also act as feeders to the major hubs. Realizing the importance of this, the government in its new civil aviation policy has given thrust to regional/ short-haul air travel. In this paper, an attempt is made to review the hierarchy of airline networks in India with respect to trunk, major and feeder routes. The air passenger traffic carried in each sector in terms of revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) is compared with upper class rail traffic. The present status of feeder airline services in India is outlined. It is pertinent to study the passenger traffic demand in these feeder routes as compared to upper class rail traffic as some percentage of upper class rail passengers are willing to shift to air travel due to marginal difference between airfare and upper class rail fare. The future RPKs are forecasted based on the actual RPKs (1999 - 2004 data) and the estimated RPKs (1999 - 2008) of earlier market survey. A suitable aircraft size for airline operations in these feeder routes is arrived at based on existing air traffic data by a simple method. A macroscopic measure is used to determine the aircraft demand by assuming average <b>block</b> <b>speed</b> and utilization for each aircraft type. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for various levels of traffic growth keeping in view the sharp increase of air travel in recent years and further growth in air traffic fuelled by feeder sector as the hinterland opens up industry, services and tourism. The approach followed in this report will help for assessing alternative fleet scenarios and possibly reflects a quick method of estimation of passenger traffic, aircraft and fleet size for serving feeder air network in India...|$|E

Methods: Sixty American Society of Anaesthesiologist′s physical status I and II patients undergoing elective hand, forearm and elbow surgery under brachial plexus block were randomly allocated to receive either 1. 5 % lidocaine (7 mg/kg) with adrenaline (1 : 200, 000) and 2 ml of normal saline (group C, n= 30) or 1. 5 % lidocaine (7 mg/kg) with adrenaline (1 : 200, 000) and 2 ml of dexamethasone (8 mg) (group D, n= 30). The block was performed using a nerve stimulator. Onset and duration of sensory and motor blockade were assessed. The sensory and motor blockade of radial, median, ulnar and musculocutaneous nerves were evaluated and recorded at 5, 10, 20, 120 min, and at every 30 min thereafter. Results: Two patients were excluded from the study because of block failure.
