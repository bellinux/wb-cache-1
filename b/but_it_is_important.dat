5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to improve one's {{way of life and}} conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{can only}} be used with older analog-only devices (using {{connections}} such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) {{by means of a}} digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive cables are only useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.|$|E
25|$|The V10 Brickhill Street {{is mainly}} a single carriageway, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in {{being one of}} the few that run {{continuously}} between the northern and the southern borders of the town. It is only a dual carriageway for 200 metres south of the H4 roundabout at Willen.|$|E

[...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not the [...] "central issue" [...] for him, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> {{enough to}} him that he [...] "devoted considerable time and energy to it." [...] However, as with many of his contemporaries, Potter's [...] "concern was moderate." ...|$|R
500|$|I {{responded to}} all these songs on an {{emotional}} level, when I first heard them. I wanted songs I felt I could tell with my own voice, and interpret them authentically ... <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to maintain the emotional integrity and {{the heart of the}} song. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a high priority to keep true to the songs.|$|R
25|$|As a result, since 1917, Trotskyism as a {{political}} theory is fully committed to a Leninist style of democratic centralist party organisation, which Trotskyists argue must {{not be confused with}} the party organisation as it later developed under Stalin. Trotsky had previously suggested that Lenin's method of organisation would lead to a dictatorship, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to emphasise that after 1917 orthodox Trotskyists argue that the loss of democracy in the Soviet Union was caused by the failure of the revolution to successfully spread internationally and the consequent wars, isolation and imperialist intervention, not the Bolshevik style of organisation.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} crisis in the 1990s has been widely cited in the Anglo-American press as a social democratic failure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to note not only did profit rates begin to fall worldwide after the 1960s, also this period saw neoliberal ascendance in Social Democratic ideology and policies {{as well as the}} rise of bourgeois coalition rule in place of the Social Democrats. 1980s Social Democratic neoliberal measures—such as depressing and deregulating the currency to prop up Swedish exports during the economic restructuring transition, dropping corporate taxation and taxation on high income-earners, and switching from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies—were exacerbated by international recession, unchecked currency speculation, and a centre-right government led by Carl Bildt (1991–1994), creating the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an element}} of truth to Dayan's claim, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to note that Israel {{regarded}} the de-militarized zones in the north as part of their sovereign territory and reserved the right to cultivate them—a right that the Syrians consistently resisted with force. Syria also worked to benefit from the Jordan river before it flowed into Israel, aiming to get use of it as a water source; Syria also actively supported Palestinian resistance movements against Israel. Israel occasionally exploited incidents in the de-militarized zones to strike at the Syrian water diversion project and to punish the Syrians for their support of the Palestinian resistance. Dayan's remarks must also be taken in context {{of the fact that he}} was a member of the opposition at the time. His attitude toward the Syrians changed dramatically once he became defense minister. Indeed, on June 8, 1967, Dayan bypassed both the Prime Minister and the Chief of staff in ordering the Israeli army to attack and capture the Golan.|$|E
40|$|TO ANYONE even vaguely {{interested}} in education, {{the appearance of}} A. S. Neill’s Summerhill must seem long overdue. The original Gollancz hard-back edition (1962) contained a foreword by Erich Fromm which <b>is</b> omitted here, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> more as a comment on Neill the man than {{as a prelude to}} the ideas which motivate him...|$|R
50|$|Some {{years later}} Schlink {{was living in}} a badly bombed Germany with few resources, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> for her to repent for Germany's cruel {{treatment}} of other nations during the war, especially the Jews. She felt the temptation to marry like other young women did. Instead she gave her mission the first priority, and so she became a Sister of Mary.|$|R

25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they sound very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound uncomfortable to the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E
500|$|On their website {{the team}} {{states that the}} 2014 annual NFL poll showing 71 percent support for the name, [...] "along with the poll taken among Native Americans by the Annenberg Institute, {{demonstrates}} continued, widespread and deep opposition to the Redskins changing our name... We respect {{the point of view}} of the small number of people who seek a name change, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to recognize very few people agree with the case they are making." ...|$|E
500|$|Narcissi {{are well}} suited for {{planting}} under small thickets of trees, {{where they can be}} grouped as 6–12 bulbs. They also grow well in perennial borders, especially in association with day lilies which begin to form their leaves as the narcissi flowers are fading. [...] A number of wild species and hybrids such as [...] "Dutch Master", [...] "Golden Harvest", [...] "Carlton", [...] "Kings Court" [...] and [...] "Yellow Sun" [...] naturalise well in lawns, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> not to mow the lawn till the leaves start to fade, since they are essential for nourishing the bulb for the next flowering season. Blue Scilla and Muscari which also naturalise well in lawns and flower {{at the same time as}} narcissus, make an attractive contrast to the yellow flowers of the latter. Unlike Tulips, narcissi bulbs are not attractive to rodents and are sometimes planted near tree roots in orchards to protect them.|$|E

50|$|Dennis {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the {{pioneering}} Multics project. His most important contribution to this project was the concept of the single-level memory. Multics was not fully successful as a commercial project, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> because <b>it</b> influenced the design of many other computer operating systems, including inspiration for Ken Thompson to design Unix. In recognition of his work on the Multics project, Dennis was elected as IEEE Fellow.|$|R

2500|$|In {{those who}} are low risk, {{the risk of death}} for {{caesarean}} sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world. The United Kingdom National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth [...] <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to remember the actual risk of death in either situation is extremely small in resource-rich settings.|$|E

Having visited them at their workplace for the first time, I took pictures to depict both, their profession and their personality. I decided on the spot on the photography method, the shooting place, and the lighting.

Said Hoffman of this assignment, [...] "I try not to feel anything when I am taking pictures of something unpleasant. I detach myself and concentrate on the picture. After seeing the camps, many of the war correspondents wanted to stop right there, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to continue and record everything." ...|$|R
50|$|Pohlin {{was also}} the author of the book Kraynske kroneke (The Carniolan Chronicles, 1770), which is {{considered}} the first work of historiography written in Slovene. In his monograph, republished and enlarged in 1788, Pohlin took as a source the Dalmatian humanist historian Mauro Orbini, who saw the Slavs as the most ancient people in Europe. Pohlin's historiographic work is considered of little worth <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> in boosting the ethnic consciousness of his contemporary countymen.|$|R
2500|$|Jade may be {{enhanced}} (sometimes called [...] "stabilized"). Note that some merchants will refer to these as grades, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> {{to bear in}} mind that degree of enhancement is different from colour and texture quality. In other words, Type A jadeite is not enhanced but can have poor colour and texture. There are three main methods of enhancement, sometimes referred to as the ABC Treatment System: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Horney we {{can have}} two views of our self: the [...] "real self" [...] and the [...] "ideal self". The real self is who and what we {{actually}} are. [...] The ideal self {{is the type of}} person we feel that we should be. The real self has the potential for growth, happiness, will power, realization of gifts, etc., but it also has deficiencies. The ideal self is used as a model to assist the real self in developing its potential and achieving self-actualization. (Engler 125) <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to know the differences between our ideal and real self.|$|E

50|$|Painter Thomas Eakins (1844-1916) felt {{a strong}} {{affinity}} toward Rush. As the 1876 Centennial Exposition approached, he painted {{two versions of}} a scene showing Rush carving his Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River (Water Nymph and Bittern). Eakins's portrayal of Rush using a nude model may not have <b>been</b> historically accurate, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to the painter, who made many preparatory sketches and even sculpted miniature wax figures {{of the people and}} statues in the paintings.|$|R

2500|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{aspect of the}} Moon is the contrast between its bright and dark zones. Lighter surfaces are the lunar highlands, which receive the name of terrae (singular terra, from the Latin for Earth), and the darker plains are called maria (singular mare, from the Latin for sea), after Johannes Kepler who introduced the name in the 17th century. The highlands are anorthositic in composition, whereas the maria are basaltic. The maria often coincide with the [...] "lowlands," [...] <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> {{to note that the}} lowlands (such as within the South Pole-Aitken basin) are not always covered by maria. The highlands are older than the visible maria, and hence are more heavily cratered.|$|E
2500|$|To the Indigenous {{peoples of}} the Pacific Northwest Coast, salmon is {{considered}} {{a vital part of}} the diet. Specifically, the indigenous peoples of Haida Gwaii, located near former Queen Charlotte Island in British Columbia, rely on salmon as one of their main sources of food, although many other bands have fished Pacific waters for centuries. Salmon are not only ancient and unique, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> because it is expressed in culture, art forms, and ceremonial feasts. Annually, salmon spawn in Haida, feeding on everything on the way upstream and down. Within the Haida nation, salmon is referred to as [...] "tsiin", and is prepared in several ways including smoking, baking, frying, and making soup.|$|E
2500|$|True Muslims should {{maintain}} a [...] "sense of supremacy" [...] and [...] "superiority," [...] {{on the road}} of renewal, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> that they also prepare themselves for a [...] "life until death in poverty, difficulty, frustration, torment and sacrifice", [...] and even to brace themselves for possibility of death by torture {{at the hands of}} Jahiliyyah's sadistic, arrogant, mischievous, criminal and degraded people. [...] Qutb ends his book by an example of persecution against Muslims from the Quran's [...] "surat Al-Burooj", enjoining modern-day Muslims to endure the same or worse tortures for the sake of carrying out God's will.
