40|$|Background: Training of lay refugees/internally {{displaced}} persons (IDPs) and deploying {{them to provide}} basic health services to other women, children, and families in camps {{is perceived to be}} associated with public health benefits. However, there is limited evidence to support this hypothesis. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions to train and deploy lay refugees and/or IDPs for the provision of <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> to other women, children, and families in camps. Methods: PubMed, Science and Social Science Citation Indices, PsycINFO, EMBASE, POPLINE, CINAHL, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched (from inception to June 30, 2014) with the aim of identifying studies that reported the effects of interventions that trained and deployed lay refugees and/or IDPs for the provision of <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> to other women, children, and families in camps. Two investigators independently reviewed all titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant articles. Discrepancies were resolved by repeated review, discussion, and consensus. Study quality assessment was undertaken using standard protocols. Results: Ten studies (five cross-sectional, four pre-post, and one post-test only) conducted in Africa (Guinea and Tanzania), Central America (Belize), and Asia (Myanmar) were included. The studies demonstrated some positive impact on population health associated with training and deployment of trained lay refugees/IDPs as health workers in camps. Reported effects included increased service coverage, increased knowledge about disease symptoms and prevention, increased adoption of improved treatment seeking and protective behaviors, increased uptake of services, and improved access to reproductive health information. One study, which assessed the effect of peer refugee health education on sexual and reproductive health, did not demonstrate a marked reduction in unintended pregnancies among refugee/IDP women. Conclusion: Although available evidence suggests a positive impact of training and deployment of lay refugees/IDPs as health workers in camps, existing body of evidence is weak, and calls for a re-examination of current practices. Interventions that promote training and deployment of lay refugees/IDPs as health workers in camps should include strong evaluation components in order to facilitate assessment of effects on population health...|$|E
40|$|With the {{objective}} of choosing a practical and valid method to delimit health service areas of regional health service centres to build a regional <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> network, we first drew lessons from traditional geographic methods of delimiting trade areas and then applied two methods to delimit health service areas, i. e. the proximal method and the gravity method. We verified {{the effectiveness of these}} methods by an index of similarity with the aid of real in-patient data. Calculation of the similarity indices shows that health service areas delimited by the proximal method has an 87. 3 % similarity to the real health service area, while the gravity method gives 88. 6 %. Our conclusion is that both methods are suitable for delimiting health service areas at regional health service centres, but find that the proximal method is more practicable in operational terms for delimiting health service areas in region health planning...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{relationship}} between education and health that are accepted {{as an indicator of}} human capital and economic growth is tested empirically. The study aimed at decomposing {{the relationship}} between human capital (using health index and education index as a proxy) and economic growth using time series data from 1971 - 2011 in Ethiopia using modern econometrics technique. Long-run relationship among variables is confirmed through Johnson co-integration analysis whereas the long-run and short-run dynamics are observed by VECM specification. For causality purpose VECM based causality tests are employed. The finding indicates {{that in the long run}} investment on education and health would affect further economic growth. Hence policy makers and / or the government should strive to create institutional capacity that increase school enrolment and improved <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> by strengthening the infrastructure of educational and health institutions that produce quality manpower.

Study Design – Data on residents aged 21 - 65 who live in Canada’s North are drawn from the 2000 - 01 and 2004 - 05 Canadian Community Health Surveys and the 2001 Aboriginal People’s Survey. Methods – Multivariate Logistic regression analysis is applied to 1) a set of health behaviors including smoking, binge drinking and obesity, and 2) a set of <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use measures including consultations with a physician and with any medical professional, Pap smear testing and mammography. Results – Higher smoking and binge drinking rates and lower rates of female cancer screening among Inuit are not accounted for by differences in demographic characteristics, education, location of residence or distance from a hospital. Conclusions – Factors specific to Inuit individuals and communities may be contributing to negative health behaviors associated with increased cancer risk, and to a lower incidence of diagnostic cancer screening. Policy interventions to address these issues may need to be targeted specifically to Inuit Canadians. Inuit, aboriginal, cancer screening, smoking, health...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} 2012 - 13 Victorian General Audit report provides {{details on}} consumer participation within the Victorian health care system. Consumers should be meaningfully involved in decision-making about their healthcare and treatment, and broader health policy, planning and service delivery. There is genuine commitment and effort from the Department of Health {{and health services}} to facilitate meaningful consumer participation. The department has led implementation of consumer participation through strong policy direction and this has translated into appropriate policies, systems and activities in the four audited health services. Implementing consumer participation is relatively recent and a challenging process, and health services do not always provide sufficient staff training, resources or support to integrate consumer participation across their organisation. Consequently, achievements both between and within health services vary. There are opportunities to enhance consumer participation at all levels, including better supporting consumers to understand and engage with <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> information, and better involving consumers in organisational strategic planning and evaluation. This will become increasingly important as new national accreditation standards are implemented from January 2013, with significantly higher expectations and evidence requirements for consumer participation. The department’s leadership has firmly placed consumer participation {{on the agenda of}} Victoria’s public health services. However, to further improve, the department needs to address gaps in its own implementation of consumer participation, provide better oversight of health services’ consumer participation activities and evaluate the impact of its main consumer participation policy...|$|E
40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study examined potential demand-side barriers to women’s use of basic health services in rural southern Egypt (Upper Egypt). Face-to-face interviews with a structured questionnaire {{were carried out}} on 205 currently-married women, inquiring about their use of health facilities: regular antenatal care (ANC) during the last pregnancy and medical treatment services when they suffered from common illness. Questions about their perceptions of barriers {{to the use of}} health services were categorized into three primary dimensions: structural, financial, and personal/cultural barriers. Distance and transportation to health facilities (structural barriers) prevented about 30 % of the women from seeing a doctor. Forty-two percent of them felt the difficulty paying for health services (financial barriers). Approximately a quarter of women answered that gaining family permission, allocating time to go to health facilities, or concern about lack of female physicians (personal/cultural barriers) was a big problem for them. After controlling for potential confounding factors, structural barriers showed an inverse association with the use of health services. Financial barriers indicated a strong association (OR= 0. 18, P< 0. 001) with the use of curative services (medical treatment), but not with the use of preventive services (regular ANC). Contrary to our expectation, personal/cultural barriers had no statistical significance with women’s use of health services. Although the Egyptian government had successfully extended <b>basic</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> delivery networks throughout the country, women in rural Upper Egypt were still facing various barriers {{to the use of the}} services, especially structural and financial barriers...|$|E
