5|$|Tesla read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, {{he would be able to}} envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.|$|E

25|$|When Chris dies, he {{experiences}} {{symptoms of}} a near death experience. As pain gradually leaves his body, he observes a tunnel of light and views his dead body from above, connected to himself by a silver cord. He then experiences his life flashing <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> as the events in his life unfold in reverse. This last experience occurs again later, much more slowly, while he's a ghost. Albert later compares it to purgatory, {{a time when people}} are forced to re-examine their lives without rationalization.|$|E

25|$|Another subject given 4mg {{complained of}} “chest oppression” and that “a load is {{pressing}} {{down from above}} and my body feels heavy.” The subject also reported “numbness of the entire body” and “a pleasant Martini feeling-my body is taking charge of my mind”. The subject reported he saw red spots passing <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and red-purple spots on the floor, and the floor seemed very close to his face. Within 2 minutes these visual effects were gone, and replaced by a yellow haze, {{as if he were}} looking through a lens filter.|$|E
25|$|Among {{several other}} awards in the {{following}} years, in 1903 Dunant was given an honorary doctorate by the medical faculty of the University of Heidelberg. He lived {{in the nursing home}} in Heiden until his death. In the final years of his life, he suffered from depression and paranoia about pursuit by his creditors and Moynier. There were even days when Dunant insisted that the cook of the nursing home first taste his food <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to protect him against possible poisoning. In his final years, he spurned and attacked Calvinism and organized religion generally. He was said to be agnostic.|$|E
25|$|Just then, {{disaster}} struck. Further {{south along}} the center of Bragg's line, Federal troops under General Thomas smashed through Confederate positions {{at the base of}} the ridge, sweeping up the hill and driving Bragg's men before them. With his army disintegrating <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> Bragg ordered Cleburne to hold the Federals off long enough to let the rest of his men escape. The 33rd Alabama attacked approaching skirmishers in the gathering darkness, allowing the remainder of Bragg's army to cross Chickamauga Creek to the east, and retreat into Georgia. Since his forces had held more-or-less together during the rout, Cleburne now found his divisionincluding the 33rd Alabamaserving as the rearguard of the Army of Tennessee.|$|E

25|$|Nicholas's life passes <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he falls. He smashes {{through a}} glass roof and lands on a giant air bag. Emergency medical {{technicians}} carefully remove him, and he finds himself in a ballroom full of his friends, family, and every figure involved in his Game; it had been just a game all along. Conrad is alive and well, and explains that he initiated the game to get his brother to embrace life and not to end up like their father. Nicholas bursts into tears, relaxes, and begins to enjoy the party once his shock has dissipated. When he sees that Christine has left the party, he follows her outside to her cab. He asks her to dinner, and she offers to share a coffee with him before her flight takes her to her next game assignment in Australia.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November 2002, the {{oil tanker}} Prestige split {{in half and}} sank in the Atlantic Ocean, after having had a huge leak in its tanks. A few days later, Man woke up to find his life ruined by an oil spill. Tons of oil had washed {{up on the beach}} where he lived. Most of his sculptures were irremediably {{destroyed}} and the oil even reached his house. Man was absolutely devastated, his whole life work destroyed <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and the natural environment where he lived heavily polluted for years to come. A month later, he was found dead in his hut. He had circulatory and respiratory problems, but most local people believe that he died of melancholy and sadness {{at the sight of the}} complete and utter destruction of his life by the oil spill. The Camelle authorities organized and paid for his funeral, and hundreds of locals attended.|$|E
25|$|A {{version of}} the modern Vision {{appeared}} in Earth X. Vision and the Avengers were fighting the Absorbing Man who had absorbed the intelligence of Ultron, giving him enhanced intelligence and better control over his powers. Vision watched as his teammates and wife the Scarlet Witch were slaughtered <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> In response, the Vision downloaded a computer virus into the Absorbing Man. When the Absorbing Man tried to purge the virus by shrinking and changing into stone, the Vision smashed him into pieces. In order to prevent the Absorbing Man from being reborn, the Vision had the parts of Creel distributed among various loners and reclusive super-heroes. When Tony Stark created a group of Iron Avengers, robots based on Stark technology and modeled after the deceased Avengers, the Vision was tapped as the group's leader. He would lead the Iron Avengers and defend them from such threats as the parasitic Hydra, Asgardian Frost Giants, and the Skull's invading army.|$|E

25|$|All seems lost until Independences Armadillo arrives. With A.J. at the controls, {{they reach}} the {{required}} depth for the bomb. However, flying debris from the asteroid damages the triggering device, requiring someone to stay behind to manually detonate the bomb. The crew draw straws and A.J. is selected. As he and Harry exit the airlock, Harry rips off A.J.'s air hose and shoves him back inside, telling him {{that he is the}} son Harry never had and gives his blessing to marry Grace. Harry contacts Grace to bid his final farewell. After some last minute difficulties involving both the shuttle engines and the detonator, the Freedom moves to a safe distance and Harry triggers the detonation while his life flashes <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> The bomb successfully splits the asteroid, avoiding the collision with Earth. Freedom safely returns to Earth, and the surviving crew are treated as heroes. A.J. and Grace get married, with photos of Harry and the other lost crew members present.|$|E

500|$|Ramanujan {{has been}} {{described}} as a person of a somewhat shy and quiet disposition, a dignified man with pleasant manners. He lived a rather Spartan life at Cambridge. Ramanujan's first Indian biographers describe him as a rigorously orthodox Hindu. He credited his acumen to his family goddess, Mahalakshmi of Namakkal. He looked to her for inspiration in his work and said he dreamed of blood drops that symbolised her male consort, Narasimha. Afterward he would receive visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He often said, [...] "An equation for me has no meaning unless it represents a thought of God." ...|$|E

500|$|That evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her {{and they}} fall asleep {{together}} in an embrace. Kelvin later causes her to panic by suddenly leaving the room and shutting the door behind him. [...] She hysterically tears {{her way through the}} room's metal door, severely cutting herself. [...] Before he can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) calls for a meeting, and Kelvin introduces Hari as his wife. [...] In their symposium, the scientists explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. [...] The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. [...] Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of [...] "neutrino systems" [...] but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of an offscreen device known as [...] "the annihilator".|$|E
500|$|Engel {{obtained}} {{stories from}} moderately well-known science fiction names for both issues, including John Jakes, Mack Reynolds, Jack Vance, and Raymond F. Jones, {{but many of}} the stories were [...] "barrel-scrapings" [...] from the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, {{in the words of one}} historian; most had already been rejected at the other active science fiction markets. Space SF also published Arthur C. Clarke's [...] "Critical Mass", one of the popular [...] "White Hart" [...] stories. It had already appeared in a 1949 edition of a British magazine, Lilliput, but Clarke revised it for this publication. Overall, in the words of Mike Ashley, [...] "... carried stories by noted sf writers, [...] they read like rejects from better magazines, and there was nothing of lasting value". Ashley comments that the best story was Jakes's [...] "The Devil Spins a Sun-Dream", which was atmospheric if poorly plotted; the protagonist, a human prospector on Mars, finds a fabulous city, but an ancient booby-trap destroys it <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
500|$|Homer gets Lurleen a gig on {{a country}} western {{television}} series called Ya-Hoo! Just before her performance, Homer and Lurleen {{spend the night in}} her mobile home, and she shows him one of her new songs. In the song she asks Homer to [...] "bunk" [...] with her, but Homer knows that would violate his marital vows and leaves. During her performance, Homer is approached by a business agent who asks to buy Lurleen's contract, but Homer refuses. In Lurleen's dressing room, Homer becomes locked in an embrace with her, then describes how his love life is flashing <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> Homer tells Lurleen that he only wanted to share her voice with the world and leaves before he does anything to lose his family. He again runs into the agent and this time sells Lurleen's contract for US $50. At home, Marge is watching the Ya-Hoo! show when Homer returns. When Homer gets into bed, Marge hears what Homer did through Lurleen's bluesy song on the television which Lurleen concludes by saying she knows how lucky Marge is.|$|E

500|$|American Beauty {{follows a}} {{traditional}} narrative structure, only deviating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky {{from the middle}} of the story. Although the plot spans one year, the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death. Jacqueline Furby says that the plot [...] "occupies no time [...] all time", citing Lester's claim that life did not flash <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> but that it [...] "stretches on forever like an ocean of time". Furby argues that a [...] "rhythm of repetition" [...] forms the core of the film's structure. For example, two scenes have the Burnhams sitting down to an evening meal, shot from the same angle. Each image is broadly similar, with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester's new-found assertiveness. Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other. Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra, and the image is reversed later for a similarly [...] "voyeuristic and exhibitionist" [...] scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment.|$|E
500|$|The novel leaves readers {{uncertain}} whether Joe Christmas or Joe Brown is the murderer. Brown is Christmas' business partner in bootlegging and is leaving Joanna's burning house when a passing farmer stops {{to investigate and}} pull Joanna's body from the fire. The sheriff at first suspects Joe Brown, but initiates a manhunt for Christmas after Brown claims that Christmas is black. The manhunt is fruitless until Christmas arrives undisguised in Mottstown, a neighboring town; he {{is on his way}} back to Jefferson, no longer running. In Mottstown, he is arrested and [...] jailed, then moved to Jefferson. His grandparents arrive in town and visit Gail Hightower, the disgraced former minister of the town and friend of Byron Bunch. Bunch tries to convince Hightower to give the imprisoned Joe Christmas an alibi, but Hightower initially refuses. Though his grandfather wants Christmas lynched, his grandmother visits him in the Jefferson jail and advises him to seek help from Hightower. As police escort him to the local court, Christmas breaks free and runs to Hightower's house. A childishly cruel white vigilante, Percy Grimm, follows him there and, over Hightower's protest, shoots and castrates Christmas. Having redeemed himself at last, Hightower is then depicted as falling into a deathlike swoon, his whole life flashing <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> including the past adventures of his Confederate grandfather, who was killed while stealing chickens from a farmer's shed.|$|E
500|$|Much {{has been}} made of the {{fragmented}} editing of Don't Look Now, and Nicolas Roeg's work in general. Time is presented as 'fluid', where the past, present and future can all exist in the same timeframe. [...] John's premonitions merge with the present, such as {{at the start of the}} film where the mysterious red-coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides, and when he 'sees' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present, but in fact it is a vision of the future. [...] The most famous use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene, in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to go out to dinner. After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments, the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback, which may be perceived as his life flashing <b>before</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> At a narrative level the plot of Don't Look Now can be regarded as a self-fulfilling prophecy: it is John's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death. According to the editor of the film, Graeme Clifford, Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his [...] "exercise in film grammar".|$|E
