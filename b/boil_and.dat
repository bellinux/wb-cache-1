25|$|When the Leviathan is hungry, reports Rabbi Dimi in {{the name}} of Rabbi Johanan, he sends forth from his mouth a heat so great as to make all the waters of the deep <b>boil,</b> <b>and</b> if he would put his head into Paradise no living {{creature}} could endure the odor of him.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{in order}} to clarify the heat {{transfer}} characteristics of the subcooled pool <b>boiling</b> <b>and</b> to discuss its mechanism, a <b>boiling</b> <b>and</b> condensation model for numerical simulation on subcooled boiling phenomenon has been developed. The developed <b>boiling</b> <b>and</b> condensation model consists of the improved phase-change model and the relaxation time based on the quasi-thermal equilibrium hypothesis. Three dimensional numerical simulations based on the MARS (Multi-interface Advection and Reconstruction Solver) with the developed <b>boiling</b> <b>and</b> condensation model have been conducted for a nucleated bubble growth process in the subcooled pool boiling. The numerical simulation results showed in good agreement with the experimental observations. Therefore, the developed <b>boiling</b> <b>and</b> condensation model is validated for the prediction of the subcooled pool boiling phenomena...|$|R

25|$|At {{the height}} of the trade, Makassans visited {{thousands}} of kilometres of Australian coastline, arriving with the monsoon season each December.

25|$|Zucchini has a {{delicate}} flavor and requires {{little more than}} quick cooking with butter or olive oil, with or without fresh herbs. The skin is left in place. Quick cooking of barely wet zucchini in oil or butter allows the fruit to partially <b>boil</b> <b>and</b> steam, with the juices concentrated in the final moments of frying when the water has gone, prior to serving. Zucchini can also be eaten raw, sliced or shredded, in a cold salad, as well as lightly cooked in hot salads, as in Thai or Vietnamese recipes. Mature (larger sized) zucchini are well suited for cooking in breads. Zucchinis can be cut with a spiralizer to make zucchini noodles for low-carbohydrate recipes.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly to a <b>boil</b> <b>and</b> then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of}} the soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 37 reviews. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the album {{one of her}} strongest efforts. Jim Carroll from The Irish Times hailed M.I.A. as [...] "a musical super-sharpshooter with an incredible ear for hard-bodied pop tracks (Bad Girls, Come Walk With Me, Exodus) that <b>boil</b> <b>and</b> steam the most mutant genres into submission." [...] Gavin Haynes of the NME wrote, [...] "MIA takes the basic template of right-now chart music and subverts it by forcing it to work triple time". He continued, [...] "Beats are constantly morphing, and every track chucks handfuls of sonic debris at you", Likewise, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "Like the woman who made it, Matangi is hugely inventive and a bit exhausting: if it's hard to take in anything other than small doses, you can't help but be glad it exists". However, Petridis also acknowledged the abrasiveness of the album's sonic scope: [...] "More characteristic is , an unyielding, punishing rhythmic assault on which the only semblance of a tune comes from a distorted electronic horn section". He {{then goes on to}} admit that [...] "in a way, that's the highest compliment you can pay her: a decade into her career, MIA still doesn't sound like anyone else." ...|$|E

2500|$|Puddling is {{the process}} of {{stirring}} pig iron with iron bars, exposing it to the air so that the carbon in the pig iron is oxidized and burns off. [...] This process creates steel. As practiced in the early and mid-19th century, puddling required great strength as well as skill. Because chemical testing of the molten iron had not yet been developed, puddlers relied on their long experience with steelmaking to determine whether {{too much or too little}} carbon had been oxidized. Puddling was also an extremely dangerous trade, as some steel processes required the molten metal to <b>boil</b> <b>and</b> bubble as the puddler stirred in scrap iron and puddlers were required to physically remove slag and drain pure steel out of furnaces for additional processing.|$|E
