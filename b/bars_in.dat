5|$|Chopin's {{influence}} is marked {{in the first}} two pieces.

5|$|The {{proportions}} {{were chosen}} arbitrarily {{in all but}} the last four pieces in the cycle: sonatas XIII and XVI use symmetrical proportions, and sonatas XIV and XV share the 2, 2, 3, 3 proportion. This symmetry, and the adherence of all four sonatas to the ten-bar unit, were explained by Cage as an expression of tranquility. The complexity of proportions prompted Cage to use asymmetric musical phrases and somewhat frequent changes of time signature to achieve both microscopic and macroscopic correlation. For example, unit length of 8½ in the first section of Sonata III is achieved by using six <b>bars</b> <b>in</b> 2/2 time and two in 5/4 (rather than eight <b>bars</b> <b>in</b> 2/2 and one in 1/2). In many sonatas the microstructure—how the melodic lines are constructed—deviates slightly from the pre-defined proportion.|$|E

5|$|Designed as the {{commercial}} heart of San Marco, the square had declined seriously by the 1970s, with many businesses closing. The original, compass-themed fountain was demolished. In the 1990s the City of Jacksonville undertook a major renovation and streetscaping project, which included restoring the fountain with three lion statues {{inspired by the}} Piazza San Marco. Since then, the square has become a popular commercial destination with many shops, restaurants and <b>bars.</b> <b>In</b> 2013 the square underwent another renovation project that rerouted the streets and expanded the small park in the center, named Balis Park, into a larger pedestrian green space.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab <b>bars</b> <b>in</b> bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these bank acquisitions, UBS also acquired an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss precious metal refinery founded in 1951, through whom they started to issue UBS branded gold <b>bars.</b> <b>In</b> 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership only to withdraw by 1999 with ownership of the refinery changing to Hereaus & Management. Nevertheless, UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which is famous for the unique kinebar holographic technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, the third section is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. Here, for the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 <b>bars</b> <b>in</b> length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues form and the next two measures extend the subdominant as a transition into the last ten bars.|$|E

5|$|Stone and Judy {{convinced}} {{the managers of}} two <b>bars</b> <b>in</b> Seattle, Washington, to set up Donkey Kong machines. The managers initially showed reluctance, but when they saw sales of $30 a day—or 120 plays—for a week straight, they requested more units. In their Redmond headquarters, a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa, his wife Yoko, James, Judy, Phillips and Stone set about gutting 2,000 surplus Radar Scope machines and converting them with Donkey Kong motherboards and power supplies from Japan. The game officially went on sale in July 1981. Actor Harris Shore created the first live-action Mario in the television commercials for Colecovision's hand-held Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong, Junior video games.|$|E
5|$|The Henschel version used a {{conventional}} hull design with sloped armour resembling {{the layout of}} the Panther tank. It had a rear-mounted engine and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimeter-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on transverse torsion <b>bars,</b> <b>in</b> a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls, the wheels were only overlapping without being interleaved — the full Schachtellaufwerk rubber-rimmed roadwheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the TigerI and Panther.|$|E
