5|$|The {{question}} of whether Deckard {{is intended to be}} a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release. Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to <b>be</b> <b>human,</b> while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity. Ridley Scott has confirmed that in his vision, Deckard is a replicant.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} door of the house that appear to <b>be</b> <b>human.</b> Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house in order to get to Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at {{the ruins}} of Los Angeles, Marcus {{encounters}} Kyle and a mute child named Star (Berry) during a violent skirmish with Skynet's machines. Kyle and Star are subsequently abducted and taken prisoner by Skynet. Later, two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Wright locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Bloodgood). They then {{make their way to}} John's base, where thereafter, Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is indeed a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to <b>be</b> <b>human,</b> John and his wife Kate think that Marcus has been sent to execute him and orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain; Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets him live.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to <b>be</b> <b>human</b> bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that one piece of bone was human but it did not belong to Natalee.|$|E

25|$|Examples of poor {{definition}} are {{the statements}} a <b>human</b> <b>is</b> an animal, {{combined with the}} statement that apes and reptiles are animals. If those statements are reversed, then animal <b>is</b> <b>human,</b> and so it is that the syllogism apes and reptiles <b>are</b> <b>human</b> results in a logical fallacy. A further example: if a <b>human</b> <b>is</b> a two-eyed animal, then a syllogism can result in the fallacy a buffalo <b>is</b> also <b>human.</b>|$|R
5|$|The game's {{story and}} its ending have been open to much interpretation; the ending was {{purposely}} left vague and unanswered by Playdead. It {{was compared to}} other open-ended books, films and video games, where the viewer is left to interpret what they have read or seen. Some reviews suggested that the game is {{a representation of the}} religious nature of Limbo or purgatory, as the boy character completes the journey only to end at the same place he started, repeating the same journey when the player starts a new game. Another interpretation suggested the game is the boy's journey through Hell to reach Heaven, or to find closure for his sister's death. Another theory considers that either the boy or his sister or both are dead. Some theories attempted to incorporate details from the game, such as the change in setting as the boy travels through the game suggesting the progression of man from child to adult to elder, or the similarities and differences between the final screen of the game where the boy meets a girl and the main menu where what could <b>be</b> <b>human</b> remains stand in their places.|$|E

The campaign sold T-shirts stating [...] "women's rights <b>are</b> <b>human</b> rights" [...] at her campaign store, in reference to her speech. The campaign also sold a bag that featured the full phrase [...] "Human rights are women's rights and women's rights <b>are</b> <b>human</b> rights"; on the bag it was shown in six languages. As well, the campaign sold a Tory Burch T-shirt featuring the phrase [...] "women's rights <b>are</b> <b>human</b> rights..." [...] in capital letters. The campaign also created photo references and displays of items necessary for five Halloween costumes, including [...] "'Women’s rights <b>are</b> <b>human</b> rights' Hillary".|$|R
25|$|Some of the {{putative}} regions encode transporter proteins such as OCTN1 and OCTN2. Other potential regions involve cell scaffolding proteins {{such as the}} MAGUK family.

25|$|When one is {{reminded}} of true beauty {{by the sight}} of a beautiful boy, he is called a lover. While all have seen reality, as they must have to <b>be</b> <b>human,</b> not all are so easily reminded of it. Those that can remember are startled when they see a reminder, and are overcome with the memory of beauty.|$|E
25|$|Through the {{humanities}} we {{reflect on the}} fundamental question: What {{does it mean to}} <b>be</b> <b>human?</b> The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world where irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.|$|E

25|$|A 16-year-old youth, {{whose parents}} were friends of Gein and who {{attended}} ball games and movies with him, reported that Gein kept shrunken heads in his house, which Gein had described as relics from the Philippines, sent by a cousin who had served on the islands during World War II. Upon investigation by the police, these were determined to <b>be</b> <b>human</b> facial skins, carefully peeled from corpses and used by Gein as masks.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} a kind of {{military}} racism, or species-ism. The Mushrooms are clearly described as different, although they would seem to <b>be</b> <b>human,</b> to some extent. However, when it comes to battle, the Mushrooms are treated like non-humans or animals—alien. Killing them is necessary, impersonal, and raises no questions of conscience. The Minnipins feel no pity for their enemy, even as the story describes the shrieks from the Mushrooms as they are killed.|$|E
25|$|At the bayou, Tiana and Naveen meet Louis, a trumpet-playing {{alligator}} who {{longs to}} <b>be</b> <b>human,</b> and Ray, a Cajun firefly {{who is in}} love with the morning star, whom he calls Evangeline.

Meanwhile, Facilier makes a deal with the voodoo spirits, offering them the souls of the people of New Orleans in exchange for finding Naveen.|$|E

25|$|A {{critical}} review of ancient DNA literature {{through the development}} of the field highlights that few studies after about 2002 have succeeded in amplifying DNA from remains older than several hundred thousand years. A greater appreciation for the risks of environmental contamination and studies on the chemical stability of DNA have resulted in concerns being raised over previously reported results. The dinosaur DNA was later revealed to <b>be</b> <b>human</b> Y-chromosome, while the DNA reported from encapsulated halobacteria has been criticized based on its similarity to modern bacteria, which hints at contamination. A 2007 study also suggests that these bacterial DNA samples may not have survived from ancient times, but may instead be the product of long-term, low-level metabolic activity.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo's success, the entire show was {{overhauled}} in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo started to walk and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four like a normal dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the new Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo format now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute Scooby and Scrappy cartoons, who in previous Scooby series had been revealed to <b>be</b> <b>human</b> criminals in costume, were now real {{within the context of}} the series.|$|E
25|$|The de Ménils, however, did {{not limit}} their {{acquisitions}} to modern art, and their eclectic tastes became {{a hallmark of}} their collecting practices. As modernists, they recognized the profound formal and spiritual connections between contemporary works {{of art and the}} arts of ancient and indigenous cultures, broadening their collection to include works from classical Mediterranean and Byzantine cultures, as well as objects from Africa, Oceania, and the Pacific Northwest. Influenced by the teachings of Father Couturier and Father Congar, the de Menils developed a particular humanist ethos in which they understood art as a central part of the human experience. Their collection was motivated by their shared interest in the many ways individuals over different cultures and eras reveal through art their understanding {{of what it means to}} <b>be</b> <b>human.</b>|$|E
