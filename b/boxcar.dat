5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, <b>boxcar</b> scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. <b>Boxcar</b> scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and <b>boxcar</b> scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E
5|$|In {{the desert}} near a Navajo Indian {{reservation}} in Two Grey Hills, New Mexico, {{a teenage boy}} comes across a <b>boxcar</b> buried in the ground. He retrieves the corpse of an alien-like figure from the <b>boxcar,</b> which he takes back to the reservation and presents it to the residents, including Navajo elder Albert Hosteen.|$|E

Hosteen introduces Mulder to his grandson, who drives him to the buried <b>boxcar.</b> Just before he heads in, he is called by the Smoking Man, {{who is able to}} trace Mulder's location through the call. Mulder heads inside the <b>boxcar,</b> finding a pile of the dead creatures, each with smallpox vaccination scars on their arms. The Smoking Man arrives by helicopter with eight armed commandos and, not finding Mulder inside, orders the <b>boxcar</b> to be burned.|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} 1833 in England, specially-padded <b>boxcars</b> {{equipped}} with feeding and water apparatus were constructed specifically for transporting draft and sport horses. In the United States, however, horses generally traveled in conventional stock cars or ventilated <b>boxcars.</b> Early on, {{the need for}} improved methods for tethering horses in <b>boxcars,</b> {{while at the same}} time allowing a horse enough room to maintain its balance while in transit, was recognized.|$|R

Cigarette Smoking Man begins searching for the tape and visits Mulder's father, who calls Mulder to see him shortly afterwards. Before he can reveal anything to Mulder however, he is murdered by Alex Krycek. Scully brings Mulder to New Mexico where she introduces him to Albert Hosteen, a code-talker who can translate the digital tape. Albert's grandson shows Mulder a <b>boxcar</b> filled with alien corpses. Cigarette Smoking Man tracks Mulder's location however and orders the <b>boxcar</b> burned.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Great Notch station, which was falling into disrepair, {{received}} a new paint job, {{changed from the}} red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad paint scheme. The abandoned tool shed made {{out of the old}} wooden <b>boxcar</b> was also removed. Due to the removal of the tool <b>boxcar,</b> the propane tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great Notch station lay abandoned. In June 1979, the State of New Jersey began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great Notch. Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On January 20, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great Notch Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities.|$|E

5|$|Hershey's {{experience}} with Scorsese {{was extended to}} another major role for her 16 years later in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) as Mary Magdalene. During the filming of <b>Boxcar</b> Bertha, Hershey had introduced Scorsese to the Nikos Kazantzakis novel on which the latter film was based. That collaboration resulted in an Academy Award nomination for the director and a Golden Globe nod for Hershey.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{created as a}} ploy by Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, to self-release an Elvis Presley album through his own label, <b>Boxcar</b> Records. As it would not consist of content that contractually belonged to RCA Records, Parker was {{theoretically}} able to retain the profits from the album. Having Fun with Elvis on Stage was first distributed at Elvis Presley concerts, but RCA would later package and distribute it.|$|E
5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the <b>boxcar</b> and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E

50|$|In 1949, France sent 49 {{of those}} <b>boxcars</b> to the United States (one for each state then in {{existence}} {{and one for}} Washington, D.C. and Hawaii to share) laden with various treasures, as a show of gratitude for the liberation of France. This train was called the Merci Train, and was sent in response to trains full (over 700 <b>boxcars)</b> of supplies known as the American Friendship Train sent by the American people to France in 1947. Each of the Merci Train <b>boxcars</b> carried five tons of gifts, {{all of which were}} donated by private citizens.|$|R
5|$|The {{album was}} the idea of Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager. Parker wished to release an Elvis Presley album through <b>Boxcar</b> Records—a company that he formed to manage Presley's {{commercial}} rights, so that he could profit directly from it. However, since Presley was signed to RCA Records, any recordings made would legally belong to RCA. To circumvent this restriction, Parker compiled audio of Presley talking—material over which RCA could not claim rights.|$|E
5|$|Brown became {{commander}} of the 62d Troop Carrier Group at McChord Air Force Base, Washington, on 17 July 1950. This group operated Douglas C-124 Globemaster II and Fairchild C-119 Flying <b>Boxcar</b> aircraft between the West Coast and Japan. With {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War in June 1950, this mission acquired great importance. In July 1951 he assumed command of the 56th Fighter Interceptor Wing at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan, part of the Air Defense Command, although he had never flown fighters before. He learned to fly the Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, North American F-86 Sabre and Lockheed F-94 Starfire. On 1 January 1952 Brown became Assistant Director of Operations of the Fifth Air Force in South Korea. He became Director on 15 July 1952.|$|E
5|$|Four British {{transports}} were considered: the Blackburn Beverley, Bristol 179B, Bristol 195 and Short PD 16/1. The mission also {{assessed the}} American Fairchild C-119G Flying <b>Boxcar,</b> Fairchild C-123 Provider and Lockheed C-130A Hercules. Of these types, the mission assessed that the Beverley, C-123 and C-130 could potentially meet the RAAF's requirements. Following further {{consideration of the}} options after their return to Australia, in early 1955 {{the members of the}} mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured, as the other two types did not meet {{some of the most important}} elements of the requirement. At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF, and a decision to acquire twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be similar to those in service with the United States Air Force (USAF), the main difference being the use of TF56-A-11 engines in the place of the usual TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these engines provided almost the same power, but were modified to meet Australian fuel requirements. The total cost for the aircraft, initial crew training and support equipment was $US36 million (equivalent to about 16 million Australian pounds).|$|E
5000|$|The first rail {{contract}} was for eight <b>boxcars</b> {{that would be}} hauled by NSB Class 87 multiple units, with delivery in 1950. This was followed by various orders to the state railways, and included <b>boxcars,</b> reefers and steel bridges. Other customers included Norsk Jernverk and Norsk Transport (who operated the Rjukan Line). The largest freight order was for 180 <b>boxcars</b> type Gr5, delivered from 1963 to 1965. At the most, Høke delivered one freight car each 18 hours. In 1957, Høke delivered a [...] gauge timber car for the Swedish Nordmark-Klarälven Railway. In 1968, Høka delivered two skip cars to Sydvaranger.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, when {{automobiles}} were still new technology, their production levels were low {{enough that they}} could be shipped in sufficient quantities in boxcars. Two to four automobiles would usually fit into one <b>boxcar.</b> But as the automobile industry grew in size, railroads found that they needed to modify the boxcars for more efficient loading. Some modifications included longer boxcars, larger sliding double side doors located near one end of the <b>boxcar,</b> or doors located on the <b>boxcar</b> ends.|$|E
25|$|A <b>boxcar</b> is a North American {{railroad}} {{car that}} is enclosed and generally {{used to carry}} freight. The <b>boxcar,</b> while not the simplest freight car design, {{is probably the most}} versatile, since it can carry most loads. Boxcars have side doors of varying size and operation, and some include end doors and adjustable bulkheads to load very large items.|$|E

A woman, who owned a <b>boxcar</b> placed in Oildale, a nearby town, asked Haggard's father {{about the possibility of}} converting it into a house. He remodeled the <b>boxcar,</b> and soon after moved in, also purchasing the lot, where Merle Ronald Haggard was born on April 6, 1937. The property was eventually expanded by building a bathroom, a second bedroom, a kitchen, and a breakfast nook in the adjacent lot.|$|E
25|$|An {{end door}} <b>boxcar</b> {{includes}} swinging doors {{on one or}} (less commonly) both ends to facilitate the loading of automobiles or other objects not easily loaded through a side door. These required clever engineering, as generally the ends of a <b>boxcar</b> provide the strength to carry the roof {{and to keep the}} structure stiff. This added cost, along with the difficulties of loading a rail car from the end, means they were less common than plain boxcars, although they usually also had side doors so they could be used as regular boxcars.|$|E
