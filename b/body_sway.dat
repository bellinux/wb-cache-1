50|$|Age, gender, {{and height}} {{have all been}} shown to impact an individual’s ability to balance and the {{assessment}} of that balance. Typically, older adults have more <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> with all testing conditions. Tests have shown that older adults demonstrate shorter functional reach and larger <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> path lengths. Height also influences <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> in that as height increases, functional reach typically decreases. However, this test is only a measure of anterior and posterior sway. This is done to create a repeatable and reliable clinical balance assessment tool. A 2011 Cochrane Review found that specific types of exercise (such as gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercises; 3D exercises Tai Chi and combinations of these) can help improve balance in older adults. However, there was no or limited evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} general physical activities, such as walking and cycling, computer-based balance games and vibration plates.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of an {{individual}} standing quietly upright, the limit of stability is defined as the amount of postural sway at which balance is lost and corrective action is required. <b>Body</b> <b>sway</b> can occur in all planes of motion, which make it an increasingly difficult ability to rehabilitate. There is strong evidence in research showing that deficits in postural balance is related to the control of medial-lateral stability and an increased risk of falling. To remain balanced, a person standing must be able to keep the vertical projection of their center of mass within their base of support, resulting in little medial-lateral or anterior-posterior sway. Ankle sprains {{are one of the most}} frequently occurring injuries among athletes and physically active people. The most common residual disability post ankle sprain is instability along with <b>body</b> <b>sway.</b> Mechanical instability includes insufficient stabilizing structures and mobility that exceed the physiological limits.Functional instability involves recurrent sprains or a feeling of giving way of the ankle. [...] It is found that nearly 40% of patients with ankle sprains suffer from instability and an increase in <b>body</b> <b>sway.</b> [...] Injury to the ankle causes a proprioceptive deficit and impaired postural control. Individuals with muscular weakness, occult instability, and decreased postural control are more susceptible to ankle injury than those with better postural control.|$|E

5000|$|Advancements in {{technology}} have allowed force platforms {{to take on}} a new role within the kinetics field. Traditional laboratory-grade force plates cost (usually in the thousands) have made them very impractical for the everyday clinician. However, Nintendo introduced the Wii Balance Board (WBB) (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan) in 2007 and changed the structure of what a force plate can be. By 2010, {{it was found that the}} WBB is a valid and reliable instrument to measure the weight distribution, when directly compared to the [...] "gold-standard" [...] laboratory-grade force plate, while costing less than $100. More so, this has been verified in both healthy and clinical populations. This is possible due to the four force transducers found in the corners of the WBB. These studies are conducted using customized software, such as LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) that can be integrated with the board to be able to measure the amount of <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> or the CoP path length during trials for time. The other benefit to having a posturography system, such as the WBB, is that it is portable so clinicians around the world are able to measure <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> quantitatively, instead of relying on the subjective, clinical balance assessments currently in use.|$|E
50|$|The {{danger of}} heavy {{cognitive}} load {{is seen in}} the elderly population. Aging can cause declines in the efficiency of working memory which can contribute to higher cognitive load. The relationship between heavy cognitive load and control of center of mass are heavily correlated in the elderly population. As cognitive load increases, the sway in center of mass in elderly individuals increases. Another study examined the relationship between <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> and cognitive function and their relationship during multitasking and found disturbances in balance led to a decrease in performance on the cognitive task Heavy cognitive load can disturb balance in elderly people. Conversely, an increasing demand for balance can increase cognitive load.|$|E

50|$|The {{semicircular canals}} {{of the inner}} ear serves as a sense organ for balance and {{controls}} the reflex for gaze stabilization. The inner ear has three canals {{on each side of}} the head, and each of the six canals encloses a membranous duct that forms an endolymph-filled circuit. Hair cells in the duct’s auditory ampulla pick up endolymph disturbances caused by movement, which register as rotatory head movement. They respond to <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> of frequencies greater than 0.1 Hz and trigger the vestibulocollic (neck) reflex and vestibuloocular (eye) reflex to recover balance and gaze stability. The bony semicircular canals allow estimates of duct arc length and orientation with respect to the sagittal plane.|$|E

5000|$|Flamingos usually {{stand on}} one leg while the other is tucked beneath their body. The reason for this {{behaviour}} is not fully understood. One theory is that standing {{on one leg}} allows the birds to conserve more body heat, given that they spend {{a significant amount of}} time wading in cold water. However, the behaviour also takes place in warm water and is also observed in birds that do not typically stand in water. An alternative theory is that standing on one leg reduces the energy expenditure for producing muscular effort to stand and balance on one leg. A study on cadavers showed that the one-legged pose could be held without any muscle activity, while living flamingos demonstrate substantially less <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> in a one-legged posture. [...] As well as standing in the water, flamingos may stamp their webbed feet in the mud to stir up food from the bottom.|$|E

5000|$|These 20 {{cars were}} officially [...] "bogie open tip-over {{cross-bench}} cars". They were a standard design tram built by J G Brill and Company of Philadelphia, although two were {{built by the}} Brisbane Tramways Company, presumably under licence from the Brill Company.

The first 8 were also fitted with couplings for trailers, but the trailers were eventually motorised (see [...] "light twelve bench cars" [...] below.) As these trams only had hand brakes, operating a coupled set was physically demanding on drivers.

50|$|Significant {{toxicity}} from benzodiazepines {{can occur}} in the elderly {{as a result of}} long-term use. Benzodiazepines, along with antihypertensives and drugs affecting the cholinergic system, are {{the most common cause of}} drug-induced dementia affecting over 10 percent of patients attending memory clinics. Long-term use of benzodiazepines in the elderly can lead to a pharmacological syndrome with symptoms including drowsiness, ataxia, fatigue, confusion, weakness, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, reversible dementia, depression, impairment of intellect, psychomotor and sexual dysfunction, agitation, auditory and visual hallucinations, paranoid ideation, panic, delirium, depersonalisation, sleepwalking, aggressivity, orthostatic hypotension and insomnia. Depletion of certain neurotransmitters and cortisol levels and alterations in immune function and biological markers can also occur. Elderly individuals who have been long-term users of benzodiazepines have been found to have a higher incidence of post-operative confusion. Benzodiazepines have been associated with increased <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> in the elderly, which can potentially lead to fatal accidents including falls. Discontinuation of benzodiazepines leads to improvement in the balance of the body and also leads to improvements in cognitive functions in the elderly benzodiazepine hypnotic users without worsening of insomnia.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{components}} of kinetics is analyzing ones center of pressure. Center of pressure (COP) is often tested using a force plate in a biomechanics lab. Many scientist don't always have access to these expensive and unique equipment. Force plates can be any from thousands {{to tens of thousands}} of dollars. Scientist and students today have turned to an alternative way, by using Nintendo Wii Balance Board system as a force plate. One 2014 San Diego State University study has shown a correlation of [...] for the center of pressure measured using the Balance Board compared to a gold standard measure. The students expect their results to find that ankle bracing will reduce sway and decrease ankle instability and falls. Postural sway is the measurement of the time and distance a subject spends away from an ideal center of pressure. Measurement of a subject's center of pressure has been used as a method of quantifying postural stability.Investigators have theorized that if ankle injuries cause differentiation and functional instability, a subject's postural sway should be altered.Bracing has been known to provide cutaneous afferent feedback in maintaining postural control. The feedback follows the same neurological pathways in which the external ankle brace enhances the replication of the joint position.Although some may argue that braces have a negative impact on sport performance, the effectiveness of their mechanical stability make them of high priority and necessity. Due to the high incidence of ankle injury, the control of stability and <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> remain of most importance in reduction of injury and better quality of life.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of quantisation of force plate data used to measure <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> and the relationship between this <b>body</b> <b>sway,</b> aim point fluctuation and performance in shooting. Quantisation error in and resolution of selected <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> parameters were calculated from force plate data sampled using 12 -bit and 16 -bit analog to digital conversion (ADC). It was concluded that 12 -bit ADC does not offer adequate precision when assessing the <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> of shooters and that 16 -bit ADC is required. The relationship between <b>body</b> <b>sway,</b> aim point fluctuation and performance was examined on both group and individual bases. <b>Body</b> <b>sway</b> was measured in six elite rifle and five elite pistol shooters while performing 20 shots in simulated competition conditions over 5 s, 3 s and 1 s before shot using an AMTI LG 6 - 4 force plate and 16 -bit ADC. This was synchronised with a SCATT shooting training analysis system, which measured aim point fluctuation and performance. From 16 time-based <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> parameters quantified, principal components analysis identified four <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> factors, which related to the amplitude and speed of this sway in both the X and Y axis. Using four <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> parameters that represented these factors, correlation and multiple regression analysis indicated that <b>body</b> <b>sway,</b> aim point fluctuation and performance were related for some but not all shooters. Further, this association was specific to the individual shooter in terms of degree and direction of association, the axis of influence of <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> and aim point fluctuation and the time period. This highlighted the importance of individual based analysis in elite shooting. Further research with larger subject numbers, aim point fluctuation more thoroughly examined and including kinematic analysis may assist in better defining the relationship between <b>body</b> <b>sway,</b> aim point fluctuation and performance...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{examining}} <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> factors for 1, 107 healthy people aged 16 to 69 years and to propose a practical <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> evaluation method. The center of foot pressure measurement was carried out twice for 1 min. with a 1 -min. rest. 30 parameters with high reliability selected from 6 domains (distance, distribution of amplitude, area, velocity, power spectrum, and <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> vector) were summarized objectively into 4 <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> factors (unit time sway, front-back sway, left-right sway, and high frequency band power). Factor scores were calculated by the estimate equation and the total standard scores of parameters with high factor loadings. Considering this result, a total standard score for each factor was classified into 4 percentile categories based on percentile rank. Using this classification criteria, <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> scores for each individual were classified {{into any of the}} above 4 domains for each factor. It was confirmed that young adultsmainly belong to percentile Categories A and B and the elderly mainly belong to percentile Categories C and D. It was found that a great effect on <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> occurred when an individual's conscious condition changed (contracting a cold or after exercise). In conclusion, the <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> of healthy people can be explained by these 4 sway factors. An evaluation of the <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> pattern using the 4 sway factors may enable us to concretely understand individuals' disorders and abnormal states in addition to changes in <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> that occur with aging. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2011...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the relationships between <b>body</b> <b>sway,</b> aim point fluctuation and performance in rifle shooting on an inter- and intra-individual basis. Six elite shooters performed 20 shots under competition conditions. For each shot, <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> parameters and four aim point fluctuation parameters were quantified for the time periods 5 s to shot, 3 s to shot and 1 s to shot. Three parameters were used to indicate performance. An AMTI LG 6 - 4 force plate {{was used to measure}} <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> parameters, while a SCATT shooting analysis system was used to measure aim point fluctuation and shooting performance. Multiple regression analysis indicated that <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> was related to performance for four shooters. Also, <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> was related to aim point fluctuation for all shooters. These relationships were specific to the individual, with the strength of association, parameters of importance and time period of importance different for different shooters. Correlation analysis of significant regressions indicated that, as <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> increased, performance decreased and aim point fluctuation increased for most relationships. We conclude that <b>body</b> <b>sway</b> and aim point fluctuation are important in elite rifle shooting and performance errors are highly individual-specific at this standard. Individual analysis should be a priority when examining elite sports performance...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of postural adjustments during infancy. In the control of posture, two functional levels can be distinguished. The basic level deals with the generation of direction-specific adjustments meaning that dorsal muscles are primarily activated when the <b>body</b> <b>sways</b> forward, whereas ventral muscles are primarily activated when the <b>body</b> <b>sways</b> backward. The second level is involved in adaptation of the direction-specific adjustments. Postural development starts with a repertoire of direction-specific adjustments suggesting that the basic level of control has an innate origin. At first, during the phase of primary variability, postural activity is largely variable and can be minimally adapted to environmental constraints. At 3 months, postural activity shows a transient period during which few postural muscles participate in postural activity. From 6 months onward, the phase of secondary variability starts, during which the second level of postural control becomes functionally active and infants develop the ability to adapt postural activity to {{the specifics of the}} situation. Initially, adaptation can be accomplished in a simple way only, but from 9 - 10 months onward, it can be performed by the subtle adaptation of the degree of muscle contraction.
