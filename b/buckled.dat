5|$|The Garter is worn on {{ceremonial}} occasions {{around the}} left calf by knights {{and around the}} left arm by ladies, and is depicted on several insignia. The Garter is a <b>buckled</b> dark-blue (originally light-blue) velvet strap, and bears the motto in gold letters. The garters of Stranger Knights and Ladies were once set with several jewels. Two styles have been used: one is a working garter where the end slips through the buckle and then is tucked in a specific way and the other style is a 'pre-made' one that has the <b>buckled</b> and tucked end pre-fashioned and is fastened with a clip attachment.|$|E

The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms.

5|$|To {{start the}} {{construction}} work, {{there was an}} official 'cutting of the first sod' ceremony. This took place in September 1846 The site chosen for the ceremony was a field in Etruria. A roped off enclosure for directors was created and {{the remainder of the}} field was reserved for invited guests. A mile long procession headed by John Lewis Ricardo, Member of Parliament for Stoke-on-Trent and chairman of the NSR Company, formed. On Ricardo's arrival, the crowds broke through the roped off area and Ricardo was pushed and shoved. During the actual cutting he <b>buckled</b> the silver spade and had difficulty removing the sod. Finally, his hat blew away.|$|E
30|$|The {{differences}} among the results from different researchers mainly arise from two aspects. Firstly, previous <b>buckling</b> solutions are only approximate results with simplified assumptions. The accurate <b>buckling</b> solutions under sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> and helical <b>buckling</b> stages have not been obtained with the <b>buckling</b> differential equation and energy method. Secondly, a comprehensive description of {{the transition from the}} sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> to helical <b>buckling</b> has not been proposed due to the significant difference between these two <b>buckling</b> modes. The critical point between the sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> and helical <b>buckling</b> stages is usually assumed in theoretical analyses, but no distinct dividing point is found in experiments. Therefore, sophisticated description of the <b>buckling</b> state transition and accurate <b>buckling</b> solutions under these two <b>buckling</b> modes still needs an in-depth research.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{work was}} {{conducted}} on oriented strand board webbed wood I-joists to investigate the <b>buckling</b> behavior. Both lateral <b>buckling</b> and local web <b>buckling</b> were witnessed in the tests. The two types of <b>buckling</b> were reproduced in the finite element simulations using ABAQUS. The <b>buckling</b> modes and usually overestimated <b>buckling</b> loads of a joist were obtained from linear eigenvalue <b>buckling</b> analysis. The <b>buckling</b> modes were then introduced into a joist as initial geometric imperfections to conduct nonlinear <b>buckling</b> analysis, and more reliable <b>buckling</b> loads were obtained. Based on statistics of the analytical results, the local web <b>buckling</b> capacity at a support was empirically expressed by the postbuckling load. The empirical formula was extended to local web <b>buckling</b> under a concentrated load applied to the upper flange, where a reduction in <b>buckling</b> load was made to take the effect of moment into account...|$|R

Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to clear a blast wall {{at the end of}} the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to lose control of the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, and his face was smashed against the Hurricane's gyrosight. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors thought at first that his back had also been broken, but it had only been <b>buckled.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tirpitz was {{rendered}} {{unfit for}} combat by Operation Paravane. The Tallboy bomb that struck the battleship {{passed through the}} foredeck and hull, and exploded in the water on the starboard side of her bow. This damage wrecked the bow, and left the battleship's forward compartments flooded with 2,000 tons of water. The explosions of several other Tallboys in the water near Tirpitz also <b>buckled</b> some of her hull plates and bulkheads. The battleship's casualties were not heavy, with five men killed and fifteen wounded. The damage was assessed as needing nine months' worth of work to repair. After reporting on the damage, Tirpitzs commanding officer, Kapitän zur See Wolf Junge, recommended to the German Navy's high command that the battleship be removed from service.|$|E
5|$|Titanic {{received}} six {{warnings of}} sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that <b>buckled</b> her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic {{had been designed}} to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge {{for many of the}} passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.|$|E
40|$|A <b>buckling</b> {{analysis}} was performed on a hat-stiffened panel subjected to shear loading. Both local <b>buckling</b> and global <b>buckling</b> were analyzed. The global shear <b>buckling</b> load {{was found to be}} several times higher than the local shear <b>buckling</b> load. The classical shear <b>buckling</b> theory for a flat plate was found to be useful in predicting the local shear <b>buckling</b> load of the hat-stiffened panel, and the predicted local shear <b>buckling</b> loads thus obtained compare favorably with the results of finite element analysis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{drill pipe}} <b>buckling</b> model {{provided}} excellent predictions for each full-scale <b>buckling</b> test performed, {{not only in}} terms of deformed <b>buckling</b> shape but also in terms of weight transfer. Existing models, on the other hand, failed to predict observed drill pipe <b>buckling</b> behavior. This is the first time in the drilling industry that a <b>buckling</b> model was successfully validated in the field, and this model can predict realistically the onset and severity of <b>buckling</b> for any 3 D trajectory. Many articles discuss <b>buckling</b> inside a wellbore but an increasing number of field observations suggest that existing <b>buckling</b> theories fail to predict <b>buckling</b> phenomenon such as lockup. Indeed, existing <b>buckling</b> theories generally assume that the wellbore is idealistically perfect without any doglegs. Recent advancements in drillstring mechanics modeling have demonstrated that doglegs, friction, and rotation affect greatly the <b>buckling</b> phenomenon. This article compares results of full-scale <b>buckling</b> tests with a new <b>buckling</b> model that takes into account actual wellbore tortuosity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presented}} the nonlinear {{behaviors of the}} single-layered lattice dome, which is widely used for the long-span structure system. The behaviors were analysed through the classical shell <b>buckling</b> theory as the single-layered lattice dome behaves like continum thin shell due to its geometric characteristics, and finite element analysis method using the software program Nastran. Shell <b>buckling</b> theory provides two types of <b>buckling</b> loads, the global- and member <b>buckling,</b> and finite element analysis provides the ultimate load of geometric nonlinear analysis {{as well as the}} <b>buckling</b> load of Eigen value solution. Two types of models for the lattice dome were analysed, that is rigid- and pin-jointed structure. <b>Buckling</b> load using the shell <b>buckling</b> theory for each type of lattice dome, governed by the minimum value of global <b>buckling</b> or member <b>buckling</b> load, resulted better estimation than the <b>buckling</b> load with Eigen value analysis.

5|$|Prior to impact, {{passengers}} did {{not assume}} the brace position. When the airplane came to rest, {{many of the}} passengers in the forward portion of the cabin were upside down, others, who were upright were submerged in water over their heads. Some passengers tried to move from their seats while their seatbelts were still <b>buckled,</b> and other passengers had difficulty locating and releasing their seatbelt buckles because of disorientation. Following the accident, passengers reported fires in the forward left and aft portions of the airplane, including many small fires on the water. Passengers stated that they escaped through large holes in the cabin. The lead flight attendant and first officer escaped {{through a hole in}} the cabin floor near the flight attendant’s position. Several passengers reported assisting others out of the cabin and into the knee-deep water. Many of them walked in the water to the dike, climbed up the wall and over an embankment, and slid down a steep hill to the runway. Others were assisted out of the water by ground personnel.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{stood with}} his men in the weak center and held them to a {{controlled}} retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops <b>buckled</b> inwards as they gradually withdrew. Knowing {{the superiority of the}} Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as they began crowding themselves into the growing gap. Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent. This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings. At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an encirclement in one of the earliest known examples of a pincer movement.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the dynamic {{torsional}} <b>buckling</b> of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) embedded in an elastic medium is studied {{by using a}} continuum mechanics model.

In particular, explicit expressions are obtained for embedded double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs). Numerical results show that, for both the DWNTs and embedded DWNTs, the <b>buckling</b> form shifts from the lower <b>buckling</b> mode to the higher <b>buckling</b> mode with increasing the <b>buckling</b> load, but the <b>buckling</b> mode is invariable for a certain domain of the <b>buckling</b> load.

25|$|When a {{structure}} {{is subjected to}} compressive stress, buckling may occur. Buckling {{is characterized by a}} sudden sideways deflection of a structural member. This may occur even though the stresses that develop in the structure are well below those needed to cause failure of the material of which the structure is composed. As an applied load is increased on a member, such as a column, it will ultimately become large enough to cause the member to become unstable and it is said to have <b>buckled.</b> Further loading will cause significant and somewhat unpredictable deformations, possibly leading to complete loss of the member's load-carrying capacity. If the deformations that occur after buckling do not cause the complete collapse of that member, the member will continue to support the load that caused it to buckle. If the <b>buckled</b> member {{is part of a larger}} assemblage of components such as a building, any load applied to the <b>buckled</b> part of the structure beyond that which caused the member to buckle will be redistributed within the structure.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>buckles</b> found in tie down straps.

Snap <b>buckles</b> are also commonly found on backpacks and duffel bags to allow fastening of the strap. These two components are often used in conjunction with the threading <b>buckle</b> providing tension and the snap <b>buckle</b> providing fastening. While threading <b>buckles</b> come in metal varieties for use with tensioning fasteners like over-center and ratchet fasteners, snap <b>buckles</b> are often plastic and are not designed to withstand a great deal of tension.|$|R

30|$|Chen et al. (1990) first deduced the {{critical}} force to cause helical <b>buckling</b> {{with the energy}} method and stated that critical helical <b>buckling</b> load was \(\sqrt 2 \) times {{the critical}} sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> load. In Chen’s research, the axial force on the tubular string {{was assumed to be}} constant during the process from the starting of sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> to helical <b>buckling.</b> By assuming that the axial force increases linearly from the start of sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> to helical <b>buckling,</b> Wu (1992) refined Chen’s method and pointed out that Chen’s result was an average value of the critical sinusoidal and helical <b>buckling</b> loads. According to Wu, the critical helical <b>buckling</b> load is \(2 \sqrt 2 - 1 \) times the critical sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> load. Miska et al. (1996) assumed that the axial force increased linearly in the entire loading process and found that the critical helical <b>buckling</b> load was \(2 \sqrt 2 \) times the critical sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> load. Miska et al. (1996) also proved that the sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> configuration became unstable (\(\beta = 1.875 \)) before the tubular string changes to the helical <b>buckling</b> configuration. Therefore, the tubular string may be in a sinusoidal or helical <b>buckling</b> state when the axial force satisfies \(1.875 < \beta < 2 \sqrt 2 \). Cunha (1995) pointed out that there are two critical helical <b>buckling</b> loads, where the lower limit value is equal to Chen’s result and the upper limit is equal to Miska’s result. The upper limit means the minimum axial force causing helical <b>buckling</b> in the loading process, while the lower limit refers to the minimum axial force to keep the tubular string in the helical <b>buckling</b> stage for the unloading process. Mitchell (1997) obtained similar conclusions with the <b>buckling</b> differential equation. On the basis of previous studies, Gao et al. (2002) summarized the previous assumptions (Fig.  2) and considered that the axial force increases linearly in the sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> stage and then remains constant until the start of helical <b>buckling</b> based on experimental results.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>buckling</b> behaviors of short multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under axial compression by using molecular mechanics (MM) simulations. The {{effects of the}} number of walls, length and chiral angle of MWCNTs on the <b>buckling</b> behaviors are examined. The results show that the <b>buckling</b> behaviors of short MWCNTs are rather different from single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and slender MWCNTs. Moreover, it is observed that the <b>buckling</b> strains of short MWCNTs vary inversely proportional to the number of nanotube walls. For slender MWCNTs, the <b>buckling</b> strains fluctuate as the number of walls increase. It increases for beam-like <b>buckling</b> mode, decreases for shell-like <b>buckling</b> mode and is approximately constant for the shell-beam-like <b>buckling</b> mode. The increase in the length of MWCNT has also led to a significant decrease of the <b>buckling</b> strain for short MWCNTs.
