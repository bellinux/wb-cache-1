5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut <b>by</b> <b>computer.</b> The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E

5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had {{been in contact with}} Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more time to get a computer with 7k bytes of memory working, and they needed more time to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused <b>by</b> <b>computer</b> memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally is a rally racing {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Codemasters. It was originally released for iOS mobile devices in June 2013, and then ported to Android devices and OS X and Windows personal computers (PCs) in 2014. Gameplay is similar to early iterations of the Colin McRae Rally series of racing games with content predominantly taken from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. Players can drive cars and participate in point-to-point rally events, competing against times recorded <b>by</b> <b>computer</b> drivers. Stages take place in several different locations with varied terrain like tarmac and gravel. The game features damage modelling and chassis deformation effects that can be sustained from collisions.|$|E
5|$|Dahl {{announced}} on October 29, 2007 {{that he would}} move to mornings at WJMK on November 5, 2007 as WCKG changed formats.

5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced <b>by</b> <b>computer</b> software.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Dugan {{produced}} the Model E, the E standing for economy. This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller {{and less expensive}} than previous ones. It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted side-by-side in only 1U of rack space. The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace the Model E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT inputs and outputs. Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible <b>by</b> <b>computer</b> connected with Category 5 cable.|$|E
5|$|Kenny is a third, later fourth-grade {{student who}} {{commonly}} has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town {{life in his}} hometown of South Park, Colorado, where he lives with his poverty-stricken family. Kenny is animated <b>by</b> <b>computer</b> to look as he did in the show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film , in which his true appearance and voice was first revealed, and various South Park merchandise.|$|E

He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film , as well as South Park-related media and merchandise. While Parker and Stone portray Kyle as having common childlike tendencies, his dialogue is often intended to reflect stances and views on more adult-oriented issues, and has been cited in numerous publications by experts in the fields of politics, religion, popular culture, and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Simulating the geodynamo {{requires}} numerically {{solving a}} set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly <b>by</b> <b>computer</b> power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.|$|E
5|$|Sony Pictures Imageworks {{designed}} {{the special effects}} for the film. The digital composition of the film, including the scene where the battle of Spider-Man and Electro in Times Square, took one year to complete.

5|$|The opening beauty pass {{of the new}} Enterprise was the {{responsibility}} of visual-effects cinematographer Marty Rosenberg, who handled all the other miniatures, explosions, and some live-action bluescreen elements. Rosenberg had previously shot some of the Enterprise-D effects for Generations, but had to adjust his techniques for the new model; the cinematographer used a 50mm lens instead of the 35mm used for Generations because the smaller lens made the new Enterprises dish appear stretched out. Knoll decided to shoot the model from above and below as much as possible; side views made the ship appear too flat and elongated. Rosenberg preferred motion-control passes of ships over computer-generated versions, as it was much easier to capture {{a high level of}} detail with physical models rather than trying to recreate it <b>by</b> <b>computer</b> graphics.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{style of}} {{animation}} {{is inspired by}} the paper cut-out cartoons made by Terry Gilliam for Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans. Construction paper and traditional stop motion cutout animation techniques {{were used in the}} original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced <b>by</b> <b>computer</b> animation, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of animatics drawn in Toon Boom are provided by the show's storyboard artists.|$|E
5|$|It {{had become}} {{apparent}} in around 1987 {{that a number}} of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances, particular the woofer. Measurements of the 1–1.5kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive-unit and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched <b>by</b> <b>computer</b> to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in Hi-fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained.|$|E
