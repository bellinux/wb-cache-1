(SAS No. 99) accounting standard-setters require audit {{firms to}} organise a discussion session/ <b>brainstorming</b> {{session at the}} audit planning stage for each audit, {{in order to discuss}} how and where a company’s financial statements might be susceptible to material misstatement due to fraud. This study introduces a structured interacting electronic <b>brainstorming</b> platform into the audit context and examines whether it improves auditors’ fraud <b>brainstorming</b> performance in the fraud hypotheses generation task when compared with the non-structured interacting electronic <b>brainstorming</b> platform which has been investigated in prior literature. In the structured interacting electronic <b>brainstorming</b> platform, idea inputs are shown by categories rather than in chronological sequence on a computer screen. Understanding the comparative effect of different forms of electronic <b>brainstorming</b> and exploring the most appropriate interacting electronic <b>brainstorming</b> method are important since it is likely to improve the effectiveness of <b>brainstorming</b> sessions in audit firms. The structured interacting electronic <b>brainstorming</b> platform {{has been found to be}} useful in improving users’ productivity and creativity in psychology. However, this study finds that the structured interacting electronic <b>brainstorming</b> platform has no effect on the <b>brainstorming</b> performance of the three-person hierarchical audit groups. Moreover, the use of the structured interacting electronic <b>brainstorming</b> platform has no effect on fraud <b>brainstorming</b> performance and mental simulations of seniors, but it even has a negative effect on the fraud <b>brainstorming</b> performance and mental simulations of managers. Furthermore, this study finds that there is no significant correlation between auditors’ <b>brainstorming</b> performance in the fraud hypotheses task and changes in their fraud risk assessments...|$|R

5|$|Bertie's <b>Brainstorm</b> is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Bertie Fawcett, a dim-witted fop, who erroneously believes to have won the heart of May Vernon. In reality, May loves Jack and the two are set to be married, but May's father wishes he would prove his worth by earning his own living. Bertie chances upon the letter and sets off {{to make a living}} proceeds through a number of jobs with hope to claim May as his bride. The film ends with Bertie returning and finding out that May has married Jack. Little is known about the production of the film save that William Russell played an unknown role and that the scenario was written by Lloyd F. Lonergan. The foppish character of Bertie may have been inspired by Edwin Thanhouser's role as Bertie Nizril in Thoroughbred. Originally conceived as a series, this ultimately singular work received praise from critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

They set up Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) as the CEO of the fictional company Solartech in Dwight's office, fitted with security cameras, and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him. Dwight and Jim send in Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) to save the sting. When Meredith strong-arms both of them, Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. Danny becomes infuriated and walks off. Michael catches up to him and offers him a job, pointing out that with Sabre's better pricing, he could make more sales as a traveling salesman for them. He accepts the offer, and Michael introduces him as the new salesman to the office. The rest of the sales staff act disrespectful towards him, worrying that Danny will take their clients. Michael tells them how well sales numbers will go up with Danny {{as a part of the}} branch, and that he is not going to rescind Danny's job offer just because it makes the other salespeople uncomfortable. Before Dwight leaves for the day, he viciously insults Danny about his alleged mistreatment of Pam and client-stealing past, then immediately welcomes him to the company.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, all has transpired {{according}} to Shockwave's plans: the Ammonites, Lost Light and Necrotitan were pupeteered {{to ensure that}} Metroplex would return to Cybertron and bring {{the last of the}} ores with him, while Optimus Prime was deliberately lured into the Dead Universe so that he could destroy Nova Prime and remove his control over it. Using all of his combined ores, fueled by the energy of the Dead Universe — channeled through an unwitting Galvatron — Shockwave intends to bend space and time to his will, collapsing all of reality into a singularity that will be used to feed Cybertron for eternity. As the majority of the Autobots and Decepticons battle the colossal Ammonite army Shockwave summons to the planet, a small team ventures into Crystal City to confront him, where they are soon rejoined by Optimus Prime's team, who emerge through a portal within the unknowingly-undead <b>Brainstorm.</b> Metalhawk sacrifices himself to unbalance the ore equation, destroying the Ammonites, while Bumblebee is killed by Shockwave; inspired by the words and the sacrifice of his new friend, Megatron dons the Autobot symbol, an action that throws Shockwave into confusion. The scientist's loss of focus causes him to lose control of his chronal drive, setting his mind adrift in time and resulting in the re-emergence of his pre-Shadowplay self. Horrified at what he has become, Shockwave allows Optimus and Megatron to kill him, destroying the drive and bringing an end to his plan.|$|E

Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, <b>Brainstorm,</b> Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E

I-BRAINTEX has two objectives, namely the idea generation for creative design ideas and problem solving in textile design process. Through I-BRAINTEX, these ideas can be generated {{with an emphasis on}} {{the quantity and quality of}} ideas thus facilitating the construction of the project design theme. Three <b>brainstorming</b> techniques were applied as an idea generation technique specifically for textile design. At the first stage, individual <b>brainstorming</b> and mind map techniques were used as preparation to stimulate initial ideas related to research subject that suitable with design project theme. Individual <b>brainstorming</b> was intended as pre-knowledge enrichment before undergoing group <b>brainstorming</b> session. In the second stage of idea generation, group <b>brainstorming</b> techniques used for the generation, development and exploration of ideas through the contribution of ideas from group members. The objective of this technique was divided into two, namely the generation of ideas in large quantities and refinement of quality ideas. Group <b>brainstorming</b> is also known as creativity in groups that also to promote collaborative Teaching and Learning approach (T&L). Group <b>brainstorming</b> technique is very practical to be applied together with sketching skills to strengthen the ideas. In the third stage of idea generation, group brainwriting technique was used for the purpose of improvement of group <b>brainstorming</b> by determining the quantity of ideas that need to be achieved without compromising the quality of ideas. All the proposed <b>brainstorming</b> (individual <b>brainstorming,</b> group <b>brainstorming</b> and brainwriting) was viewed as idea generation and comprehensive problem solving for textile design. The results of this study show that the three <b>brainstorming</b> techniques have a high significance towards creativity achievement through T-Test analysis and it is practical approach for teaching and learning textile design.
