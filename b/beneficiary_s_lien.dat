40|$|Since September 20, 1957, the Nebraska {{oil and gas}} lien statute {{has been}} in effect. Prior to its passage, Nebraska had only a general {{mechanic}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute. With a growing oil and gas drilling industry, it soon became apparent that due to the complexities and uniqueness of {{the oil and gas}} drilling business, the general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute had many shortcomings when it was stretched to include this industry. In some of these states the oil and gas drilling industry was brought within the terms of the more general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes either by judicial construction or by slight amendment of their already existing mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statutes. In other jurisdictions, particularly those with a significant oil and gas drilling industry, special oil and gas lien statutes were enacted. Even though Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s general mechanic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> statute can and often does cover many wide and varied contingencies, the complexities of the oil and gas drilling industry convinced many that a special statute, addressed specifically to this growing industry, was needed. As the oil and gas drilling industry in Nebraska grows in significance, Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s oil and gas lien statute will likewise grow in significance. It should become a necessary and familiar tool to those attorneys who do oil and gas work in Nebraska. While Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s statute is similar to other oil and gas lien statutes, many questions concerning this statute are at present unanswered...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{one aspect}} of the law regarding the satisfaction of judgments: when a creditor is determined to have a lien on property of the debtor. The unnecessary cumbersomeness of the present system, which limits the ability of creditors to promptly obtain a legally cognizable interest in specific property, hampers creditors in preventing the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s use, sale, or hypothecation of property {{that could be used to}} satisfy their debts. This is particularly true of intangible property and property where federal law or the law of sister states controls transfers. Not only do judgment creditors face the risk that the debtor will voluntarily dissipate or transfer assets, but also the risk that they will be defeated by subsequent parties who deal with the debtor, become creditors, and are able to find assets. Possibly the most pernicious of those subsequent creditors are the federal and state taxing authorities. The tax lien, once filed, locks in all personal and real property of the debtor. Bankruptcy also presents a serious difficulty for the judgment creditor. If the debtor files for bankruptcy before the creditor can locate personal property of the debtor, the creditor (despite having obtained a judgment) has no greater priority than all of the unsecured creditors of the debtor. If the judgment creditor locates personal property and obtains a lien on that property shortly before the date that the debtor files a Bankruptcy petition, the creditor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> can be avoided as a preference. Even where a debtor files a Chapter 11 petition and maintains control of the business as a debtor in possession, the debtor can still use the preference section to avoid the creditor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien.</b> This article proposes that the computer systems currently being introduced to automate court systems around the country serve as the vehicle for the implementation of major reforms in the substantive and procedural law regarding judicial liens. The most significant change would involve the creation of statewide judgment liens on virtually all of the property of the debtor. This article will explore how the proposed system might deal with various types of property and particular third parties, and how to solve some of the transitional problems involved in adopting such a system. The changes proposed are incorporated in a Model Judgment Lien Act (MJLA) which is set forth in the Appendix of this article. It is hoped that the MJLA makes clear precisely how the rules discussed in the article would operate...|$|R

40|$|DNA {{inside the}} nuclei of cells is folded into an {{intricate}} three-dimensional (3 D) structure that influences {{how and when}} genes are turned on and off. For example, 3 D interactions between distal regulatory elements, such as enhancers and their promoter targets {{are known to be}} responsible for regulating a range of genes with cell-type specific functions. Recent technologies coupling chromosome conformation capture to next-generation sequencing, such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET, allow for genome-wide identification of 3 D interactions at unprecedented resolution. However, analysis is challenging due to the complexity of the data. This PhD-thesis presents several statistical models and computational tools to analyze such data, based on realistic assumptions regarding the underlying properties of chromatin structure. The thesis presents a model for analysis of 3 D co-localization of selected elements in the genome. Additionally, the thesis presents a web-based analysis server called HiBrowse ([URL] for performing statistical analysis of 3 D genomes in a range of different settings. Finally, the thesis presents a statistical model for ChIA-PET data, allowing for accurate identification of significant interactions between regulatory regions in the genome.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to continue the dialogue begun by the proposed Restatement and has two distinct goals in this effort. Parts I through III argue that {{the position of the}} Restatement drafters is both legally and functionally sound and that bankruptcy courts should embrace and apply the proposed Restatement in administering distressed real estate developments. Part I reviews the reasoning articulated in the hotel bankruptcy cases, demonstrating how courts have applied the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and state law in a formalistic manner to extinguish the hotel mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> upon postpetition room revenues. Part II rejects the analysis of the hotel bankruptcy cases on legal grounds. Although the drafters of the proposed Restatement appear to base their recommendations purely upon the functional similarity of rents and hotel room revenues, bankruptcy courts properly may characterize hotel room revenues as “rent” in the nature of real property. The notion that a licensee may pay “rent” in exchange for its constituent rights respecting the land is consistent with the original common law scope of the term “rent,” as well as the nature and scope of the term within the civil law tradition. Part III then criticizes the hotel bankruptcy cases on policy grounds, demonstrating that financial and economic realities do not justify distinguishing between real estate projects based solely upon the status of the occupier as a tenant rather than a licensee. To the developer and the mortgagee, the occupancy revenues generated by the apartment and the hotel are economically identical. Accordingly, sound commercial policy dictates that security law should treat hotel mortgagees with liens upon hotel room revenues no differently than apartment mortgagees holding liens upon rents...|$|R
40|$|Creditors {{have more}} than a dozen prejudgment, no-notice {{remedies}} which permit them to seize or encumber a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property even before the creditor has sued the debtor and recovered a judgment. Moreover, a creditor may take a debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property without giving the debtor prior notice and the opportunity to oppose the taking in a judicial proceeding. These extraordinary remedies have been employed in England and the United States for centuries and in the 1920 s the Supreme Court affirmed their constitutionality. However, in a set of decisions beginning in with Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp. in 1969 and Fuentes v. Shevin in 1972, the Supreme Court laid down the broad principle that, except in extraordinary circumstances, no private citizen could use the courts to summarily seize another person 2 ̆ 7 s property. Now, however, the Supreme Court is retreating from these decisions, signalled by its actions in three cases decided in May 1974 which, respectively, rehabilitated replevin, upheld the constitutionality of mechanics 2 ̆ 7 and materialmen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liens,</b> and held that cognovits were valid.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Article 9 {{is a much more}} {{comprehensive}} personal property security statute than was ever found in American law prior to its enactment, cases continue to present issues on the scope of the Article. Gone are the cases in which a court was called upon to determine whether a 2 ̆ 2 conditional sales contract 2 ̆ 2 could be dealt with under the 2 ̆ 2 factor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> 2 ̆ 2 law; {{it is now clear that}} all such personal property security devices are governed by Article 9. Yet many problems remain for the unwary lawyer. I will identify several and deal in detail with three of these coverage problems. [ [...] . ] The first is the treatment of the United States government as a lender. When the United States grants credit either to a farmer (as the Farmers Home Administration) or in one of a number of other transactions, its rights are governed by federal statutory and common law. To what extent should that common law be derived from state law, namely Article 9 ? Second, I deal with 2 ̆ 2 quasi consignments. 2 ̆ 2 These are transactions in which an owner of goods puts those goods in the hands of another party for processing or other work of some sort. These arrangements are as varied as the imagination of the parties undertaking them. Some look indistinguishable from bailments, others look very much like consignments. In each case there is the question should we treat the original owner merely as an owner who has bailed his or her goods to another party or should we treat him or her as an unpaid seller or an unsecured creditor? Finally, I will deal with Article 9 as it applies to transactions somehow involving real estate. The most familiar case is that in which a secured creditor lends money against a mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s interest in a mortgage and mortgage note. Less well articulated, but nearly as important, are the secured creditor 2 ̆ 7 s rights when he or she is lending to the vendor on a land-sale contract, to the lessee on a lease or even to the lessor...|$|R
40|$|Today 2 ̆ 7 s soaring {{mortgage}} {{default rate}} and the uncertainty and delay associated with mortgage foreclosure proceedings threaten to cause financial tragedies of the commons in condominiums and homeowner associations across the country. Assessment defaults in privately governed communities result in an inequitable allocation of upkeep costs-a phenomenon that current law has failed to prevent. But the collateral damage caused by delayed foreclosures and insufficient recoveries can be minimized by increasing the payment priority of the association lien. In a majority of states, association liens are completely subordinate to the first mortgage lien. At foreclosure of the mortgage lien, the junior priority assessment lien will be extinguished {{whether or not there}} are sufficient proceeds to reimburse for community charges. Assessment delinquencies grow over time, so the longer it takes to complete foreclosure, the greater the costs to the neighborhood. Although several states have adopted a limited lien priority for up to six months 2 ̆ 7 worth of unpaid assessments, foreclosures today take far longer than six months, and the amount ultimately owed to a community can be significant and far exceed that cap. Federal housing policy affects the resolution of the issue because the Federal Housing Administration (2 ̆ 2 FHA 2 ̆ 7), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac only permit qualifying mortgages to be subject to a six-month assessment lien priority. The decelerating pace of foreclosure further exacerbates the already unjustifiable financial impact borne by non-defaulting neighbors. The lien priority status quo fails to adequately protect communities in today 2 ̆ 7 s context of widespread, delayed foreclosures andunder-collateralized mortgage loans. Decreasing the first mortgage lien 2 ̆ 7 s priority during a foreclosure delay would mitigate the harm. Lien priority statutory changes could protect association finances in the future, and such provisions might be applied retroactively as well. In other contexts, states have held that changes to a lien priority regime could apply to existing associations and existing mortgages without unconstitutionally impairing contract or property rights. This has been particularly true where the association 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lien</b> was deemed to have been created on the date the community 2 ̆ 7 s organizational documents were recorded (prior to any unit 2 ̆ 7 s mortgage). Historically, bank lobbyists have opposed any enhanced assessment lien priority. However, supporting property upkeep and making assessments more predictable and collectible would actually benefit lenders by shoring up the value of their collateral. Moreover, increased certainty with respect to homeowner payment obligations would enable more responsible credit underwriting and contribute to economic recovery. Shoring up assessment lien priority would not only ensure a fair allocation of community costs, but also would help to contain the current housing market decline...|$|R
40|$|Malawi, a small, impoverished {{country in}} {{southeast}} Africa {{has some of}} the worst child health indicators in the world. Among the major child health problems in this country is undernutrition. The present prospective, population-based, cohort study was performed to describe typical growth patterns and occurrence and determinants of undernutrition in under 3 -year-old children in Lungwena, rural Malawi. Compared to the international growth reference children in Lungwena were born lighter and shorter. The deficit in growth persisted until 24 months of age and there was no catch up growth. By 36 months of age, the children were 2. 3 kg lighter and 10. 5 cm shorter compared to the reference. Faltering in linear growth was already marked at birth while weight faltering appeared at about 3 months of age. The growth faltering resulted in high prevalence of undernutriton such that at peak levels, up to 70 %, 40 %, and 6 % of the children were moderately stunted, underweight and wasted respectively. The incidence of undernutrition fluctuated according to season. This seasonal pattern was also reflected in weight and height gain whereby periods of best linear growth gain consistently lagged periods of best weight gain by about 3 months after infancy. Such a temporal relationship between weight gain and linear growth was, however, not documented at the individual level. To study the determinants of inci-dence of undernutrition, multivariable models of various forms of undernutrition were constructed. Among the studied correlates of undernutrition, size at birth, maternal HIV, infant morbidity and access to health care independently predicted the occurrence of undernutrition. The high prevalence of moderate undernutrition in the present study necessitated evaluation of the options for management of moderate undernutrition. In Malawi this typically involved dietary supplementation with a micro-nutrient fortified maize / soy flour blend (Likuni Phala) whose effectiveness in promoting growth has been questioned. Apart from its nutrient quality, supplement leakage to nonintended beneficiaries and replacement of the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>s</b> usual dietary in-take were some of the problems associated with this food. The present study tested an energy dense, micronutrient fortified, peanut based spread called Ready to use food (RTUF) on moderately underweight and stunted 3 to 4 year old children. RTUF supplementa-tion resulted in higher energy and nu-trient intakes and less replacement compared to maize / soy flour. However RTUF did not prevent leakage. Both supplements modestly improved weight gain but did not promote height gain. In conclusion, children in rural Malawi showed early growth faltering with no catch up growth. Prevention of undernutriton in this population should start prenatally and continue until after the second year of life. Such interventions, among others, should target reducing intrauterine growth retardation, HIV, and infant morbidity, and improving access to health care.

A recent National Commission on Orthotic and Prosthetic Education (NCOPE) study highlights the need to substantially increase the number of educational programs and the number of graduates becoming certified to meet the demand for services. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the current capacity of the prosthetic profession in the state of Georgia to provide services. Palmetto GBA,the Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carrier (DMERC) for Medicare Region C. was asked to identify the number of times the "Base" L-Codes for lower limb prostheses were submitted for billing in the years 2000 and 2004. Total sales was then estimated by extrapolating the Medicare information assuming Medicare sales represent 58 % of total sales. The number of Georgia based American Board for Certification (ABC) and Board for Orthotist / Prosthetist Certification (BOC) certified prosthetists was solicited from their respective certifying agencies. The data collected represents the only estimate of lower limb prostheses fabricated in GA in 2000 and 2004. The data also represents the only estimate of prostheses fabricated per practitioner, and the only study to capture services rendered beyond Medicare <b>beneficiaries.</b> Robert <b>S.</b> Kistenber...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} two productive development programs (PDPs) in Costa Rica: PROPYME and CR Provee. The first seeks to increase the capacity of small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) to innovate, and the second aims to increase backward linkages between Costa Rican SMEs and multinational companies operating in the country. The impacts of each program were {{measured in terms of}} three result variables: real average wages, employment demand, and the probability of exporting. A combination of fixed effects and propensity score matching techniques was used in estimations to correct for any selection bias. The results show that both PROPYME and CR Provee have positive and significant impacts on SME performance. PROPYME 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> performed better than other firms in terms of labor demand and their probability of exporting, while firms treated by CR Provee showed higher average wages, labor demand, and chances of exporting than untreated firms. Firms treated simultaneously by both programs performed better in terms of average wages than those that were only treated by CR Provee. This result is of special interest to policymakers since it indicates the importance of bundling in the implementation of PDPs. The findings suggest that policies aimed at overcoming the weaknesses of these two programs are important for obtaining higher real wages, generating more employment, and increasing the probability of exporting by Costa Rican SMEs...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Minimum Data Set (MDS) {{for nursing}} home {{resident}} assessment has been required in all U. S. nursing homes since 1990 and has been universally computerized since 1998. Initially intended to structure clinical care planning, uses of the MDS expanded to include policy applications such as case-mix reimbursement, quality monitoring and research. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to summarize a series of analyses examining the internal consistency and predictive validity of the MDS data as used in the “real world ” in all U. S. nursing homes between 1999 and 2007. Methods: We used person level linked MDS and Medicare denominator and all institutional claim files including inpatient (hospital and skilled nursing facilities) for all Medicare fee-for-service <b>beneficiaries</b> entering U. <b>S.</b> nursing homes during the period 1999 to 2007. We calculated the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of diagnoses taken from Medicare hospital claims and from the MDS among all new admissions from hospitals to nursing homes and the internal consistency (alpha reliability) of pairs of items within the MDS that logically should be related. We also tested the internal consistency of commonly used MDS based multi-item scales and examined the predictive validity of an MDS based severity measure viz. one year survival. Finally, we examined the correspondence of the MDS discharge record to hospitalizations and deaths seen in Medicare claims, and the completeness of MDS assessments upon skilled nursing facility (SNF) admission...|$|R

My article suggested that the clarification of the rule against capricious purposes found in the Restatement and the UTC would have a salutary effect {{in one corner of}} trust investment law, by limiting the power of a trust settlor to insist that the trustee follow investment practices that are demonstrably harmful to the interests of the beneficiaries. Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s article sounds a contrary theme of extreme deference to settlor power.

40|$|Letters {{of credit}} {{play a vital}} role in {{financing}} international transactions, and are becoming increasingly popular domestically as substitutes for more traditional secured financing. As such, they deserve substantially more scholarly attention than they receive outside of specialized treatises and banking trade publications. Moreover, as unilateral promises by issuers of the letters of credit to pay money to their beneficiaries, the fact that Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code and pre-UCC common law recognize the right of a beneficiary to sue for anticipatory repudiation is at odds with the prevailing rule in this country that a promisee cannot sue her promisor before payment is due for anticipatorily repudiating a unilateral promise to pay money. After reviewing key aspects of letter of credit law and of the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, this article explores in depth the elements a letter of credit 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>beneficiary</b> must satisfy in order to establish a claim against its issuer and the options available to a beneficiary under both the 1962 and 1995 versions of Article 5.

It concludes by discussing the apparent disconnect between the stated intent on the drafters of the 1995 version of Article 5 to 2 ̆ 2 expand 2 ̆ 2 the remedies available to beneficiaries against issuers and the relegation of several remedies explicitly provided by the 1962 version of Article 5 to the realm of the implicit (and perhaps the nonexistent) ...|$|R
40|$|Brazil {{dominates the}} {{international}} market for frozen concentrated orange juice. By the mid 1980 s, Brazil accounted for about 80 percent of world exports of the product. Brazilian producers supplied more than 94 percent of U. S. imports of the product in the 1980 s and accounted for 50 percent of sales in the U. S. market. The dynamism of the Brazilian industry is attributable to Brazil's comparative advantage and to the series of climate shocks to Florida's orange groves. In Brazil, the industry is largely {{in the hands of}} four large firms, who sell 80 percent of their products to a few large U. S. firms, at significant price rebates. Florida orange growers, beset by import competition and climate shocks, turned to unfair trade laws for protection in the early 1980 s, relying on them increasingly as a substitute for safeguard actions. Because of Brazil's interventionist trade policies, the prevailing U. S. belief was that any Brazilian industry was guilty of unfair trade practices until proven innocent. Unfair trade actions have had a particularly negative impact on their supposed <b>beneficiary,</b> the U. <b>S.</b> citrus industry. The antidumping cases were used to protect orange growers at the expense of U. S. juice processors. Their effect has been to strengthen the oligopoly-oligopsony relationship between Brazilian producers and their U. S. partners, further hindering the competition prospects in the world market for frozen concentrated orange juice.

40|$|States {{want their}} people {{to follow the}} law. They can either persuade them, {{sanction}} law-breakers, or both. But sanctions do not only alter people s perception of risks and costs; they also affect how people view their state and its legitimacy, unleashing a series of non-economic factors that determine compliance with the law. In fact, when a sanction is perceived as unjust it may be inefficient in reducing law violations and could crowd-out legality in other aspects of life. Law scholars warn against violating the principle of proportionality by exerting extreme punishment {{in comparison with the}} magnitude of the crime, as it may result in the loss of citizen cooperation with the law. I take one of Colombia s drug-reducing policies, aerial spraying of coca crops and study the effect of its disproportionate use on legal crops. My results point to a non-linear effect of punishment on legality: spraying shocks or extreme spraying in relation to the amount of illegal crops found reduce engagement in legal crops, where as proportional levels of spraying induce legality. I use four different sources of data to test this relationship: macro data on all coca growing municipalities in Colombia, and micro data of three very different sets of farmers, namely coca growers surveyed by the UNODC, farmers that are <b>beneficiaries</b> of Colombia <b>s</b> biggest alternative development Program (Forest Warden Families) and coffee growers in municipalities that have had coca. I find the same results in all four samples and conclude that when the state overdoes its coercive actions, these can backfire and crowd out legality...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Both the United States and the European Union (EU) began providing trade preferences to eligible developing countries in the early 1970 s. These trade preferences, which reduced tariffs and product quotas, are "nonreciprocal," meaning that beneficiaries need not reciprocate with lower tariffs for donor export countries. This report discusses (1) the volume of U. S. and EU nonreciprocal preferential trade, (2) the U. S. and EU approaches to nonreciprocal trade preferences, (3) the tariff preferences offered by the U. S. and EU nonreciprocal trade programs, and (4) {{the extent to which}} U. S. and EU program beneficiaries take advantage of the tariff preferences offered under the programs. GAO found that the volume of imports receiving preferential tariff rates under U. S. and EU nonreciprocal trade preference programs in 1999 represented a relatively small share of total U. S. and EU imports, at two percent ($ 18 billion) and six percent ($ 45 billion), respectively. The U. S. and EU approaches to nonreciprocal preferential trade have evolved in similar ways since their inception in the early 1970 s. U. S. and EU programs have included increasingly more products, particularly to the poorest countries, and have, over time, relaxed customs requirements that specify where and how products can be made. Despite some program differences, the U. S. and EU nonreciprocal preference arrangements offer relatively similar tariff preferences on average. On the whole, EU programs cover more products than do U. S. programs, but U. <b>S.</b> <b>beneficiary</b> countries use more of their available tariff preferences than do EU beneficiaries. ...|$|R

A major <b>beneficiary</b> of U. <b>S.</b> film industry’s {{increased}} investment in family entertainment during the early 1990 s, Culkin was the first child star to be paid a million dollars for one movie.   The major Hollywood studios and various other non-media companies, including Coca-Cola, used Culkin’s image and performances, as both “objectified” and “embodied” capital, to sell a variety of products to children. Moreover, through the narratives of his movies, product endorsements and various off-screen activities, Culkin became a “idol of consumption” for nineties pre-teens. While the child star can exercise some agency through their performances, they have limited power over the formation and circulation of their identity and image in a wider context.   Drawing on an array of previously unexamined primary materials, I explore the ways in which Culkin, his father and the U. S. media industry tried to regulate and exploit his star image. Through consideration of press coverage of his career, I demonstrate that the selling of Culkin as “brand” was inseparable from a discussion of childhood and, also, of his peculiar status as child star. In particular, I discuss how representations of, and reactions to, Culkin’s star image drew attention to issues of innocence and knowingness. The chapter concludes with an examination of the rapid decline of Culkin’s Hollywood career, evaluating how his transition into adolescence distanced him from his established image and, thus, eroded his brand value...|$|R
