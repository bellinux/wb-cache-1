50|$|Over recent decades, {{fresh fruit}} also emerged as {{regional}} export item, when the Copiapó and Huasco valleys joined Chile’s fruit-growing boom. They enjoy a comparative advantage because, {{thanks to the}} sunny climate, fruit ripens earlier than {{in the rest of}} the country and reaches northern hemisphere markets first.Grapes are the main crop and, on a smaller scale, olives, tomatoes, peppers, onions, broad beans, citrus fruits, nectarines, apricots, oregano, and flowers.The region’s organic wealth, its clear waters and sheltered bays, together with its entrepreneurial experience, favor the development of aquaculture. Species produced include the northern scallop, Japanese and Chilean oysters, abalone, turbot, algae, and different varieties of mussels. Other products with more value added include <b>boned</b> <b>fish</b> fillets, smoked and salted fish, roe, and fishburgers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research were to create a diversified product (shredded) made from <b>bone</b> of <b>fish</b> as an alternative on the utilization of by-product fishery products that was rich in calcium, and to know the chemical and sensory characteristics of shredded <b>fish</b> <b>bones</b> of snakehead (Channa striata), <b>fish</b> <b>bones</b> of mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), <b>fish</b> <b>bones</b> of machetes (Chirocentrus Dorab), and <b>fish</b> <b>bones</b> of putak (Notopterus notopterus). This research used a randomized block design with four treatments {{of different types of}} <b>fish</b> <b>bone</b> (A 1 = <b>Fish</b> <b>bones</b> of snakehead, A 2 = <b>Fish</b> <b>bones</b> of mackerel, A 3 = <b>Fish</b> <b>bones</b> of machetes, A 4 = <b>Fish</b> <b>bones</b> of putak). The parameters observed were chemical analysis (moisture content, ash, protein, fat, carbohydrates, calcium, and phosphorus) and sensory test that used hedonic test (appearance, colour, aroma, texture, and taste). The results showed that the treatment of the different types of <b>fish</b> <b>bone</b> significantly effect on levels of fat and phosphorus. The moisture content value of shredded <b>fish</b> <b>bones</b> were ranged from 3. 16 % - 4. 93 %, the ash content of 20. 47 % - 23. 75 %, the protein content of 5. 66 % - 8. 04 %, the fat content 15, 13 % - 24. 54 %, the carbohydrate content of 44. 92 % - 51. 44 %, the calcium content of 15. 91 % - 16. 87 %, the phosphorus content 7. 48 % - 12. 29 %, and a sensory test results on all attributes were ranged rather like to like.

The product of <b>fish</b> <b>bone</b> powder is small particle size, white colour and without fish odour.

These <b>fish</b> <b>bones</b> powder was used to fortify white bread and resulted in a calcium content ranging from 431. 2 mg to 448. 8 mg calcium per serving. Calcium bioavailability of <b>fish</b> <b>bone</b> extract powder fortified white bread was measured and compared with the other calcium sources.
