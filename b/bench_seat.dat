5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall {{to give to the}} group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> in the back.|$|E
25|$|Standard seating choices by model {{included}} a notchback <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with cloth or Morrokide vinyl {{in the base}} GP, a pillowed velour cloth notchback <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> in the LJ or Strato bucket seats in cloth or Morrokide in the SJ. The Strato buckets were optional on the base GP and a 60/40 split bench was optional on both base and LJ models. Viscount leather upholstery was available with bucket seats on SJ models.|$|E
25|$|Again, the 1973 GTO {{option was}} offered on two models {{including}} the base Le Mans coupe or the LeMans Sport Coupe. The base LeMans coupe featured a cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> while the more lavish Le Mans Sport Coupe had all-vinyl interiors with Strato bucket seats or a notchback <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with folding armrest. The Le Mans Sport Coupe also had louvered {{rear side windows}} from the Grand Am {{in place of the}} standard triangular windows of the base Le Mans.|$|E
50|$|Passenger {{accommodation}} {{consists of}} longitudinal <b>bench</b> <b>seating</b> throughout, with seats for three persons between {{each pair of}} doors in the five-door cars. Seat width is 440 mm per person for the three-person <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> in five-door cars and 450 mm per person for the ten-person <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> in three-door cars. As with the 9050 series EMUs introduced around the same time, these sets featured LCD passenger information screens above the doorways, but these were subsequently removed.|$|R

50|$|Interiors {{featured}} padded instrument panels, full carpeting {{and choices}} of cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> and notchback <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> with armrest. Newport coupes and convertibles were also offered with optional bucket seats {{with either a}} center console and floor shifter or armrest and center cushion.|$|R
25|$|Inside, Strato bucket {{seats and}} console were still {{standard}} equipment with Morrokide vinyl or cloth upholstery, or a no-cost optional notchback <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with either trims. Other changes included a revised instrument panel and door panel trim.|$|E
25|$|As in the {{previous}} generation, six passenger seating with a front <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> and column shifter was optional. Cloth seating was standard on base LX with leather seating optional. Leather was standard on upscale LXi and later Limited models.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Ford's {{dominance}} of the taxi market in Australia meant that a car that could comfortably seat three along the back seat—and even the front, with a <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> installed—was necessary. It also ensured that Ford could retain, at least until Holden released the new Statesman/Caprice in 1990, the market for official cars for governmental use.|$|E

25|$|Internal seating {{is made up}} of two pilot {{seats and}} {{additional}} seating for up to 13 passengers or crew in the cabin. The maximum seating arrangement consists of a four-man <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> facing rearwards behind the pilot seats, facing a five-man <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> in front of the transmission structure, with two, two-man bench seats facing outwards from the transmission structure {{on either side of the}} aircraft. All passenger seats are constructed of aluminum tube frames with canvas material seats, and are quickly removable and reconfigurable. The cabin may also be configured with up to six stretchers, an internal rescue hoist, auxiliary fuel tanks, spotlights, or many other mission kits. Access to the cabin is via two aft-sliding doors and two small, forward-hinged panels. The doors and hinged panels may be removed for flight or the doors may be pinned open. Pilot access is via individual hinged doors.|$|E
25|$|Interior trim also {{received}} minor revisions, and a <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with center armrest returned as a no-cost option {{to the standard}} Strato bucket seats and console. Bench seat-equipped Grand Prixs got a steering column-mounted shifter with the automatic transmission along with a dashboard-mounted glovebox, replacing the console-mounted shifter and glovebox of bucket-seat cars. Power front disc brakes became standard equipment this year.|$|E
25|$|Regal {{interiors}} {{were generally}} more luxurious than lesser Century models with woodgrain trim on dashboard and door panels, along with door-pull straps and bench seats with center armrests with cloth, velour, or vinyl upholstery. Optionally available throughout the run was a 60/40 split <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with armrest. For 1976-77, the Regal coupe was available with the S/R option that included reclining bucket seats with corduroy upholstery.|$|E

25|$|The Matador station wagons had an {{available}} rear-facing third-row <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> increasing total seating {{from six}} to eight passengers. In addition, all wagons included a roof rack and a two-way tailgate that opened when the rear window was down either from the top {{to serve as an}} extended flat surface that was even with the load floor, or to swing open like a regular door hinged on the left side.|$|E
25|$|From the carpark {{at the end}} of Glenesk Road, {{directions}} {{are clearly}} signposted. A well formed loop track, used by around 30,000 people a year (2005), follows the Glen Esk Stream with minor undulations (on the south side) up to a lookout where you find a huge Macrocarpa <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> to rest on and admire the view. The <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> was made by offenders doing community work (2005). The track then descends down wooden steps {{to the base of the}} falls (40 minutes from the carpark). The track then crosses the stream next to the lower swimming hole and returns down the north side. However, instead of going down again, a walker can climb a reasonably steep track (the Connect Track) which begins about 100m from the base of the falls on the northern side of the stream. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the top of the falls. There is a good swimming hole at the top although the water is cool. From this high vantage point there are great views down the valley.|$|E
25|$|The 1966 Grand Prix {{received}} only minor appearance revisions from the 1965 edition {{including a new}} more rounded split grille and new taillight trim. Inside, a revised instrument panel included a squared off gauge panel and new Strato bucket seats in either Morrokide or cloth upholstery with higher seatbacks and more contoured cushions for improved lateral support. The Strato buckets were standard equipment along with a console, but a notchback <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> with center armrest was a no-cost option.|$|E

25|$|Interiors were revised with all-new {{instrument}} panels featuring a larger dose of walnut trim which now {{extended to the}} center console standard with bucket seats, along with a new steering wheel with horn bars replacing the horn ring used in previous years. The standard bucket seats could be upholstered either in expanded Morrokide vinyl or a new cloth-and-Morrokide trim. New for 1965 was a no-cost <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> option with center armrest available with either upholstery choice.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} generation, the {{interior}} was not as customizable in the second generation, and many options that were previously available were cut for 1992. The second generation now used only a single seat design shared with all models (the first generation LX got its own unique seat design), and was only available in two configurations; with a front <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> and a column mounted shifter, or with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor mounted shifter. The console was a carryover from the first generation, although it was redesigned for 1993.|$|E
25|$|The Talladega {{came only}} in the SportsRoof body style and in three colours: Wimbledon White, Royal Maroon, and Presidential blue. All had a flat black hood and a unique {{beltline}} pin stripe. The Talladega came standard with a 428 CJ (non-Ram Air), C-6 Cruise-O-Matic, staggered rear shocks (normally reserved for 4-speed cars) and 3.25:1 open differential. Talladegas were equipped with a cloth and vinyl <b>bench</b> <b>seat,</b> and interestingly enough used the Fairlane 500 body code like the 1969 Cobra. These cars could not be ordered with additional options, and only 743 Talladega's were produced.|$|E

25|$|The first Grand Prix was a Catalina hardtop coupe trimmed to {{standards}} {{similar to the}} larger top-line Bonneville, with a distinctive grille and taillights. The bucket seats were upholstered in Morrokide vinyl, while nylon loop-blend carpeting covered the floor and lower door panels. The center console-mounted transmission shifter included a storage compartment and a tachometer. The rear <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> included a center fold-down armrest and a speaker grille {{that could be made}} functional with the extra-cost Bi-Phonic rear speaker. Included were a padded instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lights, and other features.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Taurus was highly customizable by the buyer to fit their needs, as it had {{a large number of}} options, as well as being available in three different configurations. This meant that the {{interior of}} the Taurus could be spartan or luxurious, depending on the buyer's choice of options. The interior equipment depended on model. The most basic model, the L (see below), came standard with just an AM radio and a front cloth <b>bench</b> <b>seat,</b> while the LX, the highest model, came with a large amount of standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|A further final {{development}} {{based on}} the Minivan was the Bond Family Safety Saloon. Additional side windows were fitted to the rear compartment of the van and two small hammock type seats were added {{either side of the}} rear door facing inwards. With the <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> of the tourer replacing the single front seat of the van and pickup, this gave enough room for two children and two adults. The number of Safety Saloons produced is unknown, as factory records do not distinguish between the Saloon and the Minivan.|$|E
