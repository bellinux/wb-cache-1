40|$|A performance-based {{adaptive}} {{methodology for}} the seismic assessment of highway bridges is proposed. The proposed methodology {{is based on}} an Inverse (I), Adaptive (A) application of the Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM), with the capacity curve of the bridge derived through a Displacement-based Adaptive Pushover (DAP) analysis. For this reason, the acronym IACSM is used to identify the proposed methodology. A number of Performance Levels (PLs), for which the seismic vulnerability and seismic risk of the bridge shall be evaluated, are identified. Each PL is associated to a number of Damage States (DSs) of the critical members of the bridge (piers, abutments, joints and <b>bearing</b> <b>devices).</b> The IACSM provides the earthquake intensity level (PGA) corresponding to the attainment of the selected DSs, using over-damped elastic response spectra as demand curves. The seismic vulnerability of the bridge is described by means of fragility curves, derived based on the PGA values associated to each DS. The seismic risk of the bridge is evaluated as convolution integral of the product between the fragility curves and the seismic hazard curve of the bridge site. In this paper, the key aspects and basic assumptions of the proposed methodology are presented first. The IACSM is then applied to nine existing simply supported deck bridges, characterized by different types of piers and <b>bearing</b> <b>devices.</b> Finally, the IACSM predictions are compared with the results of nonlinear response time-history analysis, carried out using a set of seven ground motions scaled to the expected PGA values...|$|R

40|$|There is {{currently}} a resurgence of interest in unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR), {{primarily because of the}} minimally invasive approach but also because there are now some reports of UKR achieving similar long-term survival rates to total knee replacement (TKR). These improved survival rates are the result of more precise indications, improved implant design, and better surgical techniques. To achieve good 10 -year survival with fixed bearing devices, precise indications are necessary; approximately 1 in 10 patients requiring knee replacement are appropriate. The indications are not as narrow when using a mobile <b>bearing</b> <b>device</b> such as the Oxford knee, because of improved wear resistance and instrumentation; approximately one in four patients are appropriate. However, the mobile <b>bearing</b> <b>device</b> is technically more demanding to implant than most fixed bearing devices. There is a vogue to consider UKR to be a preknee replacement. As a result, many new prosthetic designs are being implanted with a minimally invasive approach often with poor instrumentation in a very wide range of patients. It is our belief that those patients who satisfy the accepted indications should be treated with a proven design using sophisticated instrumentation. It remains debatable whether those patients who do not satisfy these indications should have a UKR as a preknee replacement or should have a TKR. © 2003 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Inc...|$|E

As a result, magnetic bearing systems are beginning to emerge as integral parts of modern industrial and aerospace systems. Further applications research is still required.

We present two solutions based on the use of routing information set up in a mobile ad hoc network created among the robots. Communication in this network relies on an infrared range and <b>bearing</b> <b>device,</b> which is able to transfer data between two robots as well as to make estimates of the relative distance and angle between them. Using this device, one can relate links in the communication network to relative geographic location information. We then use an ad hoc network routing protocol to dynamically find and maintain paths between a robot and an event location in the communication network and use them to guide the robot to its goal. An important advantage of our approach is that robots can transparently help each other for navigation without having to adapt their own movements, {{so that they can be}} involved in independent tasks of their own. ...|$|E

Therefore, bulk and composite implants were subgingivally installed in the partially edentulous jaws of Beagle dogs and harvested after 4 and 16 months. Histologically, the connection between the implants and bone tissue could be clearly demonstrated. This bone connection is mainly located at the cortical bone level. In the vicinity of the infraalveolar nerve a fibrous tissue contact was found. It is shown that surgical trauma, motion at the glass to tissue interface, and gross ion dissolution from the material adversely affect the interfacial osteogenesis. If these factors are controlled, bone bonding is found over a larger area than the initial area of contact between the implant and bone tissue. This means that bone grows out along the implant surface, starting from the initial contact area.

40|$|Pre-clinical {{experimental}} wear {{testing is}} very effective to evaluate new ankle replacement in {{the aspect of}} design and material used. However, both cost and time {{can be one of}} the constraints factors, particularly in the early stage of design or analysis. Numerical method has been addressed as an alternative to predict wear on ankle replacement. The computational wear simulation has been widely used on the hip and knee but very less found in study related to wear analysis of the ankle. The purpose of this research is to develop computational simulation to predict wear on total ankle replacement (TAR).

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{dynamical}} {{behavior of a}} magnetic levitating linear bearing suitable for working in the non-hysteretic range of forces is presented. The presented <b>bearing</b> <b>device</b> is composed of a high temperature superconductor with semi-cylindrical shape and a levitating slider made of a permanent magnet. Meissner repulsion forces of the superconductor provides stable equilibrium and restoring forces in 4 degrees of freedom (DOF), allowing the magnet to displace linearly along the axis of the superconducting semi-cylinder. A custom-made model based on numerical integration of coupled electromechanical equations has been developed, demonstrating good accuracy between the solution obtained and commercial FEM software ones. Radial and axial stiffness of the bearing have been calculated using this model. The vertical equilibrium as a stable position of the linear bearing displacement was found. Dynamical and transient simulation was done {{in order to determine}} the position of the levitating magnet for different external perturbations. Moreover, the calculation of the maximum pressures and thus the magnetic field applied for each position of the displacement proves that it can operate at 100 K or below. It can be assured that a complete Meissner state occurs; hence the displacement will be completely non-hysteretic. Such a non-hysteretic passive linear bearing can be very suitable for long-stroke precision positioning. The high translational symmetry of the magnetic field seen by the permanent magnet assures a usable long stroke of around ± 90 mm with full performance and ± 150 mm with reduced performance. This linear bearing in combination with an actuating system for only one DOF can be used for accurate precision positioning systems for cryogenic environments with zero hysteresis in the movement...|$|E

Of note are the low aspect ratio journal bearing and large journal bearing clearances, primarily limited by microfabrication, from which stable bearing operation must first be demonstrated as viable. Theoretical modeling of the gas-lubricated hydrostatic journal bearing presents design charts, a comparative study of existing predictions and investigation into rotational effects to consider the bearing stiffness during operation. Continued experimental refinements and exploration with our microfabricated rotor achieved rotational speeds up to 1. 4 million rpm and peripheral speeds in excess of 300 m/s. Extensive experimental data is presented with analysis, focusing on whirl motion and its harmonic resonances as candidates for instability. Causes of ultimate failure is suggested with recommendations for further improvements. Moreover, {{in an effort to}} accomplish self-sustained microbearings, the axial thrust bearing is redesigned for a self-acting spiral groove bearing. The chosen constraint is to incorporate the hydrodynamic thrust bearing with minimal changes to the current device, whilst providing the required load and stiffness. Stability analysis and rarefaction considerations on the optimized design suggests an operating range for the bearing, leading to a hybrid design for ample stiffness during initial operation. The design is then developed into a microfabrication process flow and implemented successfully into the MicroBearing test devices. Experiments on a hybrid bearing were performed to gage the spiral grooves characteristics. A purely hydrodynamic aft thrust <b>bearing</b> <b>device</b> is then tested for operation through low speeds, although the effects of the spiral grooves could not be accurately determined.

40|$|Fast patrol {{boats are}} {{high-speed}} vessels {{operated by the}} Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN). These ships are 36, 5 meters long, have a beam of 6, 2 meters and operate at high speed (32 knots – 16, 5 meters per second) in very restricted waters. The fast patrol boats are war ships and navigation tasks performed by the crews {{are different from those}} in civilian high-speed craft. A team of five persons navigate the fast patrol boats, and navigation is based on traditional means such as visual observations and paper charts. The person leading the team is the navigator. The ships were built in the late 1970 s and upgraded in 2001 when new navigation equipment was installed. However, the crews criticized the modern navigation equipment for being complex and difficult to use. In 2002, an upgraded fast patrol boat collided with a rock during high-speed navigation. The accident resulted only in material damage. Following this accident the RNoN acknowledged the need to gather knowledge about human factors and design of navigation equipment. Navigating a fast patrol boat is about operating a complex sociotechnical system. Strong demands are put on both people and their tools. In order to design usable navigation equipment for these ships, one has to have knowledge about the ships’ task, the crew that carry out the navigation, and the contexts in which navigation takes place. To gather such knowledge, this study observed several navigation teams at work and used different approaches to structure and describe the work of navigation teams. A hierarchical task analysis was conducted in order to describe navigation in accordance with procedures and established best practices. The assignment navigate to destination was the highest level of the navigator’s work. The assignment included the navigation tasks; plan, start, monitor, change course, and arrive. For each navigation task, a detailed analysis was conducted. It was found that the crews used work practices that emphasize efficiency rather than accuracy in e. g. position fixing. Although efficiency was given priority, the navigation teams controlled system variation {{in order to keep the}} ship within safe waters. A usability study was conducted. This study treated navigation equipment that had been fitted when the ship was upgraded. A cognitive walkthrough was conducted in order to evaluate whether human factors guidelines were applied in the design of the modern navigation equipment. In total 30 usability findings were described. The study suggested that navigation equipment to little extent were user-centered. The navigation teams compensated for lack of usability by expanding actions and by modifying the equipment. The framework of distributed cognition was used to describe the observed work of the navigation teams. Distributed cognition suggests that cognitive processes are not bounded by the individual person, but are distributed between humans and the physical artifacts they use. Humans and artifacts that participate in goal directed processes are said to be in a functional relationship. Within the functional relationships information trajectories describe how information is gathered, shared and used. Functional relationships are not static but can configure depending on the context. In studies of distributed cognitive processes, investigating physical representations are important as these are outside the head of the people, yet within the cognitive system. The navigation team and their artifacts were described as one cognitive system where the crew and their tools were functionally related. Navigation was in most cases founded on a detailed plan. The navigator drew lines and symbols in nautical paper charts in order to represent the plan. The navigation plan was a resource for the teams’ actions and the charts were a frame of reference for the teamwork on the bridge. The crew enriched their tools in order to improve communication and information retrieving. For instance, information important to navigation was to large extent noted in the chart. Another example was equipping the <b>bearing</b> <b>device</b> with small pins in order to feel the direction of the device. Artifacts were also used to support the navigators’ memory. Pointing the <b>bearing</b> <b>device</b> in the direction of the upcoming course meant that the navigator did not have to remember the sailing direction. The dynamic properties of the system did on the one hand provide barriers towards erroneous actions. The crewmembers monitored each other’s tasks and corrected mistakes when necessary. On the other hand, when the functional relationship was not held together, the result was entropy. The framework of activity theory was used to provide further descriptions of the navigation teams’ work. Activity theory focuses on people working in a context. In this study, activity was regarded as situated actions taking place in shorter time frames. Activity theory claims that the elements of the activity encompass the persons and their use of tools towards a conscious goal. Further, the goals of the activity are influenced by the outcome of the activity and by specific constraints. Activity theory describes the structure of navigation at different levels. The basic constraints that influenced the navigation teams were related to the space available to maneuver the ship, and to the conditions for making visual observations. Crewmembers’ behavior was not constant, but directed towards different motives depending on the circumstances. The crew usually carried out goal related tasks. However, in some cases the crew directed their work towards the operations of equipment or towards solving problems. The framework of activity theory described how internal and external factors influenced the focus of the teams’ work. Both distributed cognition and activity theory findings suggested that the teams frequently used artifacts for purposes beyond their initial scope of design. For instance, bearing devices were used to augment navigators’ memory. Based on the knowledge gathered from task analysis, the usability study, and from the frameworks of distributed cognition and activity theory, a design study was carried out. Four prototypes were produced in order to explore possible design solutions that could improve the thinking and cooperation for the navigation teams. The prototypes included an automatic steering system, an electronic chart, alarm panels, and audio alarms. The prototypes emphasized the use of physical representations and perceptually rich interfaces. The interfaces used for instance sound, vision, and tacitle feedback. Applying human factors principles in design suggested several design solutions that possibly could improve navigators’ working conditions. However, there is a risk that new design will create opportunities for new types of failures. For this reasons, user evaluations were suggested as a necessary part of design development. However, user evaluation was outside the scope of this study. This study suggested two outcomes of a design processes. One outcome is the improvement of the design in question. The second outcome is the design seeds, that is concepts and techniques that can be reused in other development settings. Development on navigation technology is at present an industry with strong engineering influence and traditions. This study suggested that a user-centered approach should involve engineers and work through the engineers’ domain. It was suggested that a design process for development of navigation equipment would benefit from being multidisciplinary, iterative and utilize user evaluation.
