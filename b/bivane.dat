40|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{values for}} the areas surrounding the H, D and N-Area meteorological towers were computed from archived 2010 meteorological data. These 15 -minute-averaged data were measured with cup anemometers and bidirectional wind vanes (<b>bivanes)</b> 61 m above the surface. The results of the roughness calculation using the standard deviation of elevation angle {sigma}{sub E}, and applying the simple formula based on tree canopy height, gave consistent estimates for roughness around the H-Area tower {{in the range of}} 1. 76 to 1. 86 m (95 % confidence interval) with a mean value of 1. 81 m. Application of the {sigma}{sub E} method for the 61 -m level at D and N-Areas gave mean values of 1. 71 and 1. 81 with confidence ranges of 1. 62 - 1. 81 and 1. 73 - 1. 88 meters, respectively. Roughness results are azimuth dependent, and thus are presented as averages over compass sectors spanning 22. 5 degrees. Calculated values were compared to other methods of determining roughness, including the standard deviation of the azimuth direction, {sigma}{sub A}, and standard deviation of the wind speed, {sigma}{sub U}. Additional data was obtained from a sonic anemometer at 61 -m on the H-Area tower during a period of a few weeks in 2010. Results from the sonic anemometer support our use of {sigma}{sub E} to calculate roughness. Based on the H-Area tower results, a surface roughness of 1. 8 m using is recommended for use in dispersion modeling applications that consider the impacts of a contaminant release to individuals along the Site boundary. The canopy surrounding the H-Area tower is relatively uniform (i. e., little variance in roughness by upwind direction), and data supplied by the U. S. Forest Service at Savannah River show that the canopy height and composition surrounding the H-Area tower is reasonably representative of forested areas throughout the SRS reservation. For dispersion modeling analyses requiring assessments of a co-located worker within the respective operations area, recommended area-specific values range from 0. 3 m for E Area to 0. 7 m for A Area at the Savannah River National Laboratory. These area-specific values, summarized in Table 4 - 1, were determined using the Environmental Protection Agency's AERSURFACE computer algorithm...|$|R

By this new digital reduction method fine structure of vertical wind fluctuations can be visualized free from dynamic response {{character of the}} particular <b>bivane,</b> which tends to exaggerate fluctuations {{in the same period}} as free period of the <b>bivane.</b> This method was tested by the comparative field observation with a sonic anemometer.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. The Nsuze Group {{forms the}} lower, {{predominantly}} volcanic succession of the Pongola Supergroup. The 2. 9 Ga Nsuze Group outcrops in southeastern Mpumalanga, northern KwaZulu-Natal and Swaziland. The volcanic rocks of the Nsuze Group are basalts, basaltic andesites, andesites, dacites and rhyolites preserved as both lava and pyroclastic deposits. The oldest volcanic {{sequence of the}} Nsuze Group is the basaltic Wagondrift Formation. The younger <b>Bivane</b> Subgroup represents the main volcanic component of the Nsuze Group. The White River Section represents a complex volcanic history of magma storage, fractionation, and eruption, supplied by a multi-level system of magma chambers. The basaltic and basaltic andesite rocks of the White Mfolozi Inlier represent the steady and non-violent eruption of lavas from related volcanic centres. The Nsuze Group rocks have been metamorphosed by high heat flow burial metamorphism to lower greenschist facies. Geochemically, elements display well-defined fractionation trends, with evident sub-trends within each phase group of samples. These sub-trends {{are related to the}} fractionation of key minerals, in particular plagioclase. The REE patterns show that evolution of magma was largely controlled by the fractionation of plagioclase. All REE patterns show LREE enrichment relative to the HREE. The Wagondrift Formation was derived from a more depleted source than the younger <b>Bivane</b> Subgroup volcanic rocks and exhibits a within-plate tectonic signature. The volcanic rocks of the <b>Bivane</b> Subgroup in the White River Section and the White Mfolozi Inlier are geochemically similar. The volcanic rocks of the <b>Bivane</b> Subgroup of both the White River Section and the White Mfolozi Inlier have a subduction zone tectonic signature, in particular a Ta-Nb negative anomaly. Tectonic discrimination diagrams suggest an enriched source related to a continental-arc setting. The geochemistry suggests an eclogitic source for the Nsuze Group volcanic rocks. The formation of eclogite in the mantle requires subduction of basaltic material. Archaean models for subduction-like processes include decoupling of oceanic crust and subsequent underplating of the continental lithosphere, and low-angle subduction which minimises the effect of the mantle wedge. It is possible that a combination of these processes resulted in an enriched eclogitic source for the magmas of the Nsuze Group...|$|E

In addition to a vertical Gill-propellor anemometer and a Gill-propellor <b>bivane,</b> a cruciform hot-wire probe, mounted on a small windvane, were used. With this hot-wire system the heat and momentum fluxes could be measured in a relatively simple way. The possibilities and limitations of this system were checked...|$|E

The data used in this study was odtained on Aug. 2 ~, 1963 when typhoon 6311 was passingover the southern ocean of Shionomisaki. The mean wind speed over the sampling duration(6 mm) was 18. 3 in/sec. The vertical fluctuating components are smaller than longitudinal ones,and decrease more rapidly with averaging time than those. The ratio is about 20 -' 3 l~%for a few seconds averaged wind speed, but it becomes nearly 10 % for 20 or 30 sec. Andthe correlation coefficient between longitudinal and vertical components is about 07...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The Sutton {{and more}} recent Gaussian plume models of at-mospheric {{dispersion}} {{were used to}} estimate downwind concentrations of pheromone in a deciduous forest. Wind measurements from two <b>bivane</b> anemometers were recorded every 12 sec and the pheromone was emitted from a point source 1. 6 m above ground level at known rates. The wing-fanning response of individually caged male gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar) at 15 sites situated 20 to 80 m downwind was used to monitor when pheromone levels were above threshold over a 15 -min interval. Predicted concentrations from these Gaussian-type models at locations where wing fanning occurred were often several orders of magnitude below the known behavioral thresholds determined from wind tunnel tests. Probit analyses of dose-response r lationships with these models showed no relationship between predicted dose and actual response. The disparity between the predictions of concentration from these models and the actual response patterns of the male gypsy moth in the field was not unexpected. These time-average models predict concentrations for a fixed position over 3 -rain or longer intervals, based upon the dispersion coefficients. Thus the models estimate pheromone concentrations for time intervals appreciably longer than required for behavioral response...|$|E
40|$|Consideration of the {{inertial}} dissipation {{method for}} routine wind stress estimation {{suggests that the}} most significant errors {{are likely to be}} changes in height of the airflow before reaching the anemometers, and errors in estimating the true wind, due either to flow distortion-induced errors in the relative wind estimate or errors in estimating the ship's speed relative to the water. The results from four anemometers—Solent sonic and Kaijo Denki sonic anemometers, and R. M. Young propeller-vane and <b>bivane</b> anemometers—mounted on the foremast of a research ship were compared. The mean bias between the four anemometers in the friction velocity estimates was less than 3 % (rms scatter 6 %– 12 %). In contrast the bias and scatter for the drag coefficient was 17 %– 27 % due to flow distortion-induced errors in estimating the true wind speed. It is concluded that, with a reasonably well-exposed anemometer, wind stress can be determined to 5 % or better by the dissipation method whereas errors in the bulk aerodynamic method are likely to be between 20 % and 30 %. The data from the two sonic anemometers showed the best correlation; the Solent sonic, a relatively new instrument, was comparable in performance to the Kaijo Denki. Comparisons of the two propeller anemometers typically showed twice the scatter compared to the sonic values. Overcorrection for the propeller response at low wind speeds resulted in spuriously high drag coefficient values for wind speeds below 10 m s− 1. In contrast, the sonic anemometer data showed no change in the slope of the drag coefficient to wind speed relationship at low wind speed...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} of the tethered balloon measurements {{made during the}} First ISCCP Regional Experiment (FIRE) marine stratocumulus intensive field observations (IFO) at San Nicolas Island in 1987. The instrument utilized on the balloon flights, the 17 flights over a 10 day period, {{the state of the}} data analysis, and some preliminary results are described. A goal of the measurements with the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) balloon was to give a unique and greatly improved look at the microphysics of the clear and cloud-topped boundary layer. For this goal, collocated measurements were made of turbulence, aerosol, cloud particles, and meteorology. Two new instruments which were expected to make significant contributions to this effort were the saturation hygrometer, capable of measuring 95 percent less than RH 105 percent (with an accuracy of 0. 05 percent near 100 percent) and used {{for the first time in}} clouds; and the forward scatter meter which gives in situ LWC measurements at more than 10 Hz. The data set, while unfortunately only partially simultaneous with the bulk of the FIRE stratocumulus observations, is unique and worthwhile in its own right. For the first time accurate RH measurements near 100 percent have been made in-cloud; although, the use of the saturation hygrometer reflected a learning experience which will result is substantially better performance the next time. These measurements were made in conjunction with other microphysical measurements such as aerosol and cloud droplet spectra, and perhaps most important of all, they were all collocated with <b>bivane</b> turbulence measurements thus permitting flux calculations. Thus the analysis of this data set, which consisted of about 50 percent stratocumulus cases including increasing and decreasing partial cloud cover, should lead to new insights on the physical mechanisms which drive the boundary-layer/cloud/turbulence system...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop and test a conceptual model of the geomorphological impacts of river regulation, based on a review of relevant international literature. It was motivated by {{the fact that there is}} very little local information on the topic, and it was intended that the model might provide a starting point for assessing the impact of impoundments on South African river systems. At present most research in South Africa on the impact of impoundments is undertaken from an ecological perspective. In order to manage our water resources sustainably it is necessary to have a better understanding of our river systems. South Africa is characterised by a variable climatic regime and, in order to supply water to the various user sectors of the nation, dams have to be larger than elsewhere in the world, to trap most of the mean annual runoff and provide a reliable water store (Alexander, 1985). South African dams have been designed to reduce the variability of a naturally variable regime. The impact of flow regulation in dryland rivers has been described as 'ecologically catastrophic at every leve 1. ' It is therefore hardly surprising that the impact of these dams on the natural functioning of rivers is substantia 1. The conceptual model showed that there are many responses to river impoundment, which are varied and complex, both in time and space. Responses or secondary impacts depended on the nature and degree of the primary impact or process alteration, on the sediment and flow regime of the river. High flows were affected in all cases and low flows were affected in most cases. The simplest form of change was Petts' (1979) concept of 'accommodation' of the regulated flow within the existing channel form. More complex responses occUrred where the channel perimeter was unstable, or where tributaries introduced fresh sediment loads. The river could adjust its long profile, cross sectional area and substrate composition by aggradation or degradation. The conceptual model was used in the Building Block Methodology to predict impoundment impacts at Instream Flow Requirement w 0. rkshops on the Berg, Komati and <b>Bivane</b> rivers. It was also used in assessing the impact of the Sandile Dam on the Keiskamma river. Tributary junctions were identified as likely sites of change, and the morphology of bars at these junctions was investigated. Due to the number of variables affecting the sediment and flow regime in the system, and due to the fact that the primary impacts were not substantial, it was not possible to come to any decisive conclusions. It would seem that the dam is well located in the catchment, and, because the water is not heavily utilised, the secondary impacts are not great. The conceptual model was found to be a useful basic tool which might contribute to a better understanding of our river systems, and ultimately to improved sustainable resource management. ...|$|E
