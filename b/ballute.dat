500|$|Two of {{the lighter}} {{configurations}} (the Zefiro 23 and the H-25) use upper stages mounted {{on top of}} the booster. Due to the lower weight, it might have been necessary to lower the amount of fuel in a booster to ensure that the separation velocity, the flight path, and the reentry do not exceed design bounds. In the case of H-25, it might be necessary to accelerate the fly-back boosters to above [...] to help the upper stage achieve its desired orbit. Consequently, two solutions were proposed to decelerate the boosters after separation. The first option was to actively decelerate them using [...] of fuel and reduce the velocity by [...] However, launch performance would drop below that of the Vega derivative. Another option is to use aerodynamic forces to decelerate. However, a hypersonic parachute was deemed too expensive and too complex. As a result, an alternative <b>ballute</b> was proposed.

In this configuration, a launch performance of up to [...] could be achieved, partly thanks to a higher separation velocity.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the primary}} {{inflatable}} deceleration technologies is a trailing <b>ballute</b> configuration. The design features a toroidal, or donut-shaped, decelerator, made of a lightweight, thin-film material. The <b>ballute</b> is {{much larger than the}} spacecraft and is towed behind the craft, much like a parachute, to slow the vehicle down. The “trailing” design also allows for easy detachment after the aerocapture maneuver is complete. The trailing <b>ballute</b> design has performance advantages over the rigid aeroshell design, such as not constraining the spacecraft size and shape, and subjecting the vehicle to much lower aerodynamic and thermal loads. Because the trailing <b>ballute</b> is much larger than the spacecraft, aerocapture occurs high in the atmosphere where much less heat is generated. The <b>ballute</b> incurs most of the aerodynamic forces and heat, allowing the use of minimal thermal protection around the spacecraft. One {{of the primary}} advantages of the <b>ballute</b> configuration is mass. Where the rigid aeroshell may account for 30-40% of the mass of a spacecraft, the <b>ballute</b> mass fraction could be as little as 8-12%, saving mass for more science payload.|$|E
50|$|Other {{inflatable}} {{products with}} space applications include <b>ballutes</b> and decelerators; inflatable and deployable antennas; sunshields, solar sails and solar arrays; radiation shields; decoys; and planetary balloons.|$|R
50|$|ILC has {{produced}} numerous inflatable structures for military and aerospace applications. Inflatable structures are those made from high-performance flexible materials, often providing weight, size, and economic advantages over structures made from traditional metal or composite materials. Products include <b>ballutes</b> and decelerators; floats; munition dispensing systems; UAV wings; radomes; and shelters.|$|R
50|$|SMArt 155 is a German 155 mm {{artillery}} round, {{designed for}} a long range, indirect fire top attack role against armoured vehicles. The SMArt carrier shell contains two submunitions with infrared sensor and millimeter wave radar, which descend over the battlefield on <b>ballutes</b> and attack hardened targets with explosively formed penetrator warheads. Built with multiple redundant self-destruct mechanisms, these submunitions were specifically designed to fall outside the category of submunition weapons prohibited by the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ballute</b> (a {{portmanteau}} of balloon and parachute) is a parachute-like {{braking device}} optimized for use at high altitudes and supersonic velocities. Invented by Goodyear in 1958, the original <b>ballute</b> was a cone-shaped balloon with a toroidal burble fence fitted around its widest point. A burble fence is an inflated structure intended to ensure flow separation. This stabilizes the <b>ballute</b> as it decelerates through different flow regimes (from supersonic to subsonic).|$|E
50|$|During descent, {{the crew}} cabin (the second stage) was {{planned to use}} a <b>ballute</b> to reduce its speed. When its {{velocity}} becomes subsonic, the second stage's <b>ballute</b> was to be released and pull out the three parachutes before splashdown.|$|E
50|$|Inflatable <b>ballute</b> {{structures}} {{have been}} proposed for use during aerocapture, aerobraking and atmospheric entry of cubesat and nanosat satellites. The inflatable structures for these applications may take a variety of engineered shapes including stacked toroidal, tension cone and isotensoid <b>ballute</b> form factors.|$|E
40|$|Ultra {{lightweight}} <b>ballutes</b> offer revolutionary {{mass and}} cost benefits along with flexibility in flight system design compared to traditional entry system technologies. Under funding provided by NASA s Exploration Systems Research & Technology program, our team {{was able to}} make progress in developing this technology through systems analysis and design, evaluation of materials and construction methods, and development of critical analysis tools.

40|$|Aeroassist {{technology}} {{development is a}} vital part of the NASA In-Space Propulsion Technology (ISPT) Program. One of the main focus areas of ISPT is aeroassist technologies through the Aerocapture Technology (AT) Activity. Within the ISPT, the current aeroassist {{technology development}} focus is aerocapture. Aerocapture relies on the exchange of momentum with an atmosphere to achieve thrust, in this case a decelerating thrust leading to orbit capture. Without aerocapture, a substantial propulsion system would be needed on the spacecraft to perform the same reduction of velocity. This could cause reductions in the science payload delivered to the destination, increases in the size of the launch vehicle (to carry the additional fuel required for planetary capture) or could simply make the mission impossible due to additional propulsion requirements. The AT is advancing each technology needed for the successful implementation of aerocapture in future missions. The technology development focuses on both rigid aeroshell systems as well as the development of inflatable aerocapture systems, advanced aeroshell performance sensors, lightweight structure and higher temperature adhesives. Inflatable systems such as tethered trailing <b>ballutes</b> ('balloon parachutes'), clamped <b>ballutes,</b> and inflatable aeroshells are also under development. Aerocapture-specific computational tools required to support future aerocapture missions are also an integral part of the ATP. Tools include: engineering reference atmosphere models, guidance and navigation, aerothermodynamic modeling, radiation modeling and flight simulation. Systems analysis plays a key role in the AT development process. The NASA in-house aerocapture systems analysis team has been taken with multiple systems definition and concept studies to complement the technology development tasks. The team derives science requirements, develops guidance and navigation algorithms, as well as engineering reference atmosphere models and aeroheating specifications. The study team also creates designs for the overall mission spacecraft. Presentation slides are provided to further describe the aerocapture project...|$|R
40|$|The {{emphasis}} {{in this study}} was on the use of multiple pass trajectories for aerobraking. However, for comparison, single pass trajectories, trajectories using <b>ballutes,</b> and trajectories corrupted by atmospheric anomolies were run. A two-pass trajectory was chosen to determine the relation between sensitivity to errors and payload to orbit. Trajectories that used only aerodynamic forces for maneuvering could put more weight into the target orbits but were very sensitive to variations from the planned trajectors. Using some thrust control resulted in less payload to orbit, but greatly reduced the sensitivity to variations from nominal trajectories. When compared to the non-thrusting trajectories investigated, the judicious use of thrusting resulted in multiple pass trajectories that gave 97 percent of the payload to orbit with almost none of the sensitivity to variations from the nominal...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a theory of aeroassisted orbital plane change maneuvers and necessary equipment is traced and an assessment is made of potential applications. Synergetic plane changes are effected {{through a combination of}} aerodynamic and propulsive forces involving the dip of an orbiting vehicle into the atmosphere, performance of an aerodynamic turn using thrust if necessary, then reboosting into a reconfigured orbit. The Orbiter is noted to possess large synergetic plane change capability, and configurations of spacecraft such as the Venus Orbiting Imaging radar for using aeroassist to brake interplanetary velocities before establishing orbits are described. Technology advances necessary to construct effective aerobrake, aerocapture, and orbital transfer vehicles are explored, including fabrication of inflatable <b>ballutes,</b> lighter L/D configurations, and lifting brakes, which are considered to be minor extensions of current capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Aeroassisted {{planetary}} entry uses atmospheric drag {{to decelerate}} spacecraft from super-orbital to orbital or suborbital velocities. Numerical simulation of flow fields surrounding these spacecraft during hypersonic atmospheric entry {{is required to}} define aerothermal loads. The severe compression in the shock layer {{in front of the}} vehicle and subsequent, rapid expansion into the wake are characterized by high temperature, thermo-chemical nonequilibrium processes. Implicit algorithms required for efficient, stable computation of the governing equations involving disparate time scales of convection, diffusion, chemical reactions, and thermal relaxation are discussed. Robust point-implicit strategies are utilized in the initialization phase; less robust but more efficient line-implicit strategies are applied in the endgame.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of {{two types of}} hypersonic decelerators are computationally examined: mechanically deployable flares and inflatable <b>ballutes.</b> CFD is used to predict the flowfield around a solid rocket motor (SRM) with a deployed decelerator. The computations are performed with an ideal gas solver using an effective specific heat ratio of 1. 15. The surface pressure coefficients, the drag, {{and the extent of}} the compression corner separation zone predicted by the ideal gas solver compare well with those predicted by the nonequilibrium solver. The ideal gas solver is computationally inexpensive and is shown to be well suited for preliminary design studies. The computed solutions are used to determine {{the size and shape of}} the decelerator that are required to achieve a drag coefficient of 5 in order to assure that the SRM will splash down in the Pacific Ocean. Heat transfer rates to the SRM and the decelerators are predicted to estimate the amount of thermal protection required...|$|R

40|$|Gaskinetic BGK {{approach}} {{is preferable to}} handle the hypersonic- entry aerodynamics of inflatable decelerators or <b>ballutes,</b> because the peak dynamic pressure is likely to fall within the rarefied gasdynamic regime. We report here our recent development of such a BGK approach for inflatable aeroelastic applications. First, the gaskinetic flow solver BGKX is improved with grid deformation technique and the flux is modified {{to account for the}} grid velocity. Next, the improved time-accurate BGKX solver generates the steady/unsteady aerodynamics for a 2 D membrane-on-wedge and an axisymmetric membrane-on-ballute models for nonlinear aeroelastic analysis. Furthermore the BGKX solver can yield readily in one step pressures as well as heat fluxes on an axisymmetric membrane-on-ballute model. The computed BGKX results are validated with results by other continuum CFD flow solvers in the continuum range and with available measured data. Finally BGKX is applied for the nonlinear static aeroelastic analysis to the membrane-on-wedge and membrane-on-ballute cases. The static deformation is obtained first which will serve as a base for the inflatable flutter analysis that follows. I...|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} four-wheel layout {{was chosen}} to avoid stability problems that have been demonstrated in the dynamics of ultranarrow front track/ultrawide rear track configurations, such as the Budweiser rocket car (1979) and Craig Breedlove's third jet car (1996). The primary structural element for the RV1 chassis will be a large diameter tube that houses the main LOX tank, the nitrogen tanks, the cockpit, the kerosene tank, and the rocket motors. The tube will also provide the attachment points for the forward LOX tanks, the wheels, the braking <b>ballutes,</b> and the body shell. It is currently planned for the tube to be of carbon fiber composite construction, although consideration is also being given to fabricating it using rolled and welded magnesium. Magnesium has the same density as carbon fiber, but is not as stiff and so {{would have to be}} thicker, as well as protected against corrosion from salt. The cockpit will be a sealed and self-contained capsule that drops in a compartment located near the midpoint of the vehicle.Mickey Thompson used a large diameter tube as a backbone for one of his Indy cars. It had clamped on suspension and other components. The tube gave great rigidity for light weight.Modern monocoque design with carbon fibers would make this impractical.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{aerodynamic}} decelerators {{are defined}} as textile devices intended to be deployed at Mach numbers below five. Such aerodynamic decelerators include parachutes and inflatable aerodynamic decelerators (often known as <b>ballutes).</b> Aerodynamic decelerators {{play a key role}} in the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) of planetary exploration vehicles. Among the functions performed by aerodynamic decelerators for such vehicles are deceleration (often from supersonic to subsonic speeds), minimization of descent rate, providing specific descent rates (so that scientific measurements can be obtained), providing stability (drogue function - either to prevent aeroshell tumbling or to meet instrumentation requirements), effecting further aerodynamic decelerator system deployment (pilot function), providing differences in ballistic coefficients of components to enable separation events, and providing height and timeline to allow for completion of the EDL sequence. Challenging aspects in the development of aerodynamic decelerators for planetary exploration missions include: deployment in the unusual combination of high Mach numbers and low dynamic pressures, deployment in the wake behind a blunt-body entry vehicle, stringent mass and volume constraints, and the requirement for high drag and stability. Furthermore, these aerodynamic decelerators must be qualified for flight without access to the exotic operating environment where they are expected to operate. This paper is an introduction to the development and application of aerodynamic decelerators for robotic planetary exploration missions (including Earth sample return missions) from the earliest work in the 1960 s to new ideas and technologies with possible application to future missions.

40|$|NASA {{missions}} and space exploration rely on strong, ultra lightweight materials. Such materials {{are needed for}} building up past and present space vehicles such as the Sojourner Rover (1997) or the two MERs (2003), but also {{for a number of}} components and/or systems including thermal insulators, Solar Sails, Rigid Aeroshells, and <b>Ballutes.</b> The purpose of my internship here at Glenn Research Center is to make dual purpose materials; materials that in addition to being lightweight have electronic, photophysical and magnetic properties and, therefore, act as electronic components and sensors as well as structural components. One type of ultra lightweight material of great interest is aerogels, which have densities ranging from 0. 003 g/cc to 0. 8 g/cc. However, aerogels are extremely fragile and, as a result, have limited practical applications. Recently, Glenn Research Center has developed a process of nano-casting polymers onto the inorganic network of silica-based aerogels increasing the strength 300 fold while only increasing the density 3 fold. By combining the process of nano-casting polymers with inorganic oxide networks other than silica, we are actively pursuing lightweight dual purpose materials. To date, thirty different inorganic oxide aerogels have been prepared using either standard sol-gel chemistry or a non-alkoxide method involving metal chloride precursors and an epoxide; epichlorohydrin, propylene oxide or trimethylene oxide, as proton scavengers. More importantly, preliminary investigations show that the residual surface hydroxyl groups on each of these inorganic oxide aerogels can be successfully crosslinked with urethane. In addition to characterizing physical and mechanical properties such as density, strength and flexibility, each of these metal oxide aerogels are being characterized for thermal and electronic conductivity and magnetic and optical properties...|$|R

Made of thin-film material and reinforced with a ceramic cloth, the inflatable aeroshell design could offer many of the same advantages and functionality as trailing <b>ballute</b> designs. While not as large as the trailing <b>ballute,</b> the inflatable aeroshell is roughly three times larger than the rigid aeroshell system and performs the aerocapture maneuver higher in the atmosphere, reducing heating loads.
