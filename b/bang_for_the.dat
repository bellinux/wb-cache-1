25|$|The game {{opened up}} with a <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hawkeyes, as C.J. Jones took the opening kickoff 100-yards for the touchdown. But as it turns out, {{it would be the}} only time until late in the fourth quarter that the Hawkeyes would see the endzone. Although the game was tied at halftime, USC blocked Iowa's last-second field goal, {{preventing}} a possible Iowa lead at the half. From there, Heisman winner Carson Palmer went to work. The senior quarterback threw for over 300 yards against the Big Ten's worst passing defense and led scoring drives of 79, 80, 99, 85 and 61 yards as the Trojans held a 16-minute advantage in time of possession. The USC defense was suffocating and Iowa's miscues were proof. The Hawkeyes had two turnovers, 13 penalties, and multiple missed opportunities.|$|E
500|$|Michael Ordoña of the Los Angeles Times {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review, noting the slower cut of the film and saying [...] "the action is easier to read than in most films of the genre, and therefore more enjoyable.

PC Gamer commented that [...] "while this inaugural episode may not be the essential FPS that Half-Life2 is, I can't imagine any shooter fan who'd want to miss it." [...] In its review, PC Gamer UK directed particular praise to the balance between puzzle-oriented and action-oriented challenges throughout the game. In Australia, the magazine PC PowerPlay awarded the game 10 out of 10. Edge praised the [...] "deftness" [...] with which the game was able to direct the player's eyes, and the strength of Alyx as a companion, concluding, [...] "In an interactive genre bound to the traditions of the pop-up gun and invisible hero, it simply doesn't get more sophisticated than this." [...] Episode One earned a scores of 87/100 and 85.59% on review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. IGN awarded Episode One with the title of [...] "Best PC FPS of 2006" [...] and described it as a [...] "great <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> buck using Valve's new episodic plan", although it did not offer [...] "the complete experience that Half-Life2 was".

The 5–3 Falcons were determined to rebound from their disappointed Week 9 loss to the Detroit Lions. In the first quarter, nothing happened until very late. With 3:33 remaining in the quarter, Browns quarterback Charlie Frye connected on a 40-yard pass to tight end Kellen Winslow. That put the Browns on the Atlanta 6-yard line and 3 plays later, on 4th and 1, the Browns scored on a run by running back Reuben Droughns and the Browns took a 7–0 lead. The second quarter started with a <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Browns. Atlanta had 2nd and 9 on the Cleveland 49 when Falcons quarterback Michael Vick threw an interception to Browns safety Sean Jones. The Browns drove the ball quickly down the field and, with 11:59 remaining in the quarter, Charlie Frye connected with tight end Braylon Edwards on a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Browns lead was 14–0. At the two-minute-warning, Reuben Droughns fumbled on the Atlanta 35. The Falcons attempted a two-minute-drill offense, but the Browns stood Vick up at the Browns 26.
