According to the RIAA, they are the forty-first best selling artist in the US with shipments of over 37 million albums.

5|$|Through {{all these}} changes, the {{characters}} have remained popular. The books sell {{more than a}} million copies a year. Several additional volumes are published annually, and the boys' adventures have been translated into more than 25languages. The Hardy <b>Boys</b> <b>have</b> been featured in computer games and five television shows and used to promote merchandise such as lunchboxes and jeans.|$|E
5|$|The Hardy <b>Boys</b> <b>have</b> {{also been}} used to sell a variety of {{merchandise}} over the years, much of it tied to television adaptations. They have appeared in several board games, comic books, coloring books, and activity books, jigsaw puzzles, and lunch boxes; two LP albums, Here Come the Hardy Boys and Wheels; a Viewmaster set, a toy truck, charm bracelets, rings, wristwatches, greeting cards, jeans, and guitars.|$|E

5|$|The Hardy <b>Boys</b> <b>have</b> {{gone through}} many {{permutations}} over the years. Beginning in 1959, {{the books were}} extensively revised, and some commentators find that the Hardys' characters changed in the process. Commentators also sometimes see differences between the Hardy Boys of the original Hardy Boys Mystery Stories and the Hardy Boys of the Hardy Boys Casefiles or the new Undercover Brothers series.|$|E
5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. Obesity in {{children}} and adolescents is defined as a BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The reference data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity. Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E
5|$|The {{school has}} {{produced}} sixteen international rugby players (England (5), Ireland (6), Scotland (1) Italy (1), the USA (1) Bermuda (1) and the Bahamas (1)), {{as well as}} players for the Barbarians and the British and Irish Lions. Most recently they include Iain Balshaw and Kyran Bracken, who both played for England when they won the 2003 Rugby World Cup, whilst another member of that team, Will Greenwood, went to Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall, where his mother taught maths until 2007. Current pupils of the school have won places to represent Spain, Mexico (under 19s) the Irish Exiles and the Welsh Exiles (under 19s). Old <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> also played at varsity level and have won blues for Oxford or Cambridge.|$|E

5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the <b>Boys</b> <b>have</b> to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E
5|$|St George's can admit up to 380 pupils annually. Upon admission, pupils are {{allocated}} a mixed ability form, {{where they}} are registered, taught Life Skills and have access to pastoral support from their tutors. For all the other lessons, the pupils are set by ability. Each year group has a progress manager with responsibility for the students in that year. Since the Education Act 2002, years 7, 8 and 9 have been grouped into Key Stage 3 and years 10 and 11 into Key Stage 4, which co-ordinates how the National Curriculum is taught. At St George's, a manager is assigned to each Key Stage for pastoral support. Before the conversion to Academy status, the school uniform consisted of a navy-blue blazer with the school emblem sewn on, a white shirt, navy-blue tie and dark-grey trousers (girls could wear plain-blue skirts) for all pupils in years 7–10; year 11 pupils could wear a dark-blue jumper, shirt and grey trousers. Since 2010, girls no longer wear ties, and must wear a revere collar blouse. Dark-grey trousers or a pleated dark-grey skirt are available for girls to wear; <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> dark-grey trousers. All pupils wear a blue blazer, but those in Key Stage 3 have bright blue piping on their lapels; shirts are white until Year 11, when thin blue stripes are worn.|$|E

50|$|Just then Johano and Ivan appeared, and {{the detective}} work began. As it happened, the pianist, former circus <b>boy,</b> <b>had</b> in his {{possession}} a diary which had belonged to his mother. Johano recognized the language in the diary as Esperanto, and they began piecing together how the <b>boys</b> <b>had</b> gotten separated.|$|R
60|$|Only two cadets {{came forward}} with objects that might {{possibly}} be {{a clue to the}} robbery. One <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> picked up a handkerchief in his room that he said did not belong to him, and another <b>boy</b> <b>had</b> found the marks of muddy footprints over his window sill and on a fire-escape outside.|$|R
5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least willing to {{participate}} in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E

25|$|There are {{entire house}} gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05–8:30p.m. These {{are known as}} Prayers, due to their {{original}} nature. The House Master and <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> {{an opportunity to make}} announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment.|$|E
25|$|Hackensaw <b>Boys</b> <b>have</b> twice {{performed}} at the prestigious European music festival in Norway, , where they shared the stage with Marianne Faithfull, Pet Shop Boys, and Shooter Jennings--in 2007--and Delbert McClinton, Mary Gauthier, Patti Smith, and Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes--in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Mom {{gets home}} and Candace thinks that, at last, Mom {{will see what}} the <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> been up to and believe her. But just as Mom is about {{to step into the}} back yard, all {{evidence}} vanishes, usually as a side effect of Doofenshmirtz's device.|$|E

25|$|<b>Boys</b> <b>have</b> {{a higher}} chance for being {{diagnosed}} with autism than girls. The ASD sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with mental retardation and more than 5.5:1 without. Recent studies have found no association with socioeconomic status, and have reported inconsistent results about associations with race or ethnicity.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that sexual violence is also a learnt behavior in some adults, particularly as regards child sexual abuse. Studies on sexually abused <b>boys</b> <b>have</b> shown that around one in five continue in later life to molest children themselves. Such experiences may lead to a pattern of behavior where the man regularly justifies being violent, denies doing wrong, and has false and unhealthy notions about sexuality.|$|E
25|$|The Backstreet <b>Boys</b> <b>have</b> {{sold over}} 130 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling boy band in history, {{and one of}} the world's best-selling music artists.
