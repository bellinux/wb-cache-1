500|$|The National Bank Act (...) {{authorized}} {{the issue of}} a national currency. Historical vignettes on the front and back were the same <b>by</b> <b>denomination</b> (e.g., Landing of Columbus was on the reverse of all $5 notes) and the state coat of arms (located on the reverse left side) was coordinated with the geographic location of the issuing bank. Records do not clearly state who bore the responsibility for the design of the state arms (i.e., the U.S. Treasury Department, or the three bank note companies contracted for engraving and printing). It appears that the first dies (for New Jersey, Missouri, Minnesota, and Vermont) were completed by the American Bank Note Company by 9 October 1863 based on their own drawings. State arms appeared on the reverse of the Original and 1875 Series notes (first and second issue of the first design), and the 1882 Brown Back Series (the second design) of National Bank Notes.|$|E
500|$|Christian {{churches have}} existed in Lancashire since Anglo-Saxon times. [...] Architectural {{features}} from that era have survived in StPeter's Church, and in StPatrick's Chapel, both in Heysham; churches such as StMargaret, Hornby, contain Anglo-Saxon fragments {{in the form}} of parts of crosses or carved stones. [...] Norman features are found in some of the churches, including StJohn the Evangelist, Gressingham, and StSaviour, Stydd, but almost all those in the list are Gothic in style. [...] Many were restored during the 19thcentury and have additions or alterations in Gothic Revival style, including StBartholomew, Colne, and StCuthbert, Halsall. [...] All but two of the churches are Anglican <b>by</b> <b>denomination.</b> The two Roman Catholic churches in the list date from the 19thcentury and are in the Gothic Revival style: Pleasington Priory, and StWalburge, Preston. [...] Most of the county is rural, but remnants of a greater industrial past remain in the larger towns of Preston and Blackburn, and in the smaller former textile towns of east Lancashire. [...] Lancashire's [...] bedrock is mainly sandstone, with limestone deposits in the north and in the area around Clitheroe, which provided the major building materials for the churches.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a racial}} divide not just among {{individual}} congregations, {{but at a}} denominational level as well. Among the ten largest denominations in the United States, eight are either predominantly African American or White. These divisions <b>by</b> <b>denomination</b> are caused in part by theological differences and in part by differences in practice. Religious scholar Terriel Byrd explains these practical differences {{by saying that the}} church allows African American Christians to show their [...] "disillusionment" [...] with society and their mistreatment within it, whereas White people remain more reserved, as they hold societal power and do not need to express the same kind of anguish. Various denominations have made it a formal goal to increase diversity within their congregations.|$|E
