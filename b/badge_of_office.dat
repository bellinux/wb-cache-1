5|$|The Roundels Argent {{charged with}} a Cross Gules (white circles with a red cross) allude to the <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> of Rouge Croix. Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate, and the crest alone on his writing paper. When he was {{promoted}} to Somerset Herald, Planché surrounded the crest on his writing paper with a collar of Esses. While he was entitled to the collar by his appointment as herald, its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder of}} the Scouting movement, Robert Baden-Powell, wore six beads, as did Sir Percy Everett, then Deputy Chief Scout and the Chief's right hand. Baden-Powell's beads are on display at Baden-Powell House in London. Everett endowed his six beads to be worn by the Camp Chief of Gilwell as a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office.</b> Since that time the wearer of the sixth bead has {{generally}} been the director of leader training at Gilwell Park.|$|E
25|$|The council {{shoulder}} patch (known as the CSP) is an arc-shaped patch worn {{at the top}} of {{the sleeve}} that identifies the local council. Below this, Scouts at the unit level wear a unit number and units with veteran status may wear a veteran unit bar above the numbers. Lone Cub Scouts and Lone Scouts wear the Lone Scout emblem in place of the unit numeral. On the new (2008) style official shirt, the <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> is centered on the pocket, but on the older official uniform shirts, the <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> is centered and touching the bottom of the unit numeral, or centered 4inches below the shoulder seam. When earned for the current position, the green lettering Trained leader strip is centered {{at the top of}} the pocket flap on the new style official shirt, but on the older official uniform shirts, the red lettering Trained leader strip is centered immediately below and touching the <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office.</b> Qualified commissioners may wear the Commissioner Arrowhead Honor in the bottom-most position (or if wearing the first version of the Centennial shirt, immediately below the Council Shoulder Strip in the location where a unit number would be worn). Youth who are serving as a Den Chief may wear a Den Chief cord around the left shoulder and under the shoulder strap instead of the emblem. Den Chiefs who earn the Den Chief Service Award may wear the service award cord in addition to the den chief cord, and may continue to wear it for as long as they are a youth.|$|E

25|$|The <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> of New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary is blazoned A complex Māori Koru {{coloured}} in {{the traditional}} manner proper ensigned by {{a representation of the}} Royal Crown also proper. The Koru design is used to decorate the rafters of Māori meeting houses, where important ceremonies take place, and it is also found on a number of objects at these ceremonial gatherings. The loops and coils of the Koru also represent the complex Māori genealogical tree of the Whakapapa. Māori genealogy is based for the most part on oral evidence and tradition, and in art the Koru is used to represent this.|$|E
500|$|Below {{the chief}} herald are the Heralds of Arms, {{full-time}} {{workers at the}} CHA and {{considered part of the}} Public Service of Canada. The names of the various offices were taken from significant Canadian rivers. Though the titles are territorial designations, as per heraldic tradition, each herald serves the entire country. Each is assigned a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office.</b> The Heralds of Arms are: ...|$|E
500|$|The Memorial {{consists}} of two distinct architectural elements, linked by a terrace of Purbeck stone. A black rectangular creeper-covered enclosure surrounds the air shaft, forming a single block. The northern face of the enclosure is kept free of creepers, and is inscribed with the police <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> and the text [...] "The National Police Memorial: Honouring Those Who Serve". This face also includes a vitrine in which the Roll of Honour is displayed.|$|E
25|$|Staff and Students {{assemble}} in the Brompton Oratory Church to honour the School's Patron, Saint Philip Neri. The School {{celebrates its}} Patronal Festival with a Pontifical High Mass on {{the feast of}} Saint Philip Neri, 26 May, or on the nearest Friday that falls during the Trinity term. The Mass is followed immediately by the distribution of prizes to Award Winners and the presentation <b>of</b> Ties and <b>Badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> are presented to the Senior Prefects. The official handing over of duties from the outgoing Senior Prefects to the incoming Senior Prefects occurs when the Senior Prefects <b>Badges</b> and Ties <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> are issued. All members of Staff traditionally wear full academic dress on this occasion.|$|R
50|$|The Opening Mass is {{the spiritual}} event marking {{the start of}} the new year. In recent years the Opening Mass has been held at the Lismore Cathedral to allow the entire school to attend and to include the Diocese in the events of the College. The Opening Mass also celebrates the new leaders in the College, the Prefects receive their <b>badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> and the newly {{appointed}} Students' Representative Council is inducted for the year.|$|R

2500|$|Before the {{existence}} of a formal police department, the first night watch was established in Boston in 1635. In 1703, pay in the sum of 35 shillings a month was set for members of the night watch. In 1796, the watch was reorganized, and the watchmen carried a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> a rattle, and a six-foot pole, which was painted blue and white with a hook on one end and a bill on the other. The hook was used to grab fleeing criminals, and the rounded [...] "bill" [...] was used as a weapon. The rattle was a noise-making device used for calling for assistance.|$|E

50|$|The regalia worn {{by members}} is simple. <b>Badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> are worn by Circle Presidents and {{officers}} around the neck, suspended from collars {{of gold and}} white ribbon. There are equivalent badges for Provincial officers and national officers. Breast jewels are worn by members, suspended from coloured ribbons, on the breast of the jacket, to indicate membership, long service, and past participation in conferences and structures of the organisation. Regalia sashes are also worn. Regalia has been simplified in modern times, from its more complex origins.|$|R
50|$|The {{significance}} of a scarab bearing a royal name is unclear and probably changed over time and from scarab to scarab. Many may simply have been made privately in honour of a ruler during or after his lifetime. Some {{may also have been}} royal gifts. In some cases scarabs with royal names may have been official seals or <b>badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> perhaps connected with the royal estates or household, others, although relatively few, may have been personal seals owned by the royal individual named on them. As the king fulfilled many different roles in ancient Egyptian society, so scarabs naming a pharaoh may have had a direct or indirect connection {{with a wide range of}} private and public activities.|$|R
2500|$|Corbold {{opened a}} [...] "Sanctuary of the Holy Angels" [...] {{in a house}} on Horoeka Avenue, {{on the slopes of}} Mount Eden and built a flourishing order. Michel Corbold adopted the Mystic Cross of the Grand Hierophant symbol {{published}} by Mouni Sadhu in his book The Tarot as the official emblem of the Society of Guardians for the New Age of Aquarius. Corbold initially used a variation of the Golden Dawn Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis symbol, which he attributed to the lost German branch of the Guardians, as the ancient Grand <b>Badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> for the Society. For the Ancient Seal of the Guardians, a 19th brass Hindu (Southern Indian) body stamp having a solar symbol was used. The body stamp presumably was acquired in India during his studies at the Maharishi Academy.|$|E

50|$|Later in 1279 King Edward I {{formed a}} special guard of 20 sergeants at arms who carried {{decorated}} battle maces as a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> official <b>office.</b> By 1415 a watch {{was appointed to}} the Parliament of England and in 1485 King Henry VII established a household watch that became known as the Beefeaters.|$|R
6000|$|Except the {{officers}} above enumerated, {{there are none}} who mess apart from the seamen. The [...] "petty officers," [...] so called; that is, the Boatswain's, Gunner's, Carpenter's, and Sail-maker's mates, the Captains of the Tops, of the Forecastle, and of the After-Guard, and of the Fore and Main holds, and the Quarter-Masters, all mess {{in common with the}} crew, and in the American navy are only distinguished from the common seamen by their slightly additional pay. But in the English navy they wear crowns and anchors worked on the sleeves of their jackets, by way <b>of</b> <b>badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>office.</b> In the French navy they are known by strips of worsted worn in the same place, like those designating the Sergeants and Corporals in the army.|$|R
5000|$|Wampum belts {{were used}} as a memory aid in oral tradition, where writing could be encoded in wampum strings. They were also {{sometimes}} used as <b>badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> or as ceremonial devices of indigenous culture, such as the Iroquois. They were traded widely to tribes in Canada, the Great Lakes region, and the mid-Atlantic. Loose beads that were within a common size, shape, and color spectrum were usually {{not considered to be}} high in value, perhaps because of their origin as a memory aid. Conversely, large, ornate, storytelling belts were valued much more highly. Belts of wampum were not mass-produced until after European contact. A typically large belt of six feet (2 m) in length might contain 6,000 beads or more.|$|R
60|$|After him marched the {{attendant}} of Dr. Sitgreaves, who had instinctively seized an enormous tureen, as most resembling matters he understood, and followed on in place, until the steams of the soup so completely bedimmed the spectacles he wore, as a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> that, on {{arriving at the}} scene of action, he was compelled to deposit his freight on the floor, until, by removing the glasses, he could see his way through the piles of reserved china and plate warmers.|$|E
60|$|Of {{a sudden}} this scene shifted. Now {{we saw that}} same hall in which we had visited Oro not an hour before. There he sat, yes, Oro himself, upon the dais beneath the {{overhanging}} marble shell. Round him were some ancient councillors. In {{the body of the}} hall {{on either side of the}} dais were men in military array, guards without doubt though their only weapon was a black rod not unlike a ruler, if indeed it were a weapon and not a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

"If it please you, {{holy father}} Abbot," [...] cried the voice, [...] "this {{decision}} of yours is indeed secundum legem and intra vires {{so far as}} the civil suit is concerned which lies between this person and the Abbey.

25|$|Only the Roman Emperor {{could wear}} the symbol <b>of</b> his <b>office,</b> a Tyrian purple cape trimmed in golden thread, and Roman {{senators}} {{were the only}} ones who could wear the <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> their <b>office,</b> a Tyrian purple stripe on their toga. During the height of the Empire, such vast quantities of silk were imported from Sinica along the Silk Road that Imperial advisers warned that Roman silver reserves were becoming exhausted.|$|R
5|$|Officers wear <b>badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> {{suspended}} from a chain worn around the neck. The badge for the prelate shows the Lesser George encircled by the Garter, which is surmounted by a bishop's mitre. The badge for the chancellor is a rose encircled by the Garter. The badge for the register is two crossed quills over a book encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown. The badge for Garter Principal King of Arms is the royal arms impaled with St George's Cross encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown. The badge for the usher is a knot (like {{those on the}} collars of the companions of the order) encircled by the Garter and surmounted by a crown. The badge for the secretary shows two crossed quills {{in front of a}} rose and encircled by the Garter surmounted by a crown.|$|R
50|$|Badges {{include the}} Combat Infantryman Badge, Master Parachutist Badge, Joint Staff Identification, Army General Staff Identification <b>Badge,</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> the Secretary <b>of</b> Defense Identification <b>Badge,</b> Defense Intelligence Agency Badge, and the Expert Marksmanship Badge.|$|R
60|$|Next {{we went to}} the enclosure, where Mrs. Eversley with {{a native}} knife cut a string of palm fibres that was sealed with clay on to the door and one of its {{uprights}} in such a fashion that none could enter without breaking the string. The impression was made with a rude seal that she wore round her neck as a <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office.</b> It was a very curious object fashioned of gold and having deeply cut upon its face a rough image of an ape holding a flower in its right paw. As it was also ancient, this seemed to show that the monkey god and the orchid had been from the beginning jointly worshipped by the Pongo.|$|E
60|$|So they {{followed}} {{her through the}} low archway, and in a room beyond, very simply furnished, sat a young girl engaged in darning a pair of pink stockings. She was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age, not fat {{like all the rest}} of the Pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty. Her complexion was not a decided pink, but a soft, rosy tint not much deeper than that of Trot's skin. Instead of a silken gown furbelowed like all the others they had seen women wear in this land, Tourmaline was dressed in a severely plain robe of coarse pink cloth much resembling bedticking. Across her brow, however, was a band of rose gold, in the center of which was set a luminous pink jewel which gleamed more brilliantly than a diamond. It was her <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> and seemed very incongruous when compared with her poor rainment and simple surroundings.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, {{this was}} {{certainly}} the great guest-chamber of the Blossholme Priory, which, since the nuns had now few guests and many places in which to put them, had been given up to her, Sir John Foterell's heiress, as her schoolroom. There she lay, thinking {{that she was a}} child again, a happy, careless child, or that she dreamed, till presently the door opened and Mother Matilda appeared, followed by Emlyn, who bore a tray, on which stood a silver bowl that smoked. There was no mistaking Mother Matilda in her black Benedictine robe and her white whimple, wearing the great silver crucifix which was her <b>badge</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> and the golden ring with an emerald bezel whereon was cut St. Catherine being broken on the wheel--the ancient ring which every Prioress of Blossholme had worn from the beginning. Moreover, who that had ever seen it could forget her sweet, old, high-bred face, with the fine lips, the arched nose, and the quick, kind grey eyes! ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{condemned}} {{by the college}} of pontifices, she was stripped of her vittae and other <b>badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> was scourged, was attired like a corpse, placed in a close litter, and borne through the forum attended by her weeping kindred, with all the ceremonies of a real funeral, to a rising ground called the Campus Sceleratus just within the city walls, close to the Colline gate. There a small vault underground had been previously prepared, containing a couch, a lamp, and {{a table with a}} little food. The pontifex maximus, having lifted up his hands to heaven and uttered a secret prayer, opened the litter, led forth the culprit, and placing her {{on the steps of the}} ladder which gave access to the subterranean cell, delivered her over to the common executioner and his assistants, who conducted her down, drew up the ladder, and having filled the pit with earth until the surface was level with the surrounding ground, left her to perish deprived of all the tributes of respect usually paid to the spirits of the departed.|$|R
50|$|His {{military}} decorations {{include the}} Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, and the Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters.

40|$|Based on a {{range of}} new archaeological {{research}} (most of it carried out by the author herself), this book breaks new ground. It examines changes in the Western provinces in the fourth and early fifth centuries, which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. First, the author investigates regional variation within the late Roman West: important differences are found between the heavily militarised provinces of the frontier and those furthur west, and the general shift of focus from one area to another is clearly visible as the fourth century comes to its end. In combination with other burial evidence, the movement of people can be traced through the objects they were wearing, and the activity of the Roman military on the frontiers can be investigated through <b>badges</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> - the crossbow brooch and the belt set. Even in the fourth century, the increasing importance of the Germanic-style culture is becoming apparent, corresponding to the breakdown of much Roman-inspired culture in the fifth century. All these strands are skillfully brought together in Dr Swift's new account {{of the end of the}} Roman West and its legacy to the post-Roman world...|$|R
