Shrewsbury also had a large cheese market in Victorian times.|$|E
5|$|Female {{friendship}}s {{are central}} to both of Wollstonecraft's novels, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, {{that is the most}} historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman {{is one of the first}} moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.|$|E

5|$|In Earth's crust, {{scandium}} is not rare. Estimates {{vary from}} 18 to 25ppm, which {{is comparable to}} the abundance of cobalt (20–30ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant in the crust), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 23rd most common element in the Sun. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Jurassic Park III premiered at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, California, on July 16, 2001, {{followed}} {{two days}} later by a release in the United States and other countries. The film earned $181,171,875 in the United States and $368,780,809 worldwide, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year worldwide <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lowest grossing Jurassic Park film in the entire series. The film was released on VHS and DVD on December 11, 2001. It was re-released with both sequels in December 2001 as the Jurassic Park Trilogy, and as the Jurassic Park Adventure Pack in November 2005. The film has also been released as a two-disc DVD set alongside Hulk. In 2011, the film was released on Blu-ray {{as part of the}} Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy. The soundtrack was released in July 2001.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} entomopathogenic {{nematode}} are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a microscopic nematode that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a free-living, infective {{stage in the}} soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as Moraxella osloensis. The nematode enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> bacteria that kill the slug. The nematode is available commercially in Europe and is applied by watering onto moist soil.|$|E

5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a {{little in common with}} automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E
5|$|The NSS {{is headed}} by Baek San (Kim Yeong-cheol), its {{standing}} deputy director only in title and {{the man responsible for}} the recruiting of Hyun-jun and Sa-woo. The named director of the NSS comes and goes with each change of power in the presidency, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> deputy director that oversees the organization. Baek San's motivations for many of his actions are mysterious, occasionally outright inconsistent with that of the general national interests. Due to the very existence of the organization being kept secret, he enjoys a state of personal protection that few others do.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{sources for}} the early Sasanian period are not contemporary. Among them the most important are the Greeks Agathias and Malalas, the Persian Muslims al-Tabari and Ferdowsi, the Armenian Agathangelos, and the Syriac Chronicles of Edessa and Arbela, most of whom depended on late Sasanian sources, especially Khwaday-Namag. The Augustan History is neither contemporary nor reliable, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> chief narrative source for Severus and Carus. The trilingual (Greek, Parthian, and Middle Persian) inscriptions of Shapur are primary sources. These were isolated attempts at approaching written historiography however, {{and by the end}} of the 4th centuryAD, even the practice of carving rock reliefs and leaving short inscriptions was abandoned by the Sasanians.|$|E
