5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} or wood nuthatch (Sitta europaea) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{found throughout}} temperate Asia and in Europe, where its name is the nuthatch. Like other nuthatches, it is a short-tailed <b>bird</b> <b>with</b> a long bill, blue-grey upperparts and a black eye-stripe. It is a vocal <b>bird</b> <b>with</b> a repeated loud dwip call. There are more than 20 subspecies in three main groups; birds in {{the west of the}} range have orange-buff underparts and a white throat, those in Russia have whitish underparts, and those in the Far East have a similar appearance to European birds, but lack the white throat.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{descriptive study}} {{was done on}} broiler chickens with abnormal livers found at processing. Two syndromes were evident: those <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> enlarged, pale, firm livers, designated hepatosis, with Clostridium perfringens type A often isolated; and ascitic <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> cobblestone-appearing livers. Livers with hepatosis had marked proliferation of bile ducts; ascitic livers had normal architecture. Hearts from <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> ascites had elevated right ventricular/total ventricular weight ratios, whereas hearts from normal <b>birds</b> and <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> hepatosis did not. Two isolates of C. perfringens produced necrotic enteritis in experimental birds; an attempt to reproduce hepatosis with these isolates was unsuccessful...|$|R
40|$|Feather pecking is a {{major problem}} in laying hens. Frustration, i. e. the {{omission}} of expected reward, {{may play a role in}} the development of feather pecking. In two experiments, we studied if feather pecking could be facilitated by short-term frustration in <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a high feather pecking phenotype and victims of feather pecking (experiment 1), and in <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a high or low feather pecking genotype (experiment 2). Furthermore, the motivation to peck a key for a food reward was assessed in <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a high or low feather pecking genotype in experiment 3, as birds that have a stronger motivation may also react stronger to the omission of a reward. We trained birds to peck a key for a food reward in an automated Skinnerbox and tested them in control and frustration sessions. During frustration, the feeder was covered with Perspex. Frustration did not facilitate feather pecking in either experiment. In experiment 1, <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a high feather pecking phenotype did show more gentle feather pecking and aggressive pecking than victims of feather pecking during some of the control sessions. Furthermore, victims of feather pecking vocalised more than <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a high feather pecking phenotype. In experiment 2, <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a high feather pecking genotype scratched more than <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a low feather pecking genotype, indicating differences in motivation for foraging or dust-bathing behaviour, which shows a relation to feather pecking. <b>Birds</b> <b>with</b> a low feather pecking genotype also had a stronger motivation to peck at a key for a food reward than <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a high feather pecking genotype. No evidence was found that feather pecking could be facilitated by short-term frustration in a Skinnerbox. However, differences in reaction to frustration and in motivation to peck a key for a food reward in <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a high or low feather pecking phenotype or genotype indicate that frustration may still play a role in the development of feather pecking...|$|R

40|$|Reaction to {{frustration}} of high (HFP) and low feather pecking (LFP) laying hens was investigated. From a HFP- and a LFP-line five <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a HFP- and five <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a LFP-phenotype were selected. Birds from the HFP-line {{were expected to}} show more key pecking and covered feeder pecking during frustration than birds from the LFP-line. When a bunch of feathers was presented, <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a HFP-phenotype were expected to redirect their pecks at the bunch. Birds were trained to peck a key for a food reward in an automated Skinnerbox and subjected to two sessions: a control session, where food was available, and a frustration session, where the feeder was covered with Perspex. These two sessions were repeated {{in the presence of}} a bunch of feathers. Unexpectedly, birds from the LFP-line had a stronger reaction to frustration than birds from the HFP-line, expressed in pecking behaviour. When a bunch of feathers was offered, <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a HFP-phenotype did not show more bunch pecking during frustration than <b>birds</b> <b>with</b> a LFP-phenotype...|$|R
