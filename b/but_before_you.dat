On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades' life and then refused to accept honors for it (219e-221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present (221c). But be warned: Socrates may present himself as your lover, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> know it you will have {{fallen in love with}} him.|$|E
2500|$|For many years, Batchelor {{resided in}} Grosse Pointe, Michigan. In his final months, Batchelor {{lived in a}} nursing home in Detroit. Sportswriter Joe Falls {{remained}} close to Batchelor in his later years. After Batchelor died, Falls described a visit to Batchelor at the nursing home:"Batch couldn't have weighed more than 60 pounds at the end, but his mind was nimble. He'd drift between fantasy and fact. ... <b>But</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> could feel pangs of sadness at his deterioration, he'd pull you close to the bed and whisper: 'I think it's great the Lions got Munson from the Rams. They couldn't win with Plum and Munson has the poise to be a good quarterback. Pour me a drink' Batch went out the way he would have wanted, with his lifelong friend and companion, Jack Daniels, at his side. He couldn't eat at the end, and water repulsed him, so they let him sip his favorite liquid." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Engleton," [...] he said, [...] "this is absurd. We {{can afford}} to ignore your mad {{behaviour}} and your discourtesy, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> leave this room we must come to an understanding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a bannock {{and some}} pork yonder. It won't {{take long to}} warm up, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> get any, {{we must have a}} talk. Why did you leave the rest of Mappin's hobos?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to that," [...] he {{answered}} firmly, [...] "one may have opinions. My hand at least is free from bloodshed. You are there with nothing <b>but</b> death <b>before</b> <b>you.</b> I {{am here to}} ask a question." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do," [...] the Colonel said, {{soothing}} his arm tenderly. [...] "Do, my boy. She's a good girl, and she'll {{advise you}} rightly. Go {{and speak to}} her; <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> go, promise me, promise me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well," [...] {{answered}} Tua. [...] "I {{thank you}} and the gods shall give you your reward. Leave us, {{and go back to}} your homes, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> go, take a gift from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! to-morrow--after breakfast will do. It is {{too late}} to-night. <b>But</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> go, I may as well let you see the little one you are to have charge of. I hear she is awake." ...|$|E
