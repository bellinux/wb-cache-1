25|$|The {{report is}} above all, a <b>benchmark</b> <b>study</b> of regulation. The survey {{consists}} of a questionnaire designed by the Doing Business team {{with the assistance of}} academic advisers. The questionnaire centers on a simple business case that ensures comparability across economies and over time. The survey also bases assumptions on the legal form of the business, size, location, and nature of its operations. The ease of doing business index is meant to measure regulations directly affecting businesses and does not directly measure more general conditions such as a nation's proximity to large markets, quality of infrastructure, inflation, or crime.|$|E

2500|$|In a <b>benchmark</b> <b>study</b> {{on rural}} poverty the World Bank {{estimated}} that about 1.2 billion people {{earn less than}} US $1 a day (adjusted for Purchasing power parity), and that about 70% of them live in rural areas. [...] "More {{than half a century}} of persistent efforts … has not altered the stubborn reality of rural poverty, and the {{gap between rich and poor}} is widening. The likelihood of achieving the Millennium Development Goals without a focus on improving the livelihoods and service accessibility of rural dwellers is low." [...] Since most of these individuals cannot read or write, they do not use the internet, and are less likely than their neighbours to dial out on their mobile phones or initiate mobile banking transactions. An important implication of Ong's argument is that, in explaining their response to technology, residually oral culture is as important a factor as capabilities.|$|E
