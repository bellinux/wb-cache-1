5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980.

Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> to one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} accounted for about 29% of the jobs in Washington, D.C. This is thought to immunize Washington to national economic downturns because {{the federal government}} continues operations even during recessions.

5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, {{brought to the}} Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> to 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E
5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a lower limit on the planet's mass, which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use. However, assuming a random orientation of the planet's orbit, the true mass is likely to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> to the measured minimum mass.|$|E

Maga threatened that the north would secede if his victory was not validated, and Apithy threatened that his base of Porto-Novo would join with Nigeria.

5|$|At 42, Glenn was {{the oldest}} member of the {{astronaut}} corps and would likely <b>be</b> <b>close</b> to 50 {{by the time the}} lunar landings took place. During Glenn's training, NASA psychologists determined that he was the astronaut best suited for public life. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy suggested to Glenn and his wife in December 1962 that he run for the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1964, challenging aging incumbent Stephen M. Young (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. Since it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for Project Apollo missions, he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his Democratic Party candidacy for the U.S. Senate from his home state of Ohio the following day.|$|E

5|$|Brisingr is {{the third}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. It was {{released}} on September 20, 2008. Originally, Paolini intended to conclude the then Inheritance Trilogy in three books, but during writing the third book he decided that the series was too complex to conclude in one book, because the single book would <b>be</b> <b>close</b> to 1,500 pages long. A deluxe edition of Brisingr, which includes removed scenes and previously unseen art, was released on October 13, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> to the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to {{come in contact with}} target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may <b>be</b> <b>close</b> together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E

5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> to 15,000.|$|E
5|$|However, nuclear DNA {{sequence}} comparisons {{reported in}} 2017 suggest that Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Sumatran orangutans about 3.4 million years ago. Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Bornean orangutans, much later, about 670,000 years ago. Orangutans travelled from Sumatra to Borneo as the islands were connected by land bridges {{as parts of}} Sundaland during recent glacial periods when sea levels were much lower. The present range of Tapanuli orangutans is thought to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> {{to the point where}} ancestral orangutans first entered what is now Indonesia from mainland Asia.|$|E
5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} Anomalocaris from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that are thought to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.|$|E
