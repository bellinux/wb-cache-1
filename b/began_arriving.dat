Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany, and France <b>began</b> <b>arriving</b> in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot.|$|E

On 1January 1942, No.60 Squadron was established at Forest Hill from No.2 SFTS aircraft and personnel. Equipped with 18 Wirraways, the unit formed part of the expansion of the Australian military in response to the rapid Japanese advance in the first month of the Pacific War. A contingent of 68 WAAAFs also <b>began</b> <b>arriving</b> at Forest Hill in January.|$|E

5|$|No.38 Squadron's Dakotas <b>began</b> <b>arriving</b> at Changi on 19June 1950, and No.1 Squadron's Lincolns at Tengah on 16July.

Rescue trains <b>began</b> <b>arriving</b> from across eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States, but were impeded by a blizzard. Construction of temporary shelters {{to house the}} many people left homeless began soon after the disaster. The initial judicial inquiry found Mont-Blanc to {{have been responsible for}} the disaster, but a later appeal determined that both vessels were to blame.

5|$|Solomon Creek {{was first}} settled by Native Americans around 8000 to 6000 B.C.E. A settler {{arrived at the}} {{confluence}} of the creek with the Susquehanna River by 1774.

5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force <b>began</b> <b>arriving</b> over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and was on a second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E

Minefields and picket lines of cruisers, torpedo boats, and submarines were also emplaced there to defend Wilhelmshaven. Helgolands engines were kept running for the entirety of her deployment, so that she would be ready to respond at a moment's notice. Four days later, on 13 August, Helgoland returned to Wilhelmshaven to refuel. The following day, naval reservists <b>began</b> <b>arriving</b> to fill out the wartime complements for the German battleships.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio <b>began</b> <b>arriving</b> that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the brief}} time {{available}} before settlers {{were due to}} <b>begin</b> <b>arriving,</b> the survey was conducted very hastily.
