At this point, these techniques have not been validated by large-scale trials and are not in general use.|$|E

25|$|At higher Reynolds numbers, {{the flow}} became chaotic {{resulting}} in <b>broad-band</b> sound. The hole tone has been rediscovered {{in the form}} of the tea pot whistle. They found that above a Reynolds number of 2000, hole tone operation occurred with symmetric vortex evolution and a constant Strouhal number with Reynolds number. Comparison of their data with data in the figure suggests that the cylindrical enclosure between the two orifices raises the Strouhal number. There was no mention of frequency jumps. They noted that at lower speeds, the cylindrical volume responded as a Helmholtz resonator. Baron Rayleigh was aware of this whistle; it was called the bird call then.|$|E
25|$|Raman {{amplifiers}} {{have some}} fundamental advantages. First, Raman gain exists in every fiber, {{which provides a}} cost-effective means of upgrading from the terminal ends. Second, the gain is nonresonant, which means that gain is available over the entire transparency region of the fiber ranging from approximately 0.3 to 2µm. A third advantage of Raman amplifiers is that the gain spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the pump wavelengths. For instance, multiple pump lines {{can be used to}} increase the optical bandwidth, and the pump distribution determines the gain flatness. Another advantage of Raman amplification {{is that it is a}} relatively <b>broad-band</b> amplifier with a bandwidth > 5 THz, and the gain is reasonably flat over a wide wavelength range.|$|E
25|$|On March 28, 2011, a {{supermassive black}} hole was seen tearing a {{mid-size}} star apart. That {{is the only}} likely explanation of the observations that day of sudden X-ray radiation and the follow-up <b>broad-band</b> observations. The source was previously an inactive galactic nucleus, and from study of the outburst the galactic nucleus {{is estimated to be}} a SMBH with mass of the order of a million solar masses. This rare event is assumed to be a relativistic outflow (material being emitted in a jet at a significant fraction of the speed of light) from a star tidally disrupted by the SMBH. A significant fraction of a solar mass of material is expected to have accreted onto the SMBH. Subsequent long-term observation will allow this assumption to be confirmed if the emission from the jet decays at the expected rate for mass accretion onto a SMBH.|$|E

25|$|The radio {{emission}} from radio-loud active galaxies is synchrotron emission, as inferred from its very smooth, <b>broad-band</b> nature and strong polarization. This {{implies that the}} radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons with relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors of ~104) and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. There {{is no way of}} determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, {{there is no way to}} determine the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation: the same synchrotron emissivity may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, or something in between. It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given emissivity can have, but for many years there was no particular reason to believe that the true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.|$|E

The flyby provided images of up to 60meters per pixel resolution and covered about 50% of the surface, mostly in the northern hemisphere. The 462 images were obtained in 21 narrow- and <b>broad-band</b> filters extending from 0.24 to 1μm. Lutetia was also observed by the visible–near-infrared imaging spectrometer VIRTIS, and measurements of the magnetic field and plasma environment were taken as well.|$|E
2500|$|For {{practical}} purposes, {{the separation}} between wires must be less than the wavelength of the incident radiation. [...] In addition, the width of each wires should be small compared to the spacing between wires. Therefore, it {{is relatively easy to}} construct wire-grid polarizers for microwaves, far-infrared, and mid-infrared radiation. [...] In addition, advanced lithographic techniques can also build very tight pitch metallic grids, allowing for the polarization of visible light to a useful degree. Since the degree of polarization depends little on wavelength and angle of incidence, they are used for <b>broad-band</b> applications such as projection.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the development of}} a material interface perturbed by a spectrum of modes when subjected to an acceleration by a shock wave. We use the Eulerian Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code, Raptor, for the multi-fluid simulations. In two-dimensions we consider a number of <b>broad-banded</b> initial spectrum over a range of Atwood numbers accelerated by a weak M= 1. 3 shock wave. For a given realization, we consider decomposing into three cases: 1) the full <b>broad-banded</b> spectrum, 2) the long wavelength modes, and 3) the short wavelength modes. Here long or short is determined by comparison with the transverse dimension, L, of the computational domain. It is found that the subsequent evolution of the overall mixed width reaches an asymptotic tθ scaling for both bubbles and spikes. In the <b>broad-banded</b> and short wave length cases, the spikes and bubbles evolve in an Atwood number independent manner with θ = 0. 4, approximately. The long wavelength case exhibits the strong spike Atwood number dependence given previously in the literature (Alon et al. (1995)). In three-dimensions, we reconsider the weak shock case as well as the strong shock (M= 5) case. The weak shock case gives, for <b>broad-banded</b> perturbations, an asymptotic scaling for both bubbles and spikes of θ = 0. 5 at At= 0. 6. The evolution of the amount of mixed material also grows with a square root dependence. Including additional accelerations from the incident shock wave reflecting off of a solid end-wall...|$|R
2500|$|NAVAIR {{planned to}} release the draft RFP {{by the end of}} March 2014. [...] The Navy was {{optimizing}} the UCLASS for ISR and limited strike rather than long-range strike, along with a potential tanker role. [...] On 18 February 2014, Congressman Randy Forbes wrote a letter to Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus advocating for the UCLASS to have aerial refueling, survivability, and payloads to make it effective in future contested air environments. [...] Forbes requested the aircraft have <b>broad-band</b> stealth to survive integrated air defense systems and have the payload capacity to simultaneously support land and sea missions. [...] Aerial refueling was also cited as a needed capability for responding to far-off threats and conducting missions outside the envelope of long-range threats, particularly the Chinese DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile. The first flight of the UCLASS has been delayed from early 2017 to mid-2018.|$|E
2500|$|Astronomy is very {{sensitive}} to light pollution. The night sky viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what {{can be seen from}} dark skies. Skyglow (the scattering of light in the atmosphere) reduces the contrast between stars and galaxies and the sky itself, making it much harder to see fainter objects. This is one factor that has caused newer telescopes to be built in increasingly remote areas. Some astronomers use narrow-band [...] "nebula filters" [...] which only allow specific wavelengths of light commonly seen in nebulae, or <b>broad-band</b> [...] "light pollution filters" [...] which are designed to reduce (but not eliminate) the effects of light pollution by filtering out spectral lines commonly emitted by sodium- and mercury-vapor lamps, thus enhancing contrast and improving the view of dim objects such as galaxies and nebulae. Unfortunately these light pollution reduction (LPR) filters are not a cure for light pollution. LPR filters reduce the brightness of the object under study and this limits the use of higher magnifications. LPR filters work by blocking light of certain wavelengths, which alters the color of the object, often creating a pronounced green cast. Furthermore, LPR filters only work on certain object types (mainly emission nebulae) and are of little use on galaxies and stars. No filter can match the effectiveness of a dark sky for visual or photographic purposes. Due to their low surface brightness, the visibility of diffuse sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies is affected by light pollution more than are stars. Most such objects are rendered invisible in heavily light polluted skies around major cities. A simple method for estimating the darkness of a location is to look for the Milky Way, which from truly dark skies appears bright enough to cast a shadow.|$|E
