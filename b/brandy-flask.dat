6000|$|They all {{followed}} this advice {{with the exception}} of one man, a coarse savage-looking fellow, with a huge black beard and matted locks, who called himself Bradling, though there was ground for doubting whether that was the name by which he had been at first known in the world. This man pulled out an enormous <b>brandy-flask,</b> and with a scoffing laugh said:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Henry lay insensible {{where he}} had fallen. We tore away his collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of {{gratitude}} when we {{saw that there was}} no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. Already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade thrust his <b>brandy-flask</b> between the baronet's teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.|$|E
60|$|In the Peninsula the Spanish {{outposts}} {{would present}} their muskets at ours, but the British their <b>brandy-flasks.</b> And {{of all these}} generous men there was none who was the equal of this admirable milord, who held out so warm a hand to an enemy in distress.|$|R
6000|$|How had Mrs. Gereth {{known in}} advance {{that if she had}} chosen to be [...] "vile" [...] (that was what Fleda called it) {{everything}} would happen to help her?--especially the way her poor father, after breakfast, doddered off to his club, showing seventy when he was really fifty-seven, and leaving her richly alone for the day. He came back about midnight, looking at her very hard and not risking long words--only making her feel by inimitable touches that the presence of his family compelled him to alter all his hours. She had in their common sitting-room the company of the objects he was fond of saying that he had collected--objects, shabby and battered, of a sort that appealed little to his daughter: old <b>brandy-flasks</b> and match-boxes, old calendars and hand-books, intermixed with an assortment of pen-wipers and ash-trays, a harvest he had gathered in from penny bazaars. He was blandly unconscious of that side of Fleda's nature which had endeared her to Mrs. Gereth, and she had often heard him wish to goodness there was something striking she cared for. Why didn't she try collecting something?--it didn't matter what. She would find it gave an interest to life, and there was no end of little curiosities one could easily pick up. He was conscious of having a taste for fine things which his children had unfortunately not inherited. This indicated the limits of their acquaintance with him--limits which, as Fleda was now sharply aware, could only leave him to wonder what the mischief she was there for. As she herself echoed this question to the letter she was {{not in a position to}} clear up the mystery. She couldn't have given a name to her errand in town or explained it save by saying that she had had to get away from Ricks. It was intensely provisional, but what was to come next? Nothing could come next but a deeper anxiety. She had neither a home nor an outlook--nothing in all the wide world but a feeling of suspense.|$|R
60|$|However desirous Marshal Villars {{might be}} to fight, my Lord Duke did not seem {{disposed}} to indulge him this campaign. Last year his Grace had been all for the Whigs and Hanoverians; but finding, on going to England, his country cold towards himself, {{and the people in}} a ferment of High Church loyalty, the Duke comes back to his army cooled towards the Hanoverians, cautious with the Imperialists, and particularly civil and polite towards the Chevalier de St. George. 'Tis certain that messengers and letters were continually passing between his Grace and his brave nephew, the Duke of Berwick, in the opposite camp. No man's caresses were more opportune than his Grace's, and no man ever uttered expressions of regard and affection more generously. He professed to Monsieur de Torcy, so Mr. St. John told the writer, quite an eagerness to be cut in pieces for the exiled Queen and her family; nay more, I believe, this year he parted with a portion of the most precious part of himself--his money--which he sent over to the royal exiles. Mr. Tunstal, who was in the Prince's service, was twice or thrice in and out of our camp; the French, in theirs of Arlieu and about Arras. A little river, the Canihe I think 'twas called, (but this is writ away from books and Europe; and the only map the writer hath of these scenes of his youth, bears no mark of this little stream,) divided our pickets from the enemy's. Our sentries talked across the stream, when they could make themselves understood to each other, and when they could not, grinned, and handed each other their <b>brandy-flasks</b> or their pouches of tobacco. And one fine day of June, riding thither with the officer who visited the outposts, (Colonel Esmond was taking an airing on horseback, being too weak for military duty,) they came to this river, where a number of English and Scots were assembled, talking to the good-natured enemy on the other side.|$|R
60|$|And the boy--for he who {{addressed}} {{the most brilliant}} company of wits in Europe was little more--emptied {{the contents of the}} <b>brandy-flask</b> into a silver flagon, and quaffed it gayly {{to the health of the}} company assembled. 'Twas the third he had taken during the sitting. Presently, and with a graceful salute to the Society, he quitted the coffee-house, and was seen cantering on a magnificent Arab past the National Gallery.|$|E
6000|$|Schwartz applied {{himself to}} the <b>brandy-flask,</b> and began to laugh again. [...] "There never was such good company as Jack," [...] he said, in his oiliest tones. [...] "You can't get out to-night, Mrs. Witch. The gates are locked--and they don't trust me with the key. Walk in, ma'am. Plenty of {{accommodation}} for you, {{on that side of}} the room where Jack sits. We are slack of guests for the grave, to-night. Walk in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo, Ralph, boy! Rouse up, lad; we're safe now! Poor thing! I believe he's fainted." [...] And raising me in {{his arms}} he laid me on {{the folds of the}} gaff-topsail, which lay upon the deck near the tiller. [...] "Here, take a drop o' this; it'll do you good, my boy," [...] he added in a voice of {{tenderness}} which I had never heard him use before, while he held a <b>brandy-flask</b> to my lips.|$|E
6000|$|When Owen and Fleda {{were in her}} father's {{little place}} and, among the <b>brandy-flasks</b> and pen-wipers, still more disconcerted and divided, the girl--to do something, though it would make him stay--had ordered tea, he put the letter before her quite {{as if he had}} guessed her thought. [...] "She's still a bit nasty--fancy!" [...] He handed her the scrap of a note which he had pulled {{out of his pocket and}} from its envelope. [...] "Fleda Vetch," [...] it ran, [...] "is at 10 Raphael Road, West Kensington. Go to see her, and try, for God's sake, to {{cultivate}} a glimmer of intelligence." [...] When in handing it back to him she took in his face she saw that its heightened color was the effect of his watching her read such an allusion to his want of wit. Fleda knew what it was an allusion to, and his pathetic air of having received this buffet, tall and fine and kind as he stood there, made her conscious of not quite concealing her knowledge. For a minute she was kept silent by an angered sense of the trick that had been played her. It was a trick because Fleda considered there had been a covenant; and the trick consisted of Mrs. Gereth's having broken the spirit of their agreement while conforming in a fashion to the letter. Under the girl's menace of a complete rupture she had been afraid to make of her secret the use she itched to make; but in the course of these days of separation she had gathered pluck to hazard an indirect betrayal. Fleda measured her hesitations and the impulse which she had finally obeyed and which the continued procrastination of Waterbath had encouraged, had at last made irresistible. If in her high-handed manner of playing their game she had not named the thing hidden, she had named the hiding-place. It was over the sense of this wrong that Fleda's lips closed tight: she was afraid of aggravating her case by some ejaculation that would make Owen prick up his ears. A great, quick effort, however, helped her to avoid the danger; with her constant idea of keeping cool and repressing a visible flutter, she found herself able to choose her words. Meanwhile he had exclaimed with his uncomfortable laugh: [...] "That's a good one for me, Miss Vetch, isn't it?" ...|$|R
60|$|As we {{left the}} house, we looked into the dark and squalid dining-room, where a lunch of cold meat was set out; but having no {{associations}} with the house except through this one dead man, {{it seemed as if}} his presence and attributes pervaded it wholly. He {{appears to have been a}} man of reprehensible habits, though well advanced in years. I ought not to forget a <b>brandy-flask</b> (empty) among his other effects. The landlady and daughter made a good impression on me, as honest and respectable persons.|$|E
6000|$|As I {{watched them}} disappearing, the white-haired man {{returned}} with a <b>brandy-flask</b> and some biscuits. [...] "Something to go on with, Prendick," [...] said he, in a far more familiar tone than before. I made no ado, but set {{to work on the}} biscuits at once, while the white-haired man helped Montgomery to release about a score more of the rabbits. Three big hutches, however, went up to the house with the puma. The brandy I did not touch, for I have been an abstainer from my birth.|$|E
6000|$|As Rigg {{pronounced}} {{the last words}} he turned round and looked at Raffles with his prominent frozen eyes. The contrast was as striking as {{it could have been}} eighteen years before, when Rigg was a most unengaging kickable boy, and Raffles was the rather thick-set Adonis of bar-rooms and back-parlors. But the advantage now was on the side of Rigg, and auditors of this conversation might probably have expected that Raffles would retire with the air of a defeated dog. Not at all. He made a grimace which was habitual with him whenever he was [...] "out" [...] in a game; then subsided into a laugh, and drew a <b>brandy-flask</b> from his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like the}} wet," [...] said Lucinda. All the while seven men {{were at work}} with picks and shovels, and the master and {{four or five of}} the more ardent sportsmen were deeply engaged in {{what seemed to be a}} mining {{operation}} on a small scale. The huntsman stood over giving his orders. One enthusiastic man, who had been lying on his belly, grovelling in the mud for five minutes, with a long stick in his hand, was now applying the point of it scientifically to his nose. An ordinary observer with a magnifying-glass might have seen a hair at the end of the stick. [...] "He's there," [...] said the enthusiastic man, covered with mud, after a long-drawn, eager sniff at the stick. The huntsman deigned to give one glance. [...] "That's rabbit," [...] said the huntsman. A conclave was immediately formed over the one visible hair that stuck to the stick, and three experienced farmers decided that it was rabbit. The muddy enthusiastic man, silenced but not convinced, retired from the crowd, leaving his stick behind him, and comforted himself with his <b>brandy-flask.</b>|$|E
60|$|Over {{the whole}} {{landscape}} lay a luminous and unnatural discoloration, as of that disastrous twilight which Milton spoke of as shed {{by the sun}} in eclipse; so that Syme fell easily into his first thought, {{that he was actually}} on some other and emptier planet, which circled round some sadder star. But the more he felt this glittering desolation in the moonlit land, the more his own chivalric folly glowed in the night like a great fire. Even the common things he carried with him--the food and the brandy and the loaded pistol--took on exactly that concrete and material poetry which a child feels when he takes a gun upon a journey or a bun with him to bed. The sword-stick and the <b>brandy-flask,</b> though in themselves only the tools of morbid conspirators, became the expressions of his own more healthy romance. The sword-stick became almost the sword of chivalry, and the brandy the wine of the stirrup-cup. For even the most dehumanised modern fantasies depend on some older and simpler figure; the adventures may be mad, but the adventurer must be sane. The dragon without St. George would not even be grotesque. So this inhuman landscape was only imaginative by the presence of a man really human. To Syme's exaggerative mind the bright, bleak houses and terraces by the Thames looked as empty as the mountains of the moon. But even the moon is only poetical because there is a man in the moon.|$|E
60|$|He {{could have}} put {{the case to the}} guide himself; but though the guide was imaginably liberated to a {{cosmopolitan}} conception of things by three years' service as waiter in English hotels, where he learned the language, he might not have risen to this. He would have tried, for he was a willing and kindly soul, though he was not a 'valet de place' by profession. There seemed in fact but one of that useless and amusing race (which is everywhere falling into decay through the rivalry of the perfected Baedeker,) left in Leipsic, and this one was engaged, so that the Marches had to devolve upon their ex-waiter, who was now the keeper of a small restaurant. He gladly abandoned his business to the care of his wife, in order to drive handsomely about in his best clothes, with strangers who did not exact too much knowledge from him. In his zeal to do something he possessed himself of March's overcoat when they dismounted at their first gallery, and let fall from its pocket his prophylactic flask of brandy, which broke with a loud crash on the marble floor in the presence of several masterpieces, and perfumed the whole place. The masterpieces were some excellent works of Luke Kranach, who seemed the only German painter worth looking at when there were any Dutch or Italian pictures near, but the travellers forgot the name and nature of the Kranachs, and remembered afterwards only the shattered fragments of the <b>brandy-flask,</b> just how they looked on the floor, and the fumes, how they smelt, that rose from the ruin.|$|E
