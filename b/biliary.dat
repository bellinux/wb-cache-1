5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the <b>biliary</b> system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the <b>biliary</b> system. Finally, increased <b>biliary</b> pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. <b>Biliary</b> obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|In 1912, he {{performed}} what was arguably the first <b>biliary</b> tract endoscopy.|$|E
5|$|Infection {{with the}} {{bacteria}} Helicobacter bilis and Helicobacter hepaticus species can cause <b>biliary</b> cancer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>biliary</b> tree is {{normally}} relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The <b>biliary</b> system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does not allow {{the establishment of an}} infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the epithelium of the bile duct also has a protective role.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a permanent <b>biliary</b> stent (e.g. in pancreatic cancer) slightly {{increases the risk of}} cholangitis, but stents of this type are often needed to keep the bile duct patent under outside pressure.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine. Other <b>biliary</b> tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas {{may vary}} from {{undifferentiated}} to well-differentiated. They are often {{surrounded by a}} brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; {{in the presence of}} extensive fibrosis, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign <b>biliary</b> ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E
5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary <b>biliary</b> cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, <b>biliary</b> narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} <b>biliary</b> obstruction. This is usually deferred until 24–48hours after admission, when the patient is stable and has shown some improvement with antibiotics, but may need to happen as an emergency in case of ongoing deterioration despite adequate treatment, or if antibiotics are not effective in reducing the signs of infection (which happens in 15% of cases).|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for <b>biliary</b> obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the <b>biliary</b> system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the liver}} and <b>biliary</b> tree is often used as the initial imaging {{modality}} in patients with suspected obstructive jaundice. Ultrasound can identify obstruction and ductal dilatation and, in some cases, may be sufficient to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) scanning may also {{play an important role}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve <b>biliary</b> obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of <b>biliary</b> cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E
5|$|Acute cholangitis {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk of death, {{the leading cause}} being irreversible shock with multiple organ failure (a possible complication of severe infections). Improvements in diagnosis and treatment {{have led to a}} reduction in mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%. Patients with signs of multiple organ failure are likely to die unless they undergo early <b>biliary</b> drainage and treatment with systemic antibiotics. Other causes of death following severe cholangitis include heart failure and pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the <b>biliary</b> tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought {{to play a role in}} this progression.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or <b>biliary</b> ductal dilatation may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in {{people who have been}} treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo cholecystectomy have an increased risk of recurrent <b>biliary</b> pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), {{have been associated with}} an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and <b>biliary</b> papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of <b>biliary</b> colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
25|$|Cancers of the <b>biliary</b> tree, {{including}} cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of infection in definitive host {{is divided into}} two phases: the parenchymal (migratory) phase and the <b>biliary</b> phase. The parenchymal phase begins when excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the intestinal wall. After the penetration of the intestine, flukes migrate within the abdominal cavity and penetrate the liver or other organs. F. hepatica has a strong predilection for the tissues of the liver. Occasionally, ectopic locations of flukes such as the lungs, diaphragm, intestinal wall, kidneys, and subcutaneous tissue can occur. During the migration of flukes, tissues are mechanically destroyed and inflammation appears around migratory tracks of flukes. The second phase (the <b>biliary</b> phase) begins when parasites enter the <b>biliary</b> ducts of the liver. In <b>biliary</b> ducts, flukes mature, feed on blood, and produce eggs. Hypertrophy of biliar ducts associated with obstruction of the lumen occurs as a result of tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|Primary <b>biliary</b> cirrhosis. CD is {{prevalent}} in primary <b>biliary</b> cirrhosis (PBC). In PBC anti-mitochondrial antibodies are directed toward 3 mitochondrial autoantigens (pyruvate dehydrogenase, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase), 2 or more nuclear proteins (nucleoporin 210kDa, nucleoporin 62kDa, centromere protein, and sp100), and 57% of acute liver failure patients have anti-transglutaminase antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Diseases of the {{hepatobiliary}} system affect the <b>biliary</b> tract (also {{known as the}} <b>biliary</b> tree), which secretes bile in order to aid digestion of fats. Diseases of the gallbladder and bile ducts are commonly diet-related, and may include the formation of gallstones that impact in the gallbladder (cholecystolithiasis) or in the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis).|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis, {{specifically}} hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection, {{and primary}} <b>biliary</b> cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Primary <b>biliary</b> cholangitis (also {{known as}} primary <b>biliary</b> cirrhosis). The bile ducts become damaged by an {{autoimmune}} process, leading to secondary liver damage. Patients may be asymptomatic or have fatigue, pruritus, and non-jaundice skin hyperpigmentation with hepatomegaly. There is prominent alkaline phosphatase elevation {{as well as}} elevations in cholesterol and bilirubin and usually positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies.|$|E
25|$|ERCP or an {{endoscopic}} ultrasound {{can also be}} used if a <b>biliary</b> cause for pancreatitis is suspected.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of spironolactone is eliminated by the kidneys, while minimal amounts are handled by <b>biliary</b> excretion.|$|E
25|$|The {{substrates}} {{utilized by}} the cecum have either passed {{along the entire}} intestine or are <b>biliary</b> excretion products.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of MRI is its utilization of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) sequences. MRCP provides useful {{information regarding the}} etiology of acute pancreatitis, i.e., the presence of tiny <b>biliary</b> stones (choledocholithiasis or cholelithiasis) and duct anomalies. Clinical trials indicate that MRCP can be as effective a diagnostic tool for acute pancreatitis with <b>biliary</b> etiology as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but with the benefits of being less invasive and causing fewer complications.|$|E
25|$|In infants {{suspected}} of neonatal <b>biliary</b> atresia, phenobarbital {{is used in}} preparation for a 99mTc-IDA hepatobiliary study that differentiates atresia from hepatitis or cholestasis.|$|E
25|$|Depictions of the {{gallbladder}} and <b>biliary</b> tree {{are found}} in Babylonian models found from 2000 BCE, and in ancient Etruscan model from 200 BCE, with models associated with divine worship.|$|E
25|$|If {{complications}} of helminthiasis, such as intestinal obstruction occur, emergency surgery may be required. Patients who require non-emergency surgery, for instance for removal of worms from the <b>biliary</b> tree, can be pre-treated with the anthelmintic drug albendazole.|$|E
25|$|Rarely are {{diseases}} of the bile ducts, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, causes of cirrhosis. Imaging of the bile ducts, such as ERCP or MRCP (MRI of <b>biliary</b> tract and pancreas) may aid in the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Disease of the <b>biliary</b> tree {{may cause}} {{pain in the}} upper right abdomen, {{particularly}} when pressed. Disease might be investigated using ultrasound or ERCP, and might be treated with drugs such as antibiotics or UDCA, or by the surgical removal of the gallbladder.|$|E
25|$|Bile is {{the major}} pathway for the {{excretion}} of copper and is vitally important in the control of liver copper levels. Most fecal copper results from <b>biliary</b> excretion; the remainder is derived from unabsorbed copper and copper from desquamated mucosal cells.|$|E
25|$|Gallstones are {{a common}} cause of {{inflammation}} of the gallbladder, called cholecystitis. Inflammation of the <b>biliary</b> duct is called cholangitis, which {{may be associated with}} autoimmune disease, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, or a result of bacterial infection, such as ascending cholangitis.|$|E
