40|$|Abstract <b>Background</b> <b>Indication</b> {{and extent}} of lateral {{prophylactic}} neck dissection (PLND) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is very controversial. Methods We retrospectively analysed 131 patients who underwent thyroidectomy and prophylactic lateral neck dissection from level II to V for PTC. Results 140 PLND were performed. The occult lymph node metastases (OLNM) overall rate was 18. 6 %. The incidence of node involvement was 10 % at level III and 6. 4 % at level IIa. Level IV and level Vb were both concerned by 5. 7 % OLNM. Only 2. 9 % of level IIb contained OLNM. None of the level Va ND revealed OLNM. Conclusions OLNM from PTC occurs commonly in level IIa, III, IV and Vb. Incidence in other levels is low. For surgeons that usually perform PLND, we believe that a selective neck dissection of levels IIa, III, IV and Vb in N 0 neck PTC is sufficient for the clearance of occult metastases. </p...|$|E

40|$|Penile {{cancer is}} a rare {{malignancy}} with a prevalence of 1 in 100. 000 men in developed countries. The conventional treatment of this cancer consisted of either partial or total penile amputation. These procedures are inherently disfiguring and have {{a profound impact on}} sexual and urinary functioning, body image and quality of life. After important histopathological analyses of the spreading pattern of penile cancer have been published, less radical and organ preserving surgical approaches have gained popularity. These organ-preserving techniques are cold-knife excision, laser surgery and Mohs micrographic surgery. Although due to the rareness of the disease no prospective trials are available, contemporary literature consists of multiple retrospective reports showing excellent oncological control with organ-preserving surgery for penile cancer.

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} {{does not}} contain vascular, nervous and lymphatic tissue and chondrocytes hardly participate in the healing or repair process of chondral tissue because of being surrounded by plenty of extracellular matrix. Therefore, the injury to articular cartilage frequently requires an operative treatment. The goal of surgical repair of articular cartilage is to regenerate nearly normal chondral tissue and prevent degenerative arthritis caused by the articular cartilage defect. Microfracture {{is a kind of}} cartilage repair procedure that makes a fibrin clot containing mesenchymal stem cells in the chondral lesion. Microfracture is a simple procedure but it has a disadvantage that the repaired tissue is fibrocartilage. Autologous chondrocyte implantation has an advantage that it implants fully differentiated chondrocytes to the lesion, which theoretically produces hyaline cartilage. Its disadvantages are that it is a two stage and a costly procedure. Osteochondral autograft transplantation is a one stage procedure and repairs the lesion with hyaline cartilage. But its limitation is the lack of donor site availability. Surgeons who understand the theoretical <b>background,</b> <b>indications,</b> surgical methods, rehabilitation, complications, and clinical course of cartilage repair procedures can achieve the goal of preventing degenerative arthritis...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to review the overall experience with ICDs in Iceland. Methods This was a retrospective single centre study set at the University Hospital in Iceland. Data on all ICD implantations in Iceland from the first implantation in 1992 till the end of 2002 was reviewed. Results Sixty-two patients (71 % male) received an ICD during this period. There was an increase in the number of implants by year and the number of new implants in 2001 and 2002 amounted to 56 and 38 per million, respectively. The mean age at implantation was 58 (+/- 14) years. Forty patients (65 %) had coronary artery disease. The most common indications for ICD implantation were cardiac arrest, 32 (52 %) and another 26 (42 %) had experienced ventricular tachycardia without cardiac arrest. The most common adverse event was inappropriate shocks. Twenty-eight patients (45 %) received therapy from their ICDs, with the majority receiving appropriate therapy.

40|$|Beside {{conventional}} therapies for {{the treatment}} of neuroendocrine tumors, a new therapeutical approach, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy has been developed recently. There are two important features which make this therapy feasible: somatostatin receptors are strongly over-expressed in most neuroendocrine tumors resulting in a high tumor-to-background ratio and internalization of the somatostatin-receptor complex in neuroendocrine cells. Due to these features, neuroendocrine tumors can be treated with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues. For peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, somatostatin analogues are conjugated to a chelator that can bind a radionuclide. The most frequently used radionuclides for neuroendocrine tumor treatment are the beta-emitter Yttrium- 90 (90 Y) and the beta+gamma emitter Lutetium- 177 (177 Lu). Candidates for somatostatin receptor endoradiotherapy are patients with progressive, metastatic, somatostatin-receptor positive neuroendocrine tumors. Many patients have been successively treated with this approach: according to international results major remission can be achieved in 25 % of the cases. Although this therapy is still unavailable in Hungary, Hungarian patients can be treated with somatostatin receptor endoradiotherapy with financial support from the National Health Fund in a co-operation with the University of Basel since 2005. During the past 5 years, 51 Hungarian patients have been treated with this therapy.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} questions on Kant’s philosophy is the meaningfulness or meaningless of metaphysics. This article tries to answer two questions on Kant’s philosophy: 1 - Is the metaphysics, in the philosophy of Kant, meaningful or meaningless? 2 - Is the meaningfulness or meaningless of metaphysics, for Kant, so important for contemporary philosophy? In this paper, firstly, I argue that we can call Kant’s approach to Metaphysics not as a linguistic one (including; language metaphysics, philosophy of language, philosophy of ordinary language or linguistics) but it is a transcendental epistemology. Secondly, in terms of problem-based, the meaningfulness or meaninglessness of metaphysics not only is not the basic problem of Kant, but his philosophy in a clear, distinct and independent manner, involves not such an issue. Thirdly, on the problem of the meaningfulness and meaninglessness of metaphysics, it could be accepted that Kant's philosophy seems to have the <b>backgrounds,</b> <b>indications,</b> and implications For the second question, it could be distinguished two levels of meaningfulness or meaningless in Kant's philosophy: linguistic and nonlinguistic levels. The linguistic level are considered from two directions, i. e., the parts or components (words and metaphysical propositions) and the whole (as the science of metaphysics). In the linguistic level, in one hand, I argue that the metaphysical words or propositions are not meaningless, but on the other hand, the proposition that “Metaphysics is a science” is a meaningless proposition. In the nonlinguistic level, metaphysics due to not reaching to the ends and goals seems meaninglessness as well...|$|R
40|$|<b>Background</b> <b>Indications,</b> efficacy, {{and safety}} of plasma {{products}} are highly debated. We compared the concentrations of haemostatic proteins and cytokines in solvent/detergent-treated plasma (SDP) and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP). Methods Concentrations of the following parameters were measured in 25 SDP and FFP samples: fibrinogen (FBG), factor (F) II, F V, F VII, F VIII, F IX, F X, F XIII, von Willebrand factor (vWF), D-Dimers, ADAMTS- 13 protease, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, and IL- 10. Results Mean FBG concentrations in SDP and FFP were similar, but in FFP, the range was larger than in SDP (P< 0. 01). Mean F II, F VII, F VIII, F IX, and F XIII levels did not differ significantly. Higher concentrations of F V (P< 0. 01), F X (P< 0. 05), vWF (P< 0. 01), and ADAMTS- 13 (P< 0. 01) were found in FFP. With the exception of F VIII and F IX, the range of concentrations {{for all of these}} factors was smaller (P< 0. 05) in SDP than in FFP. Concentrations of TNF-α, IL- 8, and IL- 10 (all P< 0. 01) were higher in FFP than in SDP, again with a higher variability and thus larger ranges (P< 0. 01). Conclusions Coagulation factor content is similar for SDP and FFP, with notable exceptions of less F V, vWF, and ADAMTS- 13 in SDP.

40|$|<b>Background.</b> <b>Indications</b> {{for surgery}} in {{patients}} with severe AR {{are based on the}} results of a few natural history studies that were conducted before modern heart failure treatments and imaging modalities were widely available. Accordingly, the aim of the present work was to test if the criteria used to propose surgery by the guidelines are still appropriate in present times. Methods and Results. 489 patients with severe AR by Doppler echocardiography were recruited between january 1995 and december 2010. Patients were censored at the time of aortic valve surgery. Overall survival of the whole population was found to be less than that of the age- and gender matched Belgian population (83 % vs 93 %, log rank p 50 % and those with LV end-systolic dimensions (ESD) 25 mm/m² (p< 0. 001, p= 0. 002, p= 0. 008 respectively). Age adjustments yielded similar results. Among the 175 initially asymptomatic patients who were followed up conservatively, the annualized risk of developing asymptomatic LV dysfunction was 0. 5 %/year, that of symptomatic deterioration was 2 %/year and the need for surgery was 5 %/year. These figures are quite similar to those reported in the literature. Conclusion. Despite significant improvements in heart failure treatments and imaging modalities, the spontaneous outcome of patients with severe AR, in the absence of surgical correction, still depends on their symptomatic status, their initial LV function and and their initial LV end-systolic dimensions, with similar cutoffs values as those reported in the guidelines. This suggests that current indications for surgery, as outlined in the guidelines are still aprropriate...|$|R
40|$|<b>Background.</b> <b>Indications</b> to the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) {{have been}} {{expanded}} {{in the last}} decade, including patients suffering from heart disease with or without functional disorders. Accordingly, {{the increasing number of}} patients with ICD is posing relevant legal implications. Currently, the Medical Committee that evaluates the legal criteria for disability is employing guidelines referring only to pacemaker devices and not to ICD. The aim {{of this study was to}} propose new indications for patients with ICD to replace the current criteria. Methods. The study included 219 patients (83 %male, mean age 63 years) with ICD who were administered an anonymous questionnaire to evaluate the presence of any disability. Most patients were suffering from ischemic or non-ischemic dilated heart disease (41 % and 34 %, respectively). Single- and dual-chamber ICD (72 %) were more frequently implanted compared to biventricular ICD (28 %). Results. A higher percentage of disability was found in older patients (69 ± 14 years) with ischemic heart disease (61 %) and single- or dual-chamber ICD before ICD implantation. Conversely, a lower percentage of disability was found in younger patients (53 ± 15 years), active workers (44 %), without ischemic or non-ischemic dilated heart disease (36 %), and with a lower number of biventricular ICD (22 %) after ICD implantation. Conclusions. Overall, these data show that disability is currently recognized because of the presence of ICD rather than the underlying heart disease. We propose, therefore, new criteria that include the impact of the underlying heart disease for a better evaluation of disability in patients with ICD...|$|R
40|$|<b>Background.</b> The <b>indications</b> for urgent {{computed}} tomography {{of the brain}} (CTB) in the acute setting are controversial.

Adoption by resource-limited countries of more conservative scanning protocols, with outcomes comparable to well-resourced countries, would have significant benefit. A multidisciplinary team from Kimberley Hospital in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa adopted the principles defined in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for the early management of head injury and drafted the Kimberley Hospital Rule (KHR), a proposed unifying guideline for the imaging of acute intracranial pathology in a resource-limited environment.

40|$|A 3 -year-old female patient {{presenting}} with {{an unknown}} syndrome of a neonatal progeroid appearance, lipodystrophy, pulmonary hypertension, cutis marmorata, feeding disorder {{and failure to}} thrive was investigated by whole-genome sequencing. This revealed a de novo, heterozygous, frame-shift mutation in the Caveolin 1 gene (CAV 1) (p. Phe 160 X). Mutations in CAV 1, encoding {{the main component of}} the caveolae in plasma membranes, cause Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 3 (BSCL). Although BSCL is recessive, heterozygous carriers either show a reduced phenotype of partial lipodystrophy, pulmonary hypertension, or no phenotype. To investigate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this syndrome in more depth, we performed next generation RNA sequencing of peripheral blood, which showed several dysregulated pathways in the patient that might be related to the phenotypic progeroid features (apoptosis, DNA repair/replication, mitochondrial). Secondly, we found a significant down-regulation of known Cav 1 interaction partners, verifying the dysfunction of CAV 1. Other known progeroid genes and lipodystrophy genes were also dysregulated. Next, western blotting of lysates of cultured fibroblasts showed that the patient shows a significantly decreased expression of wild-type CAV 1 protein, demonstrating a loss-of-function mutation, though her phenotype is more severe that other heterozygotes with similar mutations. This phenotypic variety could be explained by differences in genetic <b>background.</b> <b>Indications</b> for this are supported by additional rare variants we found in AGPAT 2 and LPIN 1 lipodystrophy genes. CAV 1, AGPAT 2 and LPIN 1 all {{play an important role in}} triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis in adipose tissue, and the defective function in different parts of this pathway, though not all to the same extend, could contribute to a more severe lipoatrophic phenotype in this patient. In conclusion, we report, for the first time, an association of CAV 1 dysfunction with a syndrome of severe premature aging and lipodystrophy. This may contribute to a better understanding of the aging process and pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to premature aging...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the indications, complications and long-term results of PPE in patients with primary, rectal cancer. Methods A retrospective review included patient demographics, turnout and treatment variables, and morbidity, recurrence, and survival statistics. These results were compared with a group of female patients Who underwent standard resection for primary rectal cancer in the same period (non PPE group). Results The series included 30 women with an average age of 56. 7 years (range 22 - 78). Tumour location was recorded in three cases in the upper rectum, 13 cases in the medium rectum and 14 cases in the lower rectum. A sphincter-preserving procedure was performed in 70 % of the patients. Mean operative time was 4. 2 h (range 2 - 7. 5 h). Overall major morbidity rate in this series was 50 % and mean hospital stall was 19. 7 clays (range 960 clays). There was no hospital mortality. Pathological reports showed direct invasion of uterus, vagina or rectovaginal septum in 19 cases, involvement of perirectal tissue in 25 cases and positive lymph nodes in 18 cases. Comparison between PPE and non PPE groups showed no differences in mean tumour diameter, histological grade and tumour stage, but patients in the first group were younger. Although low tumours were seen more frequently in the PPE group (P = 0. 003), the rate of sphincter-preserving procedure was comparable in both groups. Operative time was longer (P = 0. 04) and morbidity was higher (P = 0. 0058) in the PPE group. Local recurrence with or without distant metastases for the whole series was 30 %. Five-year survival rate for patients who underwent curative resections (TNM I-III) was 48 % in the PPE group vs 62 % in the non PPE group (P = 0. 09).

Рurpose: to study the effect of LITT on parathyroid tissue and functional capacity of the thyroid gland, to determine the factors affecting the time of replacement by connective tissue and its volume; to develop indications to repeated thermotherapy. Materials and methods. Using the LITT we treated 272 patients with a nodular goiter with no signs of cystic degeneration. All patients — women aged 22 to 68 years. The size of nodules was within the range of 0. 8 to 5. 0 cm 3. In terms of ultrasonic characteristics, in particular echoicity, the nodules were as follows: 46 — hypoechoic, 189 — isoechoic and 37  — hyperechoic. We used a diode laser Lakhta-Milon. LITT was performed on such parameters: the wave length 1060 nm, continuous operation, output power ranging from 2. 5 to 3. 2 W. LITT was controlled by ultrasound. Changes in the nodule, parathyroid tissue and gland function after LITT was determined on day 2, as well as 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the procedure. Results. An aseptic inflammation occurred on the second day after laser thermotherapy in nodules, and their size increased by 25 – 30  %. Later, in a certain period of the survey, the size of nodules decreased, rates of hormonal function did not change. Six months after the LITT, with nodule size up to 2 cm 3, a complete replacement by connective tissue occurred in all cases of hypo- and isoechoic nodules and in 71 % — of hyperechoic, and with sizes from 2 to 5 cm 3 — in 75 % of hypoechoic structures, 18 % of isoechoic, and there was no beneficial effect in hyperechoic nodules. If the treatment failed, repeated LITT was required, after which all patients had complete reduction of the nodule. Conclusions. In the developed modes, the LITT did not cause destructive changes in parathyroid tissue and hormonal gland function. Duration of regression and replacement of the nodule by connective tissue is determined by its echogenicity and size. The residual tissue in the nodule within more than 42 % of the initial size in six months after the treatment and the presence of thyroid epithelium in it are the indications for re-use of thermotherapy...|$|R

The clinical success rate was 98. 2 % and complete procedural success rate was 92. 2 %. There was one intra-procedural death. Infection was the only identified predictor of increased complication (χ² for difference between groups 20, P < 0. 0001). The mean follow up was 5. 5 +/- 4. 9 years (range 0. 2 – 18 years). Cumulative mortality was 10. 0 % at 1 year and 33. 0 % at 10 years. Factors associated with increased long term mortality included cardiac device infection (CDI) (33 % vs 17 % for non-CDI; χ² 13. 8, P = 0. 0003), procedural complications (43 % vs 27 % for no complications; χ² 4. 2, P = 0. 04), age (75. 0 +/- 10. 9 years in patients who died vs 62. 7 +/- 17. 2 years, P < 0. 0001) and impaired renal function (Creatinine 142. 5 +/- 106. 4 umol/L in patients who died vs 106. 3 +/- 90. 7 umol/L, P = 0. 001). There was comparable mortality in those patients who did not have a replacement device after transvenous lead extraction (TLE) compared with a replacement (27 % vs 24 %, P = 0. 72). The rate of CDI after TLE was 3. 9 % (mean 11. 6 months post extraction, range 0. 3 to 84 months) and is higher in patients with retained lead fragments (13. 5 % vs 3. 0 % % with complete removal; χ² 10. 7 P = 0. 001). Conclusion Pacing and ICD leads can be safely extracted with mechanical techniques. Long term mortality following TLE is high particularly in those with systemic infection, procedural complications, advanced age and renal impairment. Device therapy can be safely withdrawn in some patients. Finally; retained fragments are a risk factor for CDI post extraction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: During {{the last}} few decades liposomes have {{attracted}} great interest as ideal models for biological membranes as well as efficient carriers for drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, nutrients and other bioactive agents. The extensive and ever increasing literature covering the field of liposomology written by researchers with diverse <b>backgrounds</b> is an <b>indication</b> of increasing interest in this field. Many techniques and methodologies have evolved for the manufacture of liposomes, on small and large scales, since their introduction to the scientific community around 40 years ago. This article intends to provide an overview of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} liposome preparation methods in general with particular emphasis on the heating method, developed in our laboratory, as a model technique for fast production of the lipid vesicles...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the patterns of cervical lymph node metastasis in the lateral and central compartment and related factors and suggest the optimal extent of lateral and central neck dissection for PTC patients with clinical lateral lymph node metastasis. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 72 patients with unilateral PTC who underwent therapeutic lateral neck dissections with concomitant total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection between January 2001 and December 2009. Results The 72 patients underwent 79 sides of therapeutic lateral neck dissection. The most frequent metastatic level in the ipsilateral lateral compartment was level IV (75. 0 %), followed by level III (69. 4 %), level II (56. 9 %) and level V (20. 8 %). Multiple level metastases were common (77. 8 %) and were correlated with tumor size (≥ 10 mm). The central compartment lymph node metastasis rate was 87. 5 %, including 26. 4 % of contralateral central compartment metastases. Conclusion In PTC patients with clinical lateral lymph node metastasis, the optimal extent of lateral and central neck dissection should include levels II, III, IV and V as well as the bilateral central compartment. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Background</b> The <b>indications</b> and {{the timing}} for surgery are {{obviously}} related {{to the type of}} complications; but a key role, in choosing the most appropriate time to perform surgery, is played not only by factors related to patient but also by the evaluation of disease intrinsic characteristics: stenosing/penetrating/inflammatory disease, disease activity, extension, prevalent localization and the response to medical therapy. Methods The authors analyzed the literature {{of the past two decades}} by integrating it with their personal experience. The authors have paid attention above all to Crohn’s disease management. Results Advances in medical therapy over the past two decades have substantially altered the management of patients with IBD. The introduction of more aggressive regimens (top down strategy) resulted in a change of surgery, which is no longer seen as “a last resort”, to be reserved for the treatment of a longstanding disease with more serious complications, but should also be seen as “early surgery”, able to induce remissions faster and perhaps more durable, at least in the short to medium term. It is logical to wonder whether this is also a result of a change in the natural history of the disease under the influence of new therapies. Biological drugs have proved to be able to induce remission (60...|$|R
40|$|An article {{contains}} substantiation of advisability of rejection of subtraction of <b>background</b> dosimeters <b>indication</b> values from the measured values of individual doses of occupational exposure of A-group {{personnel in the}} process of carrying out of individual dosimetry control of medical organizations stuff which was implemented in the Methodical Guideline 2. 6. 1. 3015 - 12. It is shown that mentioned procedure is firstly incorrect when we deal with low doses, when the impact of natural exposure could be really considerable and secondary senseless when we deal with dose values close to the dose limit value for A-group personnel when the impact of natural exposure is much lower then the error of measurements. It is suggested to carry out the account of the impact of natural exposure into personnel average doses basing on the analysis of statistical distributions of personnel individual doses and on <b>indications</b> of <b>background</b> dosimeters. It is suggested to add the information about <b>indications</b> of <b>background</b> dosimeters into the Base of Federal Statistical Supervision № 1 -DOS as it is prescribed in the Methodical Guideline 2. 6. 1. 3015 - 12. This article is the respond to the article of A. I. Grigoriev published in the present issue of Journal, in which the author contests the reasonableness of this provision. </p...|$|R
500|$|Unlike the {{painters}} in the Low Countries, Lochner {{was not so}} concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his <b>backgrounds</b> give little <b>indication</b> of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described {{as one of the}} last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly [...] "drawn into empathy with the revolving forms".|$|R

Whether actual service provision and training have developed in parallel is unknown. Methods We undertook a systematic telephone and postal survey of all public hospitals {{on behalf of}} the British Society of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance to identify all CMR providers within the United Kingdom. Results Of the 60 CMR centres identified, 88 % responded to a detailed questionnaire. Services are led by cardiologists and radiologists in equal proportion, though the majority of current trainees are cardiologists. The mean number of CMR scans performed annually per centre increased by 44 % over two years. This trend was consistent across centres of different scanning volumes. The commonest indication for CMR was assessment of heart failure and cardiomyopathy (39 %), followed by coronary artery disease and congenital heart disease. There was striking geographical variation in CMR availability, numbers of scans performed, and distribution of trainees. Centres without on site scanning capability refer very few patients for CMR. Just over half of centres had a formal training programme, and few performed regular audit. Conclusion The number of CMR scans performed in the UK has increased dramatically in just two years. Trainees are mainly located in large volume centres and enrolled in cardiology as opposed to radiology training programmes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies and}} {{intervention}} programs on interparental violence have relied largely on reports either solely from parents or solely from children. Nevertheless, {{the literature and}} the theoretical <b>background</b> provide <b>indications</b> {{of the existence of}} discrepancies between the narratives of parents and those of children. This study therefore focuses on similarities and differences between the narratives of mothers and those of their children with regard to the children’s exposure to interparental violence and its impact on child and parental functioning. In depth open interviews were conducted to assess the narratives of 36 mothers (27 - 59 years of age) and 43 of their children (17 boys and 26 girls; 9 - 25 years of age) who had experienced interparental violence in their past. A hierarchical coding system was used to code the interviews. Thereafter, the differences between mother and child narratives were analyzed based on the coded fragments. Few {{differences were found between the}} narratives with regard to parental functioning. We did find discrepancies, however, with regard to the children’s exposure to interparental violence and its impact on child functioning. Exploratory analyses showed relationships between the discrepancies and the severity of the violence and age of the children. More attention to these differences is essential in order to enhance our knowledge concerning the complex impact of violence on family members and to improve support geared to their specific needs...|$|R
