5|$|It was {{formerly}} considered a possible dwarf planet for its size, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer considered such because its shape departs significantly from an ellipsoid.|$|E
5|$|Snake Pass is a hill {{pass in the}} Derbyshire {{section of}} the Peak District, {{crossing}} the Pennines between Glossop and the Ladybower Reservoir at Ashopton. The road was engineered by Thomas Telford and opened in 1821. The pass carries the A57 road between Manchester and Sheffield, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer the main signposted route between those two cities.|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> {{pleasure}} {{after all}} for Richard {{to read the}} two communications, for each was a disappointment.|$|R
5|$|Under the Police Act 1964 {{and local}} {{government}} reform in 1974, the Isle of Ely Constabulary {{became part of the}} present Cambridgeshire Constabulary. A small police station is situated in East Park Street, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer open to the public.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} three {{business}} loops for US41: Ishpeming–Negaunee, Marquette and Baraga. Only the business loop serving Ishpeming and Negaunee is still a state-maintained trunkline, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer designated Bus. US41. US41/M-28 was relocated to bypass the two cities' downtowns in 1937. The highway through downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee later carried the ALTUS41/ALTM-28 designation before being designated Bus. M-28 in 1958. The western end of the business loop was transferred to local government control when Bus. M-28 was moved along Lakeshore Drive in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Great Sand Sea, {{the coastal}} {{portion of the}} Libyan Desert is stony rather than sandy, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> less arid, and {{supports}} little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by wadis. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. Because it was so thinly populated, bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk of civilian casualties. Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. There was almost no food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the heat or the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> dream. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all {{arranged}} later on. No one rejoiced more heartily in Tommy's {{success than}} Bessie.|$|R

50|$|Neale's {{franchise}} {{cost him}} only eighty cents a year, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> bargain; he died heavily in debt, in 1699 in Wiltshire.|$|R
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Atlantic torpedo {{is capable}} of {{generating}} up to 220volts of electricity to subdue its prey or defend itself against predators. Its diet consists mainly of bony fishes, though it also feeds on small sharks and crustaceans. It is an aplacental viviparous species, wherein the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and later maternally provided histotroph ("uterine milk"). Females give birth to up to 60 young following a gestation period of one year. The electric shock of this species can be quite severe and painful, {{though it is not}} fatal. Because of its electrogenic properties, the Atlantic torpedo was used in medicine by the Ancient Greeks and Romans and became the namesake of the naval weapon. Prior to the 19th century, its liver oil was used as lamp fuel, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer of any economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; it is caught unintentionally by commercial and recreational fishers, but the impact of these activities on its population is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} royal burials to Thebes {{after the end}} of the Amarna period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the {{intermediate}} 'jogged axis' gradually giving way to the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western Valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for Akhenaten, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> more than a gateway and a series of steps. The tomb of Ay, Tutankhamun's successor is close by. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (its decoration is of a similar style) but later usurped for Ay's burial. This would mean that KV62 may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb.|$|E
25|$|A 5% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream was used, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer {{considered}} an acceptable treatment {{due to the}} side-effects.|$|E

25|$|California bearing ratio : ASTM D 1883. A test to {{determine}} the aptitude of a soil or aggregate sample as a road subgrade. A plunger is pushed into a compacted sample, and its resistance is measured. This test was developed by Caltrans, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer used in the Caltrans pavement design method. It is still used as a cheap method to estimate the resilient modulus.|$|E

25|$|Cotton {{has long}} been a primary {{exported}} cash crop, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer vital as an export. Production in 1999 was 243,000 tons. Egypt is also a substantial producer of wheat, corn, sugarcane, fruit and vegetables, fodder, and rice; substantial quantities of wheat are also imported, especially from the United States and Russia, despite increases in yield since 1970, and significant quantities of rice are exported.|$|E
25|$|The lupus {{erythematosus}} (LE) cell test was commonly used for diagnosis, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer used because the LE cells are only found in 50–75% of SLE cases, {{and they are}} also found in some people with rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and drug sensitivities. Because of this, the LE cell test is now performed only rarely and is mostly of historical significance.|$|E
25|$|The Chilean Civil Code {{previously}} {{mandated that}} wives {{had to live}} with and be faithful and obedient to their husbands, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer in the law. A married woman cannot be head of the household or head of the family {{in the same way as}} a man; however, married women are not required by law to obey their husbands.|$|E

25|$|Boise State University and California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) – Primarily a {{football}} rivalry, with the teams {{playing for the}} Milk Can. The Milk Can game had been a regular conference rivalry in the WAC {{and later in the}} MW. <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer an annual matchup; when the MW expanded to 12 football members in 2013, the two teams were placed in separate divisions (with no protected cross-division games).|$|E
25|$|Glen Bell {{opened the}} first Taco Bell {{restaurant}} on March 21, 1962, in Downey. The 400 sq. ft. building, at 7112 Firestone Boulevard, is largely unchanged {{from its original}} appearance featuring Moorish arches, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer a Taco Bell. On November 19, 2015, the building was relocated 45 miles south, to 1 Glenn Bell Way at the Irvine Business Center, Taco Bell Corporation's Irvine, CA headquarters. Here it will remain on permanent display.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic {{notation}} (or AN) is {{a method}} for recording and describing the moves {{in a game of}} chess. It is based on a system of coordinates to uniquely identify each square on the chessboard. It is now standard among all chess organizations and most books, magazines, and newspapers. In English-speaking countries, the parallel method of descriptive notation was generally used in chess publications until about 1980. Some older players still use descriptive notation, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer recognized by FIDE.|$|E
