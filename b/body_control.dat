5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the Orient Express over And Then There Were None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper <b>body</b> <b>control.</b> In And Then There Were None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies to talk to one another, whereas in Murder on the Orient Express, characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E

She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better <b>body</b> <b>control</b> and posture. She spent considerable time training his naturally high-pitched voice, which he slowly managed to lower, to gain better resonance and tone. As his speech habits improved, his facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After {{a long period of}} training, Dillon considered him ready to attempt a film career.|$|E

500|$|In {{rating of}} three zones {{to where the}} ball is hit in right field in his first five seasons, he was above average at saving bases on shallow-hit (+31) and medium-hit (+40) balls. [...] His {{greatest}} strength came with deep-hit balls (+140). [...] In 2014 alone, he saved +40 bases on balls hit to the deepest part of right field, which {{was the equivalent of}} 20 doubles. [...] The enormous ground coverage makes up for what would be considered a slightly below average arm among right fielders. [...] Commented Fielding Bible founder John Dewan, [...] "Heyward has been able to accomplish this (winning the Fielding Bible Award) by starting and finishing every play extremely well. [...] He excels at picking up the ball off the bat and rarely takes the wrong angle. [...] He is not afraid to dive, demonstrating tremendous <b>body</b> <b>control</b> when doing so." ...|$|E
500|$|Scouts for the {{professional}} football teams described Walker as a [...] "Big physical receiver, who uses his size to muscle {{the ball away}} from defenders...Lacks explosive speed, but has exceptional <b>body</b> <b>control</b> and balance." [...] In another scouting report he {{was described as a}} [...] "Striding-type runner who is not quick or sudden. Dominates average defensive backs but has a hard time getting separation vs. a good corner" [...] In direct questioning during interviews, Walker confessed that he never had run a 40-yard dash and did not practice straight line speed. Thus, there was some consensus {{that he did not have}} the speed to play wide receiver in the National Football League and that he did not work on his speed. It was also said that he [...] "Lacks soft hands and will do a lot of double-catching and body-catching. Has a lot of drops for a featured No. 1 receiver." ...|$|E

500|$|In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role {{to a more}} {{unconventional}} one. James began {{spending more}} time in the post and shooting fewer three-pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012. He improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots, finishing second in the league in catch-and-shoot field goal percentage in 2013. He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's [...] "pass-happy" [...] offense. Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically-great levels, peaking in 2014 when he registered a 64.9 true shooting percentage. During this period, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James' free throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as [...] "average". Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity, posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016. His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the worst high-volume outside shooter from outside the paint in the NBA. Despite these changes, he has remained an elite offensive player who is capable of beating defenses with <b>body</b> <b>control,</b> strength, and varying attacking speeds.|$|E
2500|$|These {{statements}} are confirmed by close observation of her jumps; in detail, Isinbayeva's {{high level of}} <b>body</b> <b>control</b> (courtesy of her gymnastics background) especially pays off in the so-called [...] "L-Phase", where {{it is vital to}} use the pole's rebound to convert horizontal speed into height. Common mistakes are getting rebounded away in an angle (rather than vertically up) or inability to keep the limbs stiff, both resulting in loss of vertical speed and therefore less height. In Isinbayeva's case, her L-Phase is exemplary.|$|E
2500|$|At the February 2011 NFL combine pre-draft workouts, he {{completed}} 29 repetitions on the 225-pound bench press, a [...] "solid number", according to Sports Illustrateds Tony Pauline. [...] He also ran the 40-yard dash in under 5.2, which was faster than expected and considered very good. [...] Pauline reported that [...] "his footwork was smooth in pass protection, {{and he looked}} strong in run blocking drills." [...] At the March Wisconsin Pro Day workout, Bucky Brooks of NFL.com reported that Carimi: showed good footwork and lateral quickness in drills, and his <b>body</b> <b>control</b> is surprising given his frame. [...] Although he might experience some problems against speed rushers, teams will certainly start him out as a left tackle and move him to the right if he falters.|$|E
