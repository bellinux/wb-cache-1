40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to develop and extend the {{electron}} beam joining process to applications related to Mo/Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } cermets for neutron tube fabrication, glass seals for flat panel displays, and ceramics for structural applications. The key issue is {{the identification of the}} allowable operating ranges that produce thermal conditions favorable to robust joining and sealing. High strength, hermetic braze joints between ceramic components have been produced using high energy electron beams. With a penetration depth into a typical ceramic of {approximately} 1 cm for a 10 MeV electron beam, this method provides the capability for rapid, transient brazing operations where temperature control of heat sensitive components is essential. The method deposits energy directly into a <b>buried</b> <b>joint,</b> allowing otherwise inaccessible interfaces to be brazed. The combination of transient heating, with higher thermal conductivity, lower heat capacity, and lower melting temperature of braze metals relative to the ceramic materials, enables a pulsed high power beam to melt a braze metal without producing excessive ceramic temperatures. The authors have demonstrated the feasibility of this process related to ceramic coupons a well as ceramic and glass tubes and cylindrical shapes. The transient thermal response was predicted, using as input the energy absorption predicted from the coupled electron-photon and thermal transport analysis. The joining experiments were conducted with an RF linear accelerator at 10 [...] 13 MV. Joining experiments have provided high strength joints between alumina and alumina and between alumina and cermet joints in cylindrical geometry. These joints provided good hermetic seals...|$|E

The transient thermal response was predicted, using as input the energy absorption predicted from the coupled electron-photon transport analysis. The joining experiments were conducted with an RF Linac accelerator at 10 - 13 MV. The repetition rate of the pulsed beam was varied between 8 and 120 Hz, the average beam current was varied between 8 and 120 microamps, and the power was varied up to 1. 5 kW. These beam parameters gave a beam power density between 0. 2 to 2 kW/cm{sup 2 }. The duration of the joining runs varied from 5 to 600 sec. Joining experiments have provided high strength between alumina - alumina and alumina - cermet joints in cylindrical geometry. These joints provided good hermetic seals. A series of tests was conducted to determine the minimum beam power and exposure time for producing, a hermetic seal...|$|E
40|$|Bridges joints are {{designed}} to accommodate structure movement, such as to ensure the structural functionality which could be engaged by traffic loads and thermal and seismic stresses, maintaining the road surface continuity. <b>Buried</b> <b>joints</b> are widely used in viaducts characterized by an isostatic structure. They represent a suitable solution {{for the management of}} these infrastructures because of their inexpensiveness and ease of installation. Since their performance depends on mechanical behaviour of the asphalt concrete placed as filling in of the area around the joint, an evaluation of stress-strain state affecting the asphalt concrete during the service life is needed. On the basis of criteria of construction science, the Authors introduce a methodology of calculation, which allow to predict with excellent approximation the stress-strain state affecting the above-mentioned joints, furnishing a simple but powerful tool for the definition of the performance needed degree of the asphalt concrete making up the joint, in order to avoid a premature failure. Thermic stresses, seismic forces, traffic loads and braking action were taken into account. A FEM analysis by the implementation of SAP 2000 software was performed in order to evaluate the validity and the accuracy of the proposed methodology. Results show that the introduced calculation methodology allows to attain a greater durability of the structure, obtaining economic advantages due to the reduction of the maintenance works during its service life...|$|R

In 1876 this became the water department of Bury Corporation. In 1900 the corporation and eight adjoining local authorities formed the <b>Bury</b> and District <b>Joint</b> Water Board. Other than Bury, the water board's members were the municipal boroughs of Haslingden, Radcliffe and Rawtenstall, {{and the urban}} districts of Kearsley, Little Lever, Ramsbottom, Tottington and Whitefield. In 1935 the undertaking was renamed as the Irwell Valley Water Board. In 1960 the Irwell Valley Water Board was voluntarily absorbed by the water department of Manchester Corporation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} {{focusing}} on behavior of ductile iron pipelines with the earthquake resistant <b>joint</b> <b>buried</b> across a fault being used widely for water pipelines in Japan. It is necessary to design a pipeline carefully in case of crossing a fault, because the partially large displacement occurs on the pipelines when a fault moves by an earthquake. However, there are few studies on behavior of ductile iron pipelines. We analyzed the behavior of pipelines near a fault by large displacement analysis method, and we confirmed that the earthquake resistant joint nearest to a fault began to move when a fault began to move, then the joints next in line began to move when the joints movement reached their capacity. In this study, we investigated the behavior of ductile iron pipeline installed into a sand container which moved like a fault for verification of pipeline behavior analysis. As a result, we confirmed that pipeline showed the behavior like the analysis result and we verified the validity...|$|R

60|$|The igloo {{in which}} Kaga and her {{relations}} dwelt {{was the largest}} in the village. It was fully thirty feet in diameter. The passage leading to it was a hundred yards long, by five feet wide and six feet high, and from this passage branched several others of various lengths, leading to different storehouses and to other dwellings. The whiteness of the snow of which this princely mansion and its offices were composed was not much altered on the exterior; but in the interior a long winter of cooking and stewing and general filthiness had turned the walls and roofs quite black. Being somewhat lazy, Peetoot preferred the old plan of walking over this palace to going round by the entrance, which faced the south. Accordingly, he hoisted the fat and smiling infant on his shoulder, and bounded over the dome-shaped roof of Kaga's igloo. Alas for the result of disobedience! No sooner had his foot touched the key-stone of the arch than down it went. Dinner was being cooked and consumed by twenty people below at the time. The key-stone <b>buried</b> a <b>joint</b> of walrus-beef, and instantly Peetoot and the baby lay sprawling on the top of it. But this was not all. The roof, unable to support its own weight, cracked and fell in with a dire crash. The men, women, and children struggled to disentomb themselves, and in doing so mixed up the oil of the lamps, the soup of their kettles, the black soot of the walls and roof, the dogs that had sneaked in, the junks of cooked, half-cooked, and raw blubber, and their own hairy-coated persons, into a conglomerate so atrocious to behold, or even think upon, that we are constrained to draw a curtain over the scene and spare the reader's feelings. This event caused the Esquimaux to forsake the igloos, and pitch their skin tents on a spot a little to the southward of their wintering ground, which, being more exposed to the sun's rays, was now free from snow.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{methodology}} {{to obtain a}} consistent velocity model from calibration shots or microseismicity observed on a buried array. Using a layered 1 D isotropic model derived from checkshots as an initial velocity model, we invert P‐wave arrival times to obtain effective anisotropic parameters with a vertical axis of symmetry (VTI). The nonlinear inversion uses iteration between linearized inversion for anisotropic parameters and origin times or depths, which is specific to microseismic monitoring. We apply this technique to multiple microseismic events from several treatments within a <b>buried</b> array. The <b>joint</b> inversion of selected events shows a largely reduced RMS error indicating that we can obtain robust estimates of anisotropic parameters, however we do not show improved source locations. For joint inversion of multiple microseismic events we obtained Thomsen anisotropic parameters ε of 0. 15 and δ of 0. 05, which are consistent with values observed in active seismic surveys. These values allow us to locate microseismic events from multiple hydraulic fracture treatments separated across thousands of metres with a single velocity model. As a result, we invert the effective anisotropy for the buried array region {{and are able to}} provide a more consistent microseismicity mapping for past and future hydraulic fracture stimulations...|$|R
