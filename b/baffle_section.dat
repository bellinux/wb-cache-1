40|$|The flow {{structure}} {{in a circular}} uniform-diameter tube with segmental baffles is experimentally investigated over the range of Reynolds numbers from 50 to 5000, using flow visualization and pressure drop measurement. Three baffle clearance ratios (c/D = 0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 7) are studied. The results revealed {{that the presence of}} the baffles triggers transition to turbulence at a much lower Reynolds number compared to that for the straight circular tube. The flow in the <b>baffle</b> <b>section</b> of tube with c/D = 0. 3 appears turbulent at the Reynolds number of 250. Friction factor of the tubes with baffles decreases with increasing Reynolds number but it is always larger than that for a laminar flow in a tube without baffle...|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{performed}} on a 1 / 20 th-scale model of the Low Speed Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel to determine the performance effects of insertion of acoustic baffles in the tunnel inlet, replacement of the existing collector with a new collector design in the open jet test section, and addition of flow splitters to the acoustic <b>baffle</b> <b>section</b> downstream of the test section. As expected, the inlet baffles caused a reduction in facility performance. About half of the performance loss was recovered by addition the flow splitters to the downstream baffles. All collectors tested reduced facility performance. However, test chamber recirculation flow was reduced by the new collector designs and shielding {{of some of the}} microphones was reduced owing to the smaller size of the new collector. Overall performance loss in the facility {{is expected to be a}} 5 percent top flow speed reduction, but the facility will meet OSHA limits for external noise levels and recirculation in the test section will be reduced...|$|E

40|$|The {{combustion}} wave ignition concept was experimentally studied {{in order to}} verify its suitability for application in <b>baffled</b> <b>sections</b> of a large booster engine combustion chamber. Gaseous oxygen/gaseous methane (GOX/GH 4) and gaseous oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (GOX/GH 2) propellant combinations were evaluated in a subscale {{combustion wave}} ignition system. The system included four element tubes capable of carrying ignition energy simultaneously to four locations, simulating four <b>baffled</b> <b>sections.</b> Also, direct ignition of a simulated Main Combustion Chamber (MCC) was performed. Tests were conducted over a range of mixture ratios and tube geometries. Ignition was consistently attained {{over a wide range}} of mixture ratios. And at every ignition, the flame propagated through all four element tubes. For GOX/GH 4, the ignition system ignited the MCC flow at mixture ratios from 2 to 10 and for GOX/GH 2 the ratios is from 2 to 13. The ignition timing was found to be rapid and uniform. The total ignition delay when using the MCC was under 11 ms, with the tube-to-tube, as well as the run-to-run, variation under 1 ms. Tube geometries were found to have negligible effect on the ignition outcome and timing...|$|R
40|$|The STRAY {{program to}} model the amount of stray {{radiation}} reaching the focal plane of a well-baffled telescope is described. The STRAY telescope model is addressed, including the aperture shade, barrel <b>baffle,</b> optics, mirror <b>sectioning</b> and chopping, and off-axis points in focal plane. The possible illumination paths are shown, and calculation options using STRAY are discussed. The stored data and computational aspects of STRAY are addressed. STRAY is compared to the MINI-APART model, and applications of STRAY are described...|$|R
50|$|Cold traps also {{refer to}} the {{application}} of cooled surfaces or baffles to prevent oil vapours from flowing from a pump and into a chamber. In such a case, a <b>baffle</b> or a <b>section</b> of pipe containing a number of cooled vanes, will {{be attached to the}} inlet of an existing pumping system. By cooling the baffle, either with a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen, or by use of an electrically driven Peltier element, oil vapour molecules that strike the baffle vanes will condense and thus be removed from the pumped cavity.|$|R
30|$|Using baffle {{is one of}} {{the ways}} to control and reduce stray light. As {{mentioned}} in <b>section</b> <b>Baffle,</b> baffle is a highly important part of star sensor. It is an opto-mechanical device installed at the entrance aperture of the star sensor to protect the optical system against the external stray light sources such as sun, earth, moon and other celestial bodies [16, 17, 27, 31]. The satellite is also a source of stray light by reflecting the light from the intense sources. All these sources are able to saturate the detector and reduce the probability of finding low stellar magnitudes. To avoid this problem, in this work, a suitable baffle is designed for the designed optical system.|$|R

In 1910, a Los Angeles Times correspondent wrote about Sunland:The place is aptly named.[...] [...] one gets no inkling of the beauties till he is right in the town. Great live oaks, scattered with Nature's reckless disregard for expense, give the place a stately quiet.[...] [...] In the center of town the oaks are so thick that the sun is <b>baffled,</b> and this <b>section</b> has been made a public park, which is the Fourth of July and general hot-weather rendezvous of the country round, from Glendale to San Fernando.|$|R
40|$|Neither 2 ̆ 2 tax {{simplification}} 2 ̆ 2 nor its mirror image, complexity, is aconcept {{that can}} be easily defined or measured. I know of no comprehensiveanalytic framework for these ideas, nor are there anyempirical studies supplying a 2 ̆ 2 simplicity index 2 ̆ 2 of particular areas oftax law and practice. Journalists often ridicule the Internal RevenueCode by pointing to lengthy involuted provisions and to definitionsthat refer the reader to other definitions that in turn compel him to goeven farther afield. A favorite example is the 554 -word sentence thatmakes up Section 341 (e) (I). But these statutory intricacies may in fact be of minor importance, if they are addressed to tax experts concernedwith transactions that rarely occur; and they may even clarify the law,despite their initially <b>baffling</b> phraseology. <b>Sections</b> 671 - 675, for example,are intricate provisions. As compared with the pre- 1946 lawgoverning income-splitting trusts, however, their message is crystalclear. The statutory language was simpler in earlier years, but thetaxpayer and his adviser had to weigh the implications of hundreds ofjudicial decisions, most of which simply announced that all of therelevant facts and circumstances were to be weighed in determiningwhether the income of a trust was taxable to the grantor or to itstrustee and beneficiaries. The 1945 regulations and 1954 statutoryrules that replaced these judicial decisions were complex, but theymade it much easier to find one 2 ̆ 7 s way through the wilderness. On theother hand, elaborate statutory verbiage can be a source of complexityand an obstacle to simplification; I will offer some instances later inthis paper...|$|R
40|$|Background: Phenol and nitrophenol {{are common}} {{compounds}} found {{in different types}} of industrial wastewater known as serious threats to human health and natural environment. In this study, Daphnia magna {{was used to evaluate}} the effectiveness of "baffle fixes film up flow sludge blanket filtration" (BFUSBF) system in elimination of phenolic compounds from water. Methods: D. magna cultures were used as toxicity index of phenol and 2, 4 -DNP mixtures after treatment by a pilot BFUSBF system which consisted of <b>baffle</b> in anoxic <b>section</b> and biofilm in aerobic sections. Initial concentrations were 312 mg/L phenol and 288 mg/L 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (2, 4 -DNP). Results: Bioassay tests showed that D. magna was influenced by the toxicity of phenol and 2, 4 DNP mixtures. The comparison between the toxicity of initial phenol and 2, 4 -DNP mixtures and the output toxic unit (TU) derived from BFUSBF treatment system showed that the TU of the effluent from BFUSBF reactor was much lower than that of the solution that entered the reactor. Conclusion: Based on the acute toxicity test, BFUSBF process could reduce phenol and 2, 4 -DNP in aqueous solutions. Therefore, it is possible to use BFUSBF process as an appropriate treatment option for wastewaters containing phenolic compounds. ...|$|R
