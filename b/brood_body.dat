Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science. Sebelas Maret University Surakarta. Artemia franciscana {{is one of}} {{the live}} feed mostly used in the fish and shrimp breeding. Commercially, Artemia is usually sold in the dry cysts form which can be stored for many years. The purpose of the {{research}} are to know the influence of different stocking density toward brood fecundity and A. franciscana cysts production by feeding fish silage in certain concentration, and to know the optimum stocking density of producing the best quantity and quality of A. franciscana cysts. The observed parameter consist of brood fecundity, cysts diameter, <b>brood</b> <b>body</b> length, cysts and nauplii production, Hatching Rate, Hatching Percentage and Hatching Efficiency. This research was conducted on July until October 2006 at Laboratory of Live Feed, Brackishwater Aquaculture Development Center Jepara, Central Java. This research used the complete random design with 5 treatment groups and has 3 replicates. The classified of the treatment based on the differences of stocking density were 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1. 000 individu/liter by feeding fish sillage in 30 mg/l concentration.

Brood rearing activity of bees in seasonal neotropical forests should track flowering phenologies, which are typically set by rainfall and phylogenetic patterns.

40|$|When {{the overall}} food demand {{of the young}} {{increase}}s, parents can either increase their effort to feed the brood, potentially reducing their residual reproductive value, or alternatively maintain their effort, leading to offspring mortality. In long-lived species where fitness {{is related to the}} number of breeding attempts, life-history theory suggests that parents should restrict any increase of reproductive effort in a current brood so as not to compromise their survival prospects. We investigated this hypothesis in the Barn Owl Tyto alba by performing brood size manipulations. We enlarged or reduced broods by two nestlings to create some broods requiring more parental investment and others requiring less. We monitored the effect on the parents and the offspring. Total body mass gained by all nestmates from the 24 th to the 25 th day after the first hatching, a measure correlated with parental feeding rate, was not significantly different between enlarged and reduced <b>broods.</b> <b>Body</b> mass and body condition of male and female parents during the manipulation, renesting rate and their reproductive success measured the year after the manipulation were not significantly affected by the experiment. Nestling mortality was higher, and body mass of the surviving male and female nestlings was lower in enlarged than reduced broods. In conclusion, we detected an effect of brood size manipulations on nestlings but not on parents. In the Barn Owl, this suggests that when broods require extra parental effort, parents do not jeopardize their future reproductive success, and brood reduction occurs. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{trade-off}} {{between the}} number of offspring in a brood and the sizes of those offspring has been documented in a diverse array of species. Here we consider the factors that might account for the way that the trade-off achieves a particular size-number balance for female offspring. In particular, we determine whether bet hedging, along with traits influencing the expected short-term reproductive success of the brood, could select for a <b>brood</b> size and <b>body</b> mass that maximize long-term fitness. We also evaluate whether the optima based on these characteristics agree qualitatively with documented responses to brood resource levels. To develop a model incorporating these phenomena and keep it as simple and general as possible, we consider an organism that produces clonal broods, eliminating the complexities associated with parent-offspring and sibling conflict. We use the polyembryonic parasitoid wasp Copidosoma bakeri as the focal example. We find that bet hedging effects and key reproductive traits (the number of searching females, their host-finding efficiency, and survival prospects) are often sufficient to produce an optimal size-number balance and can account for the frequent tendency of both <b>brood</b> size and <b>body</b> mass to increase with brood resources (host size). Under some conditions, however, balancing the trade-off requires an additional minimum body-size constraint. Future empirical work and spatially explicit models must better establish the parameter magnitudes and functional relationships so that a deeper understanding and more precise predictions are obtained...|$|R

In general, growth rate decreased with age, was similar {{between the sexes}} for the immature crabs, and was lower in mature females than in mature males within a species. Growth rate showed consider-able variations among species, {{which seemed to be}} mainly due to the interspecific differences in in-termolt period. Survival rate was similar between the sexes, and tended to be lower in mature crabs than in immature crabs within a species. Survival rate varied considerably among species, and an apparent trade-off relationship to an index of reproductive activity existed. This brood index was calculated by multiplying the ratio of <b>brood</b> weight per <b>body</b> weight by the number of broods per year. Egg size and the ratio of <b>brood</b> weight per <b>body</b> weight were constant within a species regard-less of body size of parent female crabs, whereas the number of eggs per brood was nearly proportional to the third power of their carapace width.

40|$|International audienceIn many bird species, females {{undergo a}} marked decline in body {{condition}} {{during the first}} days of the nestling period. This decline may be because brooding young chicks reduces the time available for foraging. Alternatively, it might be viewed as an adaptive way to reduce flight costs when the food demand of the brood is highest. To test these hypotheses we modified the brooding commitment of House Sparrows Passer domesticus by manipulating brood size to see if changes in time spent <b>brooding</b> affects adult <b>body</b> condition. During the nestling period, females provided on average three times as much brooding as males. Reduced broods received 14 % more brooding than large broods and time spent brooding declined with brood size and chick age according to an exponential decay function. Male body condition was unaffected by brood size and remained stable throughout the reproductive period. Body condition of females with enlarged broods decreased gradually during the nestling period, whereas that of females tending reduced broods dropped abruptly and significantly upon hatching. This resulted in females with reduced <b>broods</b> having lower <b>body</b> condition {{during the first half of}} the nestling period than those with enlarged broods. The sharp drop in body condition of females with reduced broods coincided with the period that brooding was most intensive. Indeed, female body condition at the end of the nestling period was negatively correlated with the proportion of time they spent brooding during the first half of the nestling period. Thus, the probable lower homeothermic capacities of reduced broods implies a higher brooding commitment for female House Sparrows that, in turn, may reduce their opportunity to forage and consequently also their body condition...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the genus Philornis (comprising ‚àº 50 species), a group of muscid flies that {{parasitise}} birds and may be highly detrimental to host nestlings. Philornis species affect at least 115 species of bird, particularly in the Neotropics. The main distribution of Philornis is in Central and South America, extending to the southern United States. Larvae of the genus Philornis reside in bird nests and may feed on either nestling faeces (coprophagous scavengers), the blood of nestlings (semi-haematophagous parasites), or on nestling tissue and fluid (subcutaneous parasites). Depending on the species of Philornis, larval development can occur in bird faeces, in nesting material or inside nestlings. Nestling mortality depends on the species of Philornis, the intensity of infestation and nestling susceptibility, which in turn depends on the nestling species, age, <b>brood</b> size, <b>body</b> condition and the anatomical site of infestation. Consequently, variable effects of Philornis parasitism are observed in relation to nestling growth, development and fledging success.

Methodology/Principal Finding: Here we analyzed paired information on 89 parasite populations for 24 species of bird hosts {{some years ago}} and again in 2010 with an average interval of 10 years. The parasite taxa included protozoa, feather parasites, diptera, ticks, mites and fleas. We investigated whether change in abundance and prevalence of parasites was related to change in body condition, reproduction and population size of hosts. We conducted analyses based on the entire dataset, but also on a restricted dataset with intervals between study years being 5 ‚Äì 15 years. Parasite abundance increased over time when restricting the analyses to datasets with an interval of 5 ‚Äì 15 years, with no significant effect of changes in temperature {{at the time of}} breeding among study sites. Changes in host body condition and clutch size were related to change in temperature between first and second study year. In addition, changes in clutch size, <b>brood</b> size and <b>body</b> condition of hosts were correlated with change in abundance of parasites.

We compiled detailed information of such traits for more than 400 bird species and, by means of modern comparative methodologies, we reconstructed the evolution of adults' contribution to removing their offspring's faeces {{and the production of}} faecal sacs by nestlings. Furthermore, because the functional hypotheses used to explain nest sanitation behaviour assume potential effects of <b>brood</b> size, <b>body</b> mass, nestling period and diet, we explored the association between these traits and those related to nest sanitation in a phylogenetically controlled framework. Our results suggest that parental removal of nestling faeces has driven the evolution of faecal sacs, while the ancestral states involved birds with faecal sacs removed by parents. These results support the long-held idea that faecal sacs facilitate the removal of faeces by parents. Moreover, we found that animal diets and small body sizes have favoured the evolution of faecal sacs suggesting the existence of some chemical and physical constraints in relation to the evolution of the mucous covering.

40|$|Aims: The PHA skin-testing {{technique}} {{has become a}} widespread way of studying the ecological and evolutionary implications of T-cell mediated immunity (CMI) in birds. Several breeding and individual traits {{have been found to}} be related to CMI. However, it is not known how consistent these relationships are over the years. A four year study was conducted on the CMI response of White Stork Ciconia ciconia nestlings to evaluate this point. Location: Dehesa de Abajo, Puebla del R√≠o, Sevilla, Espa√±a. Methods: T-cell mediated immunity was measured by the PHA skin-testing technique in 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2003, as well as seven parental or individual variables for each nestling: laying date, clutch size, brood size, sex, age, <b>brood</b> hierarchy, and <b>body</b> condition. Results: The relationship between CMI and individual traits over the years depended on the studied variable. Some of them, when significantly related, showed a consistent relationship (e. g. body condition), while others did not have any relationship (e. g. age) or even contrary trends (laying date) depending on the year. Conclusions: These results highlight the need of including the temporal scale into ecological immunology for a better understanding of the relationships between CMI and individual traits.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the warm-water barnacle, Balanus perforatus, was surveyed along the south coast of England and the north-east coast of France between 1993 and 2001, repeating work carried out between the 1940 s and 1960 s. The species has recovered from catastrophic mortality during the severe winter of 1962 ‚Äì 1963 and was found over 120 km (UK) and 190 km (France) east of previous records {{on both sides of}} the Channel. The presence of the species in the eastern Channel refutes suggestions in the 1950 s that larvae, and hence adults, would not be found east of the Isle of Wight because of reproductive sterility close to the limits of distribution. Brooding of specimens translocated to Bembridge, Isle of Wight, commenced in May, earlier than previously observed in British waters, and continued until September. The stage of embryo development at Bembridge in mid-August was comparable to that of the large population at Lyme Regis, Dorset 100 km further west. However the size of <b>brood</b> per standard <b>body</b> weight was greater at Lyme Regis. Factors influencing the rate of colonization and further geographic range extension of the species as a possible result of climate change, are discussed...|$|R
50|$|M. citrina is a {{hermaphrodite}} and is viviparous. Sperm is shed {{into the}} water column and enters another individual through its buccal siphon. A batch of eggs is liberated from the oviduct and these are fertilised within the body cavity. The eggs are opaque and have red or yellow yolks. They are about 0.20 mm in diameter. The developing embryos are <b>brooded</b> in the <b>body</b> cavity. Hatching is initiated by the release of enzymes which cause the egg membranes to rupture. The larvae have notochords (stiffening rods) and resemble salamander tadpoles. They have fluid-filled sensory organs known as otocysts. The larvae continue to be brooded for a while but are later liberated into the sea. In European waters about 80% undergo metamorphosis while still in the body cavity but in North America only about 2% are retained internally to metamorphosis. When released, the larvae have a very short free-swimming period, ranging from {{a few minutes to}} an hour or two, before undergoing metamorphosis. The juveniles soon become sticky and attach to any hard surfaces with which they come in contact. This often includes the tunic of the parent individual and this may form a small cluster of individuals.|$|R
40|$|Received July 5, 2013; Accepted November 6, 2013; Published December 31, 2013 Background: Climate change {{potentially}} {{has important}} effects on distribution, abundance, transmission and virulence of parasites in wild populations of animals. Methodology/Principal Finding: Here we analyzed paired information on 89 parasite populations for 24 species of bird hosts {{some years ago}} and again in 2010 with an average interval of 10 years. The parasite taxa included protozoa, feather parasites, diptera, ticks, mites and fleas. We investigated whether change in abundance and prevalence of parasites was related to change in body condition, reproduction and population size of hosts. We conducted analyses based on the entire dataset, but also on a restricted dataset with intervals between study years being 5 ‚Äì 15 years. Parasite abundance increased over time when restricting the analyses to datasets with an interval of 5 ‚Äì 15 years, with no significant effect of changes in temperature {{at the time of}} breeding among study sites. Changes in host body condition and clutch size were related to change in temperature between first and second study year. In addition, changes in clutch size, <b>brood</b> size and <b>body</b> condition of hosts were correlated with change in abundance of parasites. Finally, changes in population size of hosts were not significantly related to changes in abundance of parasites or their prevalence. Conclusions/Significance: Climate change is associated with a general increase in parasite abundance. Variation in laying date depended on locality and was associated with latitude while body condition of hosts was associated with a change in temperature. Because clutch size, <b>brood</b> size and <b>body</b> condition were associated with change in parasitism, these results suggest that parasites, perhaps mediated through the indirect effects of temperature, may affect fecundity and condition of their hosts. The conclusions were particularly in accordance with predictions when the restricted dataset with intervals of 5 ‚Äì 15 years was used, suggesting that short intervals may bias findings.

40|$|When the {{reproductive}} value of {{sons and daughters}} differ, parents are expected to adjust the sex ratio of their offspring to produce more of the sex that provides greater fitness returns. The body condition of females or environmental factors, such as food abundance and mate quality, may influence these expected fitness returns. In a previous study of tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), we found that females produced more sons in their broods {{when they were in}} better body condition (mass corrected for size). We tested this relationship by experimentally clipping some flight feathers to reduce female body condition. As predicted, we found that females with clipped feathers had a lower proportion of sons in their <b>broods</b> and poorer <b>body</b> condition. However, female body condition alone was not a significant predictor of brood sex ratio in our experiment. We suggest that brood sex ratio is causally related to some other factor that covaries with body condition, most likely the foraging ability of females. The hypothesis that brood sex ratios are influenced by individual differences in female foraging ability is supported by a high repeatability of brood sex ratio for individual females. Thus, maternal effects may have a strong influence on the sex ratios of offspring...|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{assortative mating}} and within-pair sexual {{dimorphism}} {{and its influence}} on breeding success and offspring quality in Magellanic penguins M. G. Forero, J. L. Tella, J. A. Don√°zar, G. Blanco, M. Bertellotti, and O. Ceballos Abstract: We examined within-pair sexual dimorphism and phenotypic assortative mating in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) breeding in six colonies located on the Patagonian coast (Argentina). All measured phenotypic traits except the number of pectoral spots differed between the sexes; bill depth and flipper length were the most and least dimorphic traits, respectively. We found assortative mating by bill depth and body mass. The similarity in body condition within pairs was close to significant. When we performed separate correlations for birds that bred successfully, i. e., raised one or two offsprings, and birds that {{did not attempt to}} breed or bred unsuccessfully, only the successful breeders showed assortative mating by body mass. In addition, we attempted to relate the body size of each member of the pair and the degree of sexual dimorphism within pairs to the breeding performance of individuals, which was measured as <b>brood</b> size, and <b>body</b> condition and immunocompetence of offspring. We found that pairs that were less dimorphic in flipper length raised more offspring. This effect was due to female flipper length per se and no...|$|R
