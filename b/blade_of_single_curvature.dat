Other advantages of contra-rotation include no gear boxes and auto-centering on the wind (no yaw motors/mechanism required).

Under the same culture conditions, the survival rates of WT conchospores were only 16. 9 % and 11. 5 %, and the division rate 99. 8 % and 81. 8 % respectively.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the Reynolds number is for certain aeroelastic and aerodynamic phenomena of high significance, in particular in case the flow is dominated by massive separation areas, like bluff body flows. These kind of flows are broadly represented in our daily life, e. g. in the aerospace industry (landing gear doors, propeller <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>single</b> turboprops or piston twin aircrafts during start or landing), civil engineering (overhead transmission lines, bridge decks, pillars of semi-submerged offshore structures) or in wind engineering (blade-tower interactions and deep dynamic stall). The structures are subject to fluid-structure interactions, which in many cases lead to flow-induced vibrations like galloping or flutter and, in case of large amplitudes, even to damage of parts {{or failure of the}} complete construction. In order to minimize or even suppress those undesired flow-induced vibrations, it is of great concern to understand in detail the unsteady three-dimensional flow characteristics around these structures. For that purpose a new test section was designed and built to be implemented inside the High-Pressure Wind Tunnel Gottingen, a test facility in which the air pressure can be increased up to 100 bar to simulate realistic flow conditions at Reynolds numbers up to 10 million. The test section consists out of two torque motors that are used to either set and maintain a steady angle of incidence within 0 and 359 deg or to let the two-dimensional wind tunnel model perform a forced pitching motion with amplitudes of up to +/- 15 deg at maximum pitching frequencies of 15 Hz (i. e. reduced frequencies of k 1) around a certain steady angle of incidence.
