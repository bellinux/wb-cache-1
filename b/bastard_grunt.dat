40|$|Background. <b>Bastard</b> <b>grunt,</b> Pomadasys incisus (Bowdich, 1825), is {{reported}} as a well-established {{species in the}} Mediterranean Sea. Although <b>bastard</b> <b>grunt</b> has rapidly expanded its area of distribution in the Mediterranean, there is no information about its age and growth. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide data about growth, condition, and first sexual maturity of the species in order to contribute to a better management of its fishery. Materials and methods. A total of 515 specimens of <b>bastard</b> <b>grunt</b> were caught in the Gulf of Tunis. The age was determined from otoliths. Length–weight relation, von Bertalanffy equation, and growth rate were employed to evaluate the fish growth. Also the condition factor and length at first sexual maturity were calculated. Results. In the Gulf of Tunis population, females were significantly predominant and the overall sex ratio (M : F) reached the value of 1 : 2. 17. The two sexes showed a positive allometric growth. The marginal increment analysis validated the annual deposition of one single annulus in the winter. Growth in (total) length (TL) was approximately 65 % during the first year of life. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was TL = 23. 9 × (1 – e– 0. 186 × (t + 4. 62)). The somatic condition of fish increased markedly during the late spring and summer. Length at first sexual maturity of the <b>bastard</b> <b>grunt</b> was 16. 6 cm for males and 16. 8 cm for females, which correspond to an age of about 2 years. Conclusion. The rapid growth during the first year of life, the early maturity and the moderately short life cycle contribute to the relatively fast spreading of the species...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproduction}} and feeding {{habits of the}} <b>Bastard</b> <b>grunt,</b> Pomadasys incisus (Bowdich, 1825), in the Gulf of Tunis were investigated monthly from January to December 2003. An examination of the gonads of 463 specimens showed that the <b>Bastard</b> <b>grunt</b> is a gonochoric species and the sex-ratio wasn’t significantly different from 1 : 1. The monthly variations of the gonadosomatic index {{and the percentage of}} the different gonadal development stages revealed that P. incisus spawning period occurred from August to October. This species uses its energetic reserves contained in the liver and the muscles to assure gonadal maturation. The size at first maturity (L 50) was estimated at 15. 33 cm for both sexes pooled. The stomachs examined showed a high vacuity index throughout the year (56. 8 %) and presented a significant difference between seasons. The stomach contents analysis revealed that P. incisus ’ diet was especially constituted of crustacean species as well as benthic and planktonic organisms that belong to 19 taxa. The percentage frequency of occurrence (F) computed for Crangon crangon, Hyperoche sp. and Geryon longipes (the most abundant prey in the diet) showed significant differences among seasons (χ obs = 31. 228, 29. 471 and 11. 302 respectively, were superior to χ 0. 05).

40|$|The present paper gives, for {{the first}} time, some {{biological}} data concerning Pomadasys incisus in the Argolikos Gulf (C. Aegean Sea). The <b>bastard</b> <b>grunt</b> (Pomadasys incisus) is a thermophilic species well adapted in the above area, but the status of fishery suggests an overexploitation. The sex ratio was in favour of males. The length frequency distribution did not differ between the sexes. Growth in weight was estimated {{by means of the}} length-weight relationship. Reproduction seemed to take place in summer. Certain morphometric characters appeared to be useful while comparing populations among the different populations in the Mediterranean...|$|E

This note records the first observation, in scuba diving, of <b>bastard</b> <b>grunts,</b> Pomadasys incisus (Bowdich, 1825), on the French Catalan coast. A total of 62 fishes have been counted (one in November 2005, 18 in July 2006 and 43 in August 2006), between 14 and 18 metres deep, {{in a water}} at a temperature between 18 and 20 °C. These observations have been made on artificial reefs submerged in October 2004. We did not observe this species in any other area of the coast...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of sea water temperature on the life-history traits of the thermophilic <b>bastard</b> <b>grunt</b> Poma-dasys incisus along the Catalan coast. We compared two key traits of this species, condition and reproduction, from populations in two separate areas with different thermal regimes: the Gulf of Roses (cold area) and the Ebre Delta (warm area). Specimens were collected monthly from each area between 2010 and 2012. The results were also compared with those given in the literature from sites where the species is more common, i. e. the southern Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic. Our findings indicate that, com-pared to the populations in warmer environments, the population inhabiting the colder waters {{appears to be in}} significantly poorer condition and there is some deviance in their life-history traits: egg size and quality being traded-off for higher egg numbers; lower lengths at maturity and alterations to spawning phenology. A certain degree of plasticity in life-history traits may favour the process of expansion and establishment of this thermophilic species into newly available but colder habitats of the north-western Mediterranean under a scenario of climate change...|$|E

40|$|The <b>bastard</b> <b>grunt</b> (Pomadasys incisus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} coastal demersal fishes inhabiting the Canary Islands. Age and growth were studied from samples collected between October 2000 and September 2001. Growth analysis revealed that this species is a fast growing and moderately short-lived species (ages up to seven years recorded). Length-at-age was described by the von Bertalanffy growth model (L∞= 309. 58 mm; k= 0. 220 /year; t 0 =– 1. 865 year), the Schnute growth model (y 1 = 126. 66 mm; y 2 = 293. 50 mm; a=– 0. 426; b= 5. 963), and the seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth model (L∞= 309. 93 mm; k= 0. 218 / year; t 0 = – 1. 896 year; C= 0. 555; ts= 0. 652). Individuals grow quickly in their first year, attaining approximately 60 % of their maximum length; after the first year, their growth rate drops rapidly as energy is probably diverted to reproduction. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy weight growth curve were W∞= 788. 22 mm; k= 0. 1567 /year; t 0 = – 1. 984 year. Fish total length and otolith radius were closely correlated, r 2 = 0. 912. A power relationship was estimated between the total length and the otolith radius (a= 49. 93; ν= 0. 851). A year’s growth was represented by an opaque and hyaline (translucent) zone—an annulus. Backcalculated lengths were similar to those predicted by the growth models. Growth parameters estimated from the backcalculated sizes at age were L∞= 315. 23 mm; k= 0. 217 /year; and t 0 = – 1. 73 year...|$|E
