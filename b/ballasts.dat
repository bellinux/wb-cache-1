25|$|Simple {{inductive}} {{fluorescent lamp}} <b>ballasts</b> have a power factor {{of less than}} unity. Inductive <b>ballasts</b> include power factor correction capacitors. Simple electronic <b>ballasts</b> may also have low power factor due to their rectifier input stage.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive <b>ballasts,</b> a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In <b>ballasts</b> that control two or more lamps, line-frequency <b>ballasts</b> commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These <b>ballasts</b> are often called lead-lag <b>ballasts</b> because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.|$|E
25|$|Application of {{electronic}} <b>ballasts</b> {{is growing in}} popularity. Most newer generation electronic <b>ballasts</b> can operate both high pressure sodium (HPS) lamps as well as metal-halide lamps, reducing costs for building managers who use both types of lamps. So, the ballast, at the beginning works as a starter for the voltaic arc, supplying a high-voltage impulse and, later, it works as a limiter/regulator of the electric flow inside the circuit. Electronic <b>ballasts</b> (digital <b>ballasts)</b> also run much cooler and are lighter than their magnetic counterparts.|$|E

In the paper, the railway <b>ballast</b> particle force equilibrium is analyzed through basic mechanics and mathematic formula, and a model is set up to discover the factors and influence. The microscopic <b>ballast</b> flying model is used for <b>ballast</b> bed geometry and <b>ballast</b> shape optimization, and guide the <b>ballast</b> flying countering methods. Results show that <b>ballast</b> flying particle is correlated with <b>ballast</b> shape and mass, especially the <b>ballast</b> shape mass ratio corresponds to operation speed. <b>Ballast</b> interlock ability governs the <b>ballast</b> flying possibility and severity. <b>Ballast</b> flying possibility increases with <b>ballast</b> bed acceleration.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{is to develop a}} <b>ballast</b> quality evaluation computer model based on the relations among the <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics and <b>ballast</b> performance. ^ Much effort has been given in the past to seek suitable criteria for <b>ballast</b> material selection considering <b>ballast</b> performance and maintenance costs. But the selection of <b>ballast</b> material has appeared to be based on limited information without full regard to the effect of <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics on the ability of <b>ballast</b> to fulfill its functions in track. This will result in some misjudgments in the <b>ballast</b> material selection. ^ The developed model can quantify the <b>ballast</b> suitability with a <b>ballast</b> quality index which has taken the basic <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics and the main <b>ballast</b> field functions into consideration. The basic <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics included are shape, angularity, surface texture, gradation, and specific gravity. The main <b>ballast</b> field functions for track are providing resistance forces, resiliency, void storage, drainage, and facilitating maintenance. The <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics are numerically related to the <b>ballast</b> field functions based on available data from field and laboratory tests on granular materials and some assumptions. Weighting factors are used to represent the relative importance of the basic <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics to each <b>ballast</b> function and then the relative importance of the main <b>ballast</b> functions to the overall <b>ballast</b> field performance. ^ The developed model is evaluated using the <b>ballast</b> field data related to the track performance. The verification results show that the developed <b>ballast</b> quality index can reflect the <b>ballast</b> quality. ...|$|R

25|$|Fluorescent lamps {{require a}} ballast to {{stabilize}} the current through the lamp, and to provide the initial striking voltage required to start the arc discharge. This increases the cost of fluorescent light fixtures, though often one ballast is shared between two or more lamps. Electromagnetic <b>ballasts</b> with a minor fault can produce an audible humming or buzzing noise. Magnetic <b>ballasts</b> are usually filled with a tar-like potting compound to reduce emitted noise. Hum is eliminated in lamps with a high-frequency electronic ballast. Energy lost in magnetic <b>ballasts</b> was around 10% of lamp input power according to GE literature from 1978. Electronic <b>ballasts</b> reduce this loss.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps using {{high-frequency}} electronic <b>ballasts</b> do {{not produce}} visible light flicker, since above about 5kHz, the excited electron state half-life is longer than a half cycle, and light production becomes continuous. Operating frequencies of electronic <b>ballasts</b> are selected to avoid interference with infrared remote controls. Poor quality (or failing) electronic <b>ballasts</b> may have insufficient reservoir capacitance or have poor regulation, thereby producing considerable 100/120Hz modulation of the light.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ballasts</b> {{vary greatly}} in complexity. They {{may be as}} simple as a resistor, {{inductor}} or capacitor (or a combination of these) wired in series with the lamp; or as complex as the electronic <b>ballasts</b> used in compact fluorescent lamps and high-intensity discharge lamps.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ballast</b> {{cleaning}} removes this worn <b>ballast,</b> screens it {{and replaces}} the [...] "dirty" [...] worn <b>ballast</b> with fresh <b>ballast.</b> The advantage of <b>ballast</b> cleaning {{is that it}} can be done by an on-track machine without removing the rail and sleepers, and it is therefore cheaper than a total excavation.|$|R
50|$|After {{the track}} renewal train completes the tasks, the <b>ballast</b> {{will be put}} back on the track. For track renewal trains {{that do not have}} <b>ballast</b> {{excavating}} machines included, workers will use a shoulder <b>ballast</b> cutter machine that takes excess <b>ballast</b> that has been pushed out during the track renewal process, into a screening and cleaning machine. The reusable <b>ballast</b> will be put back to the new track together with the new <b>ballast</b> materials. For track renewal trains that do not include track copying or leveling, a <b>ballast</b> tamper will be used to make final adjustments to the track to the correct specification.

25|$|A hybrid ballast has a {{magnetic}} core-and-coil transformer and an electronic switch for the electrode-heating circuit. Like {{a magnetic}} ballast, a hybrid unit operates at line power frequency—50Hz in Europe, for example.

25|$|CFLs {{have two}} main {{components:}} a magnetic or electronic ballast and a gas-filled tube (also called bulb or burner). Replacement of magnetic <b>ballasts</b> with electronic <b>ballasts</b> has removed {{most of the}} flickering and slow starting traditionally associated with fluorescent lighting, and has allowed the development of smaller lamps directly interchangeable with more sizes of incandescent light bulb.|$|E
25|$|Quick-start <b>ballasts</b> {{use a small}} {{auto-transformer}} to {{heat the}} filaments when power is first applied. When an arc strikes, the filament heating power is reduced and the tube will start within half a second. The auto-transformer is either combined with the ballast or may be a separate unit. Tubes need to be mounted near an earthed metal reflector {{in order for them}} to strike. Quick-start <b>ballasts</b> are more common in commercial installations because of lower maintenance costs. A quick-start ballast eliminates the need for a starter switch, a common source of lamp failures. Nonetheless, Quick-start <b>ballasts</b> are also used in domestic (residential) installations because of the desirable feature that a Quick-start ballast light turns on nearly immediately after power is applied (when a switch is turned on). Quick-start <b>ballasts</b> are used only on 240nbsp&V circuits and are designed for use with the older, less efficient T12 tubes.|$|E

On average, bacterial abundance in receiving port water was three-to-four-fold higher than that in <b>ballast</b> water. During 2007, bacterial community structure, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, showed that the bacterial communities did not differ among <b>ballast</b> waters which had experienced different <b>ballast</b> operations.

50|$|The <b>ballast</b> bed is then cleared in {{preparation}} of laying new concrete sleepers.

25|$|Fluorescent lamps with {{magnetic}} <b>ballasts</b> flicker at a normally unnoticeable {{frequency of}} 100 or 120Hz and this flickering can cause problems for some individuals with light sensitivity; they {{are listed as}} problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo.

25|$|The {{efficacy}} of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 {{lumens per watt}} for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 lumens per watt with a modern electronic ballast, commonly averaging 50 to 67lm/W overall.

For a given fluorescent tube, a high-frequency electronic ballast gives about a 10% efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast.

40|$|The {{foundation}} of <b>ballasted</b> railway is usually {{consisted of a}} graded layer of granular media of <b>ballast</b> placed above naturally deposited subgrade. The <b>ballast</b> layer is responsible for limiting the vertical stress magnitudes applied to the weaker subgrade and also prevents the vertical and lateral train-induced sleeper movements. In recent years, the progressive use of faster and heavier trains has compromised the ability of <b>ballast</b> to resist such movements due to the increased magnitude of <b>ballast</b> breakage (degradation). Therefore, accurate determination of <b>ballast</b> breakage is important. The amount of <b>ballast</b> breakage can be estimated by comparing the gradation (particle size distribution) curves of fresh and degraded <b>ballast,</b> using a <b>ballast</b> breakage index. However, the Australian railway authorities currently rely on the visual inspection for estimating <b>ballast</b> breakage. Despite {{the fact that the}} visual inspection is convenient, as it does not require transport of <b>ballast</b> samples or testing, it is subjective and can lead to uneconomical maintenance cycles. In this paper, an attempt is made to utilise the digital imaging technique for gradation analysis and breakage estimation of <b>ballast.</b> The technique is fast and convenient, and can be applied to both the laboratory and field conditions, hence, can be used successfully to replace the visual inspection of <b>ballast</b> breakage...|$|R
25|$|Many {{electronic}} <b>ballasts</b> {{are controlled}} by a microcontroller or similar, and these are sometimes called digital <b>ballasts.</b> Digital <b>ballasts</b> can apply quite complex logic to lamp starting and operation. This enables functions such as testing for broken electrodes and missing tubes before attempting to start, auto detect tube replacement, and auto detection of tube type, such that a single ballast {{can be used with}} several different tubes, even those that operate at different arc currents, etc. Once such fine grained control over the starting and arc current is achievable, features such as dimming, and having the ballast maintain a constant light level against changing sunlight contribution are all easily included in the embedded microcontroller software, and can be found in various manufacturers' products.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>ballasted</b> railway tracks is largely {{controlled by the}} condition of the <b>ballast</b> bed. As shown on figure 1, a typical active railroad cross-section is composed of a clean <b>ballast</b> layer, then a transition layer of mostly clean <b>ballast</b> and finally a fouled <b>ballast</b> (or subballast) layer directly in contact with the subgrade. Subballast is sand or gravel used to provide drainage and, along with <b>ballast,</b> to distribute the dynamic loading applied by trains into the subgrade.

40|$|<b>Ballast</b> {{consisting}} of large sized aggregate particles with uniform size distribution {{is an essential}} component of the track substructure, to facilitate load distribution and drainage. As freight tonnage accumulates with traffic, <b>ballast</b> will accumulate an increasing percentage of fines due to either aggregate breakdown or outside contamination such as subgrade soil intrusion and coal dust collection. According to the classical text by Selig and Waters [1], <b>ballast</b> degradation from traffic involves up to 76 % of all fouling cases; voids will be occupied by fines from the bottom of <b>ballast</b> layer gradually causing <b>ballast</b> clogging and losing its drainage ability. When moisture is trapped within <b>ballast,</b> especially fouled <b>ballast,</b> <b>ballast</b> layer stability is compromised. In the recent studies at the University of Illinois, the focus has been to evaluate behavior of fouled <b>ballast</b> due to aggregate degradation using large scale triaxial testing. To investigate the effects of moisture on degraded <b>ballast,</b> fouled <b>ballast</b> was generated in the laboratory through controlled Los Angeles (LA) abrasion tests intended to mimic aggregate abrasion and breakdown and generate fouled <b>ballast</b> at compositions similar to those observed in the field due to repeated train loadings. Triaxial shear strength tests were performed on the fouled <b>ballast</b> at different moisture contents. Important findings of this preliminary study on characterizing wet fouled <b>ballast</b> are presented in this paper. Moisture was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the fouled <b>ballast</b> strength behavior. Adding a small amount of 3 % moisture (by weight of particles smaller than 3 / 8 in. size or smaller than 9. 5 mm) caused test specimens to indicate approximately 50 % decrease in shear strength of the dry fouled <b>ballast.</b> Wet fouled <b>ballast</b> samples peaked at significantly lower maximum deviator stress values at relatively smaller axial strains and remained at these low levels as the axial strain was increased...|$|R

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} <b>ballasts</b> usually {{change the}} frequency of the power from a standard mains frequency of 50 or 60 Hz up to 40 kHz or higher, often using a Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) circuit topology with Power Factor Correction (PFC). First the AC input power is rectified to DC, and then it is chopped at a high frequency to improve the power factor. In more expensive <b>ballasts,</b> a film capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In the picture at right, the flat grey rectangular component {{in the middle of the}} ballast circuit is a polyester film capacitor used for PFC.|$|E
25|$|Electronic <b>ballasts</b> {{contain a}} small circuit board with a bridge rectifier, a filter {{capacitor}} and usually two switching transistors, {{which are often}} insulated-gate bipolar transistors.

The resulting high frequency {{is applied to the}} lamp tube. Since the resonant converter tends to stabilize lamp current (and light produced) over a range of input voltages, standard CFLs do not respond well in dimming applications and will experience a shorter lifespan and sometimes catastrophic failure. Special electronic <b>ballasts</b> (integrated or separate) are required for dimming service.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ballast</b> is {{the most}} common {{material}} supporting the rail track structure due to its large shear strength, high load bearing capacity and free-drainage. However, the fouling of <b>ballast</b> effects deterioration of track performance, and eventually demands track cleaning. Fouling refers to the progressive intrusion of fines into the <b>ballast</b> layer and subsequently filling the voids. Coal spilling from wagons during transport, sleeper and <b>ballast</b> degradation and soil pumping from soft subgrade are the major factors contributing to <b>ballast</b> fouling. Queensland rail network suffers mainly due to <b>ballast</b> breakdown and intrusion of coal fines. The maintenance costs of <b>ballasted</b> tracks can be significantly reduced if an accurate estimation of the different types of fouling material and associated degradation mechanisms in the <b>ballast</b> layer can be quantified. Moreover, modern track design should be able to capture particle breakage and adjust the <b>ballast</b> type and gradation for improved performance. A series of large-scale triaxial tests were performed with the objective of studying the effects of coal fouling on the shear strength of <b>ballast.</b> The strength and deformation characteristics were investigated for fresh <b>ballast</b> mixed with different percentages of coal fines. In this study, the shear strength properties are linked to <b>ballast</b> fouling indices to better assess the effect of coal fouling on track degradation.
