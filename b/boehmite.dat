50|$|This {{style of}} {{statuary}} is found at Cahokian sites in western Illinois and eastern Missouri, at Spiro and other Caddoan Mississippian sites in eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Louisiana, {{and various other}} sites throughout the American southeast. For many years the statues were {{thought to have been}} produced locally at the sites in which they were discovered, but recent scientific analysis (X-ray diffraction, sequential acid dissolution, and inductively coupled plasma analyses) has shown all of the statues to have been produced from a flint clay only found in the vicinity of St. Louis, Missouri. The particular pipestone used by the artists of Cahokia has a distinctive combination of a lithium bearing chlorite, abundant <b>boehmite</b> (an aluminium oxyhydroxide) and a heavy-metal phosphate mineral suite.

50|$|Cryolite (Na3AlF6, sodium hexafluoroaluminate) is an {{uncommon}} mineral {{identified with the}} once large deposit at Ivigtût {{on the west coast}} of Greenland, depleted by 1987.It was historically used as an ore of aluminium and later in the electrolytic processing of the aluminium-rich oxide ore bauxite (itself a combination of aluminium oxide minerals such as gibbsite, <b>boehmite</b> and diaspore). The difficulty of separating aluminium from oxygen in the oxide ores was overcome by the use of cryolite as a flux to dissolve the oxide mineral(s). Pure cryolite itself melts at 1012 °C (1285 K), and it can dissolve the aluminium oxides sufficiently well to allow easy extraction of the aluminium by electrolysis. Substantial energy is still needed for both heating the materials and the electrolysis, but it is much more energy-efficient than melting the oxides themselves. As natural cryolite is too rare to be used for this purpose, synthetic sodium aluminium fluoride is produced from the common mineral fluorite.Cryolite occurs as glassy, colorless, white-reddish to gray-black prismatic monoclinic crystals. It has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and a specific gravity of about 2.95 to 3.0. It is translucent to transparent with a very low refractive index of about 1.34, which is very close to that of water; thus if immersed in water, cryolite becomes essentially invisible.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} flame retardants systems used act {{either in the}} gas phase where they remove the high energy radicals H and OH from the flame or in the solid phase, where they shield the polymer by forming a charred layer and thus protect the polymer from being attacked by oxygen and heat.Flame retardants based on bromine or chlorine, {{as well as a}} number of phosphorus compounds act chemically in the gas phase and are very efficient.

50|$|There {{are over}} 60 {{manufacturing}} operations {{across the world}} using the Bayer process to make alumina from bauxite ore. Bauxite ore is mined, normally in open cast mines, and transferred to an alumina refinery for processing. To extract the alumina, the soluble part of the bauxite ore is dissolved using sodium hydroxide under conditions of high temperature and pressure. The insoluble part of the bauxite (the residue) is removed, giving rise to a solution of sodium aluminate, which is then seeded and allowed to cool and aluminium hydroxide precipitates from the solution. Though some of the aluminium hydroxide is then returned and used to seed the next batch, the remainder is calcined (heated) at over 1000 °C in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to produce aluminium oxide (alumina). The alumina content of the bauxite used is normally about 50% but ores with a much wider range of alumina contents can be used; the aluminium compound may be present as gibbsite (Al(OH)3), <b>boehmite</b> (AlOOH) or diaspore (AlOOH). The tailings/residue invariably has {{a high concentration of}} iron oxide which gives the product a characteristic red colour. A small residual amount of the sodium hydroxide used in the process remains with the tailings, causing the material to have a high pH/alkalinity, normally >12. Various stages in the solid/liquid separation process are introduced to recycle as much sodium hydroxide as possible from the residue back into the Bayer Process {{in order to make the}} process as efficient as possible and reduce production costs. This also lowers the final alkalinity of the tailings making it easier to handle.|$|E

40|$|<b>Boehmite,</b> {{rather than}} gibbsite, {{precipitation}} {{has been proposed}} in the literature as a potential energy-saving modification of the Bayer process {{for the production of}} alumina. Previous experimental studies have reported that true equilibrium solubilities were not attained during <b>boehmite</b> precipitation. Instead, a pseudo-equilibrium or an apparent 'steady-state' aluminate concentration of about twice the <b>boehmite</b> solubility was reached. In this work, the dissolution and precipitation reactions in synthetic and plant liquors using seeds of (i) pure <b>boehmite</b> and (ii) various boehmite/gibbsite ratios were investigated at 95 °C. Only <b>boehmite</b> precipitation was observed on pure <b>boehmite</b> seed at relatively low supersaturation (alumina (A) /total caustic (TC) 0. 56). The aluminate concentrations measured as a function of time decreased continuously and did not exhibit an apparent 'steady state'. Stable equilibrium, as established by <b>boehmite</b> solubility measurements, was approached very slowly but not attained even after ten weeks. At higher supersaturation (A/TC 0. 67), after an initial desupersaturation, 'steady-state' aluminate concentrations of about twice the <b>boehmite</b> solubility were observed. There is convincing evidence that these 'steady states' correspond to metastable solubility equilibria with gibbsite, which is precipitated initially and gradually transforms into the stable phase, <b>boehmite.</b> Gibbsite also nucleated in the case of pure <b>boehmite</b> seeds. 'Steady states' were attained in one up to several days and remained constant for one to ten days. The length of these periods correlated with the gibbsite content of the seeds. After sufficient recrystallisation of gibbsite to <b>boehmite,</b> the aluminate concentrations decreased significantly and eventually approached <b>boehmite</b> solubility, thereby following a much slower precipitation kinetics typical for <b>boehmite.</b> Due to short observation times, previous workers did not detect the end of the 'steady-state' periods and therefore failed to identify the observed 'steady-state' aluminate concentrations as arising from metastable solubility equilibria with gibbsite...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} {{modification of}} the Bayer Process is investigated in this PhD Thesis, aiming to save energy. The difference of this new method lies in the precipitation stage during which, monohydrate alumina (<b>boehmite)</b> (Al 2 O 3 ?H 2 O) seeds are added into a supersaturated sodium aluminate solution at 90 oC in order to perform precipitation of <b>boehmite</b> instead of gibbsite. The thermodynamic study of hydrothermal transformation of gibbsite to <b>boehmite</b> proved that <b>boehmite</b> is the thermodynamically stable solid phase of the Al 2 O 3 -Na 2 O-H 2 O ternary system, at temperatures as low as 47, 6 οC depending on the initial caustic concentration. The kinetic study of <b>boehmite</b> precipitation from supersaturated sodium aluminate solutions revealed respectively, that crystalline <b>boehmite</b> can be precipitated from such solutions at temperatures lower than 100 οC. The typical <b>boehmite</b> precipitation curve is characterized by an initially high rate of <b>boehmite</b> precipitation that gradually decreases and the system reaches an apparent equilibrium in which, the alumina concentration in solution is almost twice the <b>boehmite</b> solubility under same conditions. The predominant mechanisms during the first nine hours of precipitation are: surface precipitation and agglomeration, while primary nucleation mechanism dominates afterwards. By studying the electrochemical properties of boehmite-water interface in the alkaline pH range, the observed kinetic inhibitions {{were found to be}} attributed to the negative value of boehmite’s surface potential produced by the negatively charged ?AlO- surface species. As a consequence, the aluminate complex ion, cannot be easily adsorbed to the <b>boehmite</b> surface due to the repulsive electrostatic forces. Precipitation under constant concentration of free caustic in solution and/or using very high initial concentration of <b>boehmite</b> seed in solution, increases the value of surface potential and leads to higher <b>boehmite</b> precipitation rate and yield. Depending on the initial particle size of the <b>boehmite</b> seeds used and the application of continuous recycling of the precipitated solids, <b>boehmite</b> with desirable particle size can be produced. Finally, during the calcination stage, <b>boehmite</b> can be transformed to α-Al 2 O 3, γ-Al 2 O 3 as well as to transition aluminas {{that can be used for}} the production of ceramics, refractories, catalysts and other special materials. ...|$|E
