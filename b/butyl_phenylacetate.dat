40|$|The Dufour glands of P. longicornis {{contain a}} group of simple 2 -ketones and alkanes, typical of the Dufour glands of many {{formicine}} ants. The principal component of the secretion was 2 -tridecanone, followed by undecane, 2 -pentadecanone and tridecane, with traces of decane, 2 -dodecanone, 2 -tetradecanone, ethyl phenylacetate and <b>butyl</b> <b>phenylacetate.</b> The venom gland contained, as expected, formic acid. The mandibular glands contained very small amounts of 2, 6 -dimethylpyrazine, trimethylpyrazine, 3 -ethyl- 4 -methylpentan- 1 -ol (but not found in all samples), and 4, 5 -dihydroxydecanoic acid gamma-lactone. Ethyl and butyl esters of the common fatty acids were found in heads and abdomens. status: publishe...|$|E
