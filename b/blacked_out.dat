5|$|On 10 October 1984, GG1001 {{crashed in}} South Korea on a {{demonstration}} flight, killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell. An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults; it concluded Cornell had <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> due to excessive g-forces. GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the Paris Air Show.|$|E

5|$|Some figurines {{have been}} defaced with profanity or Satanic symbols. In December 2008, for example, a {{fiberglass}} Baby Jesus valued at US$375 {{was stolen from}} a Eureka Springs, Arkansas park and later recovered, but had been defaced by racial slurs, a swastika, and a Hitler mustache. The eyes were also <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> and pieces had been broken off, rendering it damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|City of Death was {{broadcast}} on BBC1 over four consecutive Saturdays beginning on 29 September 1979. At this time, industrial action had <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> rival broadcaster ITV {{and as a}} result, the serial scored very high ratings, averaging 14.5 million viewers over the four episodes; 16.1 million watched the fourth episode, the largest audience ever recorded for an episode of Doctor Who. The story was repeated on BBC1 across four consecutive evenings from Tuesday to Friday, 12 - 15 August, 1980, achieving viewing figures of 6.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.9 million viewers respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was easily recognisable by its inverted gull wings and fixed spatted undercarriage. Upon the leading edges of its faired main gear legs were mounted the Jericho-Trompete (Jericho trumpet) wailing sirens, becoming the propaganda symbol of German air {{power and the}} blitzkrieg victories of 1939–1942. The Stuka's design included several innovative features, including automatic pull-up dive brakes under both wings {{to ensure that the}} aircraft recovered from its attack dive even if the pilot <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> from the high g-forces.|$|E

5|$|With TVA Sports {{becoming}} the national French rightsholder in the 2014–15 season through a sub-licensing agreement with Sportsnet, RDS subsequently announced a 12-year deal to maintain regional rights to Canadiens games not shown on TVA Sports. As a result, games on RDS are <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> outside the Canadiens' home market of Quebec, Atlantic Canada {{and parts of}} Eastern Ontario shared with the Ottawa Senators. At least 22 Canadiens games per season (primarily through its Saturday night La super soirée LNH), including all playoff games, are televised nationally by TVA Sports.|$|E
5|$|The Russian Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C³I) {{performed}} poorly {{during the}} conflict. The Russian communication systems were outdated, with a 58th Army commander allegedly making {{contact with his}} combat troops via a journalist-owned satellite phone. Without the modern GLONASS, precision-guided munitions could not be used; the US-controlled GPS was unavailable, since the war zone was <b>blacked</b> <b>out.</b> Due to the negligence of Russian defence minister, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not authorised; an RIA Novosti editorial said that Russian forces lacked reliable aerial-reconnaissance systems, once using a Tupolev Tu-22M3 bomber instead. However, Russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during the war. General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the General staff, said that during the war, new weapons were not tried out.|$|E
5|$|B-29s {{began to}} arrive over Yawata at 00:38 local {{time and the}} attack on the city lasted almost two hours. Only 15 of the American {{aircraft}} were able to aim their bombs visually as the city was <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> and obscured by smoke or haze; the other 32 bombed by radar. Two further B-29s bombed Laoyao harbor and another five struck targets of opportunity; overall 107 tons of bombs were dropped during the raid. After the first bombs were released regular updates on the operation were transmitted to the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters in Washington, from where they were relayed to Arnold who was in London at the time. The raiders were met with heavy but inaccurate anti-aircraft fire and the searchlights stationed around Yawata were not effective. The 4th Air Regiment achieved the only kill of the night when one of its fighters shot down a B-29. The Regiment's other aircraft struggled to make contact with the bombers and achieved few interceptions.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, the three-game series {{between the}} two teams on the weekend of August 5–7 drew large {{television}} viewers. The Friday game (August 5) on MLB Network drew 563,000 viewers, making it the most-watched game on the network during the 2011 season and the second-most watched game on the network, behind Stephen Strasburg's debut. In New York and Boston, it was <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> because the YES Network had local rights in New York City and NESN in Boston. The Saturday game on Fox was most-watched non-primetime regular season MLB telecast on the network {{in more than three}} years with 4.10 million viewers. The last Fox non-primetime telecast to record higher numbers also was Boston vs. New York on July 5, 2008. The Sunday game on ESPN drew 4.72 million viewers, making it the most-watched baseball game on ESPN since June 3, 2007, when both teams faced each other, and the most-watched MLB broadcast of the 2011 season on any network.|$|E
5|$|Six {{days after}} the attack on Centaur, a request {{was made by the}} Australian Department of Defence that the {{identification}} markings and lights be removed from Australian hospital ship Manunda, weapons be installed, and that she begin to sail <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> and under escort. The conversion was performed, although efforts by the Department of the Navy, the Admiralty, and authorities in New Zealand and the United States of America caused the completed conversion to be undone. The cost of the roundabout work came to £12,500, and kept Manunda out of service for three months. On 9 June 1943, communications between the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the subject of hospital ships contained a section referring to the Manunda incident {{as a response to the}} attack on Centaur, with the conclusion that the attack was the work of an irresponsible Japanese commander, and that it would be better to wait until further attacks had been made before considering the removal of hospital ship markings.|$|E
5|$|The news of {{the fall}} of Kilinochchi to the Sri Lankan Military {{resulted}} in celebration, including gathering on the streets and lighting firecrackers, in places like Nuwara Eliya, Anuradhapura, Colombo, Ampara and Kalutara. The Government of Sri Lanka claimed that the population in Jaffna celebrated the capture by raising the national flag with anti-LTTE slogans and demonstrations. However Tamilnet, the pro-rebel website, denied these claims and claimed that the public were forced {{to take part in the}} celebrations. It claimed that the Sri Lankan Army confiscated the National identity cards of many residents in order to force them to take part. The country officially marked the capture of Kilinochchi on 5 January by hoisting the national flag and observing two minutes of silence to honour the troops, while television and radio stations either <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> their regular bulletins during this time or played patriotic songs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|Localized but {{extensive}} {{power outages}} were reported across {{areas that were}} hit by significant amounts of ice. At {{the peak of the}} storm over 300,000 customers lost power across the United States. In the Cincinnati area, 122,000 were without power at one point with 52,000 still <b>blacked</b> <b>out</b> as of Wednesday morning. All had been restored by Tuesday morning. About 7,500 customers in Indiana near the Indianapolis region were still without power on February 15, down from a peak of about 50,000 especially in the Bloomington area. Other states that reported outages included Kentucky (14,000), Maryland (at least 135,000 customers, including 69,000 in Anne Arundel County and 25,000 in Prince George's County, Maryland), New Jersey (36,000), Pennsylvania (10,000 in the Pittsburgh region), Virginia (7,800), and New York (18,000) on Long Island. By 10:00 am Thursday, February 15, about 73,000 homes were without electricity in the Washington DC metropolitan area. Most of those outages were from an ice storm that hit areas from the southern Ohio Valley towards the Atlantic Coast.|$|E
