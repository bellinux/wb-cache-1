40|$|It is {{important}} to guarantee that results expressing the GM content are reliable, comparable and fulfil the requirements of existing EU legislation. The use of different measurement units to express a GM content, the appearance of new analytical methods {{that do not require}} a calibrant and the composite EU legislation on GMOs have triggered the need for a document to clarify how to obtain reliable and comparable results. For this guidance document, past and current EU legislations have been reviewed with a special emphasis on what is meant by 'GM percentage' in the different legal texts. The metrological traceability of measurement results and the currently available guidance are explained and summarised. The particular case of <b>botanical</b> <b>impurities</b> and the genetic constitution of GM seeds are described and illustrated to better understand the complexity hidden behind this type of analysis. An overview of the different analytical methods based on DNA measurements and used for the expression of quantitative GM content results is provided, including the use of new techniques based on digital PCR (dPCR). A measuring system that allows for comparing results by making them traceable to the same reference system has been elaborated in detail. Needs and tools are described and a solution has been proposed to convert results expressing GM content to the required measurement unit, whenever this is needed. By following these recommendations, results obtained in GM copy number per haploid genome equivalent (cp/HGE) by dPCR can be converted into mass fraction percentage and compared to the results obtained by quantitative PCR (qPCR) either with a calibrant certified for its GM mass fraction or with a calibrant certified for its GM purity. The general principle is to relate a measurement result to a GM quantity embedded in a specified certified reference material (CRM) either directly or via one single conversion factor (CF) per event. This conversion factor and its related uncertainty need to be determined precisely for each CRM batch, preferably on the pure GM CRM (100 %), using, for example, dPCR. The estimated uncertainty associated with this conversion factor must be integrated into the measurement uncertainty of the final results expressed in GM mass fraction. CF are currently not yet established for most CRMs. CF values have been recently reported in a few pioneer dPCR studies. However, such proof of concept studies remain incomplete. Therefore, to avoid a gap between new technologies and current EU regulation, the working group recommends to launch a dedicated study to determine CF values. Such a study should involve a limited number of competent laboratories with a proven experience in dPCR. The study could be coordinated by the EURL-GMFF. JRC. F. 5 -Food and Feed Complianc...|$|E
40|$|Tropane {{alkaloids}} (TAs) are toxins {{found in}} a wide variety of plant species growing in mild climates. The most well-known are Datura, Atropa and Hyoscyamus sp., belonging to the Solanaceae family. The TAs family comprises more than 200 compounds, of which atropine and scopolamine are the most active producing anticholinergic symptoms (e. g. blurred vision, dry mouth, muscle spasms, tachycardia and death) if ingested in toxic quantities. The presence of <b>botanical</b> <b>impurities</b> (e. g. seeds, leaves and roots) has been reported in a variety of tea and herbal blends, stressing the need to control the quality of these products in the EU market. The European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for Mycotoxins organised a proficiency test (PT) on the determination of TAs (atropine and scopolamine) in tea and herbal infusions upon request from DG SANTE. The measurand levels were targeted to provide insight on the measurement capabilities of EU Member States' laboratories at concentrations close to the recommended limit of quantification (LOQ) established by the Commission Recommendation 2015 / 976 (preferably below 5 μg/kg and not higher 10 μg/kg). Additionally, the ratio of atropine to scopolamine was kept as native in the plant materials in some samples. Three matrices appropriately processed were provided to the participants: black tea, peppermint leaves and fennel seeds. The concentrations of atropine varied from 8. 3 to 42. 2 μg/kg while those of scopolamine ranged from 1. 5 to 20. 8 μg/kg. The participants were asked to determine atropine and scopolamine in 6 contaminated samples (2 per matrix) and 3 blank materials spiked by them with a TAs solution of unknown concentration. This setup was also aimed to allow a preliminary assessment of the robustness of the EURL-developed method. Thirty-three laboratories from 11 Member States joined the PT, with a very significant participation from Germany. The performance of the laboratories was assessed using z-scores with regard to the assigned values obtained by exact matching double isotope dilution mass spectrometry (EMD-IDMS), in line with the ISO 13528 : 2015. In all cases, the consensus values derived from the participants' data were within the range of the assigned values, considering the respective confidence intervals. On average, eighty-seven percent of the z-scores for atropine and 84 % for scopolamine fell in the acceptable range (|z| ≤ 2). The success rate varied from 83 to 94 % for atropine and from 67 to 94 % for scopolamine, across the distributed matrices and concentration levels. The robust standard deviations of the reported results for both TAs were in good agreement with the target standard deviation (22 %). The results of this PT indicate that EU Member States’ laboratories can determine atropine and scopolamine reliably in tea and herbal infusions at levels relevant to the current legislation (Commission Recommendation 2015 / 976).

40|$|Tropane {{alkaloids}} (TAs) are plant toxins {{that occur}} mainly in Datura, Atropa and Hyoscyamus sp, {{belonging to the}} Solanaceae family, besides {{a variety of other}} families such as Erythroxylaceae, Brassicaceae, Proteaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Convolvulaceae and Cruciferae. The TAs occur {{in all parts of the}} plants and <b>botanical</b> <b>impurities</b> have been found in a range of crops due to accidental contamination during harvesting. The intoxication via the food leads to anticholinergic effects (e. g. blurred vision, pupil dilation, dry mouth, vomiting, muscle spasms, tachycardia, etc.), culminating in severe intoxications and death. The EFSA CONTAM Panel established a group Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) of 0. 016 μg/kg body weight (b. w.) expressed as the sum of (-) -hyoscyamine and () scopolamine, assuming equivalent potency. Infants and young children are the most exposed age classes as they consume a higher amount of cereal-based products per body weight. EFSA estimated that the dietary exposure of toddlers could be up to seven times the group ARfD. Recently, two European legislation acts were published in this field: Commission Recommendation (EU) 2015 / 976, recommending the monitoring of tropane alkaloids in certain food categories, and Commission Regulation (EU) 2016 / 239, enforcing maximum levels of tropane alkaloids in certain cereal-based foods for infants and young children. The EURL-Mycotoxins organised a proficiency test (PT) concerning the determination of atropine and scopolamine in cereal-based baby food, aiming to underpin and assess the measurement capability of Member States' (MS) laboratories. Particular focus was given to levels relevant for enforcement of legislation. Two samples were distributed to the participants: one sample labelled “C” – biscuits for infants containing approx. 1. 2 µg/kg of atropine and 0. 2 µg/kg of scopolamine, and one sample labelled “E” – cereals for porridge containing approx. 7. 4 µg/kg of atropine and 1. 0 µg/kg of scopolamine. Forty-eight datasets from 18 EU MS laboratories were received. Overall, 81 % of the z-scores were in the range of - 2 to 2 and 90 % were in the range of - 3 to 3. For the lowest TA level (sample C) still 75 % of z-scores fell into an acceptable range (|z| ≤ 2), while the mass fraction of scopolamine was far below the target level of 1 µg/kg. In line with this observation, the vast majority of reported LOQs were below 1. 0 µg/kg. The methodologies used by the participants can be clustered into three groups: the method supplied by the EURL; the RIKILT SOP A 1070 and methods based on QuEChERS. The instrumental determination was by LC-MS/MS, with one exception (GC-MS). The recoveries reported by the participants were close to 95 %. No statistically significant dependence of the z scores on the analytical methodology was observed. These results support the assumption that atropine and scopolamine can be reliably determined at the maximum levels proposed by the EU to ensure the protection of infants and young children's health using state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation.  JRC.
