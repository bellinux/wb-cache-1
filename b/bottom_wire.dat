She came into my office, looking so shabby,--not unlike one of those poor shop-girls; and as I was very well dressed from having just been to see you, why, you know, I felt the difference. 'Well, my dear?' said I, not quite liking the look of reproach she was giving me. 'You are groins to leave me,' she answered sadly. 'Well, yes; I suppose I must. You see the insurance business is very absorbing; and besides, it has a bad appearance, your coming about so in office hours, and in those clothes.' 'O,' she moaned out, 'you used to welcome me at all times, out in the country, and thought me prettily dressed.' 'Yes, yes; but this is Boston; and Boston makes a great difference in one's ideas; and I'm going to be married, too. Come, I don't want to seem ungrateful; we have had many pleasant times together, I own it; and I've no objections to your being present at Christmas and Thanksgiving and birthdays, but really I must draw the line there.' She {{gave me a look}} that made my heart ache, and went straight to my desk and took out of a pigeon hole a lot of papers,--odes upon your cruelty, Isabel; songs to you; sonnets,--the sonnet, a mighty poor one, I'd made the day before,--and threw them all into the grate.

5000|$|The {{installation}} of chain-link fence involves setting posts {{into the ground}} and attaching the fence to them. The posts may be steel tubing, timber or concrete and may be driven into the ground or set in concrete. End, corner or gate posts, commonly referred to as [...] "terminal posts", must be set in concrete footing or otherwise anchored to prevent leaning under the tension of a stretched fence. Posts set between the terminal posts are called [...] "line posts" [...] and are set at intervals not to exceed 10 feet. The installer attaches the fence at one end, stretches it, and attaches at the other, easily removing the excess by [...] "unscrewing" [...] a wire. Finally, the installer ties the fence to the line posts with aluminum wire. In many cases, the installer stretches a <b>bottom</b> tension <b>wire,</b> sometimes referred to as [...] "coil wire", between terminal posts to help minimize the in and out movement that occurs {{at the bottom of the}} chain-link mesh between posts.

50|$|The {{pronghorn}} is {{the fastest}} land mammal in the Western Hemisphere, being built for maximum predator evasion through running. The top speed {{is very hard to}} measure accurately and varies between individuals; it can run 35 mph for 4 mi (56 km/h for 6 km), 42 mph for 1 mi (67 km/h for 1.6 km), and 55 mph for 0.5 mi (88.5 km/h for 0.8 km). It is often cited as the second-fastest land animal, second only to the cheetah. It can, however, sustain high speeds longer than cheetahs. University of Idaho zoologist John Byers has suggested the pronghorn evolved its running ability to escape from extinct predators such as the American cheetah, since its speed greatly exceeds that of extant North American predators. Compared to its body size, the pronghorn has a large windpipe, heart, and lungs to allow it to take in large amounts of air when running. Additionally, pronghorn hooves have two long, cushioned, pointed toes which help absorb shock when running at high speeds. They also have an extremely light bone structure and hollow hair. Pronghorns are built for speed, not for jumping. Their ranges are sometimes affected by sheep ranchers' fences. However, they can be seen going under fences, sometimes at high speed. For this reason, the Arizona Antelope Foundation and others {{are in the process of}} removing the bottom barbed wire from the fences, and/or installing a barbless <b>bottom</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many pet rabbits do {{very well}} in the home. They can be litter box trained and are quite fastidious groomers, they can also be trained to wear a harness and leash. Be aware that rabbits love to chew so make sure all wires are safely hidden or in {{protective}} plastic covers and understand that some of your furniture, books and baseboards may be nibbled. They can be contained in an exercise pen to prevent damage to your house. If you choose to cage your rabbit, make sure the cage is at least 2 feet by 2 feet by 4 feet. If the cage has a wire bottom make certain you give the rabbit a plank or sea grass mats to stand on so his feet won’t get damaged from being on the wire all the time. It is preferred that the <b>bottom</b> <b>wire</b> of the cage be 1/2 x 1/2 - large enough for the bunny berries to go through, but small enough to keep their feet and nails from being caught in the wire. Provide a hide box or shelter and plenty of straw for bedding. The rabbits are wonderful pets, with a very nice easy-going temperament. They enjoy empty oatmeal boxes, a juice can (paper) with the ends cut off and stuffed with hay, a bell hanging from the top of their cage. You should also provide chewing material, such as untreated pieces of lumber or small twigs from trees. [...] Californians are an excellent rabbit breed. They produce large litters of 8-12 kits. Californians are a breed developed for show and meat purposes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the experimental data on five negative lightning flashes initiated using the altitude-triggering technique in China. The data include highly time-resolved optical images and electric fields measured 60 m and 1300 m from the lightning channel. The triggering technique involves the launching upward of a small rocket trailing a wire electrically floating. The data show that these 5 flashes have a similar chronological sequence of events, including a bidirectional leader system followed by a mini-return stroke and a bidirectional discharge process. The bidirectional leader system consists of an upward positive leader initiated {{from the top of the}} wire and a downward negative stepped leader from the bottom, with the onset of the former prior to the latter by 3 to 8. 3 ms. The downward negative stepped leader, having a step interval of 12 – 30 μs, appears to pause and resume several times while the upward positive leader extends forward continuously. With the downward negative stepped leader close to ground, a mini-return stroke occurs between the ground and the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>wire.</b> The mini-return stroke propagates upward with a speed of 1 – 2 × 10 ⁸ m/s and emits intense light signals similar to a normal return stroke below the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>wire.</b> It becomes invisible after entering the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>wire</b> and appears again as a bright upward discharge from the top of the wire several microseconds later. This upper bright discharge ceases after propagating forward several hundred meters at a speed of 1. 5 – 5. 4 × 10 ⁷ m/s. The cessation of the upper bright discharge is obviously associated with the disintegration of the wire at that moment. Right after the cessation of the upper bright discharge, a bidirectional discharge process starts from the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>wire</b> with its positively charged part having an upward speed of 3 – 10 × 10 ⁵ m/s and its negatively charged part a downward speed of 2 – 2. 6 × 10 ⁵ m/s. Reflection of current waves at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>wire</b> due to the explosion of the wire at that moment may be a major reason for the occurrence of this lower bidirectional discharge.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of high tensile electric fencing for controlling deer damage {{has led to}} the installation of these fence designs throughout the Northeast. In May 1984. 55 surveys were sent to individuals in 10 states who were known to have recently constructed deer fences. Sixty-seven percent of the surveys were returned and a variety of fence-related data were generated. These include information on deer damage, a general description of fence designs being utilized, information concerning fence voltage, data on fence maintenance and several questions on fence performance, owner satisfaction, and the cost/benefits of deer damage control. The majority of fences in this study were either 5 -strand vertical (40 %) or 7 -strand slant (33 %). Slanted fences enclosed more acreage and longer rotational crops than vertical fences. Most fence owners indicated that maintenance activities were routinely carried out and that fence performance was excellent. However, the majority of fence owners reported that deer penetration did occur. The results of the survey contradicted, to some extent, data and field observations collected by the authors in southeastern New York over the past five years. An unpublished study of 12 high-tensile fences, most of which were also reported on in the survey, revealed significant differences in wire tension, <b>bottom</b> <b>wire</b> height, and voltage between and within these fences. This study indicates that many fences are actually in poor operating condition and are in need of better maintenance.

40|$|Qweak is an {{experiment}} set {{to take place}} at Jefferson Lab that will put the Standard Model to the test by measuring the weak charge of the proton by precisely measuring the parity-violating asymmetry of elastic proton-electron scattering. Ver- tical Drift Chambers, which will momentum analyze events that take place, will be key to the tracking system of Qweak. A vertical drift chamber was constructed and conditioned by applying high voltage to the chamber. After conditioning, the current that the chamber would draw at 3. 55 kV began to spike to 10. 3 ?A and therefore we were cautious to go above this voltage level when testing the chamber. The efficiency of the chamber was measured using cosmic rays and a 90 Sr source. Using cosmic rays, {{the efficiency of the}} chamber was (95. 3 � 1. 3) % at 3. 5 kV, whereas when using the 90 Sr source, the efficiency of the chamber was (81. 3 � 1. 9) % at 3. 5 kV. However, it was discovered that these efficiencies were contaminated by background noise that was being picked up by the electronic equipment used to measure the efficiency. After eliminating this background noise, the efficiency of the chamber was again measured, yet it was not at an operating efficiency, which is typically on the order of 99 - 100 %. It appeared that the chamber needed {{to be able to handle}} larger voltages, however, this was not possible due to the amount of current that the chamber would draw at these larger voltages.

Results indicate that deformation is tiny when steel mesh maintains as an overall ring, and stress caused by vertical bending moment and tension of <b>bottom</b> tie <b>wire</b> are also in the safe range. However, axial forces of lap reinforcement in adjacent steel mesh exceed the ultimate bearing capacity of tie wire. Hence, tie wires are ruptured; single mesh loses lateral connection and turns into monolithic status as the destruction of overall structure.

So, in order to prevent connection failure and enhance installation security, the overlapping parts of steel mesh should be taken more reliable measures.
