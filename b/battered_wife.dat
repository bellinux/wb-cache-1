40|$|The social {{files and}} medical records of 98 acutely <b>battered</b> <b>wives</b> who {{attended}} a surgical emergency department were studied. Although all women had been hospitalized during the decade preceding the present incident, <b>wife</b> <b>battering</b> was documented in the records in only 18 %. The majority of the women (73 %) were also known to the social services, but battering was documented in {{less than half of}} the cases in the social service files. The measures taken by the social services to help the battered women consisted mainly of economic support and psychotherapy. The cooperation between the medical and social services and the police in cases of <b>wife</b> <b>battering</b> was very limited or non-existent. It is concluded that support given to battered women by the formal sources of aid is insufficient. The documentation of the cases is poor, there is a lack of practical measures and the cooperation between the authorities is limited. This study indicates that the social and medical services underestimate the importance of informal help sources like women's groups or shelters which often are the most valued resources by the battered women themselves. With improved cooperation between authorities and between formal and informal sources of aid the <b>battered</b> <b>wives</b> could be helped more effectively...|$|R

Dugard: [...] "The phrase [...] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors."

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the social definition {{process of the}} social problem of <b>wife</b> <b>battering</b> in Canada from 1970 to 1990. The primary component of the thesis is {{an examination of the}} development of various conceptual frameworks. The issue of <b>wife</b> <b>battering</b> would not have evolved as a social problem {{had it not been for}} the raised political consciousness of feminism and other social movements. The early efforts of the battered women's movement to gain recognition soon entered a stage characterized by co-optation, professionalism, and bureaucracy. Government and nongovernment officials, activists and academics played an ambivalent role in shaping the public definition of <b>wife</b> <b>battering.</b> On one hand these agencies and officials would occasionally provide financial support, legitimation, and credibility for the movement. On the other hand, these agencies and officials would compete against the movement for funding and for control of the social policy agenda. Literature on the battered women's movements in the United States of America and Great Britain are examined. An attempt was made to document and assess the various positions and perspectives of the various interest groups who were involved in the social construction of <b>wife</b> <b>battering</b> as a major social policy area. A number of divergent perspectives of frameworks were identified: the victims' position, the family violence perspective, the spousal abuse, <b>wife</b> <b>battering</b> and <b>wife</b> assault approaches. The social constructionist framework highlighted the existence of policy shifts and trends related to <b>wife</b> <b>battering</b> in Canada. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
