5|$|By Tuesday, {{the storm}} was rapidly moving across eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, it lost power quickly. This also meant less snowfall, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> of the fast motion of the storm {{and the lack of}} lake effect snow. All {{shipping}} was halted on Monday and part of Tuesday along the St. Lawrence River around Montreal, Quebec.|$|E
5|$|Design of {{the bridge}} was awarded to Aas-Jakobsen and Det Norske Veritas, the former who also {{performed}} dynamic analysis and structural engineering. Architects were Hindhammer–Sundt–Thomassen, Lund & Løvseth, and Lund & Slaatto. An H pylon was chosen instead of an A pylon <b>both</b> <b>because</b> it was more functional, and would be more aesthetic {{in conjunction with the}} other bridges in the area, particularly three suspension bridges.|$|E

5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare <b>both</b> <b>because</b> he authored few dissents, and because {{it was one of the}} few times he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E
5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, poverty forced Johnson {{to leave}} Oxford {{without taking a}} degree, and he returned to Lichfield. During his last weeks at Oxford, Jorden left Pembroke, and Johnson was given William Adams as a tutor in his place. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many of the books that his father had previously lent him, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E
5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they could work despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} week Kioe Gie and his wife sell their belongings and prepare {{to move back to}} Cicuruk. This departure is delayed by a visit from Kioe Lie, who reveals that he will be marrying Tam Bing's widow Tan Houw Nio– Tam Bing having died the year before. Kioe Gie is horrified, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> the widow has the same surname and because Kioe Lie had promised their father on his deathbed to marry Hap Nio. After an extensive argument, Kioe Lie disowns his brother and leaves.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, {{arrived in}} Virginia, having {{traveled}} south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland. Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> his Catholicism offended them as Protestants, {{and because it}} was no secret that Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own. After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony, was sent to England to argue the Virginians' case. This happened to be to Claiborne's private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, {{the then}} Governor-General of Jamaica Sir Kenneth O. Hall, {{indicated}} that he wished to step down due to declining health. He was persuaded {{to remain in the}} post for an additional half-year. On 13 January 2009, the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Bruce Golding (of the Jamaica Labour Party), announced that Allen would succeed Kenneth Hall as governor-general. The announcement generated controversy, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> Allen had strong ties to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, and because as an Adventist, Allen might be unable to attend events due to his strict observation of the sabbath. On 28 January 2009, Allen resigned from his presidency of the West Indies Union. He also resigned as {{chairman of the board of}} Northern Caribbean University, and other religious organisations in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Georgia outplayed Vanderbilt. The Commodores had two first downs {{in the first}} half, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> of Bulldog penalties. A Commodore punt was {{returned}} 15 yards by Georgia to the Vanderbilt 30-yard line, and the Bulldogs completed an 18-yard pass from Dick Hartley to halfback Jim Tom Reynolds on Vanderbilt's 12-yard line. After three short gains, Hartley advanced five yards and Vanderbilt was penalized for being offside. Jim Reynolds, gaining a yard or so, went over for the touchdown with a counter on the following series; the close call was disputed. At {{the end of the}} half, Georgia had gained 113 yards to Vanderbilt's nine.|$|E
5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{soldiers}} eventually find Ip at {{the cotton}} mill. Ip tells Chow {{to take his}} wife and son away for protection. Miura tells Ip that his life will be spared if he agrees to instruct the Japanese soldiers in martial arts. Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match, which Miura accepts, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese. The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan's square. Sato tells Ip that his life will be spared if he lets the general win.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the castle was important <b>both</b> <b>because</b> it controlled an important mountain pass, and possibly because Llywelyn claimed authority as {{the lord of the}} mountains and coasts of Wales: several of his castles appear to have been located with such political symbolism in mind. It is also possible that Llywelyn may have built his castle on top of the remains of a previous fortification constructed by Maelgwn Gwynedd, a king of Gwynedd in the 6th century, although no such remains have been found.|$|E

These include the Croyland Chronicle, Commines' Mémoires, the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, the debate about Richard's true character and motives continues, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and {{because of the fact that}} none was written by men with an intimate knowledge of Richard, even if they had met him in person.|$|E
5|$|Thomas O'Brien was a Canadian miner and {{businessman}} who had prospered considerably during the rush, investing widely in businesses {{across the city}} {{to become one of}} the wealthiest of the local hotel and saloon owners. O'Brien had considerable confidence that Dawson would continue to grow as an economic powerhouse in the region, <b>both</b> <b>because</b> of its remaining gold deposits and the presence of Canadian government institutions. O'Brien believed that transportation costs would inevitably keep the prices for imported beer high in Dawson and make a local brewery a profitable venture, with the potential to export its product into the neighbouring U.S. district of Alaska.|$|E
5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when a girl to whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them <b>both</b> <b>because</b> the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E
