This, coupled with studies of more central San Lorenzo, revealed quite a <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> houses were organized. Wendt studied refuse throughout the site, using that information to infer the layout of buildings. Clutter refuse, that is, refuse that is potentially valuable or hazardous, was studied and progressed through several stages of disposal: discarded along areas near house walls, then moved to dumps or pits. When people abandon a house, they usually leave refuse {{that is out of}} mind: behind large furniture, in corners, or outside on the periphery. Using this information, Wendt determined the likely architectural organization of the site. The data suggested that the architectural organization most likely followed the solar pattern of highland Maya house-lots. The solar pattern is unrestricted in space and has separate areas designated for separate activities, i.e. sleeping, cooking, etc. All these detached structures are built around a central patio area.|$|E

Certainly Dr. Annette Majnemer, this year’s lecturer, embodies all of these characteristics.

40|$|In this paper, I {{would like}} to put forward the claim that, {{at least in some}} central cases, visualising {{consists}} literally in imagining seeing. The first section of my paper is concerned with a defence of the specific argument for this claim that M. G. F. Martin presents in his paper 'The Transparency of Experience' (Martin 2002). This argument has been often misunderstood (or ignored), and it is worthwhile to discuss it in detail and to illus­trate what its precise nature is and why I take it to be sound. In the second section, I present a second and independent argument for the claim that visualising is imagining seeing, which is not to be found in Martin's writings, despite some crucial similarities with his own argument ‒ notably in the focus on the subjective aspects of visual experience. The last section deals with a particular objection to the idea that imagining takes perception as its direct object and says a <b>bit</b> more <b>about</b> <b>how</b> best to understand this claim. ...|$|R
40|$|Frege refines {{his theory}} ofcontent {{in what is}} his major and most {{influential}} contribution to the philosophy oflanguage, namely his essay Über Sinn und Bedeutung (1892). There is quite a <b>bit</b> ofdiscussion <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to translate this title into English, particularly Frege's use of "Bedeutung " (see Frege 1997, 36 - 46). In ordinary Gennan, "Sinn [sense], " "Bedeutung [meaning]" and "Inhalt [content] " are used interchangeably, as are their ordinary English translations. So in ordinary Gennan the title "Über Sinn und Bedeutung " is redundant and thus it seems a bit odd to the ordinary Gennan reader, as would the title "OfSense and Meaning " in English. Since Frege aims to draw a distinction using Gennan words that ordinarily are used synonymously, his use ofthose tenns in the body ofthe essay {{is bound to be}} odd, as would be the case whenusing the synonymous English tenns "sense" and "meaning " to draw a distinction.

Among the larger uncertainties that can effect an infrared temperature measurement are emissivity, spectral response, blackbody or gray body temperature uncertainty, optical scatter, size of source effect, and transfer standard uncertainty. Emissivity coupled with spectral response when measuring a non-blackbody can be especially troublesome since emissivity can vary with wavelength. There are other factors that are minor contributors to uncertainty as well. For an adequate radiometric uncertainty budget, all of these uncertainties must be evaluated. This paper discussions the calculation of uncertainty budgets for infrared thermometry in an industrial application. It discusses the measurement equation used for uncertainty budget calculation and covers the merits of using this equation as opposed to other equations.
