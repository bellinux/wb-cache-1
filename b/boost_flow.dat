D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityTo {{accomplish}} high-performance and granular {{traffic control}} across {{a great number}} of network devices, flow processing in an OpenFlow switch is of great importance for any Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture. The fundamental challenge is to classify incoming packets efficiently according to a pipeline of flow tables characterized by numerous fields and match types. So far current packet classification algorithms is not able to process a flow table with an arbitrary number of fields and any match type due to several crucial drawbacks, especially scalability, incremental update and nondeterminism. To address the new challenge we propose an innovative decomposition algorithm. Meanwhile we propose three different schemes to process flow tables with only exactmatch, prefix match and classic quintuple match. They are (1) a highly deterministic hashing scheme featured by efficient collision resolution, (2) a hierarchical hashing scheme featured by taking advantage of bitmap and hashing techniques, and (3) a divide-and-conquer scheme based on Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) hardware by addressing the range expansion problem. Together with the proposed decomposition algorithm, these four approaches cover all categories of match types and comprise a high-performance table lookup accelerator to <b>boost</b> <b>flow</b> processing in an OpenFlow switch. As far as we know, our proposed decomposition scheme is the first efficient approach toaddressing multidimensional match problem in an OpenFlow flow table with an arbitrary number of fields and any match type. And our proposed high-performance table lookup accelerator is the first comprehensive proposal to process the entire OpenFlow table pipeline by covering all categories of match types and any number of fields. The accelerator is available to be implemented and deployed in either software or hardware devices with respect to a variety of performance and cost circumstances.

40|$|Background: Although virus-specific {{responses}} are rarely detected by conventional approaches, we report here {{the detection of}} T-cell responses in HIV-exposed seronegative (HESN) patients by two distinct assays. Methods: HIV-specific T-cell responses were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} from HESN patients after a 48 -h co-culture with boosted dendritic cells. Additionally, a <b>boosted</b> <b>flow</b> cytometry approach was used to capture antiviral T-cell responses. Host genetic factors and T-cell activation were also analyzed to assess their implication on HIV exposure. Results: Of the 45 HESN individuals tested, up to 11 (24. 4 %) showed at least one response to peptide pools covering HIV Gag and Nef. A positive correlation was observed between the intensity (P¼ 0. 0022) and magnitude (P¼ 0. 0174) of the response detected in the HESN, and the viral load of the HIV-positive partner. Moreover, the result from the <b>boosted</b> <b>flow</b> and cytomix analyses showed a dominant Th 1 - like response pattern against HIV antigens, especially in CD 8 þ T-cell populations. Conclusions: The combined use of our boosted dendritic cell technique with a <b>boosted</b> <b>flow</b> cytometric approach allows us both to detect specific HIV-positive responses in a higher percentage of HESN patients and to define specific effector function profiles. This study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} resistance to HIV infection...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} {{principles}} of water-use accounts, developed {{in the first of}} the series, to the Yellow River basin in China. The Yellow River rises in the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai Province in western China, and empties into the Bohai Sea. A unique feature of the river is the large amount of silt it carries. Net runoff is about 14 % of total precipitation. Forest and woodland cover 9 % of the basin and use about 15 % of the precipitation. Grassland covers much of {{the upper part of the}} Basin, consuming about 42 % of the precipitation. Irrigated agriculture covers just 6 % of the Basin and uses about 11 % of the water. The effect of increased irrigation efficiency shows that local increase of irrigation efficiency does not necessarily translate into changes at the whole basin level. The water transfer to the Yellow River from the Yangtze <b>boost</b> <b>flows</b> to the upper Yellow river and leads to an increase in the flows throughout the river.

40|$|A {{new code}} and {{methodology}} are introduced for solving the fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) equations using time-explicit, finite-volume discretization. The code has options for solving the GRMHD equations using traditional artificial-viscosity (AV) or non-oscillatory central difference (NOCD) methods, {{or a new}} extended AV (eAV) scheme using artificial-viscosity together with a dual energy-flux-conserving formulation. The dual energy approach allows for accurate modeling of highly relativistic <b>flows</b> at <b>boost</b> factors well beyond what has been achieved to date by standard artificial viscosity methods. it provides the benefit of Godunov methods in capturing high Lorentz <b>boosted</b> <b>flows</b> but without complicated Riemann solvers, and the advantages of traditional artificial viscosity methods in their speed and flexibility. Additionally, the GRMHD equations are solved on an unstructured grid that supports local adaptive mesh refinement using a fully threated oct-tree (in three dimensions) network to traverse the grid hierarchy across levels and immediate neighbors. A number of tests are presented to demonstrate robustness of the numerical algorithms and adaptive mesh framework over {{a wide spectrum of}} problems, boosts, and astrophysical applications, including relativistic shock tubes, shock collisions, magnetosonic shocks, Alfven wave propagation, blast waves, magnetized Bondi flow, and the magneto-rotational instability in Kerr black hole spacetimes...|$|R

The decreased volume of freshwater in the Delta has {{had a profound effect}} on its ecology. In most years, large dams in the Delta watershed fully hold back spring runoff; as a result the Delta is most susceptible to salinity intrusion between February and June. However, regulation provided by dams helps <b>boost</b> freshwater <b>flows</b> during dry summers and autumns, reducing the risk of salinity intrusion in these months.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} online {{stochastic}} bipartite matching problem, {{in a form}} motivated by display ad allocation on the Internet. In the online, but adversarial case, the celebrated result of Karp, Vazirani and Vazirani gives an approximation ratio of 1 - 1 /e. In the online, stochastic case when nodes are drawn repeatedly from a known distribution, the greedy algorithm matches this approximation ratio, but still, no algorithm is known that beats the 1 - 1 /e bound. Our main result is a 0. 67 -approximation online algorithm for stochastic bipartite matching, breaking this 1 - 1 /e barrier. Furthermore, we show that no online algorithm can produce a 1 -ϵ approximation for an arbitrarily small ϵ for this problem. We employ a novel application {{of the idea of}} the power of two choices from load balancing: we compute two disjoint solutions to the expected instance, and use both of them in the online algorithm in a prescribed preference order. To identify these two disjoint solutions, we solve a max flow problem in a <b>boosted</b> <b>flow</b> graph, and then carefully decompose this maximum flow to two edge-disjoint (near-) matchings. These two offline solutions are used to characterize an upper bound for the optimum in any scenario. This is done by identifying a cut whose value we can bound under the arrival distribution...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIsland {{tourism is}} often studied {{through the prism}} of the {{negative}} impact on the environment and island societies, so creating a divide between tourists and local societies. Although {{there is no question that}} tourism has consequences for the environment, generally speaking, it is developing in regions which value environmental quality. This is particularly true of the Île de Ré, a symbolic place for tourism in France. However, the environment crystallises tensions evident in the discourses coming from the various players in this territory. As on other islands, the Ré beaches enjoy a favoured position within the tourism system, being central to tourist practices, particularly during the summer season. It is therefore our intention to qualify the impact of tourism on island areas through the example of visitors to the Île de Ré beaches. This study is founded on data from the Tourism and Leisure Practices Observatory. Analysis of the profiles and practices of those using the Ré beaches demonstrates the need to qualify the impact on the environment. Moreover, tourists are not alone in impacting on the environment. Cross-analysis of visitor numbers and factors influencing the choice of beaches reveals that visits are recurrent and regular since the beaches are perceived as being of high quality and in proximity to the place of residence of friends or family. Thus, the divide created between tourists and local society is brought into question since the latter, generally behind claims of excessive visitor numbers, helps to <b>boost</b> <b>flows</b> by welcoming friends and family...|$|R

30|$|A {{recurring}} {{theme in the}} experiences of Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden is that reforms focused on early intervention can be very successful at reducing the flow of new beneficiaries onto the program and/or <b>boosting</b> the <b>flow</b> of new beneficiaries off the program. For example, early intervention that coordinated employer actions with the employees’ particular health shock were critical to keeping impaired workers {{in the labor force}} in the Netherlands. Such intervention significantly increased the return to work of impaired workers and reduced time on the sickness or disability program. Evidence from Sweden shows that waiting even one year following the onset of impairment significantly reduces the chance that rehabilitation will result in a return to work. Evidence from Great Britain suggests that bringing medical screening forward can help to control program growth.|$|R

40|$|Anisotropic hydrodynamics is a {{reorganization}} of the relativistic hydrodynamics expansion, with the leading order already containing substantial momentum-space anisotropies. The latter are a cause of concern in the traditional viscous hydrodynamics, since large momentum anisotropies generated in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are {{not consistent with the}} hypothesis of small deviations from an isotropic background, i. e., from the local equilibrium distribution. We discuss the leading order of the expansion, presenting a new formulation for the (1 + 1) – dimensional case, namely, for the longitudinally boost invariant and cylindrically symmetric flow. This new approach is consistent with the well established framework of Israel and Stewart in the close to equilibrium limit (where we expect viscous hydrodynamics to work well). If we consider the (0 + 1) –dimensional case, that is, transversally homogeneous and longitudinally <b>boost</b> invariant <b>flow,</b> the new form of anisotropic hydrodynamics leads to better agreement with known solutions of the Boltzmann equation than the previous formulations, especially when we consider finite mass particles...|$|R
