The county-designated highway system was created around after October 5, 1970. The C-66 designation was first shown on the 1971 state map following the routing used today.|$|E

500|$|Iowa85 was paved in the mid-1950s; until then, {{the highway}} {{had been a}} gravel road. [...] In the early 1960s, Iowa21 was {{straightened}} through Keokuk County near Guernsey and Deep River.

[...] The route would remain this way for nearly thirty years. [...] In 1994, the westernmost [...] of Iowa85 was turned over to the City of Montezuma.

500|$|Also in {{the park}} is the Coosa Backcountry Trail, a strenuous [...] loop which climbs Coosa Bald and Slaughter Mountain. The trail is marked with green blazes and is {{generally}} easy to follow. It fords streams on its lower segments before ascending Duncan's Ridge near the summit of Coosa Bald at over [...] elevation, where it joins the Duncan Ridge Trail. The joined trail then makes a descent, then climbs slightly to the summit of Wildcat Knob, then descends to Wolfpen Gap where it crosses State Route 180. Across Wolfpen Gap, the trail makes a steep ascent up Slaughter Mountain, then descends to Slaughter Gap where the Coosa Backcountry and Duncan Ridge Trail split. From this point, the Duncan Ridge Trail leads directly to Blood Mountain where it meets the Appalachian Trail. The Coosa Backcountry Trail makes a steep [...] descent down the mountain and joins with the Bear Hair Gap Trail, leading <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin. The Appalachian Trail can also be accessed from nearby Neel's Gap, just a little higher up Blood Mountain on Highway 19/129; hikers can reach this area from the Byron Herbert Reece Trail.|$|E
500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at their Reading and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal to all three of us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life. I was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E

2500|$|In mathematics, the Klein bottle [...] is {{an example}} of a non-orientable surface; it is a {{two-dimensional}} manifold against which a system for determining a normal vector cannot be consistently defined. [...] Informally, it is a one-sided surface which, if traveled upon, could be followed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin while flipping the traveler upside down. [...] Other related non-orientable objects include the Möbius strip and the real projective plane. Whereas a Möbius strip is a surface with boundary, a Klein bottle has no boundary (for comparison, a sphere is an orientable surface with no boundary).|$|E
2500|$|Data flows on an EIB channel {{stepwise}} {{around the}} ring. Since there are twelve participants, {{the total number}} of steps around the channel <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of origin is twelve. Six steps is the longest distance between any pair of participants. An EIB channel is not permitted to convey data requiring more than six steps; such data must take the shorter route around the circle in the other direction. The number of steps involved in sending the packet has very little impact on transfer latency: the clock speed driving the steps is very fast relative to other considerations. However, longer communication distances are detrimental to the overall performance of the EIB as they reduce available concurrency.|$|E

2500|$|The lowest-level {{concepts}} {{related to}} visual perception {{for a human}} being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, {{the structure of the}} retina in mammals and in human beings is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of perception of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, [...] "fixes" [...] it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of maximum sensitivity. The image [...] "marks time" [...] in the vicinity of this point.|$|E
2500|$|The search resumed {{just before}} 5 a.m. on 18 December, despite strong wind, heavy seas, and {{occasional}} rain. Working in shifts, 50 divers {{focused on the}} rock pools and ledges near where Holt had last been sighted. They were forced to free dive to minimise injury when they were driven against the nearby cliff face. Due {{to a change in}} the tide, the search was suspended at 8 a.m. and did not resume until mid-afternoon. The following day's operations were again hampered by the weather. Conditions improved on Wednesday, 20 December, but by the following day most personnel were being withdrawn. The search for Holt's body was officially called off on 5 January 1968, although it had been gradually scaled <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> where it consisted only of a daily beach patrol.

2500|$|Their {{dentition}} {{is similar}} to that of the canid, but is more specialised for consuming coarse food and crushing bones. The carnassials, especially the upper, are very powerful and are shifted far <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of exertion of peak pressure on the jaws. The other teeth, save for the underdeveloped upper molars, are powerful, with broad bases and cutting edges. The canines are short, but thick and robust. Labiolingually, their mandibles are much stronger at the canine teeth than in canids, reflecting the fact that hyenas crack bones with both their anterior dentition and premolars, unlike canids, which do so with their post-carnassial molars. The strength of their jaws is such that both striped and spotted hyenas have been recorded to kill dogs with a single bite to the neck without breaking the skin. The spotted hyena is renowned for its strong bite proportional to its size, but a number of other animals (including the Tasmanian devil) are proportionately stronger. The aardwolf has greatly reduced cheek teeth, sometimes absent in the adult, but otherwise has the same dentition as the other three species. The dental formula for all hyena species is: ...|$|E
