5|$|In {{order to}} compare {{individual}} striations, examiners must obtain a known sample using the seized weapon. For slower-traveling bullets, such as pistols or revolvers, known bullet exemplars {{are created by}} firing the weapon into a water tank. The spent bullet can <b>be</b> <b>recovered,</b> intact, as the water slows down the bullet before it can reach the tank walls, allowing for it to <b>be</b> <b>recovered.</b> For faster traveling bullets, such as those fired from high-powered rifles and military style weapons, water tanks cannot {{be used as the}} tank will not provide enough stopping power for the projectiles. To examine these weapons, investigators must fire them at a target at a controlled range with enough backing to stop the bullet and collect the spent round after it has been fired.|$|E
5|$|John Pomerleau, {{owner of}} Alternative Funeral Service {{which is located}} in the Algo Centre Mall said in July that more than 30 {{cremation}} urns were still trapped in the mall and it was unknown if or when they could <b>be</b> <b>recovered.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the tests}} have been satisfactorily completed, a {{cylinder}} passing the test will be marked accordingly. Stamp marking {{will include the}} registered mark of the inspection facility and the date of testing (month and year). Records of a periodic inspection and test are made by the test station and kept available for inspection. These include: If a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot <b>be</b> <b>recovered,</b> the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder unserviceable.|$|E
5|$|Being {{a form of}} carbon, diamond oxidizes in air if heated over 700°C. In {{absence of}} oxygen, e.g. in a flow of high-purity argon gas, diamond can be heated up to about 1700°C. Its surface blackens, but can <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> by re-polishing. At high {{pressure}} (~20GPa) diamond can be heated up to 2500°C, and a report published in 2009 suggests that diamond can withstand temperatures of 3000°C and above.|$|E
5|$|Fires in the {{workings}} hampered rescue efforts, {{and it took}} several days before they were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} bodies to <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of negligence against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E
40|$|A fatal case of Trichosporon inkin {{prosthetic}} endocarditis is reported. The isolation {{sites and}} susceptibility profiles of 10 other isolates are also reviewed. Four strains <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> from cutaneous or subcutaneous samples, four <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> from urine, one <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> from peritoneal liquid, and one <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> from bone.

On 1 January 1943, the Navy base at Garden Island was commissioned as HMAS Kuttabul in commemoration of the ferry and the lives lost.|$|E
5|$|Losses for 12 July are {{difficult}} to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka {{are difficult}} to establish.|$|E

5|$|The ASAT test mission, {{the final}} {{flight of the}} High Virgo missile, was {{conducted}} on September 22, 1959. Less than a minute after {{the launch of the}} missile from its B-58 carrier aircraft at Mach 2, the telemetry signal was lost. No data was recovered from the test, and the camera data, intended to <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> afterward, was not located. Hence the test was inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The ancient trade city of Phlan {{has fallen}} into impoverished ruin. Now {{only a small}} portion of the city remains {{inhabited}} by humans, who are surrounded by evil creatures. To rebuild the city and clean up the Barren River, the city council of New Phlan has decided to recruit adventurers to drive the monsters from the neighboring ruins.

5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the larger}} third-class {{families}} were John and Annie Sage, who were immigrating to Jacksonville, Florida with their nine children, {{ranging in age}} from 4 to 20 years; Anders and Alfrida Andersson of Sweden and their five children, who were travelling to Canada along with Alfrida's younger sister Anna, husband Ernst and baby Gilbert; and Frederick and Augusta Goodwin, who were moving with their six children to his new job at a power plant in New York. In 2007, scientists using DNA analysis identified the body of a small fair-haired toddler, one of the first victims to <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> by the CS Mackay Bennett, as Frederick's youngest child, 19-month-old Sidney. The Sages, Anderssons and Goodwins all perished in the sinking.|$|E

5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} graphite moderator known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily <b>be</b> <b>recovered.</b>|$|E
5|$|By November 1998, UBS's {{losses from}} its {{exposure}} to LTCM were estimated {{at the level}} of approximately CHF 790million. UBS would prove to be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the bailout effort, which would largely <b>be</b> <b>recovered.</b> In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his fame}} and popularity, like many former {{servicemen}} contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness. As a consequence he pawned his medals for £20, only {{for them to}} <b>be</b> <b>recovered</b> by the Jewish Historical Society on the urging of the wife of Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz and ultimately reunited with Smith. Smith's varied occupations in post-war Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe. He emigrated to Australia in 1925 with his wife Elsie (née McKechnie), whom he had married at Camberwell Register Office. Marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice) and reputedly angered his parents despite the couple's later observance of Jewish religious tradition in a formal ceremony held at Central Synagogue, Hallam Street.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of two commercially available swab transport systems, Port-A-Cul (PAC; BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) and Anaerobic Specimen Collector (ASC; Becton Dickinson Vacutainer Systems, Rutherford, N. J.), {{in the recovery}} of organisms from clinical specimens was done. Fifteen abscesses were drained, and swabs of their contents {{were placed in the}} transport systems until they were inoculated for detection of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The swabs were plated immediately after collection and after delays of 4, 24, 48, and 72 h. A total of 70 bacterial isolates, 47 anaerobes and 23 aerobes, <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> from specimens inoculated immediately after collection. The survival of anaerobic bacteria was better in the PAC system than in the ASC system. This was evident as the length of delay in cultivation was extended. At 4 h, 46 anaerobic isolates <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in the PAC system, compared with 39 in the ASC system (P less than 0. 1). At 24 h, 45 isolates <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in the PAC system and 26 isolates <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in ASC (P less than 0. 001); at 48 h, 40 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in PAC and 15 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in ASC; and at 72 h, 32 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in PAC and 6 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in ASC. There were no differences between the systems in the recovery of aerobic bacteria. These data demonstrate the usefulness of the PAC system in the recovery of anaerobes and the need for quality control of all transport systems for anaerobic bacteria...|$|R
