This was at a low point in U.S.-Sudanese relations, particularly over the latter country's sponsorship of terror and the harboring of Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden. Black oversaw the collection of human intelligence on terrorist cells and support structures, and {{toward the end of}} his tenure, he was targeted <b>by</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> for assassination {see Woodward, Bush At War, p.9}.

25|$|The United States was {{attacked}} on September 11, 2001 <b>by</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> terrorists who hijacked commercial airliners and crashed them in coordinated strikes into both {{towers of the}} World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and its target was likely a prominent building in Washington, D.C., most probably either the Capitol Building or the White House. Within three hours of {{the start of the}} first hijacking and two hours after American Airlines Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center, Rumsfeld raised the defense condition signaling of the United States offensive readiness to DEFCON 3, the highest it had been since the Arab-Israeli war in 1973.|$|E

5000|$|Chile {{was elected}} a {{temporary}} {{member of the}} United Nations Security Council for 2003 and 2004, while Muñoz served as ambassador. Muñoz was chairman of a special UN committee on <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and Taliban sanctions, during which he noted a reluctance by many countries to cooperate in reporting names and information to the committee and in acting on information received by the committee. He was troubled <b>by</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda's</b> continued ability to circumvent sanctions, which he said [...] "need more teeth". In January 2004, Muñoz served as the President of the Security Council. He also headed up a panel to investigate the death of Benazir Bhutto {{at the request of}} Secretary General Ban in response to a petition for said inquiry by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari.

In a calm voice, California-native Gadahn told Muslims {{it is easy to}} get weapons from gun shows and carry out random attacks. He said: 'America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. In one section of the video the logos of Exxon, Merrill Lynch and Bank of America are shown as possible targets.|$|R
2500|$|Clarke {{wrote in}} Against All Enemies {{that in the}} summer of 2001, the {{intelligence}} community was convinced of an imminent attack <b>by</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> but could not get the attention of {{the highest levels of the}} Bush administration, most famously writing that Director of the Central Intelligence Agency George Tenet was running around with his [...] "hair on fire".|$|E

2500|$|Al-Awlaki {{was known}} {{among other things}} for having spoken with three of the September 11 hijackers in 2001, for having {{exchanged}} dozens of emails with the suspected Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan, he {{is believed to have}} met with Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab during his training <b>by</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> in the Arabian Peninsula, and for militant English-language online lectures and writings with violent rhetoric were a catalyst for a number of attacks. The New York Times described al-Awlaki as [...] "perhaps the most prominent English-speaking advocate of violent jihad against the United States." [...] Al-Awlaki was the first U.S. citizen killed by the CIA under a presidential decree.|$|E
5000|$|On October 12, 2011, the Charleston Post and Courier {{reported}} on memos from E.P.

5000|$|With {{money from}} {{extortion}} dwindling {{in areas like}} Mogadishu, defections {{in the face of}} AMISOM forces, among other internal issues, Al-Shabaab is turning to other militant Islamic groups for support. Al Shabaab has declared their support to bolster their numbers, and has made a number of strategic operational ties to both <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and AQAP in Yemen. In some cases Al Shabaab has begun flying the Al Qeada-Iraq banner at some of its rallies to demonstrate solidarity with the group. There are signs that Al-Shabaab militants are learning from <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda's</b> propaganda methods. [...] "Shabaab's propaganda has increasingly been slicked up to resemble messages produced <b>by</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda's</b> 'As-Sahab' ('The Clouds') media wing and AQAP's Inspire magazine, including the release of rap songs by Omar Hammami." [...] It is unclear how the death of AQAP leader Anwar al-Aulaqi and others has affected this bourgeoning relationship between the two. As is evident by their merger with Hizb-ul-Islam in December 2010, Al-Shabaab is turning to former rivals for assistance as their numbers decrease due to defections and casualties directly resulting from battles with AMISOM forces.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, {{a wealthy}} {{dissident}} Saudi Islamist, Osama Bin Laden, declared a fatwa {{calling for the}} killing of [...] "Americans and their allies -- civilians and military... in any country {{in which it is}} possible to do it" [...] in order to bring to an end the ongoing enforcement of the blockade against Iraq and presence of US troops in the Arabian Peninsula, thus bringing Australians into the line of fire in what would latterly grow to be defined as the War on Terror. Following the 11 September terrorist attacks <b>by</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> in 2001, [...] On 14 September 2001, the Australian Government cited the terrorist attacks against the US as sufficient basis for invoking the mutual-defence clauses of the ANZUS Treaty. This {{was the first time the}} Treaty's clauses on acting to meet a common danger had been invoked since it was enacted in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000 and 2001, he {{traveled}} to Europe and the United States to help gather support for the anti-Taliban movement. [...] "Massoud and Karzai warned the United States that the Taliban were connected with al Qaeda {{and that there was}} a plot for an imminent attack on the United States, but their warnings went unheeded. On September 9, 2001, two days before the 9/11 attacks in America, Massoud was assassinated <b>by</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> agents in a suicide bombing." [...] As the U.S. Armed Forces were preparing for a confrontation with the Taliban in September 2001, Karzai began urging NATO states to purge his country of al-Qaeda. He told BBC [...] "These Arabs, together with their foreign supporters and the Taliban, destroyed miles and miles of homes and orchards and vineyards... They have killed Afghans. They have trained their guns on Afghan lives... We want them out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1999, Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, Bahaji, and bin al-Shibh {{decided to}} travel to Chechnya {{to fight against the}} Russians, but were {{convinced}} by Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi at the last minute to change their plans. They instead traveled to Afghanistan over a two-week period in late November. On November 29, 1999, Mohamed Atta boarded Turkish Airlines Flight TK1662 from Hamburg to Istanbul, where he changed to flight TK1056 to Karachi, Pakistan. After they arrived, they were selected <b>by</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> leader Abu Hafs as suitable candidates for the [...] "planes operation" [...] plot. They were all well-educated, had experience of living in western society, along with some English skills, and would be able to obtain visas. Even before bin al-Shibh had arrived, Atta, Shehhi, and Jarrah were sent to the House of Ghamdi near bin Laden’s home in Kandahar, where he was waiting to meet them. Bin Laden asked them to pledge loyalty and commit to suicide missions, which Atta and the other three Hamburg men all accepted. Bin Laden sent them to see Mohammed Atef to get a general overview of the mission, and then they were sent to Karachi to see Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to go over specifics.|$|E

[...] Russ Travers said in the CIA in-house journal that in five years [...] "intelligence failure is inevitable". In 1997 the CIA's new director George Tenet would promise a new working agency by 2002. The CIA's surprise at India's detonation of an atom bomb was a failure at almost every level. After the 1998 embassy bombings <b>by</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> the CIA offered two targets to be hit in retaliation. One of them was the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, where traces of chemical weapon precursors had been detected. In the aftermath it was concluded that [...] "the decision to target al Shifa continues a tradition of operating on inadequate intelligence about Sudan." [...] It triggered the CIA to make [...] "substantial and sweeping changes" [...] to prevent [...] "a catastrophic systemic intelligence failure."

2500|$|Her writing {{during this}} period has been criticised by Middle-east scholar Edward Said for the anti-Islamic bias in her writing. In his book Covering Islam Said stated that Miller's book God Has Ninety-Nine Names [...] "is like a {{textbook}} of the inadequacies and distortions of media coverage of Islam." [...] He criticised her poor grasp of Arabic, saying that [...] "nearly every time she tries to impress us with her ability to say a phrase or two in Arabic she unerringly gets it wrong... They are the crude mistakes committed by a foreigner who neither has care nor... respect for her subject." [...] He concludes, [...] "she fears and dislikes Lebanon, hates Syria, laughs at Libya, dismisses Sudan, feels sorry for and a little alarmed by Egypt and is repulsed by Saudi Arabia. She hasn't bothered to learn the language and is relentlessly only concerned with the dangers of Islamic militancy, which, I would hazard a guess, accounts for less than 5 percent of the billion-strong Islamic world." [...] However, Miller asserted that {{in the wake of}} the September 11 attacks she argued that militant Islamism of he type represented <b>by</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> had peaked and was fading into insignificance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} morning, Malone is {{visited by}} General George S.

Malone later sees George Washington (Jon Voight) who gives a passionate speech about God's gift of freedom and the price many people pay for others to have it. Malone is visited by the angel of death (Trace Adkins), who takes him to a future Los Angeles completely taken over by radical Islamists. He is then taken to the ruins of his hometown in Michigan, which has been destroyed by a nuclear bomb planted <b>by</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda.</b> In a mortuary, Malone learns {{that he will be}} killed in this attack, leaving nothing behind but his trademark hat and [...] "big ass." [...] Facing his death, Malone pleads for his life with the Angel, promising to change. However, all is not well after Malone's revelation, for Aziz, a Middle Easterner he had interviewed, is actually a terrorist who will bomb a 4 July rally along with his underlings Ahmed and Fayed. However, when Fayed and Ahmed learn {{they are going to be}} detonated along with the planned bomb, they figure their slim chance of survival is by seeking out Malone.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the process <b>by</b> which <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> has sought to co-opt {{essentially}} localized struggles in Southeast Asia into an evolving network of worldwide jihad. The article illustrates how, long before it was appropriate to speak of an entity called <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> Islamists have been thinking transnationally since the 1980 s. The argument attempts to piece together available evidence to reveal a plausible explanation of the origins, growth and direction of the main Islamist grouping in Southeast Asia, Jemaah Islamiyah, and its deepening relationship with <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda.</b> The article suggests that the roots of a Southeast Asian terror network can be traced to two geographically separate ethno-religious struggles in the Philippines and Indonesia. The analysis demonstrates that these guerrilla groups orchestrating their distinct struggles were eventually combined through the auspices of <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> and the globalized franchising opportunities it exploited from the early 1990 s...|$|R
