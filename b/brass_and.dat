5|$|The {{movement}} {{begins with}} and is regularly visited by a broad, ceremonial and somewhat pompous melody (D), played on <b>brass</b> <b>and</b> woodwind. In between these formal-sounding statements are a cheerful cornet solo and various elaborations and {{variations on the}} Kijé theme, which together give the movement a celebratory feel, both boisterous and sentimental.|$|E
5|$|Carey also {{requested}} that the Sounders have their own marching band, {{the first of its}} kind in MLS. This led to the creation of the Sound Wave, a 53-member marching band consisting of <b>brass</b> <b>and</b> marching percussion. The band plays music from multiple genres, such as Latin, rock and pop, and sits on the north end of CenturyLink Field. The March to the Match, in which fans march from Occidental Park to CenturyLink Field before each home match, has been accompanied by the Sound Wave.|$|E
5|$|Casting metalware in Chamba is {{an ancient}} tradition, {{dating back to the}} Bronze Age period, with items {{typically}} made out of copper or <b>brass,</b> <b>and</b> also iron, especially in the traditional making of implements and weapons by blacksmiths. Of particular note in this trade are the large plaques with reliefs, commonly used for wall decoration. The temple cupolas in Chamba district are often furnished with copper and brass items made in Chamba and often the golden kalasha or vessel crowning them is produced here.|$|E

5|$|Hawkes & Son (later Rivière & Hawkes), a rival to Boosey & Company, {{was founded}} in 1865 by William Henry Hawkes selling orchestral sheet music. The company also made musical {{instruments}} and spare parts such as clarinet reeds, and by 1925 Hawkes had set up an instrument factory in Edgware, North London. The business, which was particularly known for <b>brass</b> <b>and</b> military band music, was eventually inherited by Ralph Hawkes (1898–1950).|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as <b>brass</b> <b>and</b> bronze, to improve {{machinability}} and for its lubricating qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving machinability. Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{was established in}} 1978 by Humphrey Burton, Walter Todds and Roy Tipping, {{former members of the}} BBC Television Music Department. Michael Hext, a trombonist, was the inaugural winner. In 1994, the usage of percussion instruments was first permitted, alongside the existing keyboard, string, <b>brass</b> <b>and</b> woodwind categories. Since its introduction, the allowance of percussion instruments has increased interest in the competition among young people. The competition has five stages, which consist of regional auditions, category auditions, category finals, semi-finals and the final. The biennial competition is managed and produced by BBC Cymru Wales.|$|E

5|$|The fort was {{initially}} commanded by Captain James Crane, with a garrison of ten men, including his second in command, a porter, six gunners and two soldiers. As time went on, {{not all of}} the gunners worked full-time at the fort, some living and working in the town itself.

5|$|The orchestra's loss of {{manpower}} was far {{worse in the}} Second World War than in the First.

The orchestra found replacements wherever it could, including the bands of army regiments based in London, whose <b>brass</b> <b>and</b> woodwind players were unofficially recruited.|$|E

George Hutchinson has a prominent wall memorial in the chancel in addition to his tomb outside; local sculptor Richard Joanes designed it, and there are Coade stone embellishments. Other carved tablets, such as those to Reverend Lewin and Nicholas Spencer, are by obscure London-based mid-19th-century sculptor T. Marsh.|$|E

5|$|Beyond architecture, Burges {{designed}} metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, {{furniture and}} stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, {{a series of}} lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, <b>brass</b> <b>and</b> iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. However the revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century {{has led to a}} renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.|$|E
5|$|Flood was They Might Be Giants' first {{release on}} any major label. Elektra Records {{approached}} the band following the unexpected {{success of their}} second album, Lincoln, which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was {{largely due to the}} work of Susan Drew, an A worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability {{to take advantage of the}} label's strategies and resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by many guest musicians on <b>brass</b> <b>and</b> string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the drums for the album.|$|E
5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, <b>brass,</b> <b>and</b> miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; {{the fingers of his}} right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
