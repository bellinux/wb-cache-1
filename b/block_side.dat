40|$|Skin {{potential}} activities (SPA) {{were used}} to assess the degree of sympathetic blockade after stellate ganglion block (SGB). The SPA were recorded bilaterally from the palmar thenar eminences in four outpatients before and after SGB. Before the SGB, the skin potential responses (SPR) on both sides were synchronous and their amplitudes were almost the same. After SGB, the SPR amplitude on the <b>blocked</b> <b>side</b> gradually fell from 1 - 2 minutes. Before SGB, the skin potential levels (SPL) on both sides were parallel and the lateral difference was constant. About 1 - 2 minutes after SGB, the SPL on the <b>blocked</b> <b>side</b> began to fall and then reached a stationary level 5 minutes after SGB. SPA variations due to factors other than peripheral blockade can be cancelled by bilateral recording. Thus, the net SPL decrease on the <b>blocked</b> <b>side</b> compared with that on the non-blocked side was proved to be a useful index for continuous, quantitative monitoring of the sympathetic blockade by the SGB...|$|R

The Standards had short rattan benches arranged in both transverse (forward- or rear-facing) and longitudinal (sideways-facing) positions. Two to three people could fit comfortably on each bench. This gave each rider more legroom and personal space. Supplemental seats located by each side door could be folded down for rider use at a conductor's discretion. When lowered, these seats would <b>block</b> <b>side</b> door leaves, so they were protected by lock to ensure only a conductor could lower them. Under regular conditions, 78 seats were available for riders in each car. During the 1950s, many (but not all) of the rattan seats were replaced by sprung leather or a plastic compound (velon) that replicated the feel of rattan.|$|E

40|$|Oh, JinseiClinical {{conditions}} such as Horner's syndrome and conjunctival injection have conventionally been used post-treatment to evaluate stellate ganglion block (SGB). Recently, there have been occasional reports of using a perfusion index (PI) obtained using a pulse oximeter to evaluate improved peripheral blood flow. In this study, we investigated whether the PI value from the <b>blocked</b> <b>side</b> is useful in evaluating the effects of SGB following treatment. A pulse oximeter sensor {{was placed on the}} fingertip of a patient diagnosed with glossalgia, and after measuring the PI value to use as the control value, SGB was performed 10 times. PI values before and after the procedure were compared, and while the PI value fell significantly immediately following the procedure, it then rose significantly between 2 and 20 minutes after treatment, peaking at about the 5 -minute mark. In the post-SGB evaluation, {{conditions such}} as Horner's syndrome and conjunctival injection were acknowledged on the <b>blocked</b> <b>side.</b> SGB <b>blocks</b> the sympathetic nerves and increases the volume of blood flow in the head and neck, face, and extremitas thoracica of the affected side, improving peripheral circulation. Accordingly, the PI value, which is said to correlate with peripheral blood flow, can be considered useful in evaluating the effects of SGB. In this case, the PI value in the fingertips on the <b>blocked</b> <b>side</b> rose following the SGB, peaking at approximately the 5 -minute mark, clearly indicating increased peripheral blood flow from the initial phase after the SGB. The PI value was therefore considered useful in evaluating the effects of SGB...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} differences in swimming track start performances using side handle and front handle grip techniques and using an inclined platform at the rear of the starting platform. An instrumented starting block system was designed to allow front grip and side grip starting techniques and inclusion of a rear incline. Thirty male and 20 female junior elite swimmers completed three starts in each of four start block configurations: (1) Flat (traditional) block, front handle grip; (2) Flat (traditional) <b>block,</b> <b>side</b> handle grip; (3) Incline (new) block, front handle grip; (4) Incline (new) <b>block,</b> <b>side</b> handle grip. Force and video data were used to quantify parameters related to starting performance. Results indicated that use of side handles had a substantial impact on start performance while the effects of the rear incline were less pronounced. Compared to using a front grip technique, use of the side handles increased horizontal velocity at takeoff up to 18 %, resulted in a more horizontal takeoff angle by up to 2 °, increased contribution to horizontal impulse from arms up to 12 %, increased peak horizontal power up to 28 %, decreased time to 6 m by 4 % and increased velocity at 6 m by 2. 5 %.

The principal variables studied were lubricant viscosity which was varied {{from less than}} 100 to over 76, 000 SUS at 100 deg F and the diametral clear-ance between the follower block and the Extrusion cylinder which ranged from 0. 0005 to 0. 0030 in. for the 1. 026 in. dia. cylinder. The specimen diameter was 0. 97 or 1. 00 in. cor-responding to an extrusion ratio of 4. 75 or 5. 00, respectively. The included die angle was either 60 deg or 90 deg. The results show that with a proper combination of the lubricant Viscosity and the fol-lower block clearance, hydrostatic extrusion can be accomplished without the necessity of any sealing of the container on the follower <b>block</b> <b>side.</b> The optimum clearance for minimum breakthrough pressure increases as the lubricant viscosity increases.

Near infrared spectroscopy reflects an increased blood volume and allows continuous, non-invasive, and bedside monitoring of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO 2). We investigated the influence of SGB on bilateral cerebral oxygenation using a near infrared spectroscopy. Methods: SGB was performed on 30 patients with 1 % lidocaine 10 ml using a paratracheal technique at the C 6 level and confirmed by the presence of Horner's syndrome. The blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and rSO 2 were measured before SGB and 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes after SGB. Tympanic temperature of each ear was measured prior to SGB and 20 minutes after SGB. Results: The increments of the rSO 2 on the <b>block</b> <b>side</b> from the baseline were statistically significant at 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes.

Materials and Methods: Fifty simulated curved canals were prepared in acrylic blocks (five groups; n = 10 each). In three groups, the canals were preflared with Gates-Glidden drills and the apical stop was prepared with # 25, 30 or 35 Flexofile files. In the other two groups, the canals were prepared with ProTaper rotary instruments and the apical stop was prepared with F 1 and F 2. A CH paste was injected into the canals using a special syringe. The four sides of the blocks were scanned with the root curvature to the mesial, buccal, distal and palatal faces. The amount (%) of filling in the total canal area and in the apical 5 mm was obtained [analysis of variance (ANOVA); Tukey′s test; α = 0. 05].

Two well-known CFD tools, i. e., FDS 6. 0. 1 and ANSYS FLUENT 14, are used for mutual verification. The smoke pattern in tunnel without blockage is studied as a benchmark and the proposed semi-transverse smoke control system can maintain tenable conditions for safe egress. The scenarios with blockages of 2 m and 4 m high are studied respectively. The simulation results demonstrate the presence of blockage significantly changes the flow pattern in tunnel. The bulk mass flow rates are reduced from the <b>blocked</b> <b>side</b> while increased from the unblocked side. The unbalanced airflow drives more smoke to the <b>blocked</b> <b>side</b> and makes this side impassable for evacuation within a few minutes. The scenarios with symmetric blockages of the same heights are further studied for comparison and smoke is well confined within the defined smoke zone. Tentative simulations are conducted to improve the environment in tunnel by increasing the smoke extraction rate.

In this study, new experimental method was employed for strain determination in the surrounding area of the axially loaded dental implant, which was embedded in the resin block. This studies can improve understanding of strain distribution, and its possible effects on the surrounding structure. Dental Implant Branemark with dimensions of 14 x 3. 75 mm was immersed into rectangular block of polymethil methacrylate in vertical position. Implant was distanced 2 mm and 4 mm from the block sides, and they were named as the surface 1 and surface 2, respectively. Axial load, in the range of 0 - 500 N, was applied using Universal testing machine Tinius Olsen. Digital Image Correlation method was used for measuring deformation. Results were presented in the form of horizontal and vertical strains. Horizontal strains were mostly tensile, with maximum value of 0. 3 % on the bottom of the surface 1. This values decreased in the upper area of the <b>block</b> <b>side.</b> Vertical compressive strain were 2 - 3 times higher on the surface 1, when compared to the surface 2, with maximum values of 0. 7 % located on the bottom of the surface 1, and 0. 3 % on the bottom of the surface 2. Resin block models could be used for determination of strain distribution under axially loaded implants. Greatest strain concentration were located under the implants apex, in the bottom area of the block.

40|$|Contact {{antimicrobial}} coatings with poly-alkylammonium compositions {{have been}} a subject of increasing interest {{in part because of}} the contribution of biocide release coatings to antibiotic resistance. Herein, a concept for antimicrobial coatings is developed based on thermodynamically driven surface concentration of soft <b>block</b> <b>side</b> chains. The concept incorporates structural and compositional guidance from naturally occurring antimicrobial proteins and achieves compositional economy via a polymer surface modifier (PSM). For this purpose, polyurethanes having P[AB] co-polyoxetane soft blocks, where A is a surface active (fluorous) or PEG-like side chain and B represents a desired function (alkylammonium) were prepared. Specifically, poly(2, 2 -substituted- 1, 3 -propylene oxide) ran-co-telechelics with bromobutoxymethyl (CH 2 O(CH 2) 4 Br) and either trifluoroethoxymethyl (3 FOx, -CH 2 OCH 2 CF 3)) or PEG-like (2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) ethoxy) methyl (ME 2 Ox, (-CH 2 (OCH 2 CH 2) 2 OCH 3)) side chains were prepared via cationic ring opening polymerization. Characterization utilized 1 H NMR spectroscopy, temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Molecular weights (Mn) by 1 H NMR end group analysis were 6000 - 8000 g/mole. Bromobutoxymethyl groups were completely substituted with N,N-dimethylalkyl amines to obtain alkylammonium co-telechelics. Two alkyl ammonium chain lengths, six carbons (C 6) and twelve carbons (C 12) were used. Tgs of bromobutoxymethyl co-telechelics were - 68 degrees C and - 48 degrees C for ME 2 Ox and 3 FOx, respectively. Tgs remained low after amine substitution.
