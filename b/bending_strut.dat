By the time the problem had been identified and rectified by the substitution of the front struts by more conventional wishbones (which was subsequently offered as a factory modification to all 17 owners), it was all too late and racing had moved on.|$|R

The cellular BMGs exhibited remarkable energy absorption capacity {{as compared with}} reported BMG foams and honeycombs. The enhanced energy absorption capability is attributed to the large plastic <b>bending</b> of the <b>struts,</b> the blunting of the cracks, and the large plastic deformation at the nodes. This work shows that, in cellular BMGs, the macroscopic cellular structures are more efficient in dissipating mechanical energy than microscopic cellular structures, opening a window for developing energy absorption devices using BMGs.

50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} composites, {{which typically}} fail catastrophically, RCCM fail incrementally {{because of the}} non-linear deformation phase and the multiplicity of joints and links. These results matched finite-element simulations with finely-meshed rigid body models. In addition to convergence to the observed coordinated buckling mode, these simulations accurately predict the relative strength scaling observed in load test experiments. These {{results are consistent with}} the observation that open-cell lattice materials fail through micro-structural <b>strut</b> <b>bending</b> failures with σmax ∝. The simulations also suggest that the coordinated buckling phenomenon as well as the modulus measurements are not dominated by edge effects, with minimal influence on overall results beyond characteristic lengths exceeding several units.|$|R
40|$|Ground {{improvement}} {{methods are}} commonly adopted in deep excavation to minimize wall deflection, wall <b>bending</b> moment and <b>strut</b> force. In this thesis {{a different approach}} to the application of ground improvement techniques is analyzed {{in the form of a}} parametric study developed with the use of a commercial finite element code. A new remedial ground improvement solution applied to an existing deep excavation located in Singapore and part of the Circle Line Project (CCL) for the construction of a new subway line is considered and computationally modeled. The soil profile in the site mainly consists of deep marine soft clay dated for the most part in the Holocene period, principally characterized by a normally to very low overconsolidation ratio, in some location even underconsolidated. The parametric analysis aims to evaluate short-term effects of the application of cementing agents to the lower portion of the marine clay externally to the excavation side. The effectiveness of the proposed ground improvement is examined using a finite element model corresponding to a key cross-section of CCL 1 project. (cont.) Parametric analyses are used to assess how the dimensions of the treatment zone and strength of soilcrete columns affect the computed wall deflections, <b>bending</b> moments and <b>strut</b> loads. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in controlling the structural behavior of the excavation support system. The same method is then used to simulate the retrofit of the partially excavated section. The results show it is possible for an external ground treatment to control wall deflections and bending moments and reduce strut loads. The thesis finally discuss the practical advantages of the solution and its limitations. by Alessia Alexandra Ferrari. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about the {{characterization}} of the microstructure of several aluminium foams {{and its relation to}} the failure behavior of these materials under monotonic tension and fatigue. Due to the production processes brittle inclusions are present in the microstructure of the foams investigated. Because damage is introduced before the peak strain, which is the strain at the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), the peak strain and the UTS depend on the particular damage evolution before the peak strain. To monitor the damage evolution the electrical resistance and acoustic emission was measured during tensile tests. Brittle fracture increases the rate of damage accumulation and therefore decreases the peak strain and UTS. For decreasing relative densities below 5. 5 %, more bending and less stretching of struts decreases the damage accumulation and therefore increases the peak strain and UTS of Duocel open cell aluminium 6101 foam. Above 5. 5 % relative density annealing the foam samples or orienting the long axis of the elliptical cells transverse to the loading direction, in stead of longitudinal, has the same effect. For Replicated open cell aluminium 6101 foam densities below 5. 5 %, the increase in <b>bending</b> of <b>struts</b> results in the ability to shift deformation from a highly strained and damaged band to another band, thereby increasing the peak strain and UTS. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical investigation {{was conducted to}} determine which characteristics of a light aircraft landing gear influence gear dynamic behavior significantly. The investigation focused particularly on possible modification for load control. Pseudostatic tests were conducted to determine the gear fore-and-aft spring constant, axial friction {{as a function of}} drag load, brake pressure-torque characteristics, and tire force-deflection characteristics. To study dynamic tire response, vertical drops were conducted at impact velocities of 1. 2, 1. 5, and 1. 8 m/s onto a level surface; to determine axial-friction effects, a second series of vertical drops were made at 1. 5 m/s onto surfaces inclined 5 deg and 10 deg to the horizontal. An average dynamic axial-friction coefficient of 0. 15 was obtained by comparing analytical data with inclined surface drop test data. Dynamic <b>strut</b> <b>bending</b> and associated axial friction were found to be severe for the drop tests on the 10 deg surface...|$|R
40|$|To brake in minimum distance, {{the tire}} slip must be {{controlled}} {{to ride the}} peak of the mu-slip curve so that maximum ground force is developed between tire and pavement. The resulting control system differs from antiskid systems which react to impending wheel lockup. A simplified model is presented to permit development of a sound control strategy. Liapunov techniques are used to derive a peak riding adaptive controller applicable to each wheel of a breaking vehicle. The controller is applied to a more sophisticated model of a braking airplane with <b>strut</b> <b>bending</b> dynamics included. Simulation results verify the peak riding property of the controller and the rapid adaption of the controller to extreme runway conditions. The effect of actuator dynamics, perturbation frequency, type and location of sensors, absence of a free wheel, and a method in which the pilot's braking commands can be interfaced with the peak riding system are also considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study is}} presented {{of the mechanical}} properties of low-density open-cell polymer foams subjected to large deformations. The foams are modelled as three-dimensional frameworks of slender struts. Regular as well as random foams are analyzed, where the latter are generated using the Voronoi technique. The macroscopic mechanical properties are determined for various types of struts properties through unit-cell analyses containing many foam cells per unit-cell. The computations make use of standard Finite Element (FE) techniques. <b>Bending</b> of the <b>struts</b> dominates the mechanical foam response at low strains. Axial deformation of the struts becomes the dominant mechanism at larger tensile strains. Strut buckling becomes the main mechanism at larger compressive strains, and causes {{a significant decrease in}} load carrying capacity of the foam. The large strain mechanical behavior of foams is found to be dependent on the weakest cross-section of the foam appearing in the random foam structure, the so-called "minimum effective cross-section". The minimum effective cross-section determines the tangential foam modulus at large tensile strains. Regular foam structures have a uniform unit-cell cross-section and, as a result, a higher minimum effective cross-section than regular foam structures and, therefore, a higher tangent modulus in the large strain range. ...|$|R
40|$|Tensile {{tests have}} been {{performed}} on replicated aluminum alloy foams of relative density between 4. 5 % and 8 %. During the test the electrical resistance was measured with a four-point set-up and the displacements along the gage section were measured using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Right {{from the start of}} the tensile test, the strain as observed at the surface with DIC is not uniformly distributed over the sample, but concentrates in bands; this is attributed to density variations. The peak strain, i. e. the strain at the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), increases with decreasing density for densities below 5. 5 %. For densities above 5. 5 % fracture occurs in the band with the highest strain, yielding a roughly constant peak strain (near 1. 5 %). Resistivity data indicate an increased contribution of <b>strut</b> <b>bending</b> compared to stretching for densities below 5. 5 %, causing a decreased rate of damage accumulation and an increase in the tolerance to damage. Incremental strain maps show that the increased damage tolerance in the low-density samples allows initially formed deformation bands to harden resulting in multiple bands to be involved in the fracture process.

40|$|Open-cell Ni foams {{are mainly}} used as battery electrodes. The very large {{specific}} {{surface of the}} INCOFOAM pure Ni foams also leads to outstanding filtration properties. A Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) application requires the alloying of the INCOFOAM material to improve the oxidation resistance and to provide thermal stability. For that purpose, a foam alloying route using powder metallurgy was developed by INCO and IFAM (patent number: DE 103 01 175. 7). The alloyed foams designed for the DPF application are named INCOFOAM HighTemp. The typical alloy composition of the foams studied in this work is that of Inconel 625. The objective {{of the work is}} to provide tools for the design of DPF considering critical aspects of the life-time of a real filter, from its manufacturing to the in service conditions. The manufacturing of complex filter shapes can induce damage in the foam that could affect the durability of the filter component. Creep in the filter is likely to start during high temperature regeneration regime. A predictive model for tensile properties for both Ni and alloyed foams is presented. It assumes that the <b>bending</b> of the <b>struts</b> is the main deformation mechanism in the foam. A simplified morphology is deduced from 3 D reconstruction of microtomography of Ni foams, 2 D image analysis and electrical resistivity measurements. Creep of alloyed foams is also investigated in this work. Two creep mechanisms are evidenced from the experimental point of view and we confronted an existing model to a large experimental data set of alloyed foams creep measurements. The proposed model describes better high temperature creep than low temperature creep. A 3 D investigation of microtomographic foam images with the Finite Elements Method is finally used in order to assess the assumptions of the models presented before...|$|R
40|$|Fibrous {{materials}} are promising {{for a wide}} range of engineering applications due to their low density and high stiffness and strength. Stochastic filamentous networks can be widely found in biomaterials at the micro- and nano-scales. The objective of this study is to investigate the mechanical properties of macro-sized, micro-sized and nano-sized stochastic fibrous networks with cross-linking. A continuum mechanics-based three-dimensional periodic beam model has been developed to describe stochastic fibrous materials by the Finite Element Method (FEM). Relative density is a key parameter to elucidate the mechanical properties of porous fibrous materials. The relative density of the beam model developed in this study can be adjusted by changing the concentration of the cross-linker, the fibre aspect ratio and the coefficient of overlap. In general, the non-dimensional Young’s moduli and shear moduli increase with increasing relative density. The simulation and analytical model have suggested that <b>strut</b> <b>bending</b> is the dominant deformation mechanism for stochastic fibrous materials. Based on the total strain energy density, scalar measures of characteristic stress and strain have been applied to reveal the yielding of stochastic fibrous materials. The effect of relative density on uniaxial yield strength of stochastic fibrous materials shows a quadratic function in the x direction and a cubic function in the z direction. When the dimensions of fibrous structures are reduced to the micro- or nano-scale, the stiffness is much different from that of their macro-sized counterparts. Strain gradient effects at the micro-meter scale, and the surface elasticity and initial stress effects at the nano-meter scale have been incorporated into the deformation mechanism of fibrous materials. For both of the micro- and nano-sized fibrous structure, the smaller the diameter, the larger the non-dimensional Young’s moduli and shear moduli. Generally speaking, the dimensionless stiffness of nano-sized stochastic fibrous structures is larger than their micro-sized counterparts. The size-dependent effects investigated in this study could provide good reference points for scientists in tissue engineering and serve as a guide in the design of MEMS and NEMS...|$|R

H 577 P ISE 2015 Chenxxv, 217 leaves :illustrations; 30 cmDue to the non-ordered atomic arrangements, bulk {{metallic}} glasses (BMGs) exhibit unique properties, {{such as high}} corrosion resistance, excellent mechanical performances and attractive processing potential. One of the key issues of BMGs is the room-temperature brittleness, especially under tensile loading. Over the past three decades, much effort {{has been devoted to}} improve the global room-temperature plasticity of BMGs, and great achievements have been made by optimizing compositions, fabricating composite micro/nano-structures and introducing geometric confinements. However, these studies mainly focus on the deformation behaviour of BMGs under uniformly distributed stress states. In practical applications of structural materials, they are seldom subject to uniform stress distributions (either under compression or tension), but are mostly under complex stress states. In this work, the prime aim is to shed light on the deformation behaviour of BMGs under complex stress states and give insights into the deformation mechanisms of macroscopic BMG structures. The effect of stress gradients on the deformation behaviour of BMGs has initially been examined using three-point bending tests. The results have shown that both compressive and tensile stress gradients are able to improve the plastic deformation behaviour of BMGs, which have further been validated by examining and comparing the fracture surface features under different stress states. Subsequently, by designing Z-shaped specimens with stress gradients, we have achieved some tensile axial elongations in monolithic BMGs. It is demonstrated that the stress concentration areas of the BMG specimens facilitate the formation of shear bands and the presence of "soft" and { 212040 }hard regions due to the stress gradient confines the propagation. Thereafter, by tailoring a complex stress distribution on curved BMG specimens, for the first time, tunable large axial elongations have been achieved in these BMG structural elements under tensile loading, resulting from the controllable plastic deformation in localized regions and the straightening of the curved segments. With the designed complex stress distribution, the deformation process of the curved part in the BMG structural elements has been found to consist of three stages, i. e., the shear band initiation stage (stage I), the shear band multiplication stage (stage II) and the final rapid fracture stage (stage III). With uniformly distributed stresses, the conventional tensile specimens fracture (stage III) catastrophically after stage I. However, in the curved specimen, the complex stress distributions result in not only more stable shearing processes in stage I, but also the evolution of stage II before stage III, which causes the formation {{of a large number of}} shear bands. These findings suggest that although the tensile BMG specimens exhibit brittle behaviour under a uniform stress state, large plastic deformation in localized regions could be achieved by controlling the complex stress distributions. The controllable geometries provide a feasible route for further understanding the deformation mechanisms of BMGs under more complex stress states, and for designing macroscopic BMG structures in potentially structural applications. To uncover the deformation mechanisms of BMG structures, compression tests on five BMG structural elements have been carried out. The findings reveal three different types of deformation modes in the designed BMG struts, which can be regarded as three fundamental deformation modes in macroscopic BMG structures. Thereafter, a series of cellular BMGs with remarkable energy absorption capacity have been designed and examined under compressive testing. The greatly enhanced energy absorption capacity is due to the large plastic <b>bending</b> of the <b>struts,</b> the blocking of the crack tips and the severe plastic deformation at the nodes. Analytical analysis capturing the effect of the strut thickness and the number of unit cells on the deformation behaviour of the cellular BMGs has been conducted and discussed. The findings have demonstrated that the designed macroscopic cellular structures are more efficient in dissipating mechanical energy than the microscopic cellular structures. The achievement of high energy absorption capacity in cellular BMGs provides a valuable guidance on designing cellular BMGs for energy absorption applications.
