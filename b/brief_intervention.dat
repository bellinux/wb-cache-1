A <b>brief</b> <b>intervention</b> in 1137–1138 by the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus, who wished to assert imperial suzerainty over all the crusader states, did nothing to stop the threat of Zengi; in 1139 Damascus and Jerusalem recognized the severity of the threat to both states, and an alliance was concluded which halted Zengi's advance. Fulk used this time to construct numerous castles, including Ibelin and Kerak. After the death of both Fulk and Emperor John in separate hunting accidents in 1143, Zengi invaded and conquered Edessa in 1144. Queen Melisende, now regent for her elder son Baldwin III, appointed a new constable, Manasses of Hierges, to head the army after Fulk's death, but Edessa could not be recaptured, despite Zengi's own assassination in 1146. The fall of Edessa shocked Europe, and a Second Crusade arrived in 1148.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Two recent {{reviews of}} the {{evidence}} on <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> in the alcohol field reach highly favourable conclusions regarding their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. However, both can be criticized on three grounds: (1) they pay insufficient regard to important differences within the family of brief interventions; (2) they do not sufficiently emphasize the crucial distinction between <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> among treatment seekers and non-treatment seekers; and (3) they arrive at over-optimistic and uncritical conclusions. While not wishing to dampen enthusiasm for the potential of <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> in reducing alcohol-related harm, the present article argues that, if the evidence {{is not to be}} misinterpreted by policy makers and purchasers of services, differences between <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> must be borne in mind and analyses of effectiveness in the treatment-seeking population must be clearly separated from those in the area of opportunistic interventions in the non-treatment-seeking population. The evidence for the effectiveness of opportunistic <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> is much stronger than for <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> in specialist settings for those seeking help, where their most prudent application should be restricted to patients with problems of relatively low severity...|$|R

40|$|Objective: to use realist {{evaluation}} {{to describe}} and explain how and in what circumstances screening and alcohol <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> work in routine antenatal care. Design: a realist evaluation incorporating systematic reviews and qualitative data. Setting: NHS Lothian, {{which is one of}} the 14 Scottish health boards. Participants: participants were recruited from two maternity units. In phase one, interviews were conducted with four participants responsible for policy implementation. These data were supported by two systematic reviews. In phase two, 17 pregnant women and 15 midwives participated in interviews, with a further six midwifery team leaders involved in a focus group. Findings: training and resources provided to midwives as part of the programme acted as facilitating mechanisms that improved their skills and confidence to screen and deliver alcohol <b>brief</b> <b>interventions.</b> The programme elicited positive change in attitudes to drinking in pregnancy and possibly stimulated drinking behaviour change amongst pregnant women. However, the small numbers of pregnant women being identified for alcohol <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> meant delivery was infrequent and resulted in the programme not working as anticipated. The findings also revealed contextual issues around midwife-pregnant woman relationship and the challenges of negotiating the timing of screening and alcohol <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> delivery. Conclusions: Drinking in pregnancy is an emotive issue, therefore delivering alcohol <b>brief</b> <b>interventions</b> at the first antenatal appointment when they are more likely to achieve the most benefits poses challenges.

The GASR has a broader remit that includes alcohol and solvent abuse cases, domestic violence and other offending behaviours. It does not replace other sentencing options but offers alternative pathways for selected offenders: the Court Supervision Regime which involves the offender being managed by a court management team for a period of four to six months whilst participating in rehabilitation programs; and the <b>Brief</b> <b>Intervention</b> Regime which also includes offender participation in rehabilitation programs but without the supervision of the court management team.|$|E
