25|$|Tooth {{whitening}} or tooth bleaching procedures {{attempt to}} lighten a tooth's color {{in either of}} two ways: by chemical or mechanical action. Working chemically, a <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> is used to carry out an oxidation reaction in the enamel and dentin. The agents most commonly used to intrinsically change the color of teeth are hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide. Oxygen radicals from the peroxide in the whitening agents contact the stains in the interprismatic spaces within the enamel layer. When this occurs, stains will be bleached and the teeth now appear lighter in color. Teeth not only appear whiter but also reflect light in increased amounts, which makes the teeth appear brighter as well. Studies show that whitening does not produce any ultrastructural or microhardness changes in the dental tissues.|$|E

2500|$|Chlorine is a {{relatively}} common gas in industry {{with a variety of}} uses. It is used to disinfect water as well as being a part of the sanitation process for sewage and industrial waste. Chlorine is also used as a <b>bleaching</b> <b>agent</b> during the production of paper and cloth. Many household cleaning products, including bleach, contain chlorine. Given the volume and ease of chlorine for industrial and commercial use, exposure could occur from an accidental spill or a deliberate attack. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that a person wear splash proof goggles, a face shield and a respirator mask when working in the vicinity of chlorine gas. Because chlorine is a gas at room temperature, most exposure occurs via inhalation. Exposure may also occur through skin or eye contact or by ingesting chlorine-contaminated food or water. Chlorine is a strong oxidizing element causing the hydrogen to split from water in moist tissue, resulting in nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride that cause corrosive tissue damage. Additionally oxidation of chlorine may form hypochlorous acid, which can penetrate cells and react with cytoplasmic proteins destroying cell structure. Chlorine’s odor provides early warning signs of exposure but causes olfactory fatigue or adaptations, reducing awareness of exposure at low concentrations. With increased exposure, symptoms may progress to labored respirations, severe coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and broncospasm associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation level[...] Severe exposure may result in [...] changes in upper and lower airways resulting in an acute lung injury, which may not be present until several hours after exposure. A recent chlorine gas leak in Pune, India, landed 20 individuals in the hospital. Though that was an accidental exposure, chlorine gas {{has been used as a}} weapon of warfare since World War I, most recently in 2007 in Iraq.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Discolored teeth can {{be treated}} by various techniques, {{including}} direct composite resin veneers, indirect porcelain veneers, ceramic crowns and <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of at-home and in-office <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> on the surface microhardness of one microhybrid (Point 4) and two nanofilled (Filtek Supreme and Premise) composite resins. Materials and methods: Opalescence PF with 20 % carbamide peroxide and Opalescence Quick with 35 % carbamide peroxide were used as at-home and in-office <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents,</b> respectively. Fifty samples from each composite resin, including Point 4 microhybrid, Premise and Filtek Supreme nanofilled composites resins were prepared and exposed to <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents.</b> For each composite resin the samples were randomly divided into five groups of 10 and designated as: control, two-week at-home, four-week at-home, one-time in-office and two-times in-office bleaching groups with two-week intervals. After the appropriate bleaching procedures on samples of each group, microhardness measurements were carried out on each sample. Data was analyzed using ANOVA and post hoc Tukey HSD test (p value < 0. 05). Results: There were significant differences in mean surface microhardness values of each composite resin type. No significant differences were observed in mean microhardness values of Point 4 between four-week at-home and one-time office, Filtek Supreme between two-week at-home and four-week at-home, and Premise between one-time in-office and two-time in-office bleaching groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of home-use <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> {{containing}} 10 % carbamide peroxide and 7. 5 % hydrogen peroxide on enamel microhardness and surface micromorphology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Enamel slabs (n= 10) received the <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> for 1 h/day and remained in artificial saliva solution for 23 h/day, during a total period of 21 days. Control group was composed of enamel slabs that were not subjected to treatment with the agents and were maintained in artificial saliva solution. Microhardness tests were performed before treatment application, 21 days of treatment and 14 days after the end of treatment. Scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed after 14 days after the end of bleaching treatment by 3 calibrated observers who attributed scores. RESULTS: The Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05) showed no significant differences in microhardness values among <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents,</b> at 21 days of treatment and a significant increase in microhardness for different agents after 14 days from the end of treatment. Fisher's exact test showed differences in micromorphology of enamel between control and experimental groups (p= 0. 0342).

40|$|Dental {{bleaching}} is {{a simple}} and conservative procedure for aesthetic restoration of vital and non-vital discolored teeth. Nevertheless, {{a number of studies}} have demonstrated the risk of tissue damage from the contact of these agents with the oral mucosa. In the current study, the genotoxic potential associated with exposure to dental <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> was assessed by the single cell gel (comet) assay in vitro. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in vitro were exposed to six commercial dental <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> (Clarigel Gold - Dentsply; Whitespeed - Discus Dental; Nite White - Discus Dental; Magic Bleaching - Vigodent; Whiteness HP - FGM and Lase Peroxide - DMC). The results pointed out that all dental <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> tested contributed to DNA damage as depicted by the mean tail moment, being the strongest effect observed with the highest dose of hydrogen peroxide (Whiteness HP and Lase peroxide, at a 35 % concentration). On the other hand, Magic Bleaching (Vigodent) induced the lowest level of DNA breakage. Negative and positive controls displayed absence and presence of DNA-damaging, respectively.

The buccal surfaces of 60 bovine incisors were restored with a composite resin and bonded with three- and two-step, etch-and-rinse, fluoride-containing adhesives, Optibond FL (FL) and Optibond Solo Plus (SP), respectively. Restored teeth were subjected to thermal cycling to age the interface. Both SP and FL adhesive-restored teeth were bleached (n = 10) with 10 % CP (CP) and 10 % CP + fluoride (CPF) or were left unbleached (control). Bleaching was performed for 14 days simultaneously with pH cycling, which comprised of 14 h of remineralization, 2 h of demineralization and 8 h of bleaching.

40|$|Objectives: There is some {{evidence}} that the pH at the root surface is reduced by intracoronal placement of bleaching pastes, which is known to enhance osteoclastic activity. Therefore, it is recommended that a protective barrier be used over the canal filling to prevent leakage of <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents.</b> Glass-ionomer (GI) is commonly used as a coronal barrier before nonvital bleaching. Because mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) creates high alkalinity after mixing with water, using MTA as a protective barrier over the canal filling may not only prevent leakage of <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> and microorganisms, but may prevent cervical resorption. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate sealing ability of white mineral trioxide aggregate (WMTA) as a coronal barrier before nonvital bleaching. Study design: Root canals of one hundred thirty human maxillary incisors were instrumented and filled with gutta-percha without sealer. Gutta-percha was removed up to 3 mm below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ). The teeth were randomly divided into six experimental groups of 20 teeth each and two control groups of 5. In three experimental groups, WMTA was packed into the canal to the level of CEJ. In the remaining experimental groups, glass-ionomer (GI) was used as a coronal barrier. After a 24 -hour incubation period, one of the following three <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> was placed in the access cavity of each of the WMTA or GI groups. These three <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> were 30 % hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate mixed with 30 % hydrogen peroxide, and sodium perborate mixed with distilled water. The <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> were replaced every 3 days for three times. In the positive controls, no coronal barrier was used. In the negative controls, all the tooth surfaces were covered by two layers of nail varnish. Microleakage was evaluated using protein leakage test. Statistical analyses were performed with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results: The experimental groups showed minimum leakage which was not significantly more than tha in the negative controls. There was no statistically significant difference in leakage between the experimental groups (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: This study indicated that different <b>bleaching</b> <b>agents</b> have no effect on sealing ability of WMTA. © Medicina Oral S. L...|$|R
