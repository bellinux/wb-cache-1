Almost all CNTs {{are found to be}} wetted by the non-polar NR but not by the other non-polar <b>rubber</b> like <b>BR</b> or weakly polar SBR. It was proposed that phospholipids, which are linked to the alpha-terminal of NR can interact with the CNT surface through cation-pi interactions forming strong bonding between NR and CNTs. Using the corrected surface tension value of NR, which involves the effect of phospholipids found in our previous work the selective wetting of CNTs in ternary rubber blends can be well predicted using the Z-model for a thermodynamic equilibrium state. By replacing the non-polar BR by a polar <b>rubber</b> like nitrile <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubber</b> (NBR) as a blend component CNTs are wetted by NBR slightly more than by NR thanks to the strong interaction between CNTs and nitrile groups of NBR.

During the solution vulcanization procedure, the double bonds (C=C) in butadiene rubber are chemically cross-linked with sulfur. Moreover, the sulfur canalso self-polymerize into polymeric sulfur with long molecular chain. The polymeric sulfur chains penetrate into the crosslinked BR network to form a unique semi-internal penetration network (semi-IPN) confinement structure, which can effectively alleviate the dissolution and diffusion of intermediate polysulfide into electrolytes. Meanwhile, the obtained sulfur-rich polymeric composites have high sulfur contents even over 90 %. As a result, the as-prepared sulfur-rich polymeric composites (BR-SPC) with network confine caged structure exhibit excellent cycling stability and high coulombic efficiency. An initial discharge specific capacity of 811 mA h g(- 1) is reached, and retains 671 mA h g(- 1) after 50 cycles at 0. 1 C.

The greatest advantage of using silica over carbon black as a reinforcing filler in a tyre tread compound is that a lower rolling resistance is achieved, while maintaining good wet traction.

The blends were re- inforced with a precipitated amorphous white silica nano- filler the surfaces of which were pretreated with bis(3 - triethoxysilylpropyl) -tetrasulfide (TESPT). TESPT is a sul- fur-bearing bifunctional organosilane that chemically bonds silica to rubber.

40|$|Blending of {{saturated}} ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) with highly unsaturated rubbers, such as natural rubber (NR) and (<b>butadiene</b> <b>rubber)</b> <b>BR,</b> is a rapidly developing area especially for tyre sidewall applications, where the saturated elastomer {{can be considered}} as a polymeric antioxidant for the diene rubbers. However, vulcanisates of such elastomer blends are generally poor in mechanical properties. These undesirable phenomena are generally the result of the thermodynamic incompatibility of these two types of rubber, cure incompatibility and heterogeneous filler distribution in each of the rubber phases. The objective of the project covered in this thesis is to overcome these incompatibility and reinforcement problems of the NR/BR/EPDM blends by various approaches and therefore improve the final mechanical properties of such blends. Besides the mechanical properties, the mechanisms involved are studied in the present work as well. In this research generally two approaches have been explored to solve the incompatibility and uneven-reinforcement problems of the NR/BR/EPDM blends and to improve the mechanical properties: adding a compatibilising agent and modification of the EPDM. Applying MAH-EPM as compatibilising agent leads to some improvements of the mechanical properties. However, ionic crosslinking resulting from MAH-EPM with ZnO, is not thermally stable, which limits the application at high temperatures. Different modification agents have been tried and it was found that APPS works by far most effectively. Significant improvements have been obtained with APPS-modified EPDM in blends with NR/BR. There is still some room for improvement, especially for the visco-elastic properties. But due to the excellent tensile, tear and fatigue properties, it can be a serious candidate for tyre sidewall applications. Considering the modification reaction of EPDM with APPS, the reaction mechanism is not clear yet and is worth to be further explored...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the so-called Green Tyre concept, in the early 90 ies, the use of silica as reinforcing fillers has spread and grown worldwide. The general advantages of silica as reinforcing filler over carbon black filler are better rolling resistance by achieving at least equal wet traction while tread wear should not be adversely affected. One way to obtain both low rolling resistance and high wet traction is indeed, to use precipitated silica together with solution polymers in tyre treads. The benefits of reinforcement by silane coupled silicas, in certain blends of solution styrene –butadiene rubber (SBR) and <b>butadiene</b> <b>rubber</b> (<b>BR),</b> were recognized by major tyre manufacturer. However, the use of silica compounds entails considerable disadvantages in terms of raw material costs and processability (before vulcanization). These difficulties include higher compound Mooney Viscosity (ML 1 + 4) that increases upon storage, short scorch time and environmental problems related to alcohol evolution. The high viscosity and poor processability in silica filled rubber compounds are believed to be associated with silica reaggregation (self aggregation) after rubber compounding. The study has been made of the effect of increased mixing stage and dispersion agent in rubber on uncured properties of the Silica Filled Epoxidised Natural Rubber Compounds. In this experiment, two orders of mixing were considered (1) Two Stages Mixing and (2) Three Stages Mixing. Results showed that filler dispersion, Mooney Viscosity and Payne Effect was influenced by the degree of mixing.
