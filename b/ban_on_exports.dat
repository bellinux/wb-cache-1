2500|$|Political {{opposition}} to the fishery began in 1885, {{based on the assumption}} that bycatch in the Chinese nets was killing large numbers of desirable young fish, especially salmon and striped bass. The opposition was exacerbated by the prevalent anti-Chinese sentiment in California in the late 19th century. Studies showed that the concerns were greatly exaggerated, and that the fishermen ate or gave away the edible fish. A 1932 report concluded that [...] "the average striped bass is too spry to be taken in any such rig." [...] Restrictive regulations were implemented, beginning in 1901 with an annual four-month closure of the fishery during the height of the season, a ban on the export of dried shrimp in 1905, followed by a ban on Chinese nets in 1911, forcing a switch to beam trawl nets, which required motorized boats. Arrests of Chinese fishing crews were common in the first decade of the 20th century. The <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> was lifted in 1919, leading to a tripling in production in the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{demand for}} {{condensate}} for oil sands diluent {{is expected to}} be more than [...] by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about [...] of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport. However, the recent huge increase in US tight oil production has largely solved this problem, because much of the production is too light for US refinery use but ideal for diluting bitumen. The surplus American condensate and light oil is [...] being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries. Since the diluent is simply exported and then immediately re-imported, it is not subject to the US <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> of crude oil. Once it is back in the US, refineries separate the diluent and re-export it to Canada, which again bypasses US crude oil export laws since it is now a refinery product. To aid in this process, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is reversing its Cochin Pipeline, which used to carry propane from Edmonton to Chicago, to transport [...] of condensate from Chicago to Edmonton by mid-2014; and Enbridge is considering the expansion of its Southern Lights pipeline, which currently ships [...] of diluent from the Chicago area to Edmonton, by adding another [...]|$|E

50|$|The {{competitive}} advantage of US refiners has {{been attributed to}} the lower price of American crude oil, as reflected by the Oklahoma-based index price West Texas Intermediate, versus the more expensive European-based index price Brent Crude. Due to the great surge in American production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids since 2008, those products have been cheaper in the North American market than worldwide, giving American refiners a major cost advantage. The discount on US crude is partially attributed to the long-standing federal <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>exports</b> of American crude oil.|$|E
