Further research showed that adding {{a small amount of}} a third metal to the <b>binary</b> <b>alloy</b> would promote the activity of the catalyst. Some widely used promoters are zinc, molybdenum and chromium. An alternative way of preparing enantioselective Raney nickel has been devised by surface adsorption of tartaric acid.|$|E

This third metal is called a [...] "promoter". The promoter changes the mixture from a <b>binary</b> <b>alloy</b> to a ternary alloy, which can lead to different quenching and leaching properties during activation.|$|E

Although the polycrystalline nature of the samples used made them unsuitable for device applications, the experimental results and analysis do provide a comprehensive overview of the potential of III-V semiconductor alloys. While more precise measurements have been obtained on single-crystal samples, such as the case of epitaxial InGaAs grown lattice-matched on InP, these results represent the best data for alloy compositions that cannot be synthesized as single-crystal epitaxial films for lack of the appropriate substrate.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{electron}} cloud density is a summation over many atoms, usually limited by a cutoff radius, the EAM potential is a multibody potential. For a single element system of atoms, three scalar functions must be specified: the embedding function, a pair-wise interaction, and an electron cloud contribution function. For a <b>binary</b> <b>alloy,</b> the EAM potential requires seven functions: three pair-wise interactions (A-A, A-B, B-B), two embedding functions, and two electron cloud contribution functions. Generally these functions {{are provided in}} a tabularized format and interpolated by cubic splines.|$|E

Even among <b>binary</b> <b>alloy</b> systems, there are few common cases of both elements being used in nearly-equal proportions such as Pb-Sn solders. Therefore, much is known from experimental results about phases near the edges of binary phase diagrams and the corners of ternary phase diagrams and much less is known about phases near the centers. In higher-order (4+ components) systems that cannot be easily represented on a 2-dimensional phase diagram, virtually nothing is known.|$|E

50|$|Monel is a solid-solution <b>binary</b> <b>alloy.</b> As {{nickel and}} copper are {{mutually}} soluble in all proportions, it is a single-phase alloy.Compared to steel, Monel {{is very difficult}} to machine as it work-hardens very quickly. It needs to be turned and worked at slow speeds and low feed rates. It is resistant to corrosion and acids, and some alloys can withstand a fire in pure oxygen. It is commonly used in applications with highly corrosive conditions. Small additions of aluminium and titanium form an alloy (K-500) with the same corrosion resistance but with much greater strength due to gamma prime formation on aging. Monel is typically much more expensive than stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|Methods {{have been}} devised to modify the yield strength, ductility, and {{toughness}} of both crystalline and amorphous materials. These strengthening mechanisms give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of materials to suit {{a variety of different}} applications. For example, the favorable properties of steel result from interstitial incorporation of carbon into the iron lattice. Brass, a <b>binary</b> <b>alloy</b> of copper and zinc, has superior mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution strengthening. Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce dislocations into materials, increasing their yield strengths.|$|E
50|$|In {{deriving}} {{the first}} equation, Darken referenced Simgelskas and Kirkendall's experiment, which tested the mechanisms {{and rates of}} diffusion and {{gave rise to the}} concept now known as the Kirkendall effect. For the experiment, inert molybdenum wires were placed at the interface between copper and brass components, and the motion of the markers was monitored. The experiment supported the concept that a concentration gradient in a <b>binary</b> <b>alloy</b> would result in the different components having different velocities in the solid solution. The experiment showed that in brass zinc had a faster relative velocity than copper, since the molybdenum wires moved farther into the brass. In establishing the coordinate axes to evaluate the derivation, Darken refers back to Smigelskas and Kirkendall’s experiment which the inert wires were designated as the origin.|$|E

The effective atomic numbers for the same <b>binary</b> <b>alloys</b> were also computed theoretically using the atomic to electronic cross-section method {{with the help of the}} mass attenuation coefficient database of WinXCom (2001).

50|$|The term alloy {{is used to}} {{describe}} a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. The primary metal is called the base, the matrix, or the solvent. The secondary constituents are often called solutes. If there {{is a mixture of}} only two types of atoms (not counting impurities) such as a copper-nickel alloy, then it is called a <b>binary</b> <b>alloy.</b> If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ternary alloy. An alloy with four constituents is a quaternary alloy, while a five-part alloy is termed a quinary alloy. Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a system. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a binary system, while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ternary system.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947, Kirkendall {{found that}} an inert marker set {{at a point in}} a <b>binary</b> <b>alloy</b> moves from the initial sate point after the {{diffusion}} treatment. [...] The phenomena are so called Kirkendall effect and it was considered that we cannot understand it from the existing theory of binary interdiffusion in those days. As a result, a new concept of intrinsic diffusion was then introduced for understanding the Kirkendall effect in the interdiffusion problems. Based on the intrinsic diffusion concept, Darken derived a relation between an interdiffusion coefficient and intrinsic diffusion coefficients in a binary interdiffusion in 1948. At present, however, it is revealed that the so-called Darken equation itself is mathematically wrong in the derivation process. Although the concentration of diffusion particles is a real quantity in physics, the temperature is a thermodynamic state quantity. As far as the shape of heat conduction material is unchangeable during a thermal treatment, the coordinate system of heat equation set in a material is a fixed one, since the coordinate system is not influenced by variations of the material internal structure. On the other hand, strictly speaking, the coordinate system of diffusion equation set in the diffusion field (solvent) is a moving one, since the origin of coordinate system is generally influenced by such variations.|$|E
50|$|Not much pure {{magnesium}} is extruded, for it has somewhat poor properties, {{especially as}} regards its proof stress. The alloying elements of chief concern at present are aluminium, zinc, cerium and zirconium; manganese is usually also present since, {{though it has}} {{little effect on the}} strength, it has a valuable function in improving corrosion resistance. One important <b>binary</b> <b>alloy,</b> containing up to 2.0% manganese, is used extensively for the manufacture of rolled sheet. It is comparatively soft and easier to extrude than other alloys, and {{is also one of the}} few that can be rolled directly without pre-extrusion.In the UK, extrusions are made from billets of 2.87 - 12 in dia. On presses varying in power over the range 600-3500 tons; normal maximum pressures on the billet are 30-50 tons/sq. in the U.S the Dow chemical company have recently installed a 13.200 ton press capable of handling billets up to 32 in. Extrusion technique is generally similar to that for aluminium base alloys but, according to Wilkinson and fox, die design requires special consideration and, in their opinion, should incorporate short bearing lengths and sharp die entries. Tube extrusion in alloys AM503, ZW2, and ZW3 is now made with bridge dies. (The aluminium-bearing alloys do not weld satisfactorily.) In contrast to the previous practice of using bored billets, mandrel piercing is now used in the extrusion of large diameter tubes in ZW3 alloy.|$|E

5000|$|For the derivation, a {{hypothetical}} case is considered where two homogeneous <b>binary</b> <b>alloy</b> rods {{of two different}} compositions are in contact. The sides are protected, so {{that all of the}} diffusion occurs parallel to the length of the rod. In establishing the coordinate axes to evaluate the derivation, Darken sets the x-axis to be fixed at the far ends of the rods, and the origin at the initial position of the interface between the two rods. In addition this choice of a coordinate system allows the derivation to be simplified, whereas Smigelskas and Kirkendall's coordinate system was considered to be the non-optimal choice for this particular calculation {{as can be seen in}} the following section. At the initial planar interface between the rods, it is considered that there are infinitely small inert markers placed in a plane which is perpendicular to the length of the rods. Here, inert markers are defined to be a group of particles that are of a different elemental make-up from either of the diffusing components and move in the same fashion. For this derivation, the inert markers are assumed to be following the motion of the crystal lattice. The motion relative to the marker is associated with diffusion, , while the motion of the markers is associated with advection, [...] Fick’s first law, the previous equation stated for diffusion, describes the entirety of the system for only small distances from the origin, since at large distances advection needs to be accounted for. This results in the total rate of transport for the system being influenced by both factors, diffusion and advection.|$|E
