2500|$|Pinochle {{derives from}} the game bezique. [...] Its name comes from the French word binocle meaning [...] "eyeglasses". The word is also {{possibly}} derived from the French word, <b>binage,</b> for the combination of cards called [...] "binocle". [...] This latter pronunciation of the game was adopted by German speakers. German immigrants brought the game to America, where it was later mispronounced and misspelled [...] "pinochle." ...|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{and soft}} tissue of bivalve samples {{collected}} from various sites of Karnataka coast were analysed for {{the estimation of}} the nanaal and anthropogenic heavy metal fluxes. Seasonal variations of heavy metals in sediment and bivalves collected from selected hot spots from <b>Binage,</b> Karwar and Thannirbavi, Mangalore were monitored. High concentrations of Hg was observed in the environment near' the vicinity of a caustic soda plant at <b>Binage,</b> Karwar, indicating Hg pollution. Total Hg concentration in the tissue of oysters sampled from a contaminated stream from the above site, exceeded the safe limit of 0. 5 ilg g. 1 wet weight. The base-line heavy metal concentrations in sediment and bivalves from selected sites of coastal Karnataka are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{study on}} the sub-populations of the oil sardine Sardinclla longiceps Val. was made ibased on {{vertebral}} counts recorded from specimens collected at seven centres, Karwar, <b>Binage,</b> Shankrubag, Chendia, Bellekeri and Belambar situated over a stretch of about 40 km south along the North Kanara coast and Kankon {{at a distance of}} 35 km north of Karwar. In all, 68 samples comprising 2183 specimens in the size range 96 - 209 mm were examined during the period June 1973 - April 1975. The total number of vertebrae ranged from. 43 to 48, the mode teing at 47. It was found that vertebral variations were not significant in fiih below 160 mm length (mostly juveniles) and those above 160 mm (adults) suggesting that they were homogeneous in character. Data pooled from all centres showed significant difference indicating the possibility that samples drawn were from different sub-populations. Within centres, samples differed significally especially at <b>Binage</b> and Chendia suggesting that these belonged to difl'erent sub-populations. Samples from Karwar, Belambar and Kankon did not differ significantly. It is inferred that sub-populations exist in the oilsardine shoals striking the coast between Karwar, Belambar and Kankon...|$|E
