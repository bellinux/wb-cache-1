Central Coast allowed 70 goals, the most in league history, and had a goal difference of −37, the worst by an A-League team.

5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch <b>by</b> <b>losing</b> feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|After 103 {{appearances}} for Third Division Gillingham {{he moved}} on to top-flight Coventry City in 1983 for a fee approaching £85,000. He struggled with injury during his time at Highfield Road, and was never popular with the fans. Keith Houchen also recalled that he did not get along with manager John Sillett and was prone to sulking when left out of the team. Despite this he managed to play over 100 games for City over a four-year period before Leeds United manager Billy Bremner took him to the Second Division for a £110,000 fee. Near the end of his first season at Leeds he played in the club's FA Cup Semi-final defeat to former club Coventry at Hillsborough, as Coventry won 3–2 in extra time. Leeds suffered further heartbreak in 1987 <b>by</b> <b>losing</b> the play-off Final to Charlton Athletic, again after extra time.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished <b>by</b> <b>losing.</b> Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E

5|$|Plataea and Mycale {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles that decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. They kept Persia from conquering all of Greece, although they paid a high price <b>by</b> <b>losing</b> many of their men. The Battle of Marathon showed that the Persians could be defeated, and the Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Plataea and Mycale that effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles is nearly as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might, however, be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers; and Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; the Greeks, in fact, sought out battle on both occasions.|$|E
