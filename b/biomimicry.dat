5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring <b>biomimicry</b> of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{attributes}} {{are sometimes}} mimicked in architecture, {{as at the}} Eastgate Centre, Harare, which uses passive cooling, storing heat {{in the morning and}} releasing it in the warm parts of the day. The target of this piece of <b>biomimicry</b> is the structure of the mounds of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively cool the nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with hydrophilic (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) sides, have been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, <b>biomimicry,</b> and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

25|$|Enamel is as brittle as {{glass and}} yet it can {{constantly}} withstand bite forces during chewing as high as 1,000 N many times a day. As such, it has been argued, that enamel tufts {{is an example of}} how nature has created a biomechanical solution to the problem of weak internal interfaces that laminate structures would otherwise have. The solutions involved (such as filling growing defects with fluids) has inspired scientists to make novel bioinspired (or <b>biomimicry)</b> materials.|$|E
25|$|Moths' {{eyes have}} an unusual property: their {{surfaces}} {{are covered with}} a natural nanostructured film, which eliminates reflections. This allows the moth to see well in the dark, without reflections to give its location away to predators. The structure consists of a hexagonal pattern of bumps, each roughly 200nm high and spaced on 300nm centers. This kind of antireflective coating works because the bumps are smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so the light sees the surface as having a continuous refractive index gradient between {{the air and the}} medium, which decreases reflection by effectively removing the air-lens interface. Practical anti-reflective films have been made by humans using this effect; this is a form of <b>biomimicry.</b>|$|E
500|$|Academically, the {{interaction}} of insects and society has been treated in part as cultural entomology, dealing mostly with [...] "advanced" [...] societies, and in part as ethnoentomology, dealing mostly with [...] "primitive" [...] societies, though the distinction is weak and not based on theory. Both academic disciplines explore the parallels, connections and influence of insects on human populations, and vice versa. They are rooted in anthropology and natural history, as well as entomology, the study of insects. Other cultural uses of insects, such as <b>biomimicry,</b> do not necessarily lie within these academic disciplines.|$|E

Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a [...] "Model, Measure, and Mentor" [...] and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of <b>biomimicry.</b> In addition to the benefits of sustainability, using <b>biomimicry</b> to create innovative materials, systems and architecture also results in businesses {{being able to do}} more at a lower cost, increasing production and profits.|$|E

50|$|The first {{approach}} of bioprinting is called <b>biomimicry.</b> The main {{goal of this}} approach is to create fabricated structures that are identical to the natural structure that are found in the tissues and organs in the human body. <b>Biomimicry</b> requires duplication of the shape, framework, and the microenvironment of the organs and tissues. The application of <b>biomimicry</b> in bioprinting involves creating both identical cellular and extracellular parts of organs. For this approach to be successful, the tissues must be replicated on a micro scale. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the microenvironment, the nature of the biological forces in this microenvironment, the precise organization of functional and supporting cell types, solubility factors, and the composition of extracellular matrix.|$|E
