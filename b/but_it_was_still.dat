5|$|In July 1951 the 13th earl died. Dunglass succeeded him, inheriting {{the title}} of Earl of Home {{together}} with the extensive family estates, including The Hirsel, the Douglas-Homes' principal residence. The new Lord Home took his seat in the Lords; a by-election was called to appoint a new MP for Lanark, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> pending when Attlee called another general election in October 1951.

5|$|In {{addition}} to British and Malayan units and personnel, the Commonwealth forces in Malaya included Australians, New Zealanders, Gurkhas, Fijians, Nyasalanders, and Northern and Southern Rhodesians. Southern Rhodesia had been self-governing since 1923. It ran its own affairs in most matters, including defence, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> constitutionally bound to Whitehall insofar as foreign affairs were concerned. The Southern Rhodesian government was therefore able to exercise {{a large degree}} of independence militarily, though diplomatically it came under the British flag.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{proposals}} {{were made to}} remedy this problem, and in 1865, the mayor of Brussels, Jules Anspach, selected a design by architect Léon Suys to cover the river and build a series of grand boulevards and public buildings. The project faced fierce opposition and controversy, mostly due to its cost {{and the need for}} expropriation and demolition of working-class neighbourhoods. The construction was contracted to a British company, but control was returned to the government following an embezzlement scandal. This delayed the project, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> completed in 1871. Its completion allowed the construction of the modern buildings and boulevards which are central to downtown Brussels today.|$|E
5|$|Pollution {{was not as}} high in New Jersey or Connecticut as in New York, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> significant. New Jersey {{reported}} its worst-ever smog.

5|$|The third highest-grossing film of its decade, Mom and Dad was {{claimed by}} Babb {{to have made}} $63,000 for every $1,000 the {{original}} investors contributed, and the Los Angeles Times estimated that it grossed anywhere from $40 million to $100 million.

5|$|A {{series of}} reports into the {{operation}} of the Free State were issued starting with the British Consul, Roger Casement's Casement Report and followed by reports commissioned by the Free State and Leopold II. These detailed unlawful killings and other abuses made by Abir and Leopold II was embarrassed into instituting reforms. These began with the appointment of American Richard Mohun by Leopold II as director of Abir. However, rubber exports continued to fall and rebellions increased, resulting in the Free State assuming control of the concession in 1906. Abir continued to receive a portion of profits from rubber exports and in 1911 was refounded as a rubber plantation harvesting company. The later history of the company is unknown <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> active in 1926.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} adhesive {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd. The company's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae's satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{completed}} a hat-trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships, {{but in a}} year with no international competition, he swam much slower times of 1min 11.1s and 2min 38.6s respectively. He {{completed a}} fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales. At the 1966 Australian Championships, his times were again slower, at 1min 11.8s and 2min 41.6s respectively, more than 4% slower than his personal bests, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> enough to retain his titles and qualify for the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. Critics had written him off, because just six weeks before the competition, he was 16kg overweight. However, {{he returned to his}} peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica, where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1min 8.2s and 2min 29.3s respectively. His winning run in the 4100m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal changeover.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 18th century the Luttrells and Dunster Castle faced many {{financial}} challenges. Francis's son Alexander, inherited the castle when he came of age in 1704, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> mostly empty and carried large debts with it. Alexander died young in 1711 and his widow, Dorothy, spent almost twenty years paying off the debts. Dorothy built a new chapel, designed by Sir James Thornhill in white Portland stone, on the rear of the mansion at a cost of £1,300 (£178,000 at 2009 prices); few records of this remain, but the interior probably resembled that of the chapel at Wimpole Hall. A safer, if less grand, approach road to the castle was created, called the New Way, and the remains of the Upper Ward on top of the motte were flattened {{to be used as a}} bowling green, complete with an octagonal summer house. Dorothy's son, Alexander Luttrell, took over the castle in 1726 but ran up new debts, and the castle was handed over into the control of a receiver.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941 the mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940, a naval {{adaptation}} of an Army anti-aircraft gun, became available. So Volta was modified between August and November 1941 with two single 25mm guns where the Hotchkiss machine guns had been mounted. Their platform was widened and one additional Browning machine gun was added {{on each side of}} the platform. The Hotchkiss guns were moved to the upper deck on either side of the after deck house. A degaussing cable was added during this same refit. Later in the year the SS 6 sonar was scheduled to be replaced by a French copy of the British ASDIC, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> sitting on the dockside when Volta was scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize the fleet on 27 November 1942 to prevent it from defecting to the Allies. She was raised on 20 May 1943 by the Italians, but no effort was made to repair her. Volta was bombed and sunk on 24 November 1943 and later refloated and scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Patching was one {{of several}} backstrokers who had slipped on the {{starting}} area earlier in the meet, so Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto the soles of his feet. The Soviet organisers had provided a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> two seconds slower than his personal best. He finished his leg in 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead after posting a time of 56.81s, with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was the last to reach the 100m mark, recording a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The four leading teams had broken away, leaving a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} Gibraltar changed following {{the invention of}} steamships; {{the first one to}} reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823. The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to Alexandria or Cape Horn, the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until {{near the end of the}} century. The demand for labour for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La Línea de la Concepción. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La Línea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.|$|E

5|$|As Patching {{had slipped}} {{earlier in the}} meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red {{substance}} onto {{the soles of his}} feet.

Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Kerry led off in {{a faster}} time than he had clocked in the {{individual}} event, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s. This left Australia in fourth place {{at the end of}} the first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, leaving the team almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than his previous best. He did so with an uneven arm technique due to the disparity in the strength of his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then made a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. At the halfway mark, he had drawn level and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler Kopliakov pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. The Australian freestyler had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. Brooks dedicated the team's win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas. Upon returning to Australia, he was greeted as a hero, but he considered retiring due to waning desire for success after his triumph in Moscow. In 2000, Brooks and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Kerry led off the Australian team in {{a faster}} time than he had clocked in the {{individual}} event, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> two seconds slower than his personal best time.

His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The remainder of the teams had been dropped, with a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans. Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a body length behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Tonelli's butterfly leg was such that if he had swum the same time in the individual event, he would have claimed the silver medal. Although he lost 0.36s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and Australia were within 0.81s going into the final leg. Furthermore, the Australians were now more than a second clear of the third placed Great Britain.|$|E
