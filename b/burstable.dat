50|$|<b>Burstable</b> billing is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} bandwidth based on peak use. It also allows usage to exceed a specified threshold for brief periods of time without the financial penalty of purchasing a higher committed information rate (CIR, or commitment) from an Internet service provider (ISP).|$|E

5000|$|Peak {{information}} rate (PIR) is a <b>burstable</b> rate set on routers and/or switches that allows throughput overhead. Related to committed {{information rate}} (CIR) which is a committed rate speed guaranteed/capped. For example, a CIR of 10 Mbit/s PIR of 12 Mbit/s allows you access to 10 Mbit/s minimum speed with burst/spike control that allows a throttle of an additional 2 Mbit/s; this allows for data transmission to [...] "settle" [...] into a flow.|$|E
50|$|Frame Relay {{connections}} are often given a {{committed information rate}} (CIR) and an allowance of <b>burstable</b> bandwidth known as the extended information rate (EIR). The provider guarantees that the connection will always support the C rate, and sometimes the PRa rate should there be adequate bandwidth. Frames that are sent {{in excess of the}} CIR are marked as discard eligible (DE) which means they can be dropped should congestion occur within the Frame Relay network. Frames sent in excess of the EIR are dropped immediately.|$|E
50|$|Above the CIR, an {{allowance}} of <b>burstable</b> bandwidth is often given, whose value {{can be expressed}} in terms of additional rate, known as the excess information rate (EIR), or as its absolute value, peak information rate (PIR). The provider guarantees that the connection will always support the CIR rate, and sometimes the EIR rate provided that there is adequate bandwidth. The PIR, i.e. the CIR plus EIR, is either equal to or less than the speed of the access port into the network. Frame relay carriers define and package CIRs differently, and CIRs are adjusted with experience.|$|E
50|$|Line speed, billed on the 95th percentile, {{refers to}} the speed in which data flows from the server or device, {{measured}} every 5 minutes for the month, and dropping the top 5% of measurements that are highest, and basing the usage for the month on the next-highest measurement. This {{is similar to a}} median measurement, which {{can be thought of as}} a 50th percentile measurement (with 50% of measurements above, and 50% of measurements below), whereas this sets the cutoff at 95th percentile, with 5% of measurements above the value, and 95% of measurements below the value. This is also known as <b>Burstable</b> billing. Line speed is measured in bits per second (or kilobits per second, megabits per second or gigabits per second).|$|E
40|$|<b>Burstable</b> billing {{is widely}} adopted in practice, e. g., by {{colocation}} data center providers, to charge for their users, e. g., data centers, for data transferring. However, {{there is still}} a lack of research on what the best way is for a user to manage its workload in response to <b>burstable</b> billing. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel method to optimally respond to <b>burstable</b> billing under demand uncertainty. First, we develop a tractable mathematical expression to calculate the 95 th percentile usage of a user, who is charged by provider via <b>burstable</b> billing for bandwidth usage. This model is then used to formulate a new bandwidth allocation problem to maximize the user's surplus, i. e., its net utility minus cost. Additionally, we examine different non-convex solution methods for the formulated stochastic optimization problem. We also extend our design to the case where a user can receive service from multiple providers, who all employ <b>burstable</b> billing. Using real-world workload traces, we show that our proposed method can reduce user's bandwidth cost by 26 % and increase its total surplus by 23 %, compared to the current practice of allocating bandwidth on-demand...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Many cloud {{services}} nowadays are running {{on top of}} geographically distributed infrastructures for better reliability and performance. They need {{an effective way to}} direct the user requests to a suitable datacenter, in a cost efficient manner. Previous work focused mostly on the electricity cost of datacenters. The approaches favor datacenters at locations with cheaper electricity prices. In this paper, we augment the picture by considering another significant cost contributor: network bandwidth. We propose to utilize statistical multiplexing to strategically bundle demands at different locations. The anti-correlation between demands effectively smooths out the aggregated bandwidth usage, thereby saving the bandwidth cost calculated by <b>burstable</b> billing methods that charge the peak bandwidth usage. We present an optimization framework that models the realistic environment and practical constraints a cloud faces. We develop an efficient distributed algorithm based on dual decomposition and the subgradient method, and evaluate its effectiveness and practicality using realworld traffic traces and electricity costs.

This is the digital chasm that could prevent Africa and other developing nations from being part of the global knowledge economy unless drastic measures are taken. The deployment of information and communication technology in developing regions brings with it many benefits from increased economic growth, improved governance to access to better education and health. In developing countries, {{the vast majority of people}} (approximately 70 to 85 %) live in rural areas. These regions face significant resource challenges such as poor communication, transport, electricity and water infrastructure. Bringing an Internet connection to these regions can usually only be achieved by using a satellite link which is severely bandwidth limited and very costly. For example to provide a VSAT satellite connection in Zambia with a commited downlink rate of 128 kbps <b>burstable</b> to 1 Mbps costs $ 1700 per month. This is is close to the most expensive Internet in the world being used by the poorest in the world where much of the population is living on $ 1 per day. The high cost of satellite connectivity usually means that the link needs to be aggregated with...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{majority}} of Internet service providers (ISPs) sup-port connectivity {{to the entire}} Internet by transiting their traffic via other providers. Although the transit prices per megabit per second (Mbps) decline steadily, the overall transit costs of these ISPs remain high or even increase due to the traffic growth. The discontent of the ISPs with the high transit costs has yielded no-table innovations such as peering, content distribution networks, multicast, and peer-to-peer localization. While the above solutions tackle the problem by reducing the transit traffic, this paper explores a novel approach that reduces the transit costs without altering the traffic. In the proposed Cooperative IP Transit (CIPT), multiple ISPs cooperate to jointly purchase Internet Protocol (IP) transit in bulk. The aggregate transit costs decrease due to the economies-of-scale effect of typical subadditive pricing as well as <b>burstable</b> billing: Not all ISPs transit their peak traffic during the same period. To distribute the aggregate savings among the CIPT partners, we propose Shapley-value sharing of the CIPT transit costs. Using public data about IP traffic and transit prices, we quantitatively evaluate CIPT and show that significant savings can be achieved, both in relative and absolute terms. We also discuss the organizational embodiment, relationship with transit providers, traffic confidentiality, {{and other aspects of}} CIPT.

40|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of the network impact of emerging large-scale distributed systems – where traffic flows and what it costs – must encompass users ’ behavior, the traffic they generate and the topology over which that traffic flows. In the case of BitTorrent, however, previous studies have been limited by narrow perspectives that restrict such analysis. This paper presents a comprehensive view of BitTorrent, using data from a representative set of 500, 000 users sampled over a two year period, located in 169 countries and 3, 150 networks. This unique perspective captures unseen trends and reveals sev-eral unexpected features of the largest peer-to-peer system. For instance, {{over the past year}} total BitTorrent traffic has increased by 12 %, driven by 25 % increases in per-peer hourly download volume despite a 10 % decrease in the average number of online peers. We also observe stronger diurnal usage patterns and, surprisingly given the bandwidth-intensive nature of the application, a close alignment between these patterns and overall traffic. Considering the aggregated traffic across access links, this has potential implica-tions on BitTorrent-associated costs for Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Using data from a transit ISP, we find a disproportionately large impact under a commonly used <b>burstable</b> (95 th-percentile) billing model. Last, when examining BitTorrent traffic’s paths, we find that for over half its users, most network traffic never reaches large transit networks, but is instead carried by small transit ISPs. This raises questions on the effectiveness of most in-network monitoring systems to capture trends on peer-to-peer traffic and further motivates our approach. ...|$|E
