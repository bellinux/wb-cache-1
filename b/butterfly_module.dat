The alignment of the fibre optic and the laser in the <b>butterfly</b> <b>module</b> become misaligned during the laser welding process of the sleeve to the ferrule.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedReduced precision redundancy (RPR), {{as a new}} method for improving fault tolerance in FPGAs, appears promising in replacing triple modular redundancy (TMR) to prevent the single event effects due to radiation in arithmetic processes. As a test of this approach, the RPR technique was used to implement a Radix- 4 fast Fourier transform (FFT). This design was implemented in a Xilinx Virtex 2 FPGA {{in order to find}} the possible gain in speed and power as compared to the TMR method. This thesis deals with a 64 -point Radix- 4 in-place FFT, based on an improved FFT algorithm. The whole FFT structure was implemented based on self-designed modules and by manipulating the embedded Virtex II FPGA's modules. The point was to create a fast and small FFT module that could be altered according to specific application requirements. The implementation of the FFT was successful, managing to handle data in real time at a speed of 134 MHz. Based on this FFT design, the next challenge was the implementation of TMR and RPR modules. The first attempt was the TMR structure, implemented by creating three identical replicas of the FFT and installing a voter per FFT stage. This implementation was unsuccessful due to space limitations. The next step was the alteration of the existing FFT {{and the creation of a}} smaller 8 x 8 bit <b>butterfly</b> <b>module</b> for the RPR structure. After the successful completion of this step, implementation of a RPR module with an 8 / 32 degree was commenced. Ambiguities and inefficient radiation protection were identified in this implementation. Finally, adopting a new RPR approach and a higher degree of 14 / 32, a smooth and correct RPR module was created that could work in real time, and handle data at a speed of 163 MHz. Both TMR and RPR with a degree of 14 / 32 methods were compared, confirming the RPR's advantage in power consumption and in occupied FPGA's resources. Hellenic Navy autho...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{invention}} of wireless telegraphy by Marconi in 1897, wireless technology has not only been enhanced, but also has {{become an integral part}} of our everyday lives. The first wireless mobile phone appeared around 1980. It was based on first generation analog technology that involved the use of Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) techniques. Ten years later, second generation (2 G) mobiles were dependent on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) techniques and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) techniques. Nowadays, third generation (3 G) mobile systems depend on CDMA techniques to satisfy the need for faster, and more capacious data transmission in mobile wireless networks. Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) has become the major 3 G air interface in the world. WCDMA employs convolutional encoding to encode voice and MPEG 4 applications in the baseband transmitter at a maximum frequency of 2 Mbps. To decode convolutional codes, Andrew Viterbi invented the Viterbi Decoder (VD) in 1967. In 2 G mobile terminals, the VD consumes approximately one third of the power consumption of a baseband mobile transceiver. Thus, in 3 G mobile systems, it is essential to reduce the power consumption of the VD. Conceptually, the Register Exchange (RE) method is simpler and faster than the Trace Back (TB) method for implementing the VD. However, in the RE method, each bit in the memory must be read and rewritten for each bit of information that is decoded. Therefore, the RE method is not appropriate for decoders with long constraint lengths. Although researchers have focused on implementing and optimizing the TB method, the RE method is focused on and modified in this thesis to reduce the RE method's power consumption. This thesis proposes a novel modified RE method by adopting a pointer concept for implementing the survivor memory unit (SMU) of the VD. A pointer is assigned to each register or memory location. The contents of thepointer which points to one register is altered to point to a second register, instead of copying the contents of the first register to the second. When the pointer concept is applied to the RE's SMU implementation (modified RE), there is no need to copy the contents of the SMU and rewrite them, but one row of memory is still needed for each state of the VD. Thus, the VDs in CDMA systems require 256 rows of memory. Applying the pointer concept reduces the VD's power consumption by 20 percent as estimated by the VHDL synthesis tool and by the new power reduction estimation that is introduced in this work. The coding gain for the modified RE method is 2. 6 dB at an SNR of approximately 10 - 3. Furthermore, a novel zero-memory implementation for the modified RE method is proposed. If the initial state of the convolutional encoder is known, the entire SMU of the modified RE VD is reduced to only one row. Because the decoded data is generated in the required order, even this row of memory is dispensable. The zero-memory architecture is called the MemoryLess Viterbi Decoder (MLVD), and reduces the power consumption by approximately 50 percent. A prototype of the MLVD with a one third convolutional code rate and a constraint length of nine is mapped into a Xilinx 2 V 6000 chip, operating at 25 MHz with a decoding throughput of more than 3 Mbps and a latency of two data bits. The other problem of the VD which is addressed in this thesis is the Add Compare Select Unit (ACSU) which is composed of 128 butterfly ACS modules. The ACSU's high parallelism has been previously solved by using a bit serial implementation. The 8 -bit First Input First Output (FIFO) register, needed for the storage of each path metric (PM), is at the heart of the single bit serial ACS <b>butterfly</b> <b>module.</b> A new, simply controlled shift register is designed at the circuit level and integrated into the ACS module.
