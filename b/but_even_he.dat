Several of the actors who were cast as college students, including Hulce, Karen Allen, and Kevin Bacon, were just beginning their film careers, although Matheson had appeared {{as one of the}} vigilante cops in the second Dirty Harry film, Magnum Force, released in 1973.|$|E
25|$|The Bagratid king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, {{still kept}} his throne even after 1064 when Ani {{fell to the}} Seljuk Turks, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> was {{constrained}} to cede his lands to the Byzantines and retreat to Anatolia, only to see Kars captured by the Turks in 1065. In Baghk and Eastern Syunik, only a few Armenian fortresses remained.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} sources emphasized on the Sasanians' {{hatred of}} everything {{adapted from the}} Parthians. The existence of such a mentality in Ardashir is understandable; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> was forced to establish his newborn government on Parthian foundations by the help of other remarkable Iranian houses, who were either affiliated with the Parthians or nursed by them. However, no change is seen in that hatred of the Parthians in the next generations of Sasanian emperors either. Therefor, it can be deduced that the Parthians enforced a more hard and tyrannical domination than presumed on their submitted shahs and {{that might have been}} the reason that facilitated Ardashir's conquest.|$|E

25|$|After Catiline's death, many of {{the poor}} still {{regarded}} him with respect and did not view him as the traitor and villain that Cicero claimed he was. The aristocratic element of Rome, however, certainly viewed him in a much darker light. Sallust wrote {{an account of the}} conspiracy that epitomized Catiline as representative of all of the evils festering in the declining Roman republic. In his account, Sallust attributes countless crimes and atrocities to Catiline, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> refuses to heap some of the most outrageous claims on him, particularly a ritual that involved drinking blood of a sacrificed child. Later historians such as Florus and Dio Cassius, far removed from the original events, recorded the claims of Sallust and the aforementioned rumors as facts. Up until the modern era Catiline was equated, as Sallust described, to everything depraved and contrary to both the laws of the gods and men.|$|E
25|$|Jan Andrzej Morsztyn, a magnate {{active in}} royal court circles, {{represented}} the conceptismo current. He wrote romantic poetry and expert translations of foreign work. Zbigniew Morsztyn {{was a soldier}} and poet connected with the Polish Brethren. He had to spend half {{of his life in}} exile in Prussia and produced realistic poetry concerned with the hardships and dangers of military life. Another poet and member of the Polish Brethren, Wac≈Çaw Potocki, converted to Catholicism. His poetry depicts the life of Polish landed gentry and historic events. He wrote the epic poem The Conduct of the Khotyn War (of 1621) and was deeply troubled by the social injustice in the Commonwealth and its decline. The szlachta apologist Wespazjan Kochowski expressed no such misgivings, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> could not conceal the progressive degeneration of his class. In the era of constant warfare the writing of memoirs had become an often practiced art. Jan Chryzostom Pasek was one of the leading in Europe representatives of this genre.|$|E
500|$|While {{the main}} Habsburg army faced Frederick at the Elbe, a smaller army {{under the command}} of Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon guarded the passes from [...] Saxony [...] and Lusatia into Bohemia. Laudon was another battle-hardened and cagey {{commander}} with extensive field experience, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> could not cover the long frontier completely. Shortly after Frederick crossed into Bohemia, Prince Henry, a brilliant strategist in his own right, maneuvered around Laudon's troops and entered Bohemia at Hainspach. To avoid being flanked, Laudon withdrew across the Iser River, but by mid-August, the main Austrian army was in danger of being outflanked by Henry on its left wing. At its center and right, it faced a well-disciplined army commanded by Frederick, arguably the best tactical general of the age and feared for his victories against France and Austria in the previous war.|$|E

500|$|The audio {{received}} mixed reception. Manny LaMancha of GamePro {{said that}} the in-game voice acting (provided by such stars as Debi Derryberry and Billy West) was [...] "clear and entertaining". Tony Guidi of TeamXbox {{also noted that the}} character voices were [...] "done well" [...] and that the music [...] "isn't annoying". However, Michael Lafferty of GameZone stated that the music can become [...] "a little tiring" [...] and [...] "annoying" [...] after a while. Ryan Davis of GameSpot concluded that the sound was [...] "respectable", but added that the [...] "attitude" [...] of the character sounds bites seemed [...] "forced". Ed Lewis of IGN {{said that the}} [...] "saving grace" [...] of the [...] "Looney Tunes-style repartee and sound effects" [...] is that [...] "it was done professionally and while it's pretty silly if you listen to it, it doesn't grate and get under the skin as other games can." [...] He added that the music was [...] "bouncy and peppy and, once again, cartoony". Steven Rodriguez of Nintendo World Report described the music and sound effects as [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "plain" [...] respectively, and noted that {{the best part of the}} game's audio was [...] "that sexy talking mask that gives you advice between races, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> gets rather annoying." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote, [...] "This {{version of}} The Mummy has no pretenses to be {{anything}} other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think Raiders of the Lost Ark with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think Night of the Living Dead stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy grafted onto a Bing Crosby-Bob Hope road picture (The Road to Hamunaptra?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof." [...] Publications like The Austin Chronicle and Dallas Observer {{came to the conclusion that}} despite good acting and special effects, the movie lacked cohesion; talking about the special effects, the Observer lamented [...] "If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy." [...] Other publications such as Jump Cut felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on special effects proved detrimental to The Mummy; [...] "The mummy", Ernest Larson wrote for the Jump Cut, [...] "is standard-issue I.L.". Kim Newman of the British Film Institute judged the picture inferior to the original, as all the time was spent on special effects, instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic. USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was [...] "not free of stereotypes", a sentiment with which the BFI concurred. [...] "If someone complains of a foul odor, you can be sure an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene. Fraser, equally quick with weapon, fist or quip, may save the day, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> can't save the picture", USA Today wrote.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Harriot {{seems to}} have been the first to derive and write {{formulas}} for sums of powers using symbolic notation, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers. [...] Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 Academia Algebrae, far higher than anyone before him, but he did not give a general formula.|$|E

2500|$|FOTLU was {{not very}} successful. District and local {{assemblies}} of the Knights of Labor withdrew almost immediately, as did most national unions. [...] Only 19 delegates attended the second convention, and 26 at the third. Gompers was elected chairman of FOTLU's executive committee (making him the de facto president) in 1883, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> did not attend that meeting. The federation's membership hovered around 25,000, and FOTLU organized almost no members and issued no charters to new unions.|$|E
2500|$|For McGraw one of {{the most}} {{challenging}} aspects of being in the military was the internal conflict which it stirred within him. At the same time that he was finishing his Marine training, Tug McGraw's brother, Dennis McGraw, was staging anti-war protests at Solano Community College, where he was then a student. In a March 5, 1967 New York Times article McGraw admitted that he and his brother would have arguments over the way the Vietnam War was being conducted. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>he,</b> with his six-year Reserve commitment to the United States Marine Corps looming large over him, would admit that he was a [...] "dove {{when it came to the}} way [...] conducting the war." ...|$|E
2500|$|In spring 613, Emperor Yang again {{ordered that}} {{soldiers}} be gathered at Zhuo Commandery, {{as he prepared}} a second campaign against Goguryeo. [...] He also selected the most elite of the soldiers into a specialized corps, the Xiaoguo Army (È©çÊûú, meaning, [...] "the strong and brave"). [...] Thereafter, the Xiaoguo Army became his own personal guards. [...] In response to the conscription order, even more men deserted and joined the agrarian rebels, throwing the northern {{central part of the}} empire into a state of confusion. [...] With the officials on command having little military training, the rebels went largely unchecked. One notable exception was general Zhang Xutuo (ÂºµÈ†àÈôÄ), who was able to defeat some of the rebels, [...] <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> was not able to succeed in suppressing them.|$|E

2500|$|Churchill later wrote:"The French Fifth Army had {{no sooner}} {{completed}} with severe exertions its deployment on the Sambre, and the British Army by forced marches had no sooner reached the neighbourhood of Mons, when the overwhelming {{force of the}} German turning movement through Belgium fell upon them ... accepted [...] with implicit faith. Lanrezac, sure that Joffre was utterly adrift from facts, watched with insolent distrust the impending disaster. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> never imagined the weight and sweep of the German enveloping wing. The two armies of the left only escaped disaster by the timely retreat which Lanrezac and Sir John French each executed independently and on his own initiative ... Lanrezac's grasp {{of the situation and}} stern decision to retreat while the time remained has earned the gratitude of France. It was a pity he forgot to tell his British Allies about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though better financed, the new {{companies}} had little success {{in spite of}} growing interest in Yule Marble generated by glowing test results from London (1887), the St Louis Exposition (1890) and the Chicago Exposition (1893). The companies had different degrees of development and success with the quarry of John Osgood obtaining a major contract in 1895 to supply [...] of marble for the new state capitol in Denver, Colorado. After this initial success, little production has accomplished by Osgood or the other two companies. The Osgood operation was well financed <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> was afflicted by {{the problems associated with}} developing and operating a quarry in the Yule Creek Valley. Also the lack of transportation to move enough of the stone out of Marble added to the difficulties. [...] Taken together, these factors resulted in high operating costs that could not be covered by marble revenue. The high cost problems would also affect the next quarry and its operators up to the present time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aftermath}} of the 20 July plot coincided with the rout of the German armies in both {{the east and the}} west. In the east Operation Bagration destroyed Army Group Centre and drove the Germans out of Byelorussia and eastern Poland: they were also forced out of the Balkans. In the west, the Americans, British and Canadians broke out of the Normandy pocket and swept across France, taking Paris on 25 August and Brussels on 3 September. The German command in the west was reorganised following the suicide of Kluge, the arrest of St√ºlpnagel and the incapacitation of Rommel. Field Marshal Walter Model, known as [...] "the F√ºhrer's fireman" [...] for his reputation for stabilising dangerous situations, was appointed both OB West and commander of Army Group B on 16 August, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>he</b> could not do justice to both jobs. At Blumentritt's urgent request, supported by Model, Hitler agreed to ask Rundstedt to resume his post as OB West, which at a meeting on 1 September he agreed to do, saying [...] "My F√ºhrer, whatever you order, I shall do to my last breath." ...|$|E
