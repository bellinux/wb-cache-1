500|$|While Jones is {{credited}} with writing the screenplay, the shooting script was actually a collaborative effort that featured contributions from Henson, George Lucas, Laura Phillips, and Elaine May. Jones himself {{has said that the}} finished film differs greatly from his original vision. According to Jones, [...] "I didn't feel that it was very much mine. I always felt it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and I wanted it to be about something else." [...] Jones has said his version of the script was [...] "about the world, and about people who are more interested in manipulating the world than actually baring themselves at all." [...] In Jones' original script, Jareth merely seems [...] "all powerful to begin with" [...] and is actually using the Labyrinth to [...] "keep people from getting to his heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peyton {{has been}} {{described}} as beautiful, smart, fiercely independent, and as someone who is often a victim on the series. [...] "My character is a good girl, but she is also kind of [...] suggestive. This is definitely not your mom's drama," [...] said Burton. [...] "She's very contradictory. Yes, she is a cheerleader, but she also goes home and listens to punk music. She's into really dark art and probably rips the heads off of Barbie dolls. Basically, she's a train wreck." [...] Burton said the character may be [...] "a train wreck" [...] but that she was [...] "so glad [...] putting a girl like her on TV. You don't have to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> Peyton has made that OK".|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic's Heather Phares {{scored the}} soundtrack 3 out of 5, writing [...] "True Crime is {{something}} of an achievement when it comes to gathering popular music in support of a video game." [...] She concluded [...] "It's not a perfect soundtrack, but True Crime is entertaining enough to please gaming and non-gaming rap fans alike." [...] IGN's Spence D scored the soundtrack 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "Where The Streets of LA: The Soundtrack really succeeds is {{in the fact that the}} 20 track album features all new material written specifically for the game." [...] He concluded [...] "The most interesting thing is that for all intents and purposes the West Coast gangsta scene, musically speaking, has more or less run its course, succumbing to the bling and blitz of the Dirty South. But this album proves that it's still alive and well. Whatever your take on the gunz-n-thugs mentality may <b>be,</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> can't be denied: the 20 tracks included here are rife with game, style, and serious funktafication." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But there <b>is</b> yet <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> more," [...] I cried. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{that must}} <b>be</b> stopped, being mere ruin to herself, {{and to me}} too." ...|$|R

2500|$|..... {{the people}} of the colonies are {{descendants}} of Englishmen... They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles. The people are Protestants... a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it... My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government—they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation—the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia. But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you.|$|E
60|$|If there <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in {{the world}} that the small Hill Rajahs deny it is just this charge; but it happens to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that the bazars believe, when they discuss the mysterious slave-traffics of India. The old lady {{explained}} to Kim, in a tense, indignant whisper, precisely what manner and fashion of malignant liar he was. Had Kim hinted this when she was a girl, he would have been pommelled to death that same evening by an elephant. This was perfectly true.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so he {{is never}} either right or wrong," [...] said the King. [...] "I don't like that, at all. I want to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or the other." ...|$|E
5000|$|If there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{that really}} honks me off, it's the {{hopelessness}} and futility {{of the human}} condition ...|$|R
60|$|That it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to have a}} king, {{another to}} have a throne, and another to have neither.|$|R
60|$|But before {{proceeding}} further, there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that had {{got to be}} understood between us, and understood clearly.|$|R
60|$|And {{she gripped}} Nuttie tight round the waist, and laid {{her head on}} her shoulder, shaking with a few little sobs, which might <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{remember}} occasions {{when it seemed}} to please you to fly {{in the face of}} them, but your thoroughness isn't altogether above suspicion now and then. One has to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or the other." ...|$|E
60|$|Tarzan {{nodded his}} head. He {{was a man}} of few words, and {{possibly}} it was for this reason as much as any that Kadour ben Saden had taken to him, for if there <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that an Arab despises it is a talkative man.|$|E
500|$|In his {{acceptance}} remarks, King said, [...] "Freedom <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> You {{have it all}} or you are not free." ...|$|R
60|$|Luc. Sir, {{though your}} song was pleasant, yet there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> amiss in it,--that was, your {{rallying}} of religion.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> however, which threw a {{cloud over}} the rejoicing {{with which the}} conquerors hailed this memorable victory.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} clergyman. [...] "Our old guard won't {{tolerate}} the smallest {{compromise with the}} enemy, and there's a good deal {{to be said for}} their point of view. After all, half-measures have seldom much result; a man must <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or another. But we might try the new waiting-room at the station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I tried keeping grocery, once, {{up in the}} mines; but I couldn't stand it; it was too dull--no stir, no storm, no life about it; it {{was like}} being part dead and part alive, both at the same time. I wanted to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or t'other. I shut up shop pretty quick and went to sea." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{a fairly}} well-educated man for one of middle class-- {{exceptionally}} well educated for a common soldier. He spoke fluently and unceasingly. He could in this way <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and seem another: for instance, he could speak of love and think of dinner; call on the husband {{to look at the}} wife; be eager to pay and intend to owe.|$|E

5000|$|John Tomlinson says, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to {{say that}} {{cultural}} diversity is being destroyed, quite another to lament the fact." ...|$|R
60|$|Why not? A tribute <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> {{but to have}} to put {{the reasons}} for that tribute, into words was quite another.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{do about}} her. Do {{you mean to}} make her your wife? That's plain English. Because I'll tell you what: I'll not see her put upon any longer. It must <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or the other; and that at once. And if you've a grain of honour in you, Mr. Tudor--and I think you are honourable--you won't back from your word with the girl now.' ...|$|E
60|$|We mean now, generally, by a hypocrite, {{a man who}} {{pretends to}} <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> while he is another; who pretends to be pious and good, while he is leading a profligate life in secret; who pretends to believe certain doctrines, while at heart he disbelieves them; a man, in short, who is a scoundrel, and knows it; but who does not intend others to know it: who deceives others, but does not deceive himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know. I cannot even {{pretend to}} guess. As I read his letter {{there must have}} been something. But it does not matter. While you have seemed to me to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> you have been another. You have been acting a part from the first moment in which we met, and have kept it up all through with admirable consistency. You are not that sweetly {{innocent}} creature which I have believed you to be." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for Sergeant Corney to {{say that}} we must sleep, and quite another for us to obey the command.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about seamen that renders them {{at least}} safe acquaintances," [...] said Mildred, smiling; [...] "I mean their frankness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Names, of course, I'll not mention. Opinions <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> direct {{accusation}} another. This is not {{a healthy}} country for the informer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} are in luck, this time, Joe. That ship must have come foreign; at least, I should say so by her appearance, though she may be from Cadiz. As to the other two, they may be anything. The xebec, no doubt, is a coast trader. The polacre may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> or another, but I should hardly think she has come across the Atlantic. Likely enough she is from Bilbao or Santander. The ship is the fellow to get hold of, {{if we get a}} chance. I shall be quite content to leave the others alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{the fashion}} in America for young girls to have waiting-maids,--in foreign {{countries}} it is the fashion. All this meretricious toilet--so elaborate, so complicated, and so contrary to nature--must be accomplished, and it is accomplished, by the busy little fingers of each girl for herself; and {{so it seems to}} be very evident that a style of hair-dressing which it will require hours to disentangle, which must injure and in time ruin the natural beauty of the hair, ought to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which a well-regulated court of inquiry would reject in our American fashions.|$|E
6000|$|Tink {{was not all}} bad: or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on {{the other}} hand, {{sometimes}} she was all good. Fairies have to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only {{it must be a}} complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning 'Follow me, and all will be well.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The third {{aspect of}} Zen yoga is the {{application}} of awareness or mindfulness (Japanese, [...] "nen" [...] 念). As mentioned above, the Buddha is recorded as saying, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that leads to happiness {{in the present and}} liberation in the future; and what <b>is</b> this <b>one</b> <b>thing?</b> It <b>is</b> mindfulness of the body." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> Mr. Pathurst, I always sleep {{like a baby}} [...] . {{which means}} a good conscience, sir, yes, a good conscience." ...|$|R
