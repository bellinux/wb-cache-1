5|$|Ali {{also sought}} to limit the {{influence}} of the al-Azhar sheikhs by allocating positions within the government to those educated outside of al-Azhar. He sent select students to France to be educated under a Western system and created an educational system based on that model that was parallel to, and thus <b>bypassed,</b> <b>the</b> system of al-Azhar.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 26, Tropical Storm Kyle {{was deemed}} {{to be a threat}} to Bermuda and a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the islands. Later that day the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning as the storm neared the island. The following day, the warning was discontinued as Hurricane Kyle <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E
5|$|It {{is home to}} Memorial Park, {{which is}} used for the annual town festival and several nature reserves. The town is served by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes and is close to the A4 road which <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> town in 1964. There are schools, religious, sporting, and {{cultural}} clubs and venues.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 <b>the</b> Raymond Terrace <b>bypass</b> on <b>the</b> Pacific Highway was opened, {{diverting}} traffic {{away from}} the town centre. Most of the town now lies to the north-west of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> between <b>the</b> Hunter and Williams rivers. However, the suburb of Lakeside lies {{to the east of}} <b>the</b> <b>bypass,</b> between <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> and <b>the</b> wall of Grahamstown Dam.|$|R

5|$|At the time, floating-point {{division}} was generally expensive compared to multiplication; the fast inverse square root algorithm <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> division step, giving it its performance advantage. Quake III Arena, a first-person shooter video game, used the fast inverse square root algorithm to accelerate graphics computation, but the algorithm {{has since been}} implemented in some dedicated hardware vertex shaders using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA).|$|E
5|$|Bordallo reintroduced it, as amended, at the {{beginning}} of the next Congress. It gained 30 cosponsors, <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> committee stage and was passed by voice vote in March 2009. Kerry reintroduced it in the Senate a month later; it eventually gained 33 cosponsors there. The Senate Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard held hearings on the bill in June.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} this compartmentalization, Andrews <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> chain of command on 8 January 1938, in a memorandum of his own regarding a minor joint air exercise held in November 1937 off the Virginia Capes. There four B-17s had found and successfully bombed Navy target vessels. Andrews sent a memo directly to Roosevelt's military aide, Col. Edwin M. Watson, that included confidential Navy memoranda confirming {{the accuracy of the}} Army's bombing.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> tunnel's <b>bypass</b> is {{not unlike}} <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Turnpike <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> Laurel Hill Tunnel in 1964, {{followed}} by <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> of <b>the</b> Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels in 1968.|$|R

5|$|It {{features}} six overpasses and {{a single}} interchange, at First Avenue. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on September7, 1981 to officially open the new route, which <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> former Highway3 alignment along Talbot Street and the short concurrency with Highway4 (Sunset Drive). The bypass cost C$16.5 million to construct, and features a two-lane roadway with allotted space {{on the north side}} for a second two-lane roadway.|$|E
5|$|M-331 is an {{unsigned}} state trunkline {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan {{located within the}} city of Kalamazoo. It runs from the southern city limits north into downtown Kalamazoo. This {{was one of many}} highways to be established or realigned {{as a result of a}} rationalization process initiated in 1998 during the tenure of Governor John Engler. M-331 uses streets in Kalamazoo that were once part of US Highway 131 (US131) before a freeway was built that <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> downtown area.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{settlement}} of the village of Skaneateles began, the Seneca Turnpike route which originally <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> village to the north was relocated southward {{to go through the}} growing settlement. The Seneca Turnpike Company closed its doors in 1852. Modern NY175 does not follow either the original alignment or the relocated alignment, but rather the length of a former trolley line that went from Skaneateles to Syracuse via Marcellus and Onondaga. This trolley line parallels the relocated alignment.|$|E
25|$|US 2 {{runs through}} the city. US 85 <b>bypasses</b> <b>the</b> city to the northwest, US 85B <b>bypasses</b> <b>the</b> city to the northeast. ND 1804 {{runs through the}} {{southern}} portion {{of the city and}} is concurrent with US 2 between 143rd Avenue, and 2nd Street.|$|R
50|$|Hartford is {{bisected}} by the A559, {{known as}} Chester Road. <b>The</b> A556 road <b>bypasses</b> <b>the</b> village {{as part of}} <b>the</b> Northwich <b>bypass.</b> <b>The</b> bridge that carries the road over the River Weaver is known as Hartford Bridge or Blue Bridge, and was built in 1938.|$|R

5|$|Strongly {{affected}} by the deindustrialization {{that took place in}} other Rust Belt cities, Utica suffered a major reduction in manufacturing activity {{during the second half of}} the 20thcentury. The 1954 opening of the New York State Thruway (which <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> city) and declines in activity on the Erie Canal and railroads throughout the United States also contributed to a poor local economy. During the 1980s and 1990s, major employers such as General Electric and Lockheed Martin began to close plants in Utica and Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|The Poor Law system {{fell into}} decline at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century owing to factors such as the introduction of the Liberal welfare reforms and the availability of other sources of assistance from friendly societies and trade unions, as well as piecemeal reforms which <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> Poor Law system. The Poor Law system was not formally abolished until the National Assistance Act 1948, with parts of the law remaining on the books until 1967.|$|E
5|$|Years after independence, West Bengal {{was still}} {{dependent}} on the central government for help in meeting its demands for food; food production remained stagnant, and the Indian green revolution <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> state. However, {{there has been a}} significant increase in food production since the 1980s, and the state now has a surplus of grains. The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–1981, declining to 5% by 1997–1998. In contrast, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, {{construction}} {{began on}} a bypass route for PA 100 and US 222 around Trexlertown. On September 29, 2005, PA 100 was rerouted to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> {{community to the}} west along the four-lane divided Trexlertown <b>Bypass.</b> <b>The</b> former alignment through Trexlertown became known as Trexlertown Road, which is designated SR 6100. US 222 was moved onto <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> on September 28, 2007 following the extension of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> east to allow US 222 to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> community. <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> cost $144 million to build. In 1988, plans were made to <b>bypass</b> <b>the</b> section of PA 100 through Eagle which was narrow and suffered from traffic congestion. A <b>bypass</b> to <b>the</b> east of the community was proposed as opposed to adding turn lanes along the existing route as the latter would have required the demolition of several buildings. <b>The</b> Eagle <b>Bypass</b> was delayed for years by funding issues. Construction on <b>the</b> Eagle <b>Bypass</b> was slated to begin in 2003. <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> was completed between Byers Road and PA 100 north of Eagle in fall 2005. The remainder of <b>the</b> <b>bypass</b> south to PA 100 south of Eagle was completed on August 19, 2009. <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> was called Graphite Mine Road and is designated as SR 1055. PA 100 continues to follow Pottstown Pike {{through the center of}} Eagle.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> highway <b>bypasses</b> <b>the</b> {{center of}} Gryazovets and {{runs into the}} center of Vologda. The ring road was built in <b>the</b> 2000s which <b>bypasses</b> <b>the</b> center of Vologda from the north, {{crossing}} the Vologda River. M8 runs further in <b>the</b> northern direction, <b>bypassing</b> <b>the</b> center of Sokol (it crosses the Sukhona River in the village of Vasyutino southwest of Sokol) and running through the center of Kadnikov. It further passes through the selo and the district center of Syamzha and bypasses Verkhovazhye before entering Arkhangelsk Oblast.|$|R
50|$|PA 228 <b>bypasses</b> <b>the</b> town of Mars.|$|R
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} again, Gretelle slowed in the Mozambique Channel. A cold front <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> storm to the south, and a building ridge behind it turned Gretelle to a west-northwest drift. Although it approached southeastern Africa on January28, an advancing trough turned the storm to the southeast. The next day, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Gretelle to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, and on January30, the MFO estimated a secondary 10minute wind peak of 85km/h (50mph). Accelerating to the south-southeast, Gretelle dissipated on January31 well to the south-southwest of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} assigned, NY132 <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> {{center of}} Yorktown Heights to the north. This was changed by 1932 as NY132 was realigned to directly serve the hamlet {{by way of}} Crompond and Saw Mill River roads. In the early 1940s, all of NY132 east of Yorktown became part of NY35, a new cross-county route extending from Peekskill to the Connecticut state line. As a result, NY132 was truncated to its junction with NY35 and US202 in the hamlet of Yorktown. NY132's northern terminus was moved a short distance northward between 1968 and 1973 {{as a result of}} the re-alignment of US6 through Yorktown. Prior to being called Old Yorktown Road, most of NY132 was named Crompond Street.|$|E
5|$|Canopy Development, a green {{development}} company from Northampton, Massachusetts, owns {{a portion of}} the former rail bed in Rosendale. It has agreed to establish a right-of-way, rerouting the trail to allow public access. Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool, which will be <b>bypassed.</b> <b>The</b> Mohonk Preserve and Open Space Conservancy were given a $20,000 state grant in March 2011 to maintain the portion of the trail by Kingston. By the end of summer 2013, the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale-Kingston extension was opened to the public, completing the entire 23.7 mile rail trail.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> idea of <b>bypasses</b> predates <b>the</b> use {{of motor}} vehicles. The first (northern) London <b>bypass,</b> <b>the</b> present Marylebone Road between Paddington and Islington, {{was started in}} 1756.|$|R
50|$|In February 2010, the Tasmanian Government {{approved}} {{the construction of}} the 2.8 km Kingston <b>Bypass.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bypass</b> includes <b>the</b> Summerleas Road underpass, Algona Road roundabout and dedicated cycle lanes.|$|R

5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{ten years}} after the eastern {{extension}} of Route 37 was canceled, RIDOT began planning studies for a western extension of the freeway. The expressway was included in a proposal to extend I-84 eastward from Hartford, Connecticut to Providence; more northern alignments for the freeway had been rejected due to concerns of potential damage to the Scituate Reservoir. The southern routing of I-84, which would have utilized Route 37 and terminated in Warwick, largely <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> reservoir's watershed. In 1982, however, I-84 was officially canceled by RIDOT after studies indicated that the southern alignment was not a feasible alternative.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 44 was {{replaced}} by US 130 north of the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach in Deepwater and by Route 49 south of there. However, US 130 was moved to new freeway alignments around Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville. The bypassed alignments of US 130, originally unnumbered, eventually became Route 44. After I-295 {{was built in the}} 1960s, it <b>bypassed</b> <b>the</b> portion of the US 130 freeway in Bridgeport and was designated along the US 130 freeway north to Westville and around Carneys Point. US 130 was moved back onto its old alignment in Carneys Point, replacing that portion of Route 44.|$|E
50|$|National {{secondary}} roads {{generally do}} not bypass towns on their routes although {{there are a number}} of exceptions: <b>the</b> N52 <b>bypasses</b> Nenagh, Mullingar and the centre of Dundalk (as a relief road) with a further N52 bypass of Tullamore planned, the N55 (along with <b>the</b> N3) <b>bypasses</b> Cavan, <b>the</b> N56 forms part of <b>the</b> Donegal <b>bypass,</b> <b>the</b> N61 and <b>the</b> N63 <b>bypass</b> Roscommon, <b>the</b> N71 <b>bypasses</b> Halfway and Skibbereen, <b>the</b> N74 <b>bypasses</b> Cashel, <b>the</b> N76 <b>bypasses</b> Callan, <b>the</b> N77 forms the northern part of the Kilkenny ring road, <b>the</b> N80 <b>bypasses</b> Carlow and <b>the</b> N85 <b>bypasses</b> Ennis.
