For this purpose, <b>banana</b> <b>flour</b> is often used raw, for example as an ingredient in smoothies, because cooking reduces the resistant starch content.

Many unripe green bananas are culled and thrown out as unsuitable for sale or export.

Thus banana producers will be able to secure greater profits from their crops, the environmental impact of those crops would be reduced, and world food production would be increased as a once wasted food stuff would now be utilized. Chilean officials have started production of an overripe <b>banana</b> <b>flour</b> made from overripe banana peels and the overripe banana fruit.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} kefir and banana pulp and skin flours on the serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c and triacylglycerols in rats fed cholesterol-rich diet. METHODS: Thirty Male Wistar rats were used. In the first 21 days, the animals were fed purified hypercholesterolemic diets, except the standard group. In the next 21 days, the animals were given modified diets: Group GC: standard diet AIN- 93 G; Group HIP: hypercholesterolemic diet; Group F: hypercholesterolemic diet added of 1 % of <b>banana</b> skin <b>flour</b> and 7 % of banana pulp flour; Group Q: hypercholesterolemic diet plus kefir suspension by oral infusion (1. 5 ml/animal); Group FQ: hypercholesterolemic diet added of 1 % <b>banana</b> skin <b>flour</b> and 7 % of <b>banana</b> pulp <b>flour</b> plus kefir suspension (1. 5 ml/animal). RESULTS: In spite of the high fiber content, the addition of banana pulp (7 %) and skin (1 %) flour did not alter the plasma levels of total cholesterol, HDL-c and LDL-c.
