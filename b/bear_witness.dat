5|$|Isa's {{relations}} with Baybars were generally on good terms, {{though there were}} occasional exceptions.

5|$|The lantern as {{a source}} of {{illumination}} in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio. Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E

25|$|Quakers <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> or {{testify to}} their {{religious}} beliefs in their spiritual lives, drawing on the James advice that faith by itself, {{if it is not}} accompanied by action, is dead. This religious witness is rooted in their immediate experience of God and verified by the Bible, especially in Jesus Christ's life and teachings. They may <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> in many ways, according to how they believe God is leading them. Although Quakers share how they relate to God and the world, mirroring Christian ethical codes, for example the Sermon on the Mount or the Sermon on the Plain, Friends argue that they feel personally moved by God rather than following an ethical code.|$|E
