40|$|The IEEE 1149. 4 Standard for a Mixed-Signal (MS) Test Bus proposes an {{extension}} to the well-accepted IEEE 1149. 1 boundary-scan test architecture, {{with the objective}} of facilitating interconnect, parametric and internal testing of MS circuits. An Analog Test Access Port (ATAP) comprising two pins called AT 1 and AT 2, and an internal analog bus (AB) comprising two lines (AB 1, AB 2), enable analog test stimulae and responses to be routed to any pin possessing an Analog Boundary Module (ABMs replace the IEEE 1149. 1 test cells in the case of analog pins). A Test <b>Bus</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Circuit</b> (TBIC) comprising ten analog switches defines how the ATAP and the internal analog bus are (dis) connected, and the six analog switches in each ABM define what connections should be established between the pin, the core circuitry, and the internal analog bus.

The microinstrumentation system is to be fabricated using the Multi-Chip-Module (MCM) technology based on a chip-level infrastructure. A standard silicon platform is the floorplan for individual smart sensor die attachment and an on-chip local sensor <b>bus</b> <b>interface,</b> testing facilities, optional compatible sensors (such as thermal sensors). The microinstrumentation system is controlled by a MCU with several modes of low-power operation (inclusive stand-by mode). As the intended application requires a huge amount of data-processing, a RISC-type MCU architecture is to be used. The MCU communicates with the front-end sensors via a two-line (clock and data lines) intramodule sensor bus (Integrated Smart Sensor bus). The sensor scan rate is adaptive and can be event triggered. This upgraded version of the ISS bus allows: service and interrupt request from the sensors, test and calibration facilities. However, the additional functionality requires a third line. The MCU also controls the power consumption and the thermal budget of all system. This paper also presents three applications for the microinstrumentation system: condition monitoring of machines, an inertial navigation system and a miniature spectrometer.
