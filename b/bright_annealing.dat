After a general description of the need of such a kind of process in comparison with the classical furnace treatment, a typical installation of in-line induction BA is discussed.

40|$|Cold rolled SS is also fruitfully used in {{deep drawing}} however the {{presence}} of scales or oxides on the surface reduces {{the life of the}} tools and emphasises creep phenomena of the material. Then a cleaning of the SS surface from these impurities is necessary. Oxides can be formed during the hot rolling preceding the cold one, or during the annealing performed between the several steps of thickness reduction. The annealing helps to decrease the work hardening occurring during the process. Normally this heat treatment is performed in reducing atmosphere of pure hydrogen (<b>bright</b> <b>annealing),</b> but even in this conditions oxides are formed on the SS surface. To avoid this uncontrolled oxide growth one method recently applied is an electrochemical cleaning performed in an electrolytic solution containing chrome, generally called electrochemical passivation. The electrochemical passivation allows the dissolution of the contaminating hard particles on the strips. Few scientific contributions are available in literature, which explain in detail the process mechanism. The aim of this work is to investigate if the electrochemical passivated surface acts in a different way with regard to corrosion phenomena with respect to conventional SS. Electrochemical measurements like polarisations, chronoamperometries and surface analysis were used to investigate the corrosion behaviour of electrochemically passivated AISI 304 L and AISI 305. The effect of some process parameters were considered, too...|$|E

40|$|Stainless steels {{are used}} {{in an array of}} {{applications}} where their ability to take on colour is of aesthetic value. Although thermal colouring (heat tinting) is known, particularly in terms of its effect on welds, the surface development of thermally coloured stainless steel has not been considered in detail. This paper demonstrates the colour development of a <b>bright</b> <b>annealed</b> 304 stainless steel with time at temperature. The colour development has been quantified using colour spectrophotoscopy and the colour related to the growth of surface oxide features by scanning electron microscopy and the chemical profiles by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

40|$|Coatings of CeO 2 {{derived from}} {{inorganic}} sol-gel dispersions {{were applied to}} type 304 <b>bright</b> <b>annealed</b> stainless steel (British Standard 1449 type 304 S 31) coupons and subjected to heat treatments at 450 and 550 degrees C. The coatings, 0. 5 mu m thick, were transparent, adherent, and stable. The aqueous corrosion properties of the coated coupons in 1 molar NaCl were then studied by potentiodynamic polarization measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The derived corrosion parameters were then compared with similarly heat-treated, uncoated 304 SS coupons. The {{results indicate that the}} application of a CeO 2 coating, heat treated at 550 degrees C, improves the corrosion rate as compared to an uncoated heat-treated coupon. The polarization curve for the 450 degrees C heat-treated, coated coupon showed passive behavior compared to transpassive for the uncoated specimen. The impedance spectrum data for the uncoated, as-received coupon could be modeled using a resistor in series with a parallel capacitor resistor combination "Randles" equivalent circuit. A coated coupon, heat treated at 550 degrees C, could be modeled using a more complex equivalent circuit involving a constant phase element, due to the CeO 2 coating. Modeling of the impedance characteristics for the oxidized coupons required the addition of a second series element consisting of a parallel resistor capacitor combination to give a Chi square statistic fit of chi(2) < 5 x 10 (- 4) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} mechanisms of pit elimination in strip drawing and rolling of stainless steel strips. Strip drawing tests with artificial in-dents confirm the role of micro-plasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (MPHL) in allowing pits to be reduced in size and depth. The similarity of results for two oils, which differ in viscosity {{by a factor of}} 10, is attributed to the fact that oil is drawn out of the pits rather easily, so that the behavior tends to the unlubricated case. Similar behavior is observed for strip drawing of shot blast white hot band. For much smoother <b>bright</b> <b>anneal</b> strip, it is suggested that the presence of an oil film in the unpitted region prevents generation of pressure differences between the pits and the unpitted regions. A comparison of strip-drawn and cold-rolled stainless steel samples show that the change in pit area and Rq roughness varies with overall reduction in a remarkably similar way. The reason for such similar behavior is attributed to the absence of hydrodynamic action in preventing pit elimination, albeit for opposite reasons. The similar rate of pit evolution in both cases confirms the usefulness of the strip drawing rig as a tool to model the change of surface topography during rolling, as long as care is taken in matching the regimes of lubrica-tion.

40|$|International audienceElectric charges at {{the surface}} of a passive {{stainless}} steel are generally considered as concentrated either in the passive film itself, or at the metal/passive film interface, or in the electrical double layer at the film solution interface. Rest potential time dependence after immersion of a passive surface in aqueous electrolytes suggests however that slow processes occur in the onset of the surface charge. Specific experiments, such as streaming potential measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a thin electrolyte cell, were carried out for understanding better this phenomenon. An AISI 304 type austenitic stainless steel with polished or <b>bright</b> <b>annealed</b> surface finishes was immersed in NaCl aqueous solutions with various pH and chloride concentrations. The streaming potential time evolution shows two steps: a first rapid one (~ 2 min) is attributed to the onset of the surface charge. The second step is much slower (approximately several hours) and possibly due to an interphase layer between the passive film and the solution. Following this idea, the whole kinetics is controlled by cation migration across the interphase when the pH is larger than the isoelectric pH (pH iep), while chloride ions are incorporated in the interphase when pHÂ  iep. Impedance measurements allow determining both the kinetics of charge transport and the thin cell conductivity. When glass is used as reference material for the cell walls instead of stainless steel, the Nyquist plots show a high-frequency response. For stainless steel cell walls, a low-frequency response is observed, attributed to a slow charge reorganisation inside the interphase layer. The charge distribution at metal/electrolyte interface is discussed in terms of a gel-like layer which possibly takes place at the passive film/electrolyte interface...|$|R
40|$|Under ideal {{conditions}} ion plating produces finely grained dense coatings with excellent adhesion. The ion bombardment induced damage initiates {{a large number}} of small nuclei. Simultaneous coating and sputtering stimulates high rates of diffusion and forms an interfacial region of graded composition responsible for good adhesion. To obtain such coatings on components far industrial applications, the design and construction Of an ion plater with a 24 " (O. 6 rn) diameter chamber were investigated and modifications of the electron beam gun were proposed. A 12 " (O. 3 m) diameter ion plater was designed and constructed. The equipment was used to develop surfaces for solar energy applications. The conditions to give extended surfaces by sputter etching were studied. Austenitic stainless steel was sputter etched at 20 and 30 mTorr working pressure and at 3, 4 and 5 kV. Uniform etching was achieved by redesigning the specimen holder to give a uniform electrostatic field over the surfaces of the specimens. Surface protrusions were observed after sputter etching. They were caused by the sputter process and were independent of grain boundaries, surface contaminants and inclusions. The sputtering rate of stainless steel was highly dependent on the background pressure which should be kept below 10 - 5 Torr. Sputter etching improved the performance of stainless steel used as a solar selective surface. A twofold improvement was achieved on sputter etching <b>bright</b> <b>annealed</b> stainless steel. However, there was only slight improvement after sputter etching stainless steel which had been mechanically polished to a mirror finish. Cooling curves Were used to measure the thermal emittance of specimens. The deposition rate of copper was measured at different levels of power input and was found to be a maximum at 9. 5 kW. The diameter of the copper feed rod was found to be critical for the maintenance of a uniform evaporation rate...|$|R
40|$|Viable {{bacteria}} on hard, open {{surfaces are}} usually present alongside some organic (or inorganic) material, typically at the solid-air interface. Even if not multiplying, the presence ofthese viable cells presents {{a risk to}} overall hygiene levels. Stainless steel is typically the material ofchoice as a hygienic surface, being hard, inert and easy to clean. Properties ofc 1 eanability in addition to ease of disinfection are key {{in the evaluation of}} hygienic surfaces. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the hygienic status and cIeanability ofstainless steel surfaces under test conditions which more closely resemble the environment under investigation, by monitoring survival at the solid-air (rather than solid-liquid) interface, in the presence oforganic material. A range ofmethods were developed: - A synthetic fingerprint emulsion was developed by combining and modifYing published standard sweat and sebum formulations. The formulation allowed survival of large, but decreasing suspended populations ofStaphylococcus aureus and Esche'richia coli, for up to 48 h, but on surfaces, no viable cells were recovered - in contrast to observations using real fingerprints. Thus the published formulation, which had been developed for physical/chemical testing, was not appropriate for combination with microorganisms, although was used to evaluate sUrface c 1 eanability. Results showed the importance of combining p!J,ysical and chemical cleaning strategies. - A 'hard-to-remove' surface soil Cburnt on' milk) was more effectively removed from the smoother oftwo stainless steel surfaces tested (<b>bright</b> <b>annealed),</b> particularly when cleaning parallel to, rather than across, linear surface features. - The requirement for moisture to release active agents from proposed antibacterial surfaces was demonstrated for a silver-containing polymer-coated stainless steel, by monitoring microbial survival at the solid-air interface for up to 3 weeks. Key parameters affecting hygienic status and cleanability were combined to assess the hygienic performance of stainless steel and copper, the latter of which had showed strong antibacterial activity when exposed to cells in nutrient broth. The test included repeated soiling and cleaning cycles, daily for 5 days, with a suspension ofSaureus in bovine serum albumen, inoculated onto three stainless steels of different surface finish, and copper. After the second and subsequent soiling, a layer of material readily stained with the fluorescent dye acridine orange, wasupparent on the copper surface, and any antibacterial effects were absent. Stainless steel, however, remained highly cleanable. A range of methods have been developed which enable the screening of proposed hygienic and/or antibacterial surfaces, combined with a variety ofcleaning and disinfection protocols, under challenging environinental conditions. All commercially available stainless steel finishes tested were comparable in terms of hygienic status (removal ofmicroorganisms), but even a small increase in surface topography (Ra = 20 to 100 nm) resulted in increased retention of organic soil. Thus cleanability remains a key step in ensuring maintenance of hygienic status, and an inert and highly cleanable surface provides the best option in this context.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the crystallization behaviour of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was undertaken. Determination of the equilibrium melting temperature showed a six degree difference between the equilibrium melting of a hydroxy terminated polymer (PDMS-OH, Tmo = 266 K, M w = 92. 9 kg mol- 1) over that of a trimethylsilyl terminated polymer (PDMS-CH 3, Tmo = 260 K, Mw = 100 kg mol- 1). The inherent flexibility of the Si-O linkage of these polymers caused crystallization to be first detected at Tmo - 35 K, and was recorded down to 177 K, i. e., Tg + 30 K. Both systems followed well behaved regime III surface nucleation kinetics. The average fold interfacial surface free energy, sigmae, was calculated to be 17. 6 erg cm - 2 and resulted in a very low value for the work of chain folding, q, calculated to be 14. 6 kJ mol- 1. This is in accord with the small rotational barrier of the siloxane backbone. In addition, PDMS-OH crystallized with slower kinetics than PDMS-CH 3, verified by chemical conversion from the hydroxy to trimethylsilyl end group. The first reported detection of two different PDMS solid state morphologies is presented. A small population of very low birefringent (Deltan) spherulites was observed to nucleate simultaneously with a majority of bright positive Deltan spherulites throughout the accessible crystallization temperature range. The sign of Deltan of these darker spherulites varied with growth, and this growth rate was depressed from that of the <b>bright</b> spherulites. Calorimetric <b>annealing</b> experiments indicate that the PDMS system attains very high percent crystallinities very early after nucleation. Coupled with the results of small angle laser light scattering (SALLS) during slow (1 deg/min) melting, secondary crystallization processes were observed to be non-negligible very soon after primary crystallization. SALLS of the crystallizing PDMS system was sensitive to the concurrent effects of (i) the presence of dark spherulites, (ii) secondary crystallization, and (iii) the distribution of spherulite sizes. These combined effects generated significant non-ideality within V v and Hv scattering envelopes. The effects of (i) and (ii) caused both the Vv pattern to remain circularly symmetric throughout the entire crystallization timeframe, and the 4 -leaf clover pattern of the Hv mode scattering to contain multiple intensity maxima not restricted to an azimuthal angle of 45 Â°. The effect of (iii) was to lower the calculated SALLS average radial growth rate relative to that observed optically...|$|R
