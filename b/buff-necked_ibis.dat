50|$|The area got {{its name}} from a species of birds present in this area, known also as <b>Buff-necked</b> <b>ibis.</b>|$|E
50|$|With a large {{range and}} an {{estimated}} population of 25,000 to 100,000, the <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis</b> is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
50|$|The similar <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis</b> {{is almost}} entirely {{restricted}} to warm regions, has contrasting large white wing-patches, a dark grey (not buff) lower chest, and its throat-wattle is smaller than in the black-faced ibis.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is also a}} birdwatching {{destination}} with sitings of {{the torrent}} duck (pato correntino), the Magellanic woodpecker (carpintero negro), the Chilean pigeon (torcaza), the hued-hued (huet-huet), the Andean condor, the great grebe (huala), the house wren (chercán) and the <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis</b> (bandurria).|$|E
50|$|The <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis</b> (Theristicus caudatus), {{also known}} as the white-throated ibis, is a fairly large ibis found widely in open {{habitats}} of eastern and northern South America. It formerly included the similar black-faced ibis as a subspecies, but that species is almost entirely restricted to colder parts of South America, has a buff (not dark grey) lower chest, and lacks the contrasting large white wing-patches.|$|E
5000|$|The black-faced ibis (Theristicus melanopis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Threskiornithidae. It is found in {{grassland}} and fields in southern and western South America. It has been included as a subspecies of the similar <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis,</b> but today all major authorities accept the split. The black-faced ibis also included the Andean ibis (T. branickii) as a subspecies. Some taxonomic authorities (including the American Ornithological Society) still do so.|$|E
50|$|When {{he first}} {{described}} the green ibis in 1789, from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana, Johann Friedrich Gmelin {{gave it the}} scientific name Tantalus cayennensis, assigning it to the same genus {{as a number of}} Old World ibis species. In 1930, James Lee Peters moved it to the monotypic genus Mesembrinibis; it has no subspecies. DNA-DNA hybridization studies show that the species falls squarely into the New World ibis clade, with its closest relatives being the sharp-tailed ibis, the American white ibis and the <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like the {{sympatric}} glossy ibis, the {{sharp-tailed ibis}} largely feeds terrestrially or semi-terrestrially; either on open land or in short grass. It typically forages in moist soil, shallow mud and along marshy edges of lagoons and rice fields. However, it also occasionally forages {{in shallow water}} at depths of 3 cm or less. It is less aquatic in its feeding habits than many other South American Ibises. Throughout the sharp-tailed ibis’s range, only the <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis</b> forages on drier, higher-altitude ground. More rarely, the sharp-tailed ibis has been observed to forage in gallery forests during the wet season.|$|E
50|$|The <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis</b> {{lives in}} a wide range of open habitats, {{including}} fields, marshes, savanna and grassland. There are two primary populations; the nominate subspecies is found across northern and central South America in Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas and Brazil, while the very similar subspecies hyperorius is found in south-central South America in southern Brazil, eastern and northern Bolivia, Paraguay, southern Chile, Uruguay, and northern Argentina. It is almost entirely restricted to tropical and warmer subtropical lowlands, but very locally it extends into highlands (though never as high as the Andean ibis). It is almost entirely resident, although local movements may occur. It has been recorded as an accidental visitor in Panama.|$|E
50|$|Most birds {{found in}} the Cerrado breed there {{although}} there are some Austral migrants (breed in temperate South America and winter in the Amazon basin) and Nearctic migrants (breed in temperate North America and winter in the Neotropics) that pass through. Most breeding birds in the Cerrado are found in more closed canopy areas like gallery forests although 27% of the birds breed only in open habitats and 21% breed in either open or closed habitats. Many of the birds in the Cerrado, especially those found in closed forest, are related to species from the Atlantic rainforest and also the Amazon rainforest. The crowned solitary eagle, hyacinth macaw, toco toucan, <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis,</b> dwarf tinamou, and Brazilian merganser are examples of birds {{found in the}} Cerrado.|$|E
50|$|This notably large ibis {{measures}} 71-77 cm in length, with a wing {{length of}} 397-450mm in males and 360-406mm in females. The culmen length is 145-167mm in males, and 126-147mm in females. The sexes appear similar, but the female is slightly smaller. The plumbeous ibis is easily recognisable through a distinctive shaggy crest comprising long grey plumes that extend {{from the back}} of head 10 cm down the nape. A prominent, narrow, white feathered band also extends around the forehead, which has earned this species the German common name Stirnbandibis (headband ibis). Overall, it is readily distinguishable in the field from other ibises by its solid colouration and thick neck. The plumbeous ibis is the most morphologically similar to the sympatric <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis</b> Theresticus caudatus, but differs in colouration and neck structure.|$|E
5000|$|The plumbeous ibis often feeds solitarily or in pairs, but may {{assemble}} {{in loose}} flocks to forage in winter when food is scarcer. Individuals {{have also been}} found foraging together with white-faced ibises and jacanas. The plumbeous ibis’s typical foraging strategy consists in walking slowly through shallow mud and water, probing fast and repeatedly with its bill in the water in search of prey. Its bill is sometimes completely submerged {{in the water and}} its aquatic foraging habits ecologically distinguishes it from the related, sympatric <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis</b> which preferentially forages in adjacent dry grassland; although the breeding biology of these two species is regarded to be similar. [...] Both parents feed the young by regurgitation. Chicks induce the parent to feed them by prodding their bills into the gap between the upper and lower mandibles of the parent’s bill. Thereupon, the parent regurgitates food for the nestlings with head movements during which the young hang onto the parent with their bills and sway passively with such movements. With age, the juveniles become more independent in food acquisition as they begin to leave the nest, and are fed less frequently.|$|E
40|$|We {{observed}} six {{species of}} raptors: Black-chested Buzzard-eagle (Geranoaetus melanoleucus), Cinereous Harrier (Circus cinereus), Red-backed Hawk (Buteo polyosoma), Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango), Crested Caracara (Polyborus plancus), and Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), nesting at <b>Buff-necked</b> <b>Ibis</b> (Theristicus caudatus) colonies in northern Argentinean Patagonia. Four {{out of these}} six species preyed upon <b>Buff-necked</b> <b>Ibis</b> nestlings and eggs. Ibis breeding success was not different when raptor species were present or absent from colonies. The association between raptors and ibises could be a consequence of generally low availability of colony sites where raptors are absent. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Theristicus caudatus {{breeding}} in Uruguay. The <b>Buff-necked</b> <b>Ibis</b> {{is considered}} a summer visitant in northem Uruguay (Cuello yGerzenstein 1962. Gore y Gepp 1978). On December 12. 1987. a nest with four whitegrayish chicks was discovered. It was placcd 15 metres above water level at a rocky wall of Laureles creek in the hilIy region at Tacurembó Departament. This confirms that the species or {{at least part of}} its population is resident in Uruguay...|$|E
40|$|In this study, serum {{samples of}} 53 wild animals from two {{different}} states from the southeast region of Brazil were analyzed {{for the presence of}} anti–Toxoplasma gondii antibodies by the modified agglutination test (MAT), with a cut-off of 1 : 5 for birds and of 1 : 25 for mammals. Out of the sampled animals, 27 were birds and 26 were mammals, and from this total, 83 % (n= 44) were free-living animals. Antibodies were found in 13 mammals, from which 11 were free-living animals, and in five birds, all of which were free-living. In this study, T. gondii antibodies were detected in four bird species (crested seriema, Cariama cristata; <b>buff-necked</b> <b>ibis,</b> Theristicus caudatus; picazuro pigeon, Patagioenas picazuro; and burrowing owl, Athene cunicularia) and in a giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) for the first time...|$|E
40|$|The subantarctic {{forests of}} South America are the world’s southernmost forested ecosystems.

40|$|In {{northern}} Argentinean Patagonia, <b>Buff-necked</b> <b>Ibis</b> (Theristicus caudatus) nest {{on different}} substrata: cliffs, trees, and marsh vegetation. According to the ideal-free distribution hypothesis, this polymorphism {{may be due}} to the occupation of the best breeding habitats by dominant individuals and the relegation of the subdominant birds to marginal substrata with a lower probability of achieving successful breeding. We investigated whether there were any variations in the breeding performance among colonies and whether these variations were related to the breeding substratum. Laying date varied from the third week of September to the last week of October, laying occurring earlier in colonies at lower elevations. Clutch size per colony varied between 1. 8 and 2. 0 (X 1. 9, n = 106), but significant differences were not detected among colonies. Brood size per colony varied significantly, ranging between 1. 3 and 2. 0 (x = 1. 8, n = 164). The substratum of breeding did not influence variations in any of these three parameters. The physical condition of the chicks did not vary among substrata, but there was inter-colony variation in broods of two chicks. Daily rates of nest losses were similar among colonies reaching 6. 2...|$|E
