5|$|German cinema {{has made}} major {{technical}} and artistic contributions to film. The first {{works of the}} Skladanowsky Brothers were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Berlin's suburb Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Today it is Europe's largest studio. Other early and still active studios include UFA and Bavaria Film. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) {{is referred to as}} the first major science-fiction film. In 1930 Josef von Sternberg directed The <b>Blue</b> <b>Angel,</b> the first major German sound film, with Marlene Dietrich. Films of Leni Riefenstahl set new artistic standards, in particular Triumph of the Will.|$|E
5|$|On February 19, 1930, Variety {{published}} the entire {{contents of the}} Code and predicted that state film censorship boards would soon become obsolete. However, the men obligated to enforce the code — Jason Joy, who {{was the head of}} the Committee until 1932, and his successor, Dr. James Wingate — were seen as generally ineffective. The very first film the office reviewed, The <b>Blue</b> <b>Angel,</b> which was passed by Joy without revision, was considered indecent by a California censor. Although there were several instances where Joy negotiated cuts from films, and there were indeed definite—albeit loose—constraints, a significant amount of lurid material made it to the screen.|$|E

25|$|Maintenance {{issues and}} {{additional}} near-fatal accidents {{put an end}} to <b>Blue</b> <b>Angel</b> Cutlass performances. While traveling to an airshow at Naval Air Station Glenview in Chicago, Illinois, both F7U's experienced in-flight emergencies. One of Feightner's engine's failed shortly after takeoff, but before he could land, Macknight's right engine caught fire and the left engine quit soon after. Although Feightner called for him to eject, Macknight stayed with the burning aircraft and landed at Glenview. With the runway closed, Feightner was redirected to make his landing at Chicago's former Orchard Airpark, which had been expanded and renamed O'Hare Airport. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. After yet another in-flight emergency resulted in a forced landing at Naval Air Station Memphis, the F7Us were given to the station's training center.|$|E

The movie was favorably reviewed, but not commercially successful. At the end of 1958, the National Board of Review named Tracy the year's Best Actor.

500|$|In 1927 {{developments}} in sound technology brought {{the arrival of}} [...] "talking pictures".

Music could now be aligned specifically with the film's on-screen action—the so-called [...] "diegetic" [...] approach. Early pioneers of this method were the Germans Friedrich Hollaender and Karol Rathaus, who provided the music for The <b>Blue</b> <b>Angel</b> (1930) and The Murderer Dimitri Karamazov (1931) respectively. By {{this time in the}} Soviet Union, the young Dimitri Shostakovich had already begun his prolific career as a composer of film sound-tracks, with The New Babylon in 1929 and Alone in 1931.|$|E

Inside Madonna starts singing the song from the center of a carousel that revolves to display her to the gaze of the customers who are sitting safely in their cubicles. Madonna is dressed in a black bustier, spike heels, fishnets, revealing her new slimmed down body at that time. She begins the video wearing a black wig which she subsequently removes, revealing her short bleached hair. The bluish and dark lighting reveals her look as a mix of actresses Marlene Dietrich in the movie The <b>Blue</b> <b>Angel</b> as well as Liza Minnelli as the character Sally Bowles in the Bob Fosse-directed musical film, Cabaret.|$|E
