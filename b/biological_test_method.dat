Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The use of boron in wood preservatives has been growing since the 1930 s, primarily in various boric acid/borax mixtures. Boron preservatives have several advantages for application as wood preservatives including a broad spectrum of activity against insects and fungi, low mammalian toxicity, low volatility, and cost effectiveness. In addition, they are colorless, odorless and non-corrosive and nonflammable with favorable effects on wood's fire resistance. Boron treatment of wood provides excellent protection for aidoveground uses. However, boron treatment by itself has not been found to give adequate protection when wood is used in ground contact because of its leaching problem. This research examined the potential for decreasing the leachability of boron preservatives using water repellents. Southern pine (Pinus spp.) test samples were impregnated with several types and at different concentrations of borax/boric acid and PEG (Polyethylene glycol) mixture. Leachability performance of these treating solutions was determined. It was found that wood samples treated with boric acid or borax and then treated with PEG- 400 or PEG- 600 by double treatment method showed a significant increase in their water repellency and resistance to boron leaching. Protection performance of these treating solutions on native wood was also determined by soil-block and agar-block test methods. Weight loss by Lentinus lepideus and Poria monticola fungi and toxic threshold retention point for each treatment solution and <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> were determined. The type of soil effect on the soil-block test was determined. It was found that it {{does not appear to be}} sufficient to choose soils only on the basis of waterholding capacity, pH, and weight as indicated by the ASTM standards. The results found in this research will serve their purpose as far as they are made use of in the wood preservation industry...|$|E

Nymphal host plant species (and variety) significantly affected nymphal survival, nymphal development {{rate and the}} subsequent size and fecundity of adults, with fiddlewood (Citharexylum spinosum) being significantly best in all respects. Nymphs that developed on a relatively poor host (Duranta erecta var “geisha girl”) and which were moved to fiddlewood as adults laid significantly fewer eggs (mean ± SE = 836 ± 130) than those that developed solely on fiddlewood (1, 329 ± 105). Adults on geisha girl, regardless of having been reared as nymphs on fiddlewood or geisha girl, laid significantly fewer eggs (342 ± 83 and 317 ± 74, respectively) than adults on fiddlewood. A simple model that incorporates host plant related survival, development rate and fecundity suggests that the population dynamics of A. compressa are governed mainly by fiddlewood, the primary host.

Cultivar Mira has resistance against Ro 1 pathotype G. rostochiensis. Cultivars Ornela and Tábor are susceptible to Ro 1. Seedlings of F 1 generations were used for analyses. Plants were cultivated in greenhouse. DNA was isolated from tissue discs by GenElute Plant Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma, SRN). PCR marker of major gene H 1 was used for bulked analyses, according to (Niewöhner et al. 1995). Size of this marker was 760 bp.

40|$|The {{study of}} substances, {{concerning}} their potential inhalative toxicology, traditionally follows from in vivo animal experimentation studies. For financial, temporal and ethical reasons {{even in this}} field of toxicology an increasing search of alternative <b>test</b> <b>methods,</b> which can generate reliable data, takes place. Conventional in vitro <b>methods</b> provide the <b>testing</b> of substances, which are dissolved in medium. This <b>test</b> <b>method,</b> termed as submerged exposure, neither matches the physiological conditions in the lung, nor describes the inhalative exposure appropriately. The aim of this bachelor thesis was to establish and verify an experimental approach {{for the study of}} inhalable test substances with selected model substances {{on the basis of a}} novel, device-based in vitro <b>test</b> <b>method.</b> Developed at the Fraunhofer ITEM, the P. R. I. T. ®-ExpoCube enables the exposure of a <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system to airborne substances, simulating in vivo-like conditions. The human originated A 549 cell line served as <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> system, whereas it has characteristics of alveolar lung epithelial cells. The target cells were cultured under so-called air/liquid interface (ALI-) conditions on microporous cell culture inserts, in which the cells were supplied basolaterally with culture medium and exposed apically with a test aerosol. Previously the model substance aerosols were physically characterised by using a cascade impactor. Based on the data of the submerged testing, SDS (positive substance) and NaCl (negative substance) were selected from the six model substance candidates SDS, CuSO 4, LiCl, 5 -Fluorouracil, NaCl and lactose. These two model substances were used in the device-based method. After aerosolisation and deposition on the target cells under ALI-conditions, dose-response curves were established. Resulting from these, effective dose (ED) values were determined for the aerosolised model substances and compared with the ED values of the submerged testing. The particle sizes of the generated model aerosols ranged between 389 - 1580 nm. A toxicity ranking was derrived from the results of the conventional <b>test</b> <b>method</b> with dissolved model substances. This corresponded to the results of the ranking, obtained with the same model substances after aerosolisation and deposition under ALI-conditions and proved as a consequence the plausibility of this method. The results of the present study attest the general feasibility and the high potential of this in vitro <b>test</b> <b>method</b> for applications in the field of inhalation toxicology.

40|$|Europe is {{introducing}} a new regulatory system (REACH) for management of chemicals. The overriding {{objective is to}} ensure protection of {{human health and the}} environment and at the same time have a control of the flow of use of chemicals in the Society. An important component in REACH is extended hazard assessment for chemicals in use of more than 1 ton/year. Approximately 30. 000 chemicals fall in this group. Information on toxicity and the biological behaviour of chemicals has therefore a central position in REACH. This need leads to an increasing demand on <b>biological</b> <b>tests</b> and <b>test</b> <b>methods.</b> However, already in the starting instructions of REACH (Commission White Paper on a new Chemical legislation, EC 2001) it was stated that REACH should not lead to an increased use of test animals. Instead, REACH should stimulate the development of alternative methods and approaches. These include in vitro methods, in silico methods (QSAR, SAR) and the optimal use of information from one method to another, so called ¿read across¿. An intensive development is currently going on, particularly in the industry, to meet the REACH testing requirements in a cost-effective manner. In this chapter, we will evaluate how and if a 3 R based approach can be applied in testing of ecotoxicity of chemicals. The 3 R approach (reduce-refine-replace) is a strategy to reduce or totally abolish the use of experimental animals in favour of alternative methods. We review the current status of alternatives in aquatic ecotoxicology and how well they perform in comparison with current in vivo methods. We will conclude that theoretically can alternative methods and approaches replace animal based testing but the way to reach this goal is long. A strong development of more sophisticated alternative methods is needed focusing on specific and physiologically/toxicologically representative endpoints. We underline the importance to gain more information on toxic mechanisms of chemicals.

40|$|Summary. -Statistically {{significant}} correlations {{have been demonstrated}} between carcinogenic activity, toxicity and number of carbons per molecule for an extensive set of nitrosamines. Such correlations, involving only bulk molecular properties, indicate that the chemical nature of the alkyl substituents need not be the sole determinants of carcinogenic activity. These structure-activity relationships {{can be used to}} estimate carcinogenic activity with some degree of confidence. A MAJOR problem in both drug design and toxicology is the large number of compounds which require <b>biological</b> evalu-ation. Current <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> are time-consuming and expensive and, con-sequently, rapid preliminary proce-dures are needed for screening those compounds most likely to produce a particular biological response (Maugh, 1974 a, b). This problem has become increasingly important in the area of chemical car-cinogenesis as additional classes of chem-ical carcinogens, many of which are present in the environment, have become recognized (Maugh, 1974 a, b). Since in-vestigators understand neither the overall molecular factors responsible for carcino-genic effect, nor those causing the variations in behaviour from compound to compound (Magee and Barnes, 1967; Shoental, 1973), they cannot assess the potential danger of a newly synthesized member of a carcinogenic class or of one newly detected in the environment. Hansch and his associates have had notable success in predicting biological activities by the use of empirical relation-ships, which express a biological para-meter, such as a mean therapeutic dose (C), as a function of a nonbiological property, such as a water-octanol parti-tion coefficient (P) (Hansch and Fujita...|$|R

These factors favor {{the use of}} rigorous, quantitative monitoring of metabolic {{and nutritional}} diseases whenever possible. This paper will focus on strategies for testing and monitoring three critical diseases in dairy herds- subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA), ketosis, and parturient hypocalcemia (clinical plus subclinical milk fever). Enough quantitative data about these diseases is available {{to allow for the}} development of a herd-based testing scheme. Additionally, these three disorders are gateway conditions for other problems such as laminitis, displaced abomasum, impaired immune function, retained placenta, and cystic ovarian disease. Other metabolic diseases can be important problems in dairies (e. g., hypomagnesemia, udder edema, hypokalemia, etc), but these are less common disorders and there are limited published data available to permit the development of a testing scheme. 15 Sources of Error in Herd-Based <b>Testing.</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>tests</b> can be very useful in supporting other clinical evidence of a metabolic disease problem on a dairy. Veterinarians have tremendous experience in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the results of <b>biological</b> <b>tests.</b> However, <b>biological</b> <b>test</b> results do not stand alone in making herd-based decisions. <b>Biological</b> <b>test</b> results are subject to errors from inadequate sample size, improper sample handling, inappropriate time of sample collection relative t...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{agglutination}} with antiserum against lateral flagella (H-agglutination) for {{the identification}} of Vibrio parahaemolyticus was studied. Sucrose-negative bacteria were isolated from seawater, and their characterization {{was carried out by}} traditional <b>biological</b> <b>tests</b> and slide agglutination with antiserum specific to lateral flagella of V. parahaemolyticus. Of 135 strains isolated, 78 were identified as V. parahaemolyticus by <b>biological</b> <b>tests</b> and were agglutinated with the above serum. Fifty-five strains did not agglutinate with the serum, and their biological characteristics were different from those of V. parahaemolyticus. Two strains also differed from V. parahaemolyticus in some biological characteristics but agglutinated with the antiserum. All clinically isolated V. parahaemolyticus strains also agglutinated with the above serum. These results suggest that our serological method is useful for {{the identification of}} V. parahaemolyticus, especially for samples in which there are many organisms related to V. parahaemolyticus, because many <b>biological</b> <b>tests</b> can be omitted...|$|R
