5|$|After {{the judges}} {{returned}} home, Lawrence {{was made a}} Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> this as poor reward for the work he had put in at Nuremberg.|$|E

He was wounded several times {{over the course of}} the war, and won the Iron Cross, 2nd class, in 1915. Shortly before the war ended, Hess enrolled to train as an aviator, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> no action in this role. He left the armed forces in December 1918 with the rank of Leutnant der Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1550, Knox was {{appointed}} a preacher of St Nicholas' Church in Newcastle upon Tyne. The following year he {{was appointed}} {{one of the six}} royal chaplains serving the King. On 16 October 1551, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, overthrew the Duke of Somerset to become the new regent of the young King. Knox condemned the coup d'état in a sermon on All Saints Day. When Dudley visited Newcastle and listened to his preaching in June 1552, he had mixed feelings about the fire-brand preacher, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Knox as a potential asset. Knox was asked to come to London to preach before the Court. In his first sermon, he advocated a change for the second edition of the Book of Common Prayer. The liturgy required worshippers to kneel during communion. Knox and the other chaplains considered this to be idolatry. It triggered a debate where Archbishop Cranmer was called upon to defend the practice. The end result was a compromise in which the famous Black Rubric, which declared that no adoration is intended while kneeling, was included in the second edition.|$|E
25|$|As a gardener, Monier was not {{satisfied}} with the materials available for making flowerpots. Clay was easily broken and wood weathered badly and could be broken by the plant roots. Monier began making concrete pots and tubs, but these were not stable enough. In order to strengthen the concrete containers, he experimented with embedded iron mesh. He was not the first to experiment with reinforced concrete, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> some of the possibilities in the technique, and promoted it extensively.|$|E
25|$|Nelson's parents opposed his volunteering, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it as a {{patriotic}} duty. He sent half his soldier's pay {{to his parents}} to help retire the debt on the farm. He seems to have enjoyed army life, noting that the food was better than at home. He shared the frustration of his fellow soldiers over not being put into battle soon enough. His unit moved from Racine to Camp Dix near Baltimore, Maryland. From there they moved to combat operations in Louisiana.|$|E

25|$|He did not {{consider}} himself a materialist: the social question was not only an economic issue but also an ethical one. He rejected the concept of class struggle. He did not deny {{that there was a}} struggle, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it as the first stage of evolution, which was not be encouraged, but passed in favour of a greater spread of altruism. A position that proved irreconcilable with Marxism, which led him to adhere to the newborn Republican Party. He also opposed revolutionary syndicalism and severely criticized the general strike of 1904.|$|E
25|$|Britain {{found itself}} {{bound by the}} Westminster Convention and entered the war on the Prussian side. Newcastle was deeply {{reluctant}} to do this, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that a Prussian collapse would be disastrous to British and Hanoverian interests. The Anglo-Prussian Alliance was established, which saw large amounts of subsidy given to Prussia. Some supporters of George II were strong advocates of support for Prussia, as they saw {{it would be impossible}} to defend his realm of Hanover if they were to be defeated. Despite his initial dislike of Frederick, the King later moved towards this viewpoint.|$|E
25|$|In Political Justice Godwin had {{acknowledged}} that {{an increase in}} the standard of living as he envisioned could cause population pressures, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> an obvious solution to avoiding distress: “project a change in the structure of human action, if not of human nature, specifically the eclipsing of the desire for sex by the development of intellectual pleasures”. In the 1798 version of his essay, Malthus specifically rejected this possible change in human nature. In the second and subsequent editions, however, he wrote that widespread moral restraint, i.e., postponement of marriage and pre-nuptial celibacy (sexual abstinence), could reduce the tendency of a population to grow until distress was felt.".|$|E

25|$|Between January 26, 1864 and August 24, 1864, Mackall {{served as}} chief of staff in the Army of Tennessee under General Joseph E. Johnston. Mackall {{declined}} to serve with the Army of Tennessee when General John Bell Hood replaced General Johnston. After the end of his service with the Army of Tennessee on August 24, 1864, Mackall was inactive at Macon, Georgia. He was in command of Confederate forces in south Georgia between March 23, 1865 and April 20, 1865, when he was captured by Union troops at Macon, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> no active service during this time. No record of his parole has been found.|$|E
25|$|When Banda {{returned}} to Nyasaland, {{which he had}} left in 1915, he was over 60. Chipembere and Chiume and most other leading Congress activists were in their late 20s or early 30s. As well as the age difference there was, from the start, a disagreement about Banda's role: the activists saw him as a figurehead, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> himself {{as the leader of}} Congress and expected their obedience. Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise more moderate in his speeches that the younger Congress members. Both Chipembere and Chiume avoided social contact with Europeans and, in their speeches, they frequently denounced Europeans as a group, in contrast to Banda's relatively cordial relations with individual Europeans.|$|E
25|$|In , AGS {{started with}} a new car, the JH23, and Philippe Streiff as the team's only driver. Streiff drove quite powerfully and {{qualified}} well, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the chequered flag only four times; in all the other events of that year technical failures or accidents were recorded. Financially, the year started well and ended with a disaster. AGS had a solid sponsor - the French Bouygues group - which promised to support not only the racing activity but also {{the completion of a}} new factory outside Gonfaron. After AGS had started work on the new facility, Bouygues withdraw from the team, leaving Julien without any support. To save the team, he eventually had to sell it to Cyril de Rouvre, a French entrepreneur with various ambitions.|$|E

25|$|Thus, by the {{beginning}} of 1919 the positions taken up by those involved were fairly well defined. Robert Munro, himself a Highlander, believed passionately in the reinstatement of the crofts and he also felt strongly that the Westminster Parliament was unlikely to tolerate any departure from the implementation of land reform, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> no reason why Lewis should not have Leverhulme's industrial schemes as well as more crofts. Leverhulme refused to budge, believing that the break-up of his farms would lead to seriously inefficient, probably unsustainable, and ultimately abandoned smallholdings as crofters moved away in search of better incomes. Ranged against this at least ostensibly reasonable prediction was the formidable influence wielded by prospective crofters away fighting in France, as well as by supporters of the Highland League which was politically dedicated to land reform.|$|E
25|$|The German Navy was for Germany mainly an {{instrument}} for putting political pressure on Britain. Before the war, Germany would {{have been willing to}} cease or moderate its naval competition with Britain but only in return for a promise of its neutrality in any European conflict. Hitler attempted the same thing by different methods, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> only one side of the picture like other German politicians. It is clear from his writings that he was enormously impressed with the part played by the prewar naval rivalry in creating bad {{relations between the two countries}}. Thus, he argued that the removal of this rivalry all that was necessary to obtain good relations. By making a free gift of an absence of naval competition, he hoped that relations between the two countries would be so improved that Britain should not, in fact, find it necessary to interfere with Germany's continental policy.|$|E
25|$|Kashiide {{was born}} in February 1915 in the seacoast town of Kashiwazaki, Kariwa District, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. In February 1934, he {{enrolled}} as a cadet in the Imperial Japanese Army flying school in Tokorozawa, Saitama. He graduated in November 1935, then entered fighter pilot school at Akeno Army Flying School northeast of Ise, Mie. His first squadron assignment was the 1st Rentai, probably flying the Kawasaki Ki-10 biplane. Kashiide was posted to China in July 1938 with the 59th Sentai, flying the Nakajima Ki-27 Type 97 Nate fighter, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> little action in the Hankou area. In September 1939, he fought in the final Battles of Khalkhin Gol in Mongolia. During one sortie on 15 September, he fought against eight Polikarpov I-16s, downing two then breaking from the remaining six by flying away at tree-top altitude. He claimed a total of seven aerial victories in Mongolia to become a flying ace. His air unit was ordered back to Hankou.|$|E

25|$|Known {{throughout}} his career for maintaining an accurate line and length, McGrath's consistency enabled him {{to be one of}} the most economical and dangerous fast bowlers of his time. McGrath holds the world record for the highest number of Test wickets by a fast bowler and is fourth on the all-time list, with the top three wicket takers Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne, and Anil Kumble all being spin bowlers. He has also taken the seventh-highest number of one day international wickets (381), and holds the record for the most wickets in the Cricket World Cup. McGrath announced his retirement from Test cricket on 23December 2006, with his Test career coming to an end after the fifth Ashes test in Sydney in January 2007, whilst the 2007 World Cup marked the end of his one-day career, in which he won the man of the tournament award for his outstanding bowling which was instrumental in Australia winning the tournament. McGrath later played for the Indian Premier League team of the Delhi DareDevils, and was one of the tournaments' most economical bowlers during its first season, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> no action in the second season, ultimately having his contract bought out.|$|E
25|$|Casting {{the lead}} roles of Duck, You Sucker! {{proved to be}} a {{difficult}} process. The role of John Mallory was written for Jason Robards, who had played Cheyenne in Once Upon a Time in the West. However, the studio wanted a bigger name for his character. Clint Eastwood was then approached by Leone for the role, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it as just a different take of the same character he had already played in the Dollars Trilogy, and he also wanted to end his association with the Italian film industry. As a result, he declined the offer and starred in Hang 'Em High instead. George Lazenby was then approached to play John, but he declined. A young Malcolm McDowell, then mostly known for his performance in if...., was considered for both John and Nolan, John’s Irish friend, but Leone eventually settled on James Coburn to play John. Coburn had previously been considered for other Leone projects, including A Fistful of Dollars and Once Upon a Time in the West. He had also previously been considered for a role in another United Artists-financed Zapata Western, Sergio Corbucci's The Mercenary, but Franco Nero was later cast in what was originally his role.|$|E
