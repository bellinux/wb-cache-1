40|$|This master's thesis {{concerns}} driver models, with {{focus on}} non perfect driving. On {{the base of}} a black <b>box</b> <b>driver</b> behaviour model, perturbations are added for modelling lane drifting, non-alert driving (for example caused by sleepiness) and collision from behind. The driver models are developed and implemented for usage in an HIL environment. This means that both high and low level behaviour is considered. The running off road is modelled as a small steering wheel angle offset introduced with a smooth ramp. This has support in data from extensive field operation tests. The non alert driving is modelled both as driving with random input update frequency, and a sinusoidal steering wheel angle offset. These models are qualitatively compared to data corresponding to sleepy driving, recognised by a Driver Alert Control safety function. The behaviour connected to collisions from behind is modelled using Gipps' longitudinal model, with small presumed decelerations. The thesis also presents different low level model approaches, that is how a target vehicle motion is realised, in terms of pedal positions and steering wheel angle. Both PID and open loop methods are discussed. It is shown that PID controlling can give a very good resemblance between target and obtained motion, but also that a high correlation can be acquired without a good resemblance on the low level input...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{importance}} {{in the global economy}} and the availability of comprehensive data set, the motion picture industry has emerged as an important focus of research inquiry. A large amount of studies have been conducted to investigate the determinants of the box office revenues, and sequel is found to be a key factor in improving the box office performance of movies. In spite of the numerous studies concerning the motion picture industry, {{little is known about the}} specific <b>box</b> office <b>drivers</b> of motion picture sequels. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to (1) conceptualize movie sequels as brand extensions of an experiential product; (2) collect a data set comprising of both single movie sequels and multiple movie sequels to reveal <b>box</b> office <b>drivers</b> of movie sequels; (3) in terms of multiple movie sequels, how the box office performance of the most recent intervening sequels affects the box office revenue of the subsequent sequels and (4) what kind movie sequel is amenable to success. A linear regression model approach is adopted to address this research topic. The results indicate that: (1) the box office performance of the parent movie is positively related to the success of the sequel; (2) the box office revenue of a movie sequel is influenced by its naming strategy; (3) PG- 13 rated movie sequels are more amenable to success...|$|R

5000|$|There {{have been}} four {{recorded}} accidents at Three Bridges station, {{the first two}} of which were relatively minor and involved no injuries. On 12 April 1858 an engine collided with passenger carriages, and on 18 October 1863 an excursion train hit the buffer stops. Two members of station staff died on 13 December 1868 from an explosion of naphtha in a truck of a goods train. [...] On 28 January 1933 an electric train crashed {{into the back of}} a steam freight train waiting at the signal <b>box.</b> The <b>driver</b> of the electric train and the guard of the freight train were both seriously injured.|$|R
60|$|A {{man in a}} loose white great coat, his countenance {{concealed}} by a shawl {{which was}} wound round his neck and by his slouched hat, assisted Sybil into the coach, and pressed her hand {{at the same time}} with great tenderness. Then he mounted the <b>box</b> by the <b>driver</b> and ordered him {{to make the best of}} his way to Smith's Square.|$|R
60|$|The {{coach was}} {{punctual}} {{to the time}} appointed; and Mr. Weller, after duly installing Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle inside, took his seat on the <b>box</b> by the <b>driver.</b> They alighted, as had been agreed on, {{about a quarter of}} a mile from the place of rendezvous, and desiring the coachman to await their return, proceeded the remaining distance on foot.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{technology}} such as {{signal post}} telephones, in-cab radio, and mobile phones {{means that it}} is rarely necessary for train crew to visit the signal <b>box.</b> Indeed the <b>driver</b> does not even need {{to speak to the}} signaller as pressing the [...] "SG" [...] button on CSR and GSM-R radios will send a [...] "Train standing at signal" [...] text message.|$|R
60|$|Geoffrey wrote a line {{in pencil}} on his card, and sent it into the house by the driver. After waiting some minutes, a lad {{appeared}} and touched his hat.

50|$|His father Joe Petty and {{grandfather}} Jack Petty were both accomplished drivers {{who won a}} combined 11 championships and 340 wins in various series. Petty, who was always an athletic person, started into racing {{at the age of}} ten years by becoming a Colorado State Champion Soap <b>Box</b> Derby <b>driver.</b> This led to various other forms of racing such as go-karts, vintage race cars, and IMCA type modifieds. In 2001, Petty started his racing career racing modifieds at various dirt tracks throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. In 2002, Jeremy tried asphalt racing at the Dodge City Raceway Park. Petty went on to win taking his first “A” feature race in just his 9th career start.|$|R
50|$|On 26 December (<b>Boxing</b> Day), <b>drivers</b> in Northern Ireland {{were warned}} of icy conditions. Conditions {{in many other}} parts of the UK {{continued}} to improve as milder air moved in from the south. However, northern England and Scotland remained cold and nighttime temperatures continued to drop below freezing. Some Boxing Day sporting fixtures were cancelled (or postponed) because of continuing icy conditions in certain areas, including the National Hunt meeting at Towcester and all but two of the Scottish Football League's matches. Some parts of East Anglia suffered electricity cuts, including Dedham, Stratford St Mary and parts of Colchester; in more remote parts of the region, some were without power for 36 hours.|$|R
60|$|Such was the morning, when an open carriage, {{in which}} were three Pickwickians (Mr. Snodgrass having {{preferred}} {{to remain at}} home), Mr. Wardle, and Mr. Trundle, with Sam Weller on the <b>box</b> beside the <b>driver,</b> pulled up by a gate at the roadside, before which stood a tall, raw-boned gamekeeper, and a half-booted, leather-legginged boy, each bearing a bag of capacious dimensions, and accompanied by a brace of pointers.|$|R
5000|$|Generally {{there is}} a train every two hours {{northbound}} to Carlisle (six departures on Mondays to Saturdays - one service runs through non-stop) and southbound to Leeds (seven Mon-Fri, plus one extra on Saturdays). [...] One service each day also terminates and starts back from here (the last train of the day from Leeds) - this runs empty across the viaduct to reverse at Blea Moor signal <b>box,</b> where the <b>driver</b> changes ends before returning south.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{there are}} few studies about risks and {{accidents}} at work with harvesters, but each study creates a better basis to prevent future accidents to occur. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine machine driver's perception of risks and accidents at work with harvesters Komatsu 901, 901 TX. The focus was on the drivers of the model Komatsu 901 and 901 TX, a common thinning and final felling machine in Sweden. Results show that there are deficiencies that are recurring on multiple machines. These deficiencies also have a connection to the actual accidents. Half of the drivers felt that there were defects (flaws) around the handle and the footboard and only one driver had access to the alarm <b>box.</b> The <b>drivers</b> believe the current structure of harvester can be improved but is not always taken seriously when they make their requests for improvements to reduce risks...|$|R
50|$|Whilst the Clever {{vehicle was}} {{intended}} to use a low emission engine burning compresses natural gas, the research prototype at the University of Bath uses a 13 kW 176cc single cylinder engine taken from BMW C1 scooter. The original CVT gearbox is retained (albeit modified to provide a power take off to drive the pump for the tilt hydraulics); belt drives are used to transmit power to the two rear wheels. Rear suspension is by way of independent trailing arms, adjustable Öhlins spring/damper units and an anti-roll bar. The front wheel is suspended by a leading four bar linkage with a single Öhlins spring/damper unit and uses a hub-centric steering system. A single track-rod transmits steer inputs to the front wheel from the output arm of a worm-gear steering <b>box,</b> the <b>driver’s</b> steer inputs are transmitted to the steering box via a modified wheel and column sourced from a BMW car.|$|R
6000|$|Thompson {{thought about}} it for a moment before he spoke. There was room in the fly for only two, or if for three, still he knew his place better than to thrust himself inside {{together}} with his prisoner and his prisoner's wife. He had been specially asked by Mr. Walker to be very civil. Only one could sit on the <b>box</b> with the <b>driver,</b> and if the request was conceded the poor policeman must walk back. The walk, however, would not kill the policeman. [...] "All right, ma'am," [...] said Thompson;--"that is, if the gentleman will just pass his word not to get out till I ask him." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} too late now, for as they were still {{speaking}} Lady Mason appeared at the door, leaning on her son's arm. She was dressed {{from head to foot}} in black, and over her face there was a thick black veil. Mr. Aram spoke no word further as she stepped up the steps from the hall door to the carriage, but stood back, holding the carriage-door open in his hand. Lucius merely bowed to Mrs. Orme as he assisted his mother to take her place; and then following her, he sat himself down in silence opposite to them. Mr. Aram, who had carefully arranged his own programme, shut the door, and mounted on to the <b>box</b> beside the <b>driver.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{proposals}} made to restrict Cup regulars' participation in the now-Xfinity Series, including increasing the purse for series regulars, not awarding championship points to such drivers, forcing Cup drivers {{to start at the}} back, or restricting the number of races a Cup driver can run in the other series. In late 2010, media reports began to indicate that NASCAR would respond to the critics of [...] "claim jumping" [...] by effectively splitting {{the difference between the two}} extremes of unrestricted presence of Cup drivers and none at all. It was specifically reported that in 2011, Cup drivers would be allowed to run in the Nationwide Series, but not to compete for the series championship. This rule change was confirmed by NASCAR.com in a report on January 11, 2011. Drivers are now allowed to compete for the championship in only one of NASCAR's three national touring series in a given season. The NASCAR license application form now includes a check <b>box</b> requiring <b>drivers</b> to select the series in which they wish to compete for the championship. NASCAR president and CEO Brian France officially announced this change on January 26, adding that Cup Series drivers will still be allowed to earn owner's points, but not driver's points, in the Nationwide and Truck Series.|$|R
