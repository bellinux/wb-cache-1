5|$|In February 1975, Whitlam {{decided to}} appoint Senator Murphy a {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, even though Murphy's Senate seat would not <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> {{election}} if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win {{three of the five}} New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent.|$|E

Under proportional representation, Labor could hold its three short-term seats in the next half-Senate election but, if Murphy's seat were also contested, Labor was unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, a Murphy appointment meant the almost certain loss of a seat in the closely divided Senate at the next election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway.

The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent. By March 1975, many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was doing an inadequate job as leader of the Opposition, and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives. Malcolm Fraser challenged Snedden for the leadership, and defeated him on 21 March.|$|E

It was also the 25th anniversary of the club's first premiership in the top grade, and the players reunited. The function followed a Past Players Day, when the newly created Steve Pascoe Cup was fought out between rivals Warrandyte and Norwood, where Pascoe is a life member at both clubs. Pascoe also umpired the game, and awarded the Chris Snaidero Medal to {{the man of the}} match. Snaidero is another legend of both cricket clubs.

25|$|The form of {{government}} was chosen based on the final report issued in August 2013 by a Charter Study Commission that had narrowed its options to the weak Mayor Council-Manager form or the strong Mayor Faulkner Act form, ultimately choosing to recommend the Council-Manager form as it would retain desired aspects of the 1923 Municipal Manager Law (non-partisan voting for an at-large council with a professional manager) while allowing a directly elected mayor, elections in November and grants voters {{the right to use}} initiative and referendum. The four winning council candidates in the November 2014 general election drew straws, with two being chosen to serve full four-year terms and two serving for two years. Thereafter, two council seats will <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election every two years.|$|E

500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> it".|$|E

500|$|Albert Brooks {{plays the}} foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn {{suggested}} him, Gosling agreed, but thought the actor would not <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> playing {{a character who}} is violent and sullen, or for appearing in a film {{that he did not}} work on himself. Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché. [...] "There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real style. Also, he doesn't {{get up in the morning}} thinking about killing people. He's sad about it. Upset about it.

500|$|The former {{governor}} was enraged when in March 1890, Hanna {{gave a speech}} in New York stating, [...] "Foraker is dead {{as a factor in}} our politics and Ohio is again as reliable a Republican state as it ever was." [...] Foraker determined to secure election to the Senate; although the Democratic-controlled legislature had elected Calvin S. Brice to the Senate in 1890, Sherman's seat would <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election in January 1892. [...] McKinley was defeated for re-election to Congress in November 1890; his stature in Ohio politics was not diminished by the loss, as he was seen as a victim of gerrymandering. [...] When the former congressman ran for governor the following year, he asked Foraker to place his name in nomination, which he did. [...] Although some saw this as a rapprochement between the Sherman and Foraker factions, the {{former governor}}'s supporters, such as Kurtz and millionaire Springfield manufacturer Asa Bushnell, were already campaigning for Foraker for Senate.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{posted a}} number of reviews on its website. Julia Reaside deemed the series a [...] "perfectly cast remake of Swedish-Danish crime hit", and stated that [...] "this {{confirms}} Dillane {{as one of our}} very finest. Such control. Poésy is beautifully chilly, and Joseph Mawle (another cracker) leads an asylum-seeker subplot. It's also really funny." [...] Writing about the finale, Reaside said of Dillane's performance: [...] "If this were on a terrestrial channel, he'd <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> all the awards." [...] On the Karl–Elise partnership, she stated: [...] "I wasn't sure about them as a pairing but was immediately convinced by their uncomfortable chemistry." [...] Having not enjoyed The Bridge, Andrew Anthony called The Tunnel an [...] "attractive proposition", adding that [...] "there's an engaging confidence to the slow revelation of the story. All in all, this looks good." [...] Sam Wollaston was more critical of the series, stating that, while the tone was [...] "atmospheric, intriguing, gripping" [...] and there were strong performances from the lead cast members, The Tunnel was [...] "exactly the same as the (recent) original". [...] Wollaston felt that the only [...] "obvious" [...] difference was that, in the original series, there [...] "was a bridge, this is a tunnel. However magnificent an engineering feat the Channel tunnel is, it can't compete as a spectacular location with the Øresund Bridge." ...|$|E

500|$|New {{contracts}} for returning cast members were made, as {{the actors and}} actresses had signed for only two films. Hugh Jackman's contract included the approval of director, initially offering the position to Darren Aronofsky, {{with whom he had}} just finished filming on The Fountain. Joss Whedon, whose comic book [...] "Gifted" [...] was integrated into the script's plot, turned down the offer because he was working on a Wonder Woman film. Rob Bowman and Alex Proyas were also rumored to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> consideration, though Proyas personally turned it down, citing feuds with 20th Century Fox president Thomas Rothman while producing I, Robot. Zack Snyder was also approached, but he was already committed to 300. Peter Berg was also considered to direct the film but he too turned down the job. In February 2005, with still no director hired, Fox announced a May 5, 2006, release date, with filming to start in July 2005 in Vancouver. One month later, the studio signed Matthew Vaughn to direct, and pushed the release date three weeks to May 26, Memorial Day weekend. Vaughn cast Kelsey Grammer as Beast, Dania Ramirez as Callisto, and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, but family issues led him to withdraw before filming began. Vaughn was also cautious of the tight deadlines imposed by Fox, stating that he [...] "didn't have the time to make the movie that I wanted to make". John Moore was also considered to direct the film at one point.|$|E
500|$|After Germany resumed {{unlimited}} submarine {{warfare in}} early 1917, many considered U.S. {{entry into the}} war inevitable, though Borah expressed hope it might still be avoided. Nevertheless, he supported Wilson on legislation to arm merchant ships, and voted in favor when the president requested {{a declaration of war}} in April 1917. He made it clear that in his view, the U.S. was going in to defend its own rights and had no common interest with the Allies beyond the defeat of the Central Powers. He repeated this often through the war: the United States sought no territory, and had no interest in French and British desires for territory and colonies. Borah, though a strong war supporter, was possibly the most prominent wartime advocate of progressive views, opposing the draft and the Espionage Act of 1917, and pressing Wilson for statements of limited war aims. Borah's term was to expire in 1919; never a wealthy person and hard-hit by the high cost of living in wartime Washington, he considered leaving the Senate and practicing law in a major New York firm. However, he felt needed in the Senate and in Idaho, as both of the state's seats would <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> election in November 1918 due to the death of Borah's junior colleague, James H. Brady. Even President Wilson urged Borah's re-election in a letter to former senator Dubois. [...] Borah received two-thirds of the vote in his bid for a third term, while former governor Gooding narrowly won Brady's seat. Nationally, the Republicans retook control of the Senate with a 49–47 majority.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] In November, Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. [...] In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. [...] Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork. [...] Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season. [...] Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, [...] "We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible {{when it comes to the}} NFL. We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status." [...] Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the Heisman. I will come back."
