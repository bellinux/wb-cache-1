Conversely, Maple noted that his research indicated that attitudes toward Murrell varied within the local community. Although many individuals, particularly among the poor, viewed him as a valuable member of the community, others [...] particularly among the wealthier strata of society [...] deemed him to be [...] "a dangerous quack and disseminator of superstitious nonsense". Maple found one woman, Mrs Petchey, who described him as [...] "a smuggler and a bad man. He did things that wouldn't be allowed today - them witchcrafts, I mean. Nowadays, people would say he'd sold his soul to the Devil, wouldn't they? They'd put him away for his witchcrafts." [...] Conversely, Maple noted that Mrs Murrell, who was a descendent of James, described the cunning man as [...] "a good man and a regular churchgoer". According to the folklore obtained by Maple, Murrell would often have debates about Christian theology with a local parson, the Reverend Thomas Espin [...] who had been Professor of Pastoral Theology at Queen's College, Birmingham [...] and that Espin expressed the view that Murrell [...] "knows his Bible <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do...</b> He is either a very good man or a very bad one, and I can't {{make up my mind}} which." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Sondheim, he {{was asked}} to {{translate}} Mahagonny-Songspiel: [...] "But, I'm not a Brecht/Weill fan and that's really all there is to it. I'm an apostate: I like Weill's music when he came to America <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> his stuff before... I love The Threepenny Opera but, outside of The Threepenny Opera, the music of his I like is the stuff he wrote in America – when he was not writing with Brecht, when he was writing for Broadway." [...] He turned down an offer to musicalize Nathanael West's A Cool Million with James Lapine around 1982.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I was," [...] replied Ken, impulsively. [...] "I {{can play}} <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> to-day--but--Mr. Arthurs, I'm not in Graves's {{class as a}} third-baseman. I know it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she murmured. [...] "I {{was afraid}} you would blame me, {{but now it}} seems that Dick knew you <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> When he made you my trustee, he {{said that you were}} too big to bear him malice." ...|$|R
