5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} talk of {{building}} a replica of the memorial. On 31 May 2008 on Anzac Parade, Canberra, the formal dedication of a site in which will be placed a new national Boer War memorial was held. A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: {{going so far as to}} say that they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.|$|E

Blood clots and biliary problems have the possibility of arising in the donor post-op, but these issues are remedied fairly easily. Although death is a risk that a living donor must <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> prior to the surgery, the mortality rate of living donors in the United States is low. The LDLT donor's immune system does diminish {{as a result of}} the liver regenerating, so certain foods which would normally cause an upset stomach could cause serious illness.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} {{selection}} criterion for decision analysis is subjective. The choice of criterion is made {{outside of the}} analysis (it is exogenous). One of the influences on this choice on this is attitude to risk. Risk aversion describes how willing or unwilling someone is to take risks. Evidence indicates that most, but not all, individuals prefer certain outcomes to uncertain ones. Risk-averse individuals prefer decision criteria that reduce the chance of the worst possible outcome, while risk-seeking individuals prefer decision criteria that maximize the chance of the best possible outcome. In terms of returns on investment, if {{society as a whole}} is risk-averse, we might <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> some investments with negative expected returns, e.g., in mitigation. Such investments may help to reduce the possibility of future climate damages or the costs of adaptation.|$|E
25|$|Haye's trainer, Adam Booth, {{indicated}} that Haye would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the challenge. Both sides began negotiations {{for a potential}} fight and the bout was targeted for September. As the negotiations continued to move forward, the unification fight between Klitschko and Haye was expected {{to take place in}} Germany rather than England. The IBF set a deadline to end negotiations on 17 May. A few days before the deadline to make the unification bout, Haye said he was interested in fighting the older Klitschko, Vitali, rather than Wladimir. The fight did not materialize and Klitschko was set to take on mandatory challenger Alexander Povetkin. On 17 May 2010, the 30-day period of negotiation began for Klitschko to defend his championship against Povetkin. Within this period, discussions to make a fight with Haye were still ongoing.|$|E

500|$|The second {{series of}} Inside No. 9 {{was written in}} 2014, and then filmed {{from the end of}} 2014 into early 2015. [...] "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] follows the life of Christine over 12 years, with the story told through scenes showing the key events in that time. Shearsmith {{described}} this as a very unusual episode structure and storytelling method, but felt that, in this case, it was effective. Upon penning the script, Pemberton and Shearsmith immediately thought of Sheridan Smith as a performer who would be suitable to play Christine. Both had previously worked with her, and the pair hoped that she would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the role. Smith had been a long-time fan of the writers' work, and enjoyed the way the format of Inside No. 9 allows standalone stories. She was [...] "gripped" [...] by the script, and accepted the role; during filming, she said she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to be working with Pemberton and Shearsmith.|$|E
500|$|In the 1900s, the Walker {{brothers}} became {{active in}} the Back-to-Africa movement. [...] In 1902, Fleetwood and Weldy established and edited a black-issues newspaper called The Equator. [...] Six years later, Fleetwood and Weldy published a 47-page book titled Our Home Colony: A Treatise on the Past, Present, and Future of the Negro Race in America. [...] Fleetwood's biographer, David Zang, has written that Fleetwood [...] "was effected by the political vigilance which his younger brother, Weldy, had brought to the black cause." [...] In the credits to Our Home Colony, Fleetwood was identified as the author, and Weldy was identified as [...] "General Agent," [...] though much {{of the book is}} written in the first-person plural. [...] In the book, the Walkers wrote: [...] "The only practical and permanent solution of the present and future race troubles in the United States is entire separation by Emigration of the Negro from America." [...] They added: [...] "The Negro race will be a menace and the source of discontent as long as it remains in large numbers in the United States. The time is growing very near when the whites of the United States must either settle this problem by deportation, or else <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> a reign of terror such as the world has never seen in a civilized country." ...|$|E
500|$|Playing {{the final}} year of his {{contract}} in 2012–13 and with the team languishing {{near the bottom of the}} NHL standings, speculation about Iginla's future in Calgary was again raised as April 3, 2013, trade deadline neared. National media outlets reported that Iginla, who had a clause in his contract preventing the Flames from moving him to another team without his permission, had given the organization a list of four teams he would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> a trade with: the Chicago Blackhawks, Los Angeles Kings, Boston Bruins or Pittsburgh Penguins. The Bruins were considered the leading contender to acquire Iginla's services, and after he was held out of the line-up of Calgary's March 27, 2013, game against the Colorado Avalanche, it was reported that a trade between the two teams had been completed. Instead, Iginla's 16-year career in Calgary ended when he was sent to the Penguins in exchange for Pittsburgh's first round selection at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft and college prospects Kenny Agostino and Ben Hanowski. Iginla stated that playing with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin played a factor in his decision to move to the Penguins. The Bruins and Penguins met in the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite having the top scoring offence in the league, the Penguins lost the series without winning a game. Iginla, along with Crosby, Malkin, James Neal and Kris Letang, registered a combined 0 points in the series. Iginla was moved to the third line after a 6–1 Game2 loss. Bruins forward Milan Lucic said after the series that Iginla's spurning of Boston ignited the series sweep: [...] "When a guy chooses another team over your team, it does light a little bit of a fire underneath you." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the 9/11 attacks, Novak {{stated that}} he {{believed}} the perpetrators had been largely motivated by revenge over U.S. support for Israel. He also argued that the event brought the nations closer together “in a way that cannot improve long-term U.S. policy objectives.” In a November 2001 episode of Capital Gang, Novak said, “I am always amazed how American conservatives can {{get involved in this}} absolutely mindless support of the transigent [...] Israeli policy.” He argued that Yasser Arafat would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> Israel’s right to exist, but Ariel Sharon would never recognize a Palestinian state. He also referred to Hamas as “freedom fighters,” which prompted Margaret Carlson to remark that he’s “the only person who would call Hamas freedom fighters” and Novak to respond that “people all over the world do.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he did not}} {{actively}} seek the 1964 Republican nomination for President of the United States in the beginning, a [...] "Draft Scranton" [...] movement quickly gathered momentum among moderate and liberal Republicans who saw him {{as an alternative to}} conservative frontrunner, Senator Barry Goldwater, and other Republicans who feared that Goldwater's polarizing views would lead to defeat, after the campaign of Goldwater's liberal opponent, New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, had lost steam. Early in the campaign, he announced that he would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the nomination for Vice President. Scranton first declined to enter the race but later threw his hat into the ring on June 12, 1964. Scranton won the support of ten state delegations, but Goldwater {{went on to win the}} nomination on the first ballot. Republican National Committee Chairman and US Representative William E.

[...] He also advocated a term limit of four or six years for the office of governor. [...] Despite these concerns, Sloan did not advocate delaying statehood, stating [...] "Personally, while there are things in the Constitution which I deem unwise still I would, as a citizen <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> them if this would bring statehood– [...] hoping that whatever should prove by experience to be unwise would be corrected in the future by amendment." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Copenhagen criteria, {{membership}} of the European Union is open to any European country that is a stable, free market liberal democracy that respects {{the rule of law}} and human rights. Furthermore, it has to <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> all the obligations of membership, such as adopting all previously agreed law (the 170,000 pages of acquis communautaire) and switching to the euro. In order to join the European Union, it is required for all member states to agree; if a single member state disagrees, the applying country is declined acceptance to the European Union. [...] In addition to enlargement by adding new countries, the EU can also expand by having territories of member states, which are outside the EU, integrate more closely (for example in respect to the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles) or by a territory of a member state which had previously seceded and then rejoined (see withdrawal below).|$|E

[...] Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan received a similar letter. A senior U.S. official told the Washington Post that the letter was a response to Iran's desire to ship out its uranium piecemeal, rather than in a single batch, and that during [...] "multiple conversations" [...] U.S. officials made clear that Iran should also cease 20% enrichment; however, the official stated [...] "there was no president-to-president letter laying out those broader concerns".|$|E

2500|$|Reynolds joined {{several of}} his fellow {{officers}} in urging that Hooker be replaced, {{in the same way}} he had spoken out against Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside after Fredericksburg.

[...] President Abraham Lincoln met with Reynolds in a private interview on June 2 and is believed to have asked him whether he would consider being the next commander of the Army of the Potomac. Reynolds supposedly replied that he would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> only if he were given a free hand and could be isolated from the political influences that had affected the Army commanders throughout the war. Unable to comply with his demands, Lincoln promoted the more junior George G. Meade to replace Hooker on June 28.|$|E
2500|$|I made a {{whole series}} of studies to prepare this portrait. Drawings and washes in china ink.

2500|$|India {{continues}} to assert its sovereignty or rights {{over the entire}} region of Kashmir, while Pakistan maintains {{that it is a}} disputed territory. Pakistan argues that the status quo cannot be considered as a solution and further insists on a UN-sponsored plebiscite. Unofficially, the Pakistani leadership has indicated that they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> alternatives such as a demilitarised Kashmir, if sovereignty of Azad Kashmir was to be extended over the Kashmir valley, or the [...] "Chenab" [...] formula, by which India would retain parts of Kashmir on its side of the Chenab river, and Pakistan the other sideeffectively re-partitioning Kashmir on communal lines. The problem with the proposal is that the population of the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir is for the most part ethnically, linguistically, and culturally different from the Valley of Kashmir, a part of Indian-administered Kashmir. Partition based on the Chenab formula is opposed by some Kashmiri politicians, although others, including Sajjad Lone, have suggested that the non-Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir be separated from Kashmir and handed to India. Some political analysts say that the Pakistan state policy shift and mellowing of its aggressive stance may have to do with its total failure in the Kargil War and the subsequent 9/11 attacks. These events put pressure on Pakistan to alter its position on terrorism. Many neutral parties to the dispute have noted that the UN resolution on Kashmir is no longer relevant.
