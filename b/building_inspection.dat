25|$|Rubin faced a major {{budgetary}} {{scandal in}} 2009 and 2010. In fiscal year 2009 (which ended September 30, 2009), DCFEMS spent $11 million on overtime, {{although it had}} budgeted just $5 million. Chief Rubin blamed the problem on extensive firefighter and EMS vacancies, which forced the department to incur overtime. Hiring freezes imposed by the city worsened the situation, he said, and led to even more overtime. Rubin warned the D.C. City Council in November 2009 that fiscal 2010 overtime expenditures would be about $8 million, although the council had approved an overtime budget that remained steady at just $5 million. To avoid going over budget, Rubin claimed that shutting down the fire training academy and the <b>building</b> <b>inspection</b> division, closing several fire stations, and reducing staffing on fire trucks {{was the only way}} to rein in these costs. City council members disputed his claim.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 1957, the State Department of Industrial Relations {{condemned}} {{any further}} instructional use of Harrison Hall after a <b>building</b> <b>inspection.</b> As a result, Miami allocated resources {{to many of}} the academic divisions housed within Harrison Hall to other buildings on campus including Bonham House and Ogden Hall.

The Board stated that the new Harrison Hall should be devoted to classroom purposes and that it would house the departments of Sociology and Anthropology, Psychology, Government, and the Scripps Foundation. Bids for the construction of the new building were received on October 17, 1958 by the State Architect’s Office in Columbus and construction began in January. The cornerstone was laid on May 9, 1959 and was presided by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Hugh C. Nichols. A strike that began on June 8, 1959 interrupted the construction of the building, which was later completed in 1960.|$|E

25|$|It was a {{political}} decision to deprive local authorities of the resources needed to provide an adequate service. Local authority budgets have been cut by 40% {{as a result of}} the 2010 austerity budget of the Conservative Coalition Government, and the fire service cuts have resulted in 11,000 fewer firefighters. The <b>building</b> <b>inspection</b> regime is under pressure as mandatory competition between Local Authority Building Control and private approved inspectors was introduced to drive down costs. This impacts on quality. Local authority budget cuts have led to fewer building control inspectors and fewer planning inspectors and also the recommendations of a coroner’s report into the Lakanal House tower block fire in Southwark in 2009 has not been acted on nor have building regulations been overhauled. The responsibility for fire safety checks had been switched from the fire brigade onto building owners for similar cost cutting reasons, by the previous Blair government. Southwark council was fined £570,000 for fire safety offences following the 2009 Lakanal House fire, where six people died. Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn brought this to the attention of the House. He said these “terrible consequences of deregulation and cutting corners” stemmed from a “disregard for working-class communities”.|$|E

2500|$|These {{personnel}} scandals deepened in April {{when the}} D.C. City Council revealed {{it failed to}} identify inaccuracies on Few's résumé, submitted in 2000.

Some members of the District of Columbia Financial Control Board, which hired Few, said they might have vetoed his employment had they known about the inaccuracies. Few was also accused of misleading Congress by implying {{that he was a}} certified paramedic when he was not. Few blamed the mayor's office for submitting an incorrect résumé to the control board and Congress. A few days later, an internal DCFEMS report concluded that Anderson, Cowan, and Garland had not only failed to meet basic performance goals but also that departmental performance had actually declined under them. Under Anderson, ambulances met their arrival-time goals only 41.6 percent of the time, down from 50.2 percent of the time a year earlier. (The national standard is 90 percent, and the city's goal was 80 percent.) The average time for an ambulance to arrive after a patient's call was 15.5 minutes, far above the national average. Under Garland, the emergency fleet continued to deteriorate as well. Not a single new fire engine had been ordered since October 2000, and the average age of engines in reserve was 15 years (nearly 50 percent higher than the 11-year lifespan of the vehicles).
