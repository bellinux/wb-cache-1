25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering wheel angle sensor, and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering <b>Brake</b> <b>Control</b> (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{an active}} <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> {{dynamical}} system {{in order to}} establish a safe and efficient vehicle driving stability control test system. Aiming at Chery A 3 sedan, set up the active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> dynamic simulation system base on MATLAB/Simulink. Adopting the brake driving integration ESP control strategy, analyze and verify the stability control performance of independent vehicle system and vehicle ESP test system based on active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> respectively in under steering and excessive steering two test conditions. The analyzing results indicate that the test system based on active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> can effectively assist vehicle travelling in the absence of ESP control or ESP control system failure; when vehicle has ESP control system, the driving stability control performance of this system and independent vehicle system has remarkable consistency. The active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> system provides a basis for research of vehicle driving stability control test. 1...|$|R

25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive {{on the train}}. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If {{the system is not}} recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied {{as in the case of}} the Lac-Mégantic accident. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|E

40|$|A new {{cooperative}} <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy (CBCS) {{is proposed}} for a parallel {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) with both a regenerative braking system and an antilock braking system (ABS) to achieve improved braking performance and energy regeneration. The braking system of the vehicle {{is based on a}} new method of HEV braking torque distribution that makes the antilock braking system work together with the regenerative braking system harmoniously. In the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy, a sliding mode controller (SMC) for ABS is designed to maintain the wheel slip within an optimal range by adjusting the hydraulic braking torque continuously; to reduce the chattering in SMC, a boundary-layer method with moderate tuning of a saturation function is also investigated; based on the wheel slip ratio, battery state of charge (SOC), and the motor speed, a fuzzy logic control strategy (FLC) is applied to adjust the regenerative braking torque dynamically. In order to evaluate the performance of the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy, the <b>braking</b> system model of a hybrid electric vehicle is built in MATLAB/SIMULINK. It is found from the simulation that the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy suggested in this paper provides satisfactory braking performance, passenger comfort, and high regenerative efficiency...|$|R

40|$|In modern road vehicles, active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> {{systems are}} crucial {{elements}} {{to ensure safety}} and lateral stability. Unfortunately, the wheel slip dynamics is highly nonlinear and the on-line estimation of the road-tire conditions is still a challenging open research problem. These facts {{make it difficult to}} devise a <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> system that is reliable in any possible situation without being too conservative. In this paper, we propose the Data-Driven Inversion Based Control D 2 -IBC approach to overcome the above issues. The method relies on a two degrees of freedom architecture, with a linear controller and a nonlinear controller in parallel, both designed using only experimental data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach against state-of-the-art <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> is shown by means of an extensive simulation campaign.
