50|$|While the culvert {{discharge}} capacity derives from hydrological and hydraulic engineering considerations, this results often in large velocities in the barrel, creating some fish passage barrier. Critical culvert parameters {{in terms of}} fish passage are {{the dimensions of the}} barrel, particularly its length, cross-sectional shape and invert slope. The behavioural response by fish species to culvert dimensions, light conditions and flow turbulence {{may play a role in}} their swimming ability and culvert passage rate. There is no simple technical means for ascertain the turbulence characteristics most relevant to fish passage in culverts, but it is understood that the flow turbulence plays a key role in fish behaviour.The interactions between swimming fish and vortical structures involve a broad range of relevant length and tine scales. Recent discussions emphasised the role of secondary flow motion, considerations of fish dimensions in relation to the spectrum of turbulence scales, and the <b>benefitial</b> role of turbulent structures provided that fish are able to exploit them.The current literature on culvert fish passage focused mostly on fast-swimming fish species, but a few studies argued for better guidelines for small-bodied fish including juveniles.|$|E

The experimental work conducted provides evidence on the discriminatory power of the descriptor, with results comparable to recent similar approaches. Furthermore, since its degree of locality, its visual compactness, and the pair-wise feature similarity can be easily changed, it holds promise to account for characterizations of other descriptors, as well as for a range of accuracy-computational trade-oﬀs for pedestrian detection and, possibly, also for other object detection problems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Scheduling of delay-tolerant jobs {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a mechanism to alleviate pressure on congested network resources. However, when multiple competing users share these resources, {{they may not be}} willing to reveal the flexibility of the schedule for their jobs. This work presents a trading system that enables the users to trade their finite allowances in a scenario where they have fixed-size atomic jobs. The trading system makes it possible for tasks with strict timing requirements to be completed on time, while rewarding customers who exhibit flexibility regarding the schedule of their workloads (by reducing their operating costs or assigning them a larger share of off-peak capacity). The trading system hereby presented thus provides the right incentives so that user agents schedule their delay-tolerant jobs in a way <b>benefitial</b> for the whole system. It is proven to always converge, and simulations on real traces show significant reductions on the peak-to-valley ratio on the link utilization. I...|$|E

For this purpose, it connects theoretical threads from Governmental Political and New Liberalism with the literature on military innovation and democratic peace. Four periods of military transition during which the incentive for military innovation is particularly strong are analysed based on a structured-focused comparison: The Post-World War II (1945 - 1949), the Korean War period (1959 - 1953), the Post-Cold War (1990 - 1998) and the War on Terror period (2001 - 2007). The findings of this study show that the domestic and international levels of US military policy increasingly follow conflicting logics which reduce the likelihood of innovation. The public majority's interest in innovation as a means to maintain efficient military forces in a changing world remains latent most of the time. In contrast, special interest groups' preferences for the <b>benefitial</b> domestic status quo result in a permanent push towards military stability.

If the capability to remove heat from the primary side cannot be restored, the primary side will be subjected to high pressure for a long period of time. The actuation of the ECCS will be inhibited, primary side (PS) inventory will be lost, ﬁnally the core will be in dryout conditions. The EOP which is investigated in this paper proposes to utilise mobile pumps (e. g. using ﬁre brigade trucks) to make additional sources of feedwater available and thereby restore a heat sink for the primary side at least for a limited period of time. After a certain time (which should be determined by calculations) of this measure, the PORV-valve and/or the gas-removal system should be opened to lower the pressure in the primary side and actuate the ECCS (primary side bleed and feed mode).
