5|$|Lego Designer Jamie Berard created many Modulars Buildings {{and decided}} to make a mini version of his set for fun. Five of these were then {{released}} as a single set 10230 containing 1356 pieces, each one on an 8x8 <b>baseplate,</b> making them quarter-scale with respect to the original buildings. Initially this set was for Lego Group VIPs only, but it later became available for general sale.|$|E
5|$|Ninjago City (set number 70620), a large 4867 piece set, was {{released}} in late August {{to coincide with the}} release of the Lego Ninjago Movie. Although not advertised as a modular building, it features the same structure as the regular modulars with a 32x32 stud <b>baseplate,</b> building connectors and a river matching the same dimensions as the sidewalk. It is a huge 3-level model with each level themed differently. The bottom level contains an old fashioned fish market, the middle level contains a modern comic store and sushi bar, and the top floor contains a radio station. The set comes with 16 different minifigures.|$|E
5|$|Operation Bodenplatte (<b>Baseplate),</b> {{launched}} on 1 January 1945, {{was an attempt}} by the Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries during the Second World War. The goal of Bodenplatte was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could resume their advance. The operation was planned for 16 December 1944, but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year’s Day, the first day that happened to be suitable.|$|E

5000|$|Footplates, {{also known}} as footpads or <b>baseplates,</b> are {{at the base of}} columns and serve as anchors to give the rack more stability: anchor bolts are {{inserted}} through the <b>baseplate’s</b> holes to attach the column to the concrete floor. Footplates are made of thicker steel and in some geographic locations, they must be of a certain size and seismic rating. Footpads increase the pallet rack’s overall stability and weight-bearing capacity.|$|R
25|$|In April 1944 Staffelkapitän of 10./JG 51, Leutnant Horst-Günther Von Fassong, was {{transferred}} to lead 7./JG 11. He was credited with 62 victories on the Eastern Front at the time. He added several B-17s {{in the next month}} before promotion to Gruppenkommandeur of III./JG 11. Von Fassong died on 1 January 1945 during Operation <b>Baseplate,</b> and his aircraft cartwheeled after attack by two P-47 Thunderbolts. Another major casualty of Operation <b>Baseplate</b> was Geschwaderkommodore Specht.|$|E
25|$|Rail anchors or Anticreepers are {{spring steel}} clips that {{attach to the}} {{underside}} of the rail <b>baseplate</b> and bear against the sides of the sleepers to prevent longitudinal movement of the rail, either from changes in temperature or through vibration.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} types of heavy-duty clips are used to fasten the rails to the underlying <b>baseplate,</b> one common one being the Pandrol fastener (Pandrol clip), named after its maker, which is shaped like a stubby paperclip. Another one is the Vossloh Tension Clamp.|$|E
25|$|Many {{railways}} use large wood screws, {{also called}} lag screws, to fasten the tie plates (or <b>baseplates)</b> to the railroad ties.|$|R

30|$|According to Wang et al. [14], {{dynamic tests}} on a {{rigid frame bridge}} from the Sydney RSA line {{indicated}} that a train speed of 65  km/h across a bridge with rigid <b>baseplates</b> under sleepers resulted in a noise level of 90  dB(A) at 5.5  m from the track centerline at frequencies of 200 – 1, 000  Hz. For a bridge with elastic <b>baseplates</b> under sleepers, the overall noise level, the vibration of the main girder in the vertical direction, and the lateral vibration were reduced by 6, 10, and 5  dB(A), respectively.|$|R
25|$|The SASA boom {{assembly}} {{consists of}} a mast, an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) handle, a harness, a connector panel, a mounting surface for the RFG and a <b>baseplate</b> fitting. The fitting {{will serve as the}} structural interface for mounting the SASA to the Zenith 1 truss on the ISS.|$|E
25|$|A tie plate, <b>baseplate</b> or {{sole plate}} is a steel plate used on rail tracks between flanged T rail and the crossties. The tie plate {{increases}} bearing area {{and holds the}} rail to correct gauge. They are fastened to wooden ties by means of spikes or bolts through holes in the plate.|$|E
25|$|Models were well-proportioned {{and looked}} similar in style to {{contemporary}} Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which {{came with a}} horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p.47).The model in the photograph is a very poor example and any self respecting collector wouldn't have it on the shelf. Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet {{as well as one}} underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The <b>baseplate,</b> however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not diecast with moulded lettering {{as was the case with}} Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the <b>baseplate.</b> The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the <b>baseplate</b> and held pinched on each side by extensions of the diecast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate. The ref. 072 Bedford articulated lorry was a reproduction of the Meccano factory lorry, its articulated flat trailer was dimensioned to receive the Hornby Dublo container.

40|$|Complexes of substructural e ements of {{bacteriophage}} T 4 (<b>baseplates,</b> baseplate-core complexes) {{with long}} tail fibres {{were obtained for}} the first time by complementation in vitro. A study of the organization of the complexes was carried out by PAGE, electron microscopy and sedimentation a alysis. About 90 % of <b>baseplates</b> and baseplate-core complexes were combined with fibres. However, the number of the attached fibres varied from one to six. On the basis of the data obtained, we proposed that the attachment of long tail fibres can occur before the assembly of the whole bacteriophage...|$|R

40|$|A fluidic {{amplifier}} {{is a crucial}} automatic control component in a liquid jet hammer used to drill hard formations in the oil industry. This study aims to determine the true causes of the fracture failure of <b>baseplates</b> in a {{fluidic amplifier}} made of WC- 11 Co cemented carbide {{in a very short}} period of time. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), theoretical estimation, and finite element analysis (FEA) were employed to analyze the effect of static and dynamic loads on the strength of the <b>baseplates.</b> Fractographic, metallographic, and processing defect analyses were also carried out. The FEA results showed that the static and dynamic loads caused stress concentrations at the actual fracture locations, and the effect of working loads on material strength was allowable and safe. Fracture surfaces exhibited typical characteristics of a brittle fracture. The metallographic analysis revealed that a specific amount of brittle eta-phase (η-phase) was present in the material. The microstructure of the processing cutting zone was inspected and the results revealed that some voids, pores, and microcracks were formed on the processing surface. The manufacturing and processing defects resulted in low stress fracture failure of the <b>baseplates...</b>|$|R
25|$|During the Battle of the Bulge, the Luftwaffe {{undertook}} night bombing {{attacks against}} Bastogne. A paradrop and aerial re-supply of German spearheads failed completely. On 1 January 1945 the Luftwaffe undertook a final attack operation known as Operation <b>Baseplate</b> (Unternehmen Bodenplatte) against Allied airfields in the Netherlands and Belgium {{in a bid}} to establish air superiority and eliminate air attacks on the German forces in the Ardennes area.|$|E
25|$|The Ruger SR40c {{started to}} ship in June 2011. Like the SR9c {{is to the}} SR9, the SR40c is a compact version of the SR40. It is {{dimensionally}} equal to the SR9c; and unlike the SR40 is to the SR9, it also weighs the same. The SR40c ships standard with a 9-round magazine with an optional extended <b>baseplate,</b> {{as well as a}} full-size 15-round SR40 magazine with a removable sleeve. In jurisdictions that prohibit large-capacity magazines, it ships with two 9-round magazines and two extended baseplates instead.|$|E
25|$|On New Year’s Day 1945, the Luftwaffe {{launched}} Operation <b>Baseplate,</b> a massed low-level fighter strike {{targeted at}} Allied airfields in France, Belgium and the Netherlands {{in support of}} the German offensive in the Ardennes. Elements of JG 11 were allocated the USAAF air base coded Y-29 at Asch where the 366th Fighter Group (366th FG, Ninth Air Force) and the 352nd Fighter Group (352 FG, Eighth Air Force) were based. Also targeted was the Spitfire airfield at Ophoven, housing the RAF's No. 41, No. 130, 350 and No. 610 of the 2nd Tactical Wing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In recent years, {{demand for}} quartz crystal {{resonators}} {{continues to grow}} for the mobile phone market. To meet the stringent long-term frequency stability requirement, crystal makers usually use Au as the electrode <b>baseplating</b> material. Using layered electrodes with different metallic materials {{was reported in the}} past for different reasons. In this paper we report our own study of using a sputtered Cr/Ag/Au layered structure for the electrodes of AT-cut quartz crystal resonators with the sole intention of reducing the usage of Au for cost reason. We studied the physical parameter, electrical sheet resistance, of the layers along with thermal processes. The electrical characteristics of finished crystal resonators were compared with those made with the Cr/Au <b>baseplated</b> electrodes and the reliability performance of the crystals with new electrodes also be examined. Preliminary results show that AT-cut quartz crystal resonators with electrodes based on the Cr/Ag/Au layered structure meet the long-term frequency stability requirement for mobile phone application. The electrical characteristics are compatible to the Cr/Au <b>baseplated</b> crystal resonators. The physical characteristics study shows that the Cr/Ag/Au layered structure is stable under related thermal process environments...|$|R
25|$|In {{most of the}} world, {{flat-bottomed}} rail and <b>baseplates</b> became the standard. However, in Britain, bullhead rail-and-chairs remained in use {{until the middle of}} the twentieth century. They are now largely obsolete but can still be found on the London Underground, some sidings and at London Waterloo Platforms 1-4.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{original}} Acrow prop was only intended for vertical support, the range {{has since been}} extended. Shoring 'push and pull' props with swivelling footplates are available and are used to support concrete formwork. Horizontal strutting props are used for shoring trenchwork. These are similar, but have a 'claw' form to their <b>baseplates.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Brandt Mle CM60A1, {{also known}} as the Brandt HB 60LP, MCB-60 HB, or simply as the Brandt 60mm LP Gun-Mortar, is a 60mm (2.36 in.) gun-mortar. Unlike {{conventional}} infantry mortars, it was not designed to be mounted on a bipod and a <b>baseplate,</b> but rather in the turrets of armoured fighting vehicles. The CM60A1 could be fired at a very low angle of elevation, giving it the dual purpose of direct fire artillery. Its hydraulic recoil mechanism reduces peak loads, allowing it to be mounted in very light armoured cars such as the Panhard AML-60 or wheeled armoured personnel carriers like the Panhard M3.|$|E
25|$|The <b>baseplate</b> (sole plate) is {{generally}} circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) {{and may be}} used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, DeAgostini, {{the parent}} company of Atlas editions, {{launched}} another range of Dinky Toys in The United Kingdom and Italy, this time relaunching some of the range from 2008 onward, but replacing Atlas Editions with DeAgostini on the <b>baseplate.</b> Offerings to the general public were through selected newsagents in Dorset and Milan or by subscription. After a test run of 5 issues the range was discontinued in the UK. In the United Kingdom, the first five models issued were the Triumph TR2, Bedford CA Van, Ford Thunderbird, Morris Mini Traveller and the Jaguar XK120 coupe. In Italy the first three issues were the Citroen DS, Fiat 600 and the Volkswagen beetle. Issue 6 was continued in Italy and the range is available (as of May 2017 up to issue # 16).|$|E

500|$|Although the {{technology}} existed, it remained for British designers {{to develop a}} system that could deliver hollow-charge ammunition in a larger size and with a greater range than that possessed by the No. 68. At {{the same time that}} Mohaupt was developing hollow-charge ammunition, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker of the Royal Artillery was investigating the possibility of developing a lightweight platoon mortar. However, rather than using the conventional system of firing the mortar shell from a barrel fixed to a <b>baseplate,</b> Blacker wanted to use the spigot mortar system. Instead of a barrel, there was a steel rod known as a 'spigot' fixed to a <b>baseplate,</b> and the bomb itself had a propellant charge inside its tail. When the mortar was to be fired, the bomb was pushed down onto the spigot, which exploded the propellant charge and blew the bomb into the air. By effectively putting the barrel {{on the inside of the}} weapon, the barrel diameter was no longer a limitation on the warhead size. Blacker eventually designed a lightweight mortar that he named the 'Arbalest' and submitted it to the War Office, but it was turned down in favour of a Spanish design. Undeterred, however, Blacker continued with his experiments and decided to try to invent a hand-held anti-tank weapon based on the spigot design, but found that the spigot could not generate sufficient velocity needed to penetrate armour. But he did not abandon the design, and eventually come up with the Blacker Bombard, a swivelling spigot-style system that could launch a [...] bomb approximately although the bombs it fired could not actually penetrate armour, they could still severely damage tanks, and in 1940 a large number of Blacker Bombards were issued to the Home Guard as anti-tank weapons.|$|E
500|$|The Detective's Office (set number 10246) is {{the tenth}} {{set in the}} Modular Building line and was {{released}} January 1, 2015. [...] This set contains 2262 pieces. It contains a detective's office, a barber shop named [...] "Al's", a pool room, and an upstairs apartment. The [...] "Al's" [...] sign resembles the various signs from the Pet Shop, Town Hall, and Fire Brigade. The featured [...] "Pool" [...] sign uses a building technique never used before. Inside the pool room features a fan, a pool table, and a dart board. The detective office features clues, a cabinet, and a secret storage space behind a picture. The barber shop features a mirror, scissors, lights, and chairs for customers. The apartment holds an old style toilet and a small kitchen. This modular varies from previous buildings because it has secret compartments that allow cookie smuggling throughout the building, a new box design, new pieces, and somewhat more of a modern design. It also is different {{because it is the}} only modular to have two buildings on the same <b>baseplate.</b> The front of the building features a newspaper stand, a tree, and 2 balconies. It includes 6 minifigures.|$|E
