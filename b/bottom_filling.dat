5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4  stars with the review by Thom Jurek stating [...] "Bassist Charlie Haden and guitarist Jim Hall played {{a number of}} duet concerts {{together}} over the years, but this was certainly among the very earliest. Given their respective careers up to this point, both men had nearly perfected the artistry of playing in this particular chamber jazz setting. That all said, it does not prepare the listener for the canny, intimate, yet absolutely electric interplay on offer here ... This set is not only impossible to criticize, but adds an immeasurable depth to the catalogs of both artists". In JazzTimes Colin Fleming wrote [...] "this Haden-Hall bass/guitar duet album smacks of affinity, several ways over". PopMatters' correspondent Will Layman said [...] "Hall and Haden were not only eloquent and influential masters but also musicians who spoke with a quiet assurance. They were revolutionaries who didn’t ruffle feathers, perhaps. It seemed like they’d be around forever, quietly knocking us out. What a gift, then, to find this quiet and loving duet concert from the 1990 Montreal International Jazz Festival pairing Hall and Haden in duets on eight good tunes". The Absolute Sound's Derk Richardson noted [...] "These eight songs, preserved in exquisite sonic detail—warm and sculpted from top to <b>bottom,</b> <b>filling</b> up huge but keenly defined aural space— are an unexpected bonanza for lovers of pure melody, improvised harmony, and the radiant sunset tones that these two men perfected on their respective instruments". In The Irish Times Cormac Larkin observed [...] "Whether on standards or originals, there is a warmth and an unmistakable sincerity on display that belies the sparse, almost skeletal texture of the music. As the set develops, one can hear these two great artist reaching out, listening to and developing each other’s ideas, clearly revelling in the encounter".|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about an early medieval well, made of sods, from a Roman and medieval site in Naaldwijk, Zuid-Holland, the Netherlands. All the wood from this well, {{including}} part of a wooden wheel, was examined together with soil samples, one from the <b>bottom</b> <b>filling</b> of the well and one from the sods, {{for the presence of}} seeds. The main research question was: “How did the local vegetation look like {{at the time of the}} well, based on the examined wood and seeds?” A second complementary question was: “What was the character of the use of wood?” In the well wood of alder, oak, ash, willow, buckthorn and elder was found, possibly all of these have grown in the area near the settlement. Most of the found wood was of poor quality and together with the findings of branches of most of the taxa suggest the use of local wood and therefore the availability was the main factor in the choice of wood. Research of the seeds from the soil sample that was taken from the sods showed that the sods probably came from a clayey environment that given the amount of foraminifera in the sample, has possibly been under the influence of the sea. The discovered taxa in this sample seem to indicate a moist to wet, moderately brackish to brackish environment. The soil sample from the <b>bottom</b> <b>filling</b> of the well showed many arable weeds that seem to indicate the presence of lime-free, nitrogen-rich and moderate to rich farmland or vegetable gardens. There are indications for frequently entered environments with a rich soil, such as yards and roadsides. Also ample evidence was found of rarely entered brushwood with a reworked rich, humous, lime-free, dry soil, such as waste land and pastures. Some of these taxa are indicators for nitrogen and also occur in fields and can point to manuring of the soil. There are also many indications for the presence of grasslands and/ or pastures with a highly variable humidity and a moderately brackish to brackish soil, such as dune grasslands. However, determining the presence or absence of forests and the degree of openness of the landscape can only be done with additional pollen analysis...|$|E

Life tests on the plastic extrusions determine their feasibility for containing the scintillator.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical and experimental evaluation of an enhanced techniques for no-vent fill. The method entails injecting liquid {{through the top}} of the receiver vessel, thereby increasing surface area and agitation of the ullage/liquid interface. Both of these factors promote condensation induced ullage collapse, and reduce compressive impedance to the incoming liquid. The enhanced process was analyzed by modifying the surface area algorithm of an existing tank thermodynamic code to model a downward-pointing, conical jet impringing on a steadily rising liquid surface. Transient pressure and temperature measurements from several tests with Freon- 114 were input into the revised model to calculate condensation rate as a function of fill level. By expressing these rates in dimensionless form (i. e., in terms of Stanton number and Prandtl number), an empirical correlation similar to the submerged jet model of Brown and Sonin (1989) was derived. This provided a basis for developing an expression which relates top <b>fill</b> to <b>bottom</b> <b>fill</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{theoretical}} and numerical analysis of singularly perturbed problems for linear surface waves propagating in a vessel with a rough <b>bottom</b> <b>filled</b> with a structured fluid. The paper also contains some experimental results on lensing of linear surface liquid waves through a phononic crystal flat lens. International audienceWe analyse transport properties of linear liquid waves propagating within arrays of immersed rigid circular cylindrical obstacles fixed to a rough bottom. A comparison between Multipole and Finite Element methods is drawn {{in the case}} of Robin boundary conditions coupled with Floquet–Bloch boundary conditions. We find that the first band is concave yet nearly flat (associated waves of small negative group velocity) and it displays a cut-off (zero-frequency stop band associated with a singular perturbation). Thanks to this anomalous dispersion in such fluid filled structures, we achieve both ultra-refraction and negative refraction for waves propagating at their surface. Potential applications lie in a omnidirective ‘water antenna' and a convergent flat ‘water lens'. The latter one is demonstrated experimentally...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a modal {{analysis}} of the elastic cylindrical shell with a clamped <b>bottom</b> partially <b>filled</b> with fluid in open source Code_Aster software using the finite element method. Natural frequencies and modes obtained in Code_Aster are compared to experimental and theoretical data. The aim {{of this paper is}} to prove that Code_Aster has all necessary tools for solving fluid structure interaction problems. Also, Code_Aster can be used in the industrial projects as an alternative to commercial software. The available free pre- and post-processors with a graphical user interface that is compatible with Code_Aster allow creating complex models and processing the results. The paper presents new validation results of open source Code_Aster software used to calculate small natural modes of the cylindrical shell partially filled with non-viscous compressible barotropic fluid under gravity field. The displacement of the middle surface of thin shell and the displacement of the fluid relative to the equilibrium position are described by coupled hydro-elasticity problem. The fluid flow is considered to be potential. The finite element method (FEM) is used. The features of computational model are described. The resolution equation has symmetrical block matrices. To compare the results, is discussed the well-known modal analysis problem of cylindrical shell with flat non-deformable <b>bottom,</b> <b>filled</b> with a compressible fluid. The numerical parameters of the scheme were chosen in accordance with well-known experimental and analytical data. Three cases were taken into account: an empty, a partially filled and a full-filled cylindrical shell. The frequencies of Code_Aster are in good agreement with those, obtained in experiment, analytical solution, as well as with results obtained by FEM in other software. The difference between experiment and analytical solution in software is approximately the same. The obtained results extend a set of validation tests for Code_Aster in the field of aerospace systems. Using the free software to analyze the aerospace system components allows enterprises to diminish dependency on the commercial software, reduce the cost of software usage, and adapt the open source software to the specific problems. </p...|$|R
