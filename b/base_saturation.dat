40|$|Background: Recent {{methodology}} {{development in}} directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes {{has shown that}} various mutagenesis strategies <b>based</b> on <b>saturation</b> mutagenesis at sites lining the binding pocket enable the generation of small and smart mutant libraries requiring minimal screening. Methods: In this endeavor, limonene epoxide hydrolase (LEH) has served as an experimental platform, the hydrolytic desymmetrization of cyclohexene oxide being the model reaction with formation of (R,R) - and (S,S) -cyclohexane- 1, 2 -diol. This system has now been employed for testing reduced amino acid alphabets based on the Hecht concept of binary patterning, with and without additional hydrophobic amino acids. Results and Conclusions: It turns out that in binary pattern <b>based</b> <b>saturation</b> mutagenesis as applied to LEH, polar amino acids are seldom introduced. When applying binary patterning in combination with additional hydrophobic amino acids as building blocks in iterative saturation mutagenesis, excellent LEH variants were evolved {{for the production of}} both (R,R) - and (S,S) -diols (80 – 97 % ee), but again the introduction of polar amino acids occurs rarely.

50|$|There are acid-forming cations (hydrogen and aluminium) {{and there}} are base-forming cations. The {{fraction}} of the base-forming cations that occupy positions on the soil colloids is called the <b>base</b> <b>saturation</b> percentage. If a soil has a CEC of 20 meq and 5 meq are aluminium and hydrogen cations (acid-forming), the remainder of positions on the colloids (20-5 = 15 meq) are assumed occupied by base-forming cations, so that the percentage <b>base</b> <b>saturation</b> is 15/20 x 100% = 75% (the compliment 25% is assumed acid-forming cations). When the soil pH is 7 (neutral), <b>base</b> <b>saturation</b> is 100 percent {{and there are}} no hydrogen ions stored on the colloids. <b>Base</b> <b>saturation</b> is almost in direct proportion to pH (increases with increasing pH). It is of use in calculating the amount of lime needed to neutralise an acid soil. The amount of lime needed to neutralize a soil must take account of the amount of acid forming ions on the colloids not just those in the soil water solution. The addition of enough lime to neutralize the soil water solution will be insufficient to change the pH, as the acid forming cations stored on the soil colloids will tend to restore the original pH condition as they are pushed off those colloids by the calcium of the added lime.|$|E

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of lime doses applied to the soil surface on the plant nutritional status, the production, and the technological quality of mango fruits. The study was carried out at Selviria, {{in the state of}} Mato Grosso, Brazil, in a Typic Haplustox. Thirteen year old producing mango plants of the “Heden ” variety, grafted on rootstock of the “Coquinho ” variety, were used in this experiment. Lime doses of 0, 1. 55, 3. 10, 4. 655, and 6. 20 t·ha– 1 were applied to the soil. Each treatment was replicated 4 times and the experimental units distributed according to a randomized com-plete block design. Lime (CaO: 390 g·kg– 1; MgO: 130 g·kg– 1) was superficially applied to the soil and then incorpo-rated at depths between 0 and 5 cm in the total area of the orchard. The soil chemical characteristics pH, Ca, Mg, K, sum of <b>bases,</b> and <b>bases</b> <b>saturation,</b> in the 0 - 20 cm layer, were evaluated 16 and 28 months after soil liming. Plant nu-tritional status was evaluated 12 months after soil liming. Fruit production and technological quality were evaluated during the cropping years of 2006 and 2007. Soil liming had a positive effect on the evaluated soil chemical characteris-tics and this improved plant nutritional status and fruit technological quality as well as increased fruit production. These beneficial effects though were observed only in the second year after soil liming.

40|$|In a Geographic Information System (GIS), the {{transformation}} of geographical data (e. g. actual locations and physical characteristics of objects on the Earth surface) into geographic information dealt with complex series of process and procedures. In hydrologic modelling, streamflow {{is one of the}} main physical geographic apprearance within nature of hydrologic cycle. Rapid population growth,constructions, urbanization, and industrialization have increased impervious area causing hazardous impact towards rate of stormwater infiltrated into soil. Thus the overland flow in a post-development area becomes greater than the pre-development area. Within GIS, all stream networks, surface structures and its properties must be assigned and preserved with coordinate systems and map projections respectively known as georeferencing. Hence, any GIS based hydrologic applications need careful understanding in terms of map projections, coordinate systems and its transformations, scales and grid resolutions while entering spatial data. At present, there is still no unifying evidence available that provides a coherent and satisfactory explaination for the integration of the core GIS <b>based</b> <b>saturation</b> excess mechanisms into the streamflow generating process. Concepts of georeferencing need to be applied while performing GIS <b>based</b> <b>saturation</b> mechanism and to sustain the existing spatial properties of soil and land use. This study aims to visualize the effects of georeferencing system towards determine areas and total overland flow volume generated from Saturation Excess Overland Flow (SEOF) process using topographic wetness index (TWI) and antecedent soil-moisture conditions (AMC). Both factors are analysed by focusing on spatial object preservation techniques of conformal based Rectified Skew Orthomophic (RSO) and equidistance based Cassini-Soldner projections. This study is carried out at Sungai Pinang basin, located in North East coast of Penang Island, Malaysia.

The melanic epipedon is a mineral horizon that is very dark in color due to its high organic matter content (>0.6%). It is characteristic of soils high in such minerals as allophane, developed from volcanic ash. Melanic epipedon is extremely fluffly for a mineral soil. Histic epipedon is a 20 to 60 cm thick layer of organic soil materials (>20%) overlying a mineral soil.
