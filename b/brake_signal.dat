40|$|Abstract. The <b>braking</b> <b>signal</b> {{transmitter}} is a {{major component}} of the EBS. The structure and working principle of a <b>braking</b> <b>signal</b> transmitter were introduced. The test bed of the <b>braking</b> <b>signal</b> transmitter was designed and built. The static characteristics of the <b>braking</b> <b>signal</b> transmitter were obtained by analyzing the test data. The inflection points and the slope of each segment curve obtained by the bed test are basically identical to the static characteristic calibration curve. The pressure does not reach the maximum pressure of the static characteristic calibration curve because the gas source pressure does not reach the required test pressure...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} compare reaction times to <b>brake</b> <b>signals</b> when they appear with red or yellow turn signals. The laboratory study simulated a daytime driving condition. The subject's task was to respond {{as quickly as possible}} to the onset of peripherally presented brake lamps (but not to turn signals), while engaged in a central tracking task. There were three lamp conditions: brake lamps alone, brake lamps while turn signal was on, and a turn-signal lamp alone. Thus, the subject's task required an immediate response in the first condition, a delayed response in the second (only after the brake lamps came on, not to the turn signal), and no response in the third condition. Turn signals were presented at two levels of luminous intensity. The results showed that reaction times to <b>brake</b> <b>signals</b> were significantly shorter when the <b>brake</b> <b>signals</b> were presented in the context of yellow turn signals than when they were presented in the context of red turn signals. Averaged over both levels of luminous intensity and conditions with and without turn signals, the difference between yellow and red was 110 ms. The colors of turn signals had an effect whether or not the turn signal was on, but the effect was greater when it was. Older subjects were affected more by the color of turn signals than were younger subjects. In conclusion, yellow turn signals are beneficial in situations simulated in this experiment. However, the present findings are directly applicable only to a situation where all vehicles have yellow turn signals and tail lamps are not energized...|$|R

5000|$|... 14 {{mechanical}} signal boxes were {{built for the}} operation of the freight yard, mainly of the Bruchsal G design. Over the years, signal boxes B and D were abolished during the replacement of sets of points and in 1974 signal boxes 5, 7, 8 (old), 10 and 11 were replaced during the commissioning of the new central signal box B8. Signal box 4 was destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War and reconstructed in 1947 in a different style with yellow clinker brickwork and a lever frame of the Jüdel design from old spare parts. In the 1960s, an electro-mechanical lever frame of a 1907 design was installed in the previously {{mechanical signal}} box A and, in addition, the approach track received three beam retarders. In 1971, colour light signals were installed on the western hump. These are operated centrally by the dispatcher at the western hump, who was moved from signal box 2 to exit signal box 1 at the same time. During the construction of the Engelsdorf crossing structure, which took the Leipzig-Geithain railway under the exit from the yard, exit signal boxes A and 3 were remodelled. Both were equipped with electro-mechanical lever frames of 1912 design with lamp monitoring and signal box A was relocated from its old position on the crossing structure to the already prepared Bremsturm (<b>brake</b> <b>signal</b> box). In 1988, the sorting tracks were equipped with screw-type track brakes so that since then no riders have been required to retard wagons.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{incandescent}} brake lamps have {{a relatively}} slow rise time. It takes approximately {{a quarter of a}} second for them to reach 90 % of asymptotic light output, causing potential delays in responses by following drivers. The present study evaluated reaction times to <b>brake</b> <b>signals</b> from standard incandescent brake lamps and from three alternative brake lamps with substantially faster rise time: neon, LED, and fast incandescent. The study, performed in a laboratory, simulated a daytime driving condition. The subject’s task was to respond as quickly as possible to the onset of either of two brake lamps in the visual periphery, while engaged in a central tracking task. <b>Brake</b> <b>signals</b> were presented at two levels of luminous intensity. The results showed that reaction times to the alternative brake lamps were faster than to the standard incandescent lamp, with the advantage averaging 166 ms for the LED and neon lamps, and 135 ms for the fast incandescent lamp. A reduction of the signals’ luminous intensity from 42 cd to 5 cd increased the reaction time by 84 ms. For the neon, LED, and fast incandescent lamps all at 5 cd, the frequencies of reaction times longer than 1 s were all similar, and they were comparable to the frequency for the standard incandescent lamp at 42 cd...|$|R
50|$|They {{can be used}} to {{automatically}} calibrate wheel diameter by comparing the number of rotations of each axle against a master wheel that has been measured manually. Since all wheels travel the same distance, the diameter of each wheel is proportional to its number of rotations compared to the master wheel. This calibration must be done while coasting at a fixed speed to eliminate the possibility of wheel slip/slide introducing errors into the calculation. Automatic calibration of this type is used to generate more accurate traction and <b>braking</b> <b>signals,</b> and to improve wheel slip detection.|$|R

In experiments at the University of Karlsruhe we studied the dependency between reaction time and overlap of signal lights. We can see, that the total overlap from a yellow turn signal and a red <b>brake</b> <b>signal</b> will increase the reaction time. The increase depends of the ratio between the luminance of the turn indicator signal and the luminance of the <b>brake</b> <b>signal.</b> With a ratio from one to one (best case with minimal increase) we found an increase of 300 milli seconds...|$|E

40|$|Brake {{propagation}} is slow {{for long}} freight trains that use a conventional air brake system. If {{the train is}} too long then the brake application will not propagate throughout the whole train. Brake propagation {{is one of the}} factors that limit the length of current heavy haul freight trains using a conventional air brake system. It is possible that a relatively simple modification to every wagon's brake valve could be done to ensure the <b>brake</b> <b>signal</b> is relayed throughout the train irrespective of the length of the train. The modification effectively increases the quick service volume or 'bulb' on Westinghouse style triple valves by connecting an additional volume and valve to the brake pipe. As each wagon's brakes apply, extra air will be taken from the brake pipe to fill the additional volume and thus ensuring the propagation of the <b>brake</b> <b>signal</b> {{to the rear of the}} train. The modification also has the advantage of reducing the time for the brakes to reach their final pressure, which reduces the train's stopping distance. A computer model of a complete train air brake system developed through the Rail CRC is used to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the modification. Using air brake equipment at CQU, experimental tests have been conducted to determine the allowable size of the additional volume and show the stability of the modification...|$|E
