60|$|The Princess was {{outwardly}} calm, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> like steel.|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{was very}} pale, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> hard and steely.|$|E
60|$|Isobel {{answered}} her steadily, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> filled with shrinking fear.|$|E
60|$|Nance {{expressed}} a polite interest, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> on Mr. Archer, who was reading his letter {{with a face}} of such extreme indifference that she was tempted to suspect him of assumption.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> blue," [...] I said; [...] "it {{would not}} do at all to have them {{anything}} else. Some Italian girls are that way. At any rate, I couldn't alter her in my mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The red {{flashing}} {{in the western}} sky comes from her," [...] says the father. [...] "Her body is like a human being, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> greenstone, <b>her</b> hair sea-kelp, and her mouth is like a barracouta's mouth." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand. She was smiling, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> grave.|$|E
60|$|She {{pressed his}} hand and smiled at him, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> wet.|$|E
60|$|She was {{flushing}} {{a little}} under his stare, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> shining.|$|E
60|$|Miss Everdene and Boldwood were alone. Her cheeks {{had lost}} {{a great deal of}} their healthful fire from the very {{seriousness}} of <b>her</b> position; <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> bright with the excitement of a triumph--though it was a triumph which had rather been contemplated than desired.|$|R
5000|$|Princess Mirilla (performed by Alison McGowan) - She was {{delivered}} to Mopatop's Shop in [...] "Mr. Puniverse". Her design {{is very similar to}} one of the Whozits of The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> different and she has curly hair, a dress, and tiara.|$|R
60|$|Now Van Vooren went mad indeed; so mad that, forgetting {{he was not}} on {{the lonely}} veldt, he lifted his gun and fired {{straight}} at Sihamba. <b>But</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> quick, and seeing the muzzle rise, she threw herself upon the ground, so that the ball passed over her.|$|R
60|$|She {{was careful}} not to {{interrupt}} him, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> full of mute questions.|$|E
60|$|Frona's {{face was}} quite pale, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> hard, brilliantly hard, and she nodded approval.|$|E
60|$|She {{laughed at}} him. Her {{face was a}} little drawn with pain <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> very soft.|$|E
5000|$|Maiko C. Suma: She is Takenomaru's younger sister, whom he hasn't {{seen in a}} long time. They {{have the}} same hair color, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> green while his are red. Later in the chapters, she also {{receives}} a brooch from Takenomaru. The [...] "C" [...] stands for [...] "Catherine." ...|$|R
50|$|Julia's hairdresser. She is very easy-going {{and enjoys}} teasing people, {{especially}} Saeki and Haruna. She knows about Haruna's feelings for <b>her,</b> <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> focused on Saeki. She takes {{great pride in}} her work. She once did the hair and make-up for the female band Zlay (a parody of Japanese band Glay).|$|R
5000|$|Princess Trudie (performed by Alison McGowan) - She came to Mopatop's Shop in [...] "Cinderfella" [...] {{looking for}} a prince to fit a nose ring to Cinderfella. Her design {{is very similar to}} one of the Whozits of The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{different}} and she has curly hair, a dress, and tiara.|$|R
60|$|Ovid {{might have}} evaded her entreaties {{by means of}} an excuse. <b>But</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> irresistible: they looked him into {{submission}} in an instant.|$|E
60|$|Hetty smiled faintly {{and put her}} arm within his. Adam {{looked down}} at her, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> turned dreamily towards another corner of the garden.|$|E
6000|$|A {{trace of}} color crept into Violet Wayne’s face, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> fixed upon her {{companion}} {{as she said}} slowly, “Still, I think it is necessary.” ...|$|E
50|$|The 3.5 metre tall bronze {{sculpture}} {{was made}} in 2002 and depicts a huge fat woman from the west, sitting {{on the shoulders of}} a starved African boy. The woman is holding a pair of scales as a symbol of justice, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> closed to show that justice is degenerating into self-righteousness and unwillingness to see the obvious injustice.|$|R
6000|$|... "How now, sir leech!" [...] {{said the}} Dominican, [...] "do you call prayers {{for the dead}} juggling tricks? I know that Chaucer, the English maker, says of you mediciners, that your study is but little on the Bible. Our mother, the church, hath nodded of late, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> now opened to discern friends from foes; and be well assured--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Daphne Dreamer (performed by Susan Beattie) - Daphne Dreamer {{came into}} Mopatop's Shop in [...] "Mattresses" [...] {{looking for an}} empty {{mattress}} because hers is full of sleep, {{but all of them}} are full as well. Her design is very similar to one of the Whozits of The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> different and she has a blond curly wig and wears blue pajamas.|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned out}} of the window and gave an address to the man. Then she turned to Jacob. She was very pale <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> ablaze.|$|E
60|$|Grace lay {{silent in}} his arms: <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> fixed upon him; {{her hands were}} folded on her bosom; her lips moved as if in prayer.|$|E
60|$|When he overtook her at {{the foot}} of the first incline she was breathless, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> joyous as a child's and her cheeks were glowing.|$|E
6000|$|They all gazed {{upon the}} little girl curiously, {{and one of them}} said, [...] "How strangely light her color is! And it is pink, too, which is in <b>her</b> favor. <b>But</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> of that dreadful blue tint which {{prevails}} in the other half of Sky Island, while her hair is a queer color unknown to us. She is not like our people and would not harmonize with the universal color here." ...|$|R
60|$|During {{that time}} Jack wrote two letters to Ruth, and {{received}} one in return. The girl stated {{that she felt}} quite well, <b>but</b> that <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> still bothering <b>her</b> a good deal.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Touchett {{appeared}} at last, just after Isabel {{had returned to}} the big uninhabited drawing-room. She looked a good deal older, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> as bright as ever and her head as erect; her thin lips seemed a repository of latent meanings. She wore a little grey dress of the most undecorated fashion, and Isabel wondered, as she had wondered the first time, if her remarkable kinswoman resembled more a queen-regent or the matron of a gaol. Her lips felt very thin indeed on Isabel's hot cheek.|$|R
6000|$|Lucy laughed, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> soft. [...] "We {{all make}} mistakes, Mr. Foster, but your object was good. Besides, I {{feel that you}} will carry it out." ...|$|E
6000|$|Grace {{said little}} on her entrance, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> {{brighter}} than usual, {{and she looked}} so contented and happy that Emily observed to her, in an affectionate manner-- ...|$|E
60|$|Jeanne made no answer, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> full {{of tears}} {{as she put}} her hands into Harry's, and no sound came from her lips in answer to his good-night.|$|E
60|$|Diana bit {{her lips}} to {{restrain}} a frown, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> which he <b>was</b> avoiding, flashed wickedly.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Maria Refugio Rudecinda Sepulveda, the first(?) daughter of Diego Sepulveda {{who was born}} on March 2 (?), 1848, in her burial casket, [s. d. ]. She can be seen lying down at center with her head at right; it <b>is</b> turned forward <b>but</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> closed. She is visible wearing a fancy white dress and a crown, and can be seen holding a bouquet of flowers. Her head can be seen resting on a pillow with a lace cover and her body is resting on a sheet with zigzag edges. There is a fancy gold frame around the oval image...|$|R
6000|$|Willow-like she trembled, yet she [...] Never {{fled from}} me; [...] <b>But</b> <b>her</b> dove-like <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> downcast, [...] On the grass to see [...] White feet standing: white thy feet were, [...] Maid of Yí.|$|R
