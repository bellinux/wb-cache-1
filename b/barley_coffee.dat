60|$|An {{examination}} of the import list shows that 63.6 per cent are raw materials and food. The chief items of the former class, namely, cotton, wool, copper, hides, iron-ore, furs, silk, rubber, and tin, could not be much reduced without reacting on the export trade, and {{might have to be}} increased if the export trade was to be increased. Imports of food, namely, wheat, <b>barley,</b> <b>coffee,</b> eggs, rice, maize, and the like, present a different problem. It is unlikely that, apart from certain comforts, the consumption of food by the German laboring classes before the war was in excess of what was required for maximum efficiency; indeed, it probably fell short of that amount. Any substantial decrease in the imports of food would therefore react on the efficiency of the industrial population, and consequently on the volume of surplus exports which they could be forced to produce. It is hardly possible to insist on a greatly increased productivity of German industry if the workmen are to be underfed. But this may not be equally true of <b>barley,</b> <b>coffee,</b> eggs, and tobacco. If it were possible to enforce a régime in which for the future no German drank beer or coffee, or smoked any tobacco, a substantial saving could be effected. Otherwise there seems little room for any significant reduction.|$|E

Hot coffee may be sometimes replaced by hot tea, depending on personal taste. Children often drink hot chocolate, plain milk, hot milk with <b>barley</b> <b>coffee,</b> or hot milk with very little coffee. Cereals, yogurt and fruit juices are also common.

Melanoidin-rich fractions were extracted by ultrafiltration (10 KDa cut-off) from coffee, <b>barley</b> <b>coffee,</b> dark beer and traditional balsamic vinegar. All the food melanoidin-rich fraction were formed mainly of carbohydrates, phenolic compounds and proteins. In dark beer, <b>barley</b> <b>coffee</b> and traditional balsamic vinegar melanoidins, glucose was the most important sugar incorporated in melanoidins.

Recently, Vitaglione et al. reviewed the possible mechanisms by which coffee melanoidins may influence the risk of colorectal cancer development. In this work, we tested high molecular weight melanoidins (HMWM) extracted from different food sources for their cytotoxic activity against colon cancer cell lines. Water soluble HMWM were extracted by ultrafiltration (cut-off 10 kDa) from instant coffee, cocoa brew, dark beer and instant <b>barley</b> <b>coffee.</b> HMWM have been chemically characterized for their content in total polyphenols, protein, and polysaccharides, antioxidant activity as well as their spectroscopic properties. These extracts were assessed using two colon cancer cell lines: Caco- 2 and SW 480. Cytotoxic activity was assayed by MTT and data are presented as the dose that inhibited 50 % control growth (IC 50). All of the assessed HMWM were cytotoxic against Caco- 2 cell line. Coffee HMWM were the most effective (IC 50 of 1042 and 857 µg/mL after 24 and 48 h of treatment, respectively) followed by dark beer, <b>barley</b> <b>coffee</b> and cocoa HMWM. Meanwhile, they are less effective against SW 480 with coffee HMWM that were the most effective (IC 50 of 2038 µg/mL after 48 h) followed by cocoa, dark beer and <b>barley</b> <b>coffee.</b> Considering that the colon accumulates its content over at least 24 h in a maximum volume of 2 litres, and that the daily intake of coffee melanoidins range between 0. 5 and 2. 0 g, it is possible to calculate a hypothetical concentration of coffee melanoidins in the colon between 0. 25 and 1 mg/mL, which are values comparable to the IC 50 for the cytotoxic activity against colon cancer cells...|$|E

In this study, we have further examined the potential of BC, BC LMM fraction and BC HMM melanoidin fraction as caries controlling agents by evaluating their anti-biofilm activity. The effects of BC and BC fractions on biofilm formation by S. mutans ATCC 25175 and its detachment from pre-developed biofilms were evaluated by microtiter plate assay. It was found that BC and its fractions, at concentrations ranging from 60 to 15 mg ml- 1 that are devoid of antimicrobial activity, inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation. An increase of S. mutans ATCC 25175 detachment from 24 h developed biofilm was observed at the highest tested concentrations. Interestingly, BC and BC fractions also showed anti-biofilm activity towards a variety of S. mutans clinical strains isolated from saliva, plaque and caries lesions of adult donors. In general, the HMM melanoidin fraction was more active than the LMM fraction.

Of these fungi, the flax rust pathogen Melampsora lini {{has been developed}} extensively over the past 80 years as a model to understand the molecular mechanisms that underpin pathogenesis. During infection, M. lini secretes virulence effectors to promote disease. The number of these effectors, their function and their degree of conservation across rust fungal species is unknown. To assess this, we sequenced and assembled de novo the genome of M. lini isolate CH 5 into 21, 130 scaffolds spanning 189 Mbp (scaffold N 50 of 31 kbp). Global analysis of the DNA sequence revealed that repetitive elements, primarily retrotransposons, make up at least 45 % of the genome. Using ab initio predictions, transcriptome data and homology searches, we identified 16, 271 putative protein-coding genes. An analysis pipeline was then implemented to predict the effector complement of M. lini and compare it {{to that of the}} poplar rust, wheat stem rust and wheat stripe rust pathogens to identify conserved and species-specific effector candidates. Previous knowledge of four cloned M. lini avirulence effector proteins and two basidiomycete effectors was used to optimise parameters of the effector prediction pipeline. Markov clustering based on sequence similarity was performed to group effector candidates from all four rust pathogens. Clusters containing at least one member from M. lini were further analysed and prioritized based on features including expression in isolated haustoria and infected leaf tissue and conservation across rust species. Herein, we describe 200 of 940 clusters that ranked highest on our priority list, representing 725 flax rust candidate effectors. Our findings on this important model rust species provide insight into how effectors of rust fungi are conserved across species and how they may act to promote infection on their hosts...|$|R

Whilst such {{studies have been}} carried out with different in vitro systems, information about melanoidins absorption and bio-availability are scarce. However, they are generally considered as poorly absorbable and bio-available compounds. Therefore, we present a review in which the gastro-intestinal tract is hypothesized to be the main site of action of food melanoidins and melanoproteins biological activity. We described recent data supporting this hypothesis both in vitro model systems and in vivo. Importantly, we focused this review only on the effect of melanoidins and melanoproteins extracted from food. Most of the studies had been carried out using water-soluble carbohydrate-based melanoidins isolated from different food sources (beer, <b>barley</b> <b>coffee,</b> coffee). In bakery products, melanoidins are protein-based structure (melanoproteins) which are largely insoluble in water. Dietary melanoidins and melanoproteins have been demonstrated to exert in vitro antioxidant and metal chelating ability in the gastro-intestinal tract reducing the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and advanced lipid oxidation end products during the digestion of meat. The reduction in the formation of these pro-atherogenic compounds {{has been shown to be}} followed by a decrease in their absorption in human volunteers. Food melanoidins have also shown in vitro anti-caries and prebiotic activities. We conclude by underlining the possible role of food melanoidins in the prevention of gastro-intestinal tract cancers.

Among food additives permitted in Europe, the use of synthetic amorphous silica particles has recently captured the attention of the scientific community, since the European Commission Directive 2008 / 84 /EC 20. 9. 2008 which authorises its uses has neglected the possible hazards related to particle size of the primary grains, falling into the nano size range. In order to determine the properties and potential biological effects of nano-particles, physico-chemical particle characterization information is required, for example particle size, particle shape, aggregation grade, solubility, elemental purity and surface area, surface reactivity. At present, there are no standardized methodologies that can provide all these parameters at one time; rather different analytical methods must be used synergically to obtain reliable data. In this study, four types of SiO 2, available on the market as additives in food and personal care products, were firstly size characterized using Sedimentation Field Flow Fractionation (SdFFF), SEM, TEM and Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS). The synergic use of the different analytical techniques made it possible, for some samples, to confirm the presence of primary nanoparticles (10 nm) organised in clusters or aggregates of different dimension.

5000|$|Rice is {{the most}} {{important}} cereal crop. In 1966 total rice production amounted to a little more than 1 million tons; by 1989 more than 3 million tons were produced. Fluctuation in rice production was very common because of changes in rainfall; overall, however, rice production had increased following the introduction of new cultivation techniques as well as increases in cultivated land. By 1988 approximately 3.9 million hectares of land were under paddy cultivation. Many people in Nepal devote their lives to cultivating rice to survive. In 1966 approximately 500,000 tons of corn, the second major food crop, were produced. By 1989 corn production had increased to over 1 million tons.Other food crops included wheat, millet, <b>barley,</b> and <b>coffee,</b> but their contribution to the agricultural sector was small. Increased production of cash crops, used as input to new industries, dominated in the early 1970s. Sugarcane and tobacco also showed considerable increases in production from the 1970s to the l980s. Potatoes and oilseed production had shown moderate growth since 1980. Medicinal herbs were grown in the north on the slopes of the Himalayas, but increases in production were limited by continued environmental degradation. According to government statistics, production of milk, meat, and fruit had improved but as of the late 1980s still had not reached a point where nutritionally balanced food was available to most people. Additionally, the increases in meat and milk production had not met the desired level of output as of 1989.Nepal has more than 50% of people engaged in agriculture.Food grains contributed 76 percent of total crop production in 1988-89. In 1989-90 despite poor weather conditions and a lack of agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizer, there was a production increase of 5 percent. In fact, severe weather fluctuations often affected production levels. Some of the gains in production through the 1980s were due to increased productivity of the work force (about 7 percent over fifteen years); other gains were due to increased land use and favorable weather conditions.According to Statistical Information on Nepalese Agriculture (2008/2009) only 65.6% of people depends on agriculture and 21% of land is cultivated whereas 6.99% of land is uncultivated.|$|R
40|$|Drying is a {{water removal}} process {{involving}} simultaneous heat and mass transfer process. Usually, it {{is referred to}} a process involving vapor removal. Study of drying is important since it is an energy-intensive process because large amount of heat needs to be supplied for evaporating water. Drying also affects significantly the product quality of materials. Optimization exercises need {{to be carried out}} to maintain the highest possible product quality of the materials during drying as well as minimizing energy consumption. The optimization procedures often involve modeling. Hence, reliable drying model can assist in process design, process simulation and optimization. For process design, {{it can be used to}} explore new innovative designs of a dryer, to evaluate the performance of existing dryer and to assess its energy consumption. For maintaining product quality, a reliable drying model can be applied to explore new processes and to optimize the existing process to achieve high quality products. A reliable drying model should ideally be simple, accurate, able to capture the physics of drying process and require minimum sets of experiments to generate the drying parameters. The minimal number of laboratory trials required is a feature useful for industry. The reaction engineering approach (REA) was proposed by Professor X. D. Chen in 1996 and has been used successfully to model several drying processes mainly thin layer drying and drying of small particulates of food materials. The physics of the drying process is captured by the relative activation energy which represents the level of difficulty to ‘extract’ moisture during drying in addition to evaporating free water. Initially, it may be zero near the start of drying of high moisture product and keeps on increasing during drying as drying progresses. When the low equilibrium moisture content is reached, the relative activation energy becomes one. The relative activation energy of the same materials can be used to model other drying processes with the similar initial moisture content. The REA framework allows a very effective way to obtain the necessary parameters. Because of the efficiency of the REA framework established so far, it is worthwhile to develop further the REA in an innovative manner and to implement the REA to more complex scenarios. The REA, which was previously proposed in the lumped format, is now labeled as the lumped reaction engineering approach (L-REA) and more comprehensively, we have developed the spatial reaction engineering approach (S-REA) in the current work. In L-REA, the REA is used to model the global drying rate while in S-REA, the REA is applied to model the local evaporation rate and coupled with a system of equations of conservation to yield a spatial model. To expand the L-REA approach, it is implemented in this study to model convective infrared-heating drying, convective drying of several centimeters thick samples, intermittent drying under time-varying temperature, humidity and infrared-heating, baking, roasting and heat treatment of wood under linearly increased temperature. In all the cases of food and natural materials, appropriate shrinkage models are required. The S-REA is developed and applied here to model convective drying, intermittent drying and heat treatment of wood under constant heating rate, where spatial energy and mass balances are resolved. For modeling of the convective drying of other materials, the original formulation of the L-REA is implemented. Without any modification, the L-REA can model the convective drying of the mixture of polymer solutions accurately. For modeling the infrared-heating drying, a new definition of the equilibrium activation energy has to be introduced. For modeling of convective drying of several centimeters of thick sample using the L-REA, the approximation of spatial distribution of sample temperature is used. The surface temperature is also implemented in the mass and heat balances as well as the evaluation of saturated water vapor concentration. It is emphasized that the L-REA does not actually assume uniform moisture content inside the sample but the L-REA evaluates the average moisture content during drying. The results indicate that the L-REA models well the convective drying of non-food materials, infrared-heating drying and convective drying of several centimeters of thick sample. The L-REA is applied to model the intermittent drying of food and non-food materials under time-varying humidity, temperature and infrared-heating intensity. Surprisingly, for modeling the intermittent drying, no major modification of the original formulation of the REA is necessary. In order to incorporate the effect of time-varying humidity and temperature, the equilibrium activation energy is evaluated according to the corresponding humidity and temperature in each drying period. The relative activation energy generated from convective drying of materials under constant environmental conditions can be used to model the intermittent drying. The results indicate that the L-REA can model actually the intermittent drying of food and non-food materials under slow and rapid change of ambient humidity and temperature. For modeling the intermittent drying under time-varying infrared-heating intensity using the L-REA, two schemes of definition of equilibrium activation energy is used. The first scheme employs the relationship between the infrared-heating intensity in each stage and the final product temperature in each stage should the infrared heating be prolonged to equilibrium. The second scheme uses direct relationship between the infrared-heating intensity in each stage and equilibrium activation energy. Both definitions are combined with the relative activation energy, generated from convective drying run under constant environmental conditions to yield the activation energy. It has been shown that the L-REA can also model very well the intermittent drying under time-varying infrared-heating intensity. The L-REA is further implemented to model the simultaneous heat and mass transfer processes at high temperature namely baking of bread, roasting of <b>barley</b> and <b>coffee</b> and heat treatment of wood under constant heating rate. For modeling these processes, no modification of the original formulation of the REA is required. For modeling the heat treatment of wood under constant heating rate which is essentially a drying process under linearly increased gas temperature, the equilibrium activation energy is evaluated according to corresponding humidity and temperature during the process. The results indicate that the L-REA can model these processes well. The use of non-equilibrium multiphase drying model is suggested as the model can offer better understanding of drying process and it can be used to assess the suitability of equilibrium multiphase drying model. However, the model requires explicit formulation of the local evaporation rate. The REA is further implemented to model the local evaporation rate and coupled with a system of equations of conservation of heat and mass transfer to yield a spatial model called the spatial reaction engineering approach (S-REA), as a non-equilibrium multiphase drying model. The S-REA consists of the spatial mass balances of liquid water and water vapor as well as the heat balance in the conventional manner. In the mass balances of liquid water and water vapor, the REA is used as the depletion and source terms, respectively. The REA is also adopted as the local evaporation rate term in the heat balance. The relative activation energy, implemented in the L-REA and generated in one accurate drying run, is used to model the local evaporation rate for the same material but the average moisture content is now replaced by the local moisture content. In this study, the S-REA has been implemented to model the convective drying, intermittent drying and heat treatment of wood under constant heating rate. The accuracy of the S-REA to model these processes as well as the applicability of the REA to describe the local evaporation rate has been assessed. For modeling convective drying using the S-REA, using the approach mentioned above, it has been shown that the results of modeling match well with the experimental data. The S-REA is capable to model the spatial profiles of moisture content, concentration of water vapor and temperature accurately. Due to the application of the REA as the local evaporation rate, the profiles of local evaporation rate and concentration of water vapor can now be generated so that better insightful physics of drying can be gained. The S-REA has also been successfully applied to modeling of the intermittent drying and heat treatment of wood under linearly increased temperature. Based on the extensive modeling exercises carried out in this study, it can be concluded that the REA framework is very useful in characterizing various challenging drying and other simultaneous heat and mass transfer processes. The L-REA has been proven to be accurate and effective to model these processes with simplicity being a major advantage. The REA framework has also been shown to be able to model the local evaporation/condensation rate well. The S-REA is an effective non-equilibrium multiphase drying approach to provide better understanding of transport phenomena of drying and other simultaneous heat and mass transfer processes that involve water transformations. It is interesting to note that the L-REA parameters obtained in laboratory can also be used in S-REA simulations for the same material being dried. This presents an obvious practical advantage.
