These donor/provider restrictions are usually communicated in writing and {{may be found in}} the terms of an agreement, government grant, will or gift.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{geometric}} multiplicity of the eigenvalue 2 is only 1, because its eigenspace is spanned by just one vector T {{and is therefore}} 1-dimensional.

Geometric multiplicities are defined in a later section.|$|E
