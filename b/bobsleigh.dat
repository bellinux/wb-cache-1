5|$|Bond veteran {{cameraman}} {{and professional}} skier Willy Bogner, Jr. {{was promoted to}} director of a second unit involving ski footage. Bogner designed the ski chase on the <b>bobsleigh</b> track of Cortina d'Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me. To allow better filming, Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a <b>bobsleigh,</b> allowing to film the vehicle or behind it, {{and a set of}} skis that allowed him to ski forwards and backwards to get the best shots. In February 1981, {{on the final day of}} filming the <b>bobsleigh</b> chase, one of the stuntmen driving a sleigh, 23-year-old Paolo Rigon, was killed when he became trapped under the bob.|$|E

5|$|In 1984 in Sarajevo, Steven Lee and Cameron Medhurst placed 19th in the {{downhill}} and individual figure skating respectively. No other top 20 finishes were recorded among the 11 athletes, {{and the two}} cross-country skiers and the first Australian Olympic biathlete, Andrew Paul, finished no better than 47th in their eight events. Australia sent 15 athletes to the 1988 Olympics in Calgary, where they competed in the <b>bobsleigh</b> for the first time. The two two-man <b>bobsleigh</b> teams came 23rd and 26th respectively, well down the field.|$|E
5|$|Lillehammer Olympic <b>Bobsleigh</b> and Luge Track {{is located}} at Hunderfossen {{and is the only}} <b>bobsleigh,</b> luge and {{skeleton}} track in the Nordic countries. Kristins Hall will host ice hockey and curling. Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall is located in a man-made cave and will feature the short-track speed skating events. In Hamar, Vikingskipet will host long track speed skating and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre will host figure skating. Alpine skiing and slopestyle snowboarding will take place at Hafjell in Øyer.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic {{program was}} {{adjusted}} {{from that of}} the 1956 Winter Olympics omitting <b>bobsleigh</b> and adding a sport new to Olympic competition, men's biathlon. The sport of military patrol, similar to biathlon, had previously been a medal sport in 1924 and a demonstration sport in 1928, 1936 and 1948. The removal of <b>bobsleigh</b> from the Olympic program was by necessity; the site for the 1960 Games lacked a <b>bobsleigh</b> track and the funds were not available to build one. Despite only five nations confirming their intention to take part, the removal of the event from the program garnered international criticism. Both men and women competed at the 1960 Games, with women taking part in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and speed skating.|$|E

5|$|The <b>bobsleigh</b> {{track was}} built for the 1952 Winter Olympics, where it hosted two <b>bobsleigh</b> events. Contrary to popular belief, this was not built at Korketrekkeren but as a {{separate}} run nearby also starting at Frognerseteren. It was built as a temporary, artificial track with the curves being constructed in snow and then frozen hard to ice. Trial runs were undertaken in 1951 and the <b>bobsleigh</b> course was not used after 1952. Both Olympic events were won by Germany, with Andreas Ostler and Lorenz Nieberl participating in both winning teams. The tobogganing hill hosted the inaugural FIL World Luge Championships 1955, with Norway's Anton Salvesen winning the men's single—the only time in history Norway has won a World Luge Championships medal.|$|E
5|$|The first Australian {{to compete}} in <b>bobsleigh</b> {{represented}} Great Britain. Frederick McEvoy drove the British two-man and four-man bobsleighs in 1936, earning fourth place and a bronze respectively, and carried the British flag at the opening ceremony. Australia first competed in <b>bobsleigh</b> in 1988, and has competed in the event in every Olympics since, except for 2002. Paul Narracott became the first Australian to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics: he competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in athletics, and participated in <b>bobsleigh</b> in 1992 as the brakeman. Australia competed in luge in 1992 and 1994. They did not compete in skeleton in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{elimination}} of the United States ice hockey team, American television stations needed to fill airtime and chose to focus on the Jamaican <b>bobsleigh</b> team in the four-man event. The first run ended poorly, as when Dudley Stokes jumped into the <b>bobsleigh,</b> the push-bar in the sleigh broke, resulting in the team coming in third from last in 24th place. On their second attempt, the team ranked second to last, due in part to White struggling to crouch down properly in his seat, remaining almost upright through the first corner.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Lillehammer Olympics, {{there was}} no <b>bobsleigh</b> and luge track in Norway. During the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Korketrekkeren had been built as a {{temporary}} venue, but {{it was made of}} snow and was not reused after the Olympics. In its bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, Lillehammer had proposed placing the <b>bobsleigh</b> and luge track next to Balbergbakken in Fåberg. By May 1989, plans for most of the venues were being reshuffled and the track was then proposed located at Kanthaugen as part of an Olympic Park at Stampesletta. The Kanthaugen proposal was estimated to cost NOK231 million.|$|E

5|$|The IOC {{awarded the}} 1960 Olympics to Squaw Valley, United States. Since the village had no facilities, {{there was a}} rush to {{construct}} infrastructure and sports facilities including an ice arena, speed-skating track, and a ski-jump hill. The opening and closing ceremonies were produced by Walt Disney. The Squaw Valley Olympics was the first winter Olympics to have a dedicated athletes' village, {{the first to use}} a computer (courtesy of IBM) to tabulate results, and the first to feature female speed skating events. The <b>bobsleigh</b> events were absent for the only time due to the cost of building a <b>bobsleigh</b> run.|$|E
5|$|The International <b>Bobsleigh</b> and Skeleton Federation {{suspended}} four Russian skeleton sliders. They {{are among}} the six athletes on the skeleton team: Nikita Tregubov, Alexander Tretyakov, Sergey Chudinov, Elena Nikitina, Maria Orlova and Olga Potylitsina. Tretyakov won a gold medal, and Nikitina won a bronze.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{occasional}} proposals that Norway should build a permanent <b>bobsleigh</b> track, where Korketrekkeren {{was the leading}} location. The debate died out in the 1990s with the selection of Lillehammer as {{the host of the}} 1994 Winter Olympics and the subsequent construction of Lillehammer Olympic <b>Bobsleigh</b> and Luge Track. Also the Oslo bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics proposed using the Lillehammer track. In 2007, there were two serious accidents in the hill and it was subsequently closed by the police. The municipality then renovated the hill, removing poles and polstering dangerous edges.|$|E
5|$|Three of the venues {{for these}} games (the <b>bobsleigh</b> run, indoor arena, and ski jump) {{would serve as}} film {{location}} for the 1981 James Bond film For Your Eyes Only.|$|E
5|$|Unusually {{for winter}} sports, <b>bobsleigh</b> {{has never been}} popular in Norway. The country had not sent an Olympic team until the 1948 Winter Olympics {{and there were no}} {{previous}} <b>bobsleigh</b> tracks in Norway when Oslo was awarded the 1952 Winter Olympics. Two Swiss civil engineers, Heinz Cattani and Emil Ingold, were the main technical consultants {{for the development of the}} venue. The steep terrain made construction excessively expensive, resulting in the organizing committee deciding to build a temporary track, without permanent concrete and stone curves. Instead, a new track was constructed each year using snow: the overhangs were built by hand, the tracks were leveled and the structure sprayed with ice until it was hard.|$|E
