40|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>Lot</b> 4. 12 {{consists}} of approximately 17, 500 yd{sup 3 } of low-level, radioactively contaminated soil, concrete, and incidental metal and debris generated from remedial actions at the K- 770 Scrap Metal Yard and Contaminated Debris Site (the K- 770 Scrap Yard) at the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP). The excavated soil will be transported by dump truck to the Environmental Management Waste Management Facility (EMWMF). This profile provides project-specific information to demonstrate compliance with Attainment Plan for Risk/Toxicity-based Waste Acceptance Criteria at the Oak Ridge Reservation, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (DOE 2001). The K- 770 Scrap Yard is an approximately 36 -acre storage area located {{southwest of the}} main portion of ETTP, outside the security perimeter fence in the Powerhouse Area adjacent to the Clinch River. The K- 770 area was used to store radioactively contaminated or suspected contaminated materials during and previous to the K- 25 Site cascade upgrading program. The waste storage facility began operation in the 1960 s and is estimated to at one time contain in excess of 40, 000 tons of low-level, radioactively contaminated scrap metal. Scrap metal {{was taken to the}} site when it was found to contain alpha or beta/gamma activity on the surface or if the scrap metal originated from a process building. The segregated metal debris was removed from the site as part of the K- 770 Scrap Removal Action (RA) Project that was completed in fiscal year (FY) 2007 by Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC (BJC). An area of approximately 10 acres is located in EUs 29 and 31 where the scrap was originally located in the 100 -year floodplain. In the process of moving the materials around and establishing segregated waste piles above the 100 -year floodplain, the footprint of the site was expanded by 10 - 15 acres in EUs 30 and 32. The area in EUs 29 and 31 that was cleared of metallic debris in the floodplain was sown with grass. The areas in EUs 30 and 32 have some scattered vegetation but are generally open and accessible. With limited exception, all materials contained in the scrap yard have been removed and disposed at the EMWMF. Soils that underlay the original waste storage area in EUs 29 and 31 as well as soils that underlay the scrap piles in EUs 30 and 32 show substantially elevated radioactivity. In addition to soils present at the site, remaining portions of foundations/floor slabs for Bldgs. K- 725, K- 726, and K- 736 as well as the unnamed pad at the northeast corner of the site constructed to support the sort and segregation operations at the K- 770 Scrap Removal Project in 2006 and several other small, unnamed concrete pads are included in this <b>waste</b> <b>lot.</b> While many of these foundations/floor slabs will be removed because they are contaminated, some of the smaller unamed concrete pads will be removed in order to access contaminated soils that are around and under the pads and regrade the site. Appendix E contains a map showing the areas of soil and concrete pads that are expected to be excavated. Soils in the areas indicated on this map will be removed to approximately one foot below the surface. (This corresponds to the soil interval sampled and analyzed to characterize this <b>waste</b> <b>lot.)</b> Contaminants present in the soils are directly derived from metallic debris and rubbish handled by the waste storage operations, are concentrated in the top few inches, and include the predominant constituents of concern associated with the metallic waste already disposed at EMWMF. Additionally, some residual metallic debris remains embedded in the shallow soils that underlay the former debris piles. This residual metallic debris is eligible for disposal in the EMWMF WAC criteria as defined in Waste Profile for: Disposal of the Scrap Removal Project <b>Waste</b> <b>Lot</b> 65. 1 East Tennessee Technology Park, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (BJC 2004 a).

40|$|Cachexia is an {{irreversible}} {{process that can}} develop {{in the course of}} chronic disease. It is characterized by the remodeling of the metabolic, inflammatory, and endocrine pathways. Insulin, growth hormone (GH), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) are involved in glucose, protein, and fat metabolism, which regulates body composition. In <b>body</b> <b>wasting</b> and cachexia, their signaling is impaired and causes anabolic/catabolic imbalance. Important mechanisms include inflammatory cytokines and neurohormonal activation. Remodeled post-receptor insulin, GH, and IGF- 1 pathways constitute a potential target for pharmacological treatment in the setting of <b>body</b> <b>wasting</b> and cachexia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists, drugs inhibiting angiotensin II action (angiotensin II antagonists and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme), and testosterone, which interfere with post-receptor pathways of insulin, GH, and IGF- 1, were investigated as pharmacological intervention targets and various clinically important implications were reported.

40|$|Section 5. 1 of the {{approved}} Waste Handling Plan for Demolition ofthe K- 25 and K- 2 7 Building Structures and Remaining Components Located at the East Tennessee Technology Park, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (WHP) {{includes two}} Environmental Management Waste Management (EMWMF) waste lots: (1) Asbestos-contaminated roofing/transite; and (2) Construction debris, such as nonasbestos roofing, structural steel/miscellaneous metal/equipment, nonradiological piping, wood, and miscellaneous small quantities of concrete. This concurrence form adds an additional EMWMF <b>waste</b> <b>lot</b> 6. 47 for lavatory sink drains. Based on {{an analysis of}} the building structure characterization data, the only individual building structure with either an analytic carcinogenic or Hazard Index (HI) sum-of-fractions (SOF) greater than 1 is the lavatory sink drains (Table 1). The HI SOF for the lavatory sink drains is 1. 34 (Table 2). When all media are combined with the material of construction calculations, the HI SOF is 1. 22 (Table 3). However, when the lavatory sink drains are segregated from all other media, the HI SOF is only 0. 256, which is well below the EMWMF waste acceptance criteria SOF limit of 1 (Table 4). Given the large volume (124, 625 cubic yards) of other building structure media with a small HI SOF of 0. 256 and the small volume (one cubic yard) of lavatory sink drains with a large HI SOF of 1. 34, a separate <b>waste</b> <b>lot</b> for lavatory sink drains is recommended. Lead is the primary contributor to the large HI SOF in the lavatory sink drains. Lead in the lavatory sink drains was shown using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistically to have higher concentrations than all other building structure media combined. Other analytes having statistically different median concentrations in the lavatory sink drains compared to all other media are antimony, arsenic, boron, cadmium, selenium, solver, vanadium, zinc, mercury, strontium, and Uranium- 233 / 234 (Table 5). A separate <b>waste</b> <b>lot</b> for the lavatory sink drains minimizes the volume weighted sum-of fractions since a much smaller volume of waste will have the higher HI SOF of 1. 34, while a much larger volume of waste will have a small HI SOF of 0. 256...|$|R

40|$|Cardiac {{cachexia}} (i. e. <b>body</b> <b>wasting)</b> {{has long}} been recognised as a serious complication of chronic heart failure (CHF) which affects many body systems and remains an important and increasing public health problem. The occurrence of wasting in CHF {{has been known for}} many centuries but little investigated. Independently of functional disease severity, age, and measures of exercise capacity and cardiac function, cardiac cachexia is associated with poor prognosis. Cachectic CHF patients are weaker and fatigue earlier because of a general loss of fat tissue, lean tissue and bone tissue as well as impaired muscle quality. There is a shift of understanding of pathophysiology of cardiac cachexia with increasing evidences that metabolic, neurohormonal and immune abnormalities may play a significant role as well the degree of <b>body</b> <b>wasting</b> is dependent on such changes.
