500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first thing I think of every morning when I wake and the last thing I think of every night <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|E
500|$|Producer Marc E. Platt {{contacted}} actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: [...] "I {{have this}} list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me [...] writers, directors, actors whom I {{have to work}} with <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> onto another career or do something else with my life." [...] Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling claimed that he was simply put off from the genre, believing that the action films of today focused more on stunts instead of characters. Despite this, Platt heard back from the actor around 48 hours later. Gosling has stated that his strong attraction to the plot led him to take on the leading role of the unnamed driver, saying that he was drawn to the [...] "very strong character" [...] at its core, as well as the [...] "powerful" [...] romance.|$|E
500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to bed. An idea will suddenly come to my mind, and sometimes I manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vedder {{was heavily}} {{inspired}} by the early Jethro Tull sound, stating that: [...] "I'm {{a big fan of}} Jethro Tull, and I listen to this record [...] every night <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on stage!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Notable {{examples}} include Lucy Whitmore in 50 First Dates, Dory in Finding Nemo and Finding Dory, Do Kyungsoo in [...] Anterograde Tomorrow, [...] Jonathan Archer in the [...] episode [...] "", Chris Pratt in The Lookout, Kaori Fujimiya in One Week Friends, Chihiro Shindou in , Christine Lucas in <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> to Sleep, Gus in Remember Sunday, and Sanjay in Ghajini. In the TV series Perception, an episode revolved around a crime victim with this condition. The main character in Gene Wolfe's novels Soldier of the Mist, and the anime characters Vash the Stampede from Trigun and Index from A Certain Magical Index suffers from both retrograde and anterograde amnesia too.|$|E
2500|$|Sinéad O'Connor {{reviewed}} the album on 28 November 2007 on The Dave Fanning Show and praised it as: [...] "the record I {{always come back}} to again and again...It is far superior to Astral Weeks and I love Astral Weeks. [...] This is the definitive Van album with the definitive Van song, [...] "Who Was That Masked Man"...It's the most obvious album he's ever done about Ireland...Veedon Fleece {{is the only thing}} I listen to just <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on stage." [...] When asked in an interview in 2005 to name something she considered [...] "a mind-altering work of art", she answered: [...] "Van Morrison's Veedon Fleece." ...|$|E

2500|$|Osbourne has abused {{alcohol and}} other drugs {{for most of his}} adult life. He {{admitted}} to Sounds in 1978, [...] "I get high, I get fucked up ... what the hell's wrong with getting fucked up? There must be something wrong with the system if so many people have to get fucked up ... I never take dope or anything <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on stage. I'll smoke a joint or whatever afterwards." [...] Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that, while all the band were involved with {{alcohol and other}} drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all. Despite this, said Iommi, he was typically the only one left standing when the others were [...] "out for the count". Keyboardist Don Airey said that Osbourne's substance-abuse issues were what caused him to leave the band.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Kidman {{starred in}} the biopic, Grace of Monaco {{in the title role}} that chronicles the 1962 crisis, in which Charles de Gaulle {{blockaded}} the tiny principality, angered by Monaco's status as a tax haven for wealthy French subjects and Kelly's contemplating a Hollywood return to star in Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie. Opening out of competition at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, the film received largely negative reviews. Kidman also starred in two films with Colin Firth, the first, the British-Australian historical drama, The Railway Man in which Kidman played officer's wife Patti Lomax received positive critical reviews. Katherine Monk of the Montreal Gazette said of Kidman's performance, [...] "It's a truly masterful piece of acting that transcends Teplitzky's store-bought framing, but it's Kidman who delivers the biggest surprise: For the first time since her eyebrows turned into solid marble arches, the Australian Oscar winner is truly terrific". The second, the British thriller film <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> To Sleep drew positive critical response of Kidman's performance, as Christine Lucas, a car crash survivor with brain damage. Kidman also appeared in the family film Paddington (2014) as a villain.|$|E
