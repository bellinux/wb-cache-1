5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to have a}} successful performance review {{in order to get}} a raise. He makes elaborate posters, prepares a ridiculous speech, and pumps himself up in the office's hallway. Unfortunately for him, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) successfully prank him by making him <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a Friday instead of a Thursday. He arrives at the office very late the next day, much to Michael's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one must believe it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true; if that is the case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins at}} a funeral, {{attended}} by Guy, Caroline, Boyce (Oliver Chris), Martin Dear (Karl Theobald) and Sue White (Michelle Gomez). References {{made in the}} episode lead the viewer to first <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Mac's funeral, but then a giant picture of Angela Hunter (Sarah Alexander), who left the hospital in series two, appears. The cause of her death is not fully explained, although comments made by the characters indicate she died in a hunting accident with a moose. The plot then splits between three groups of characters.|$|E
50|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 1981 {{showed that a}} substantial majority of U.S. adults and adolescents <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> socially unacceptable to discuss menstruation, especially in mixed company.

5|$|We <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the {{inalienable}} {{right of the}} Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy {{the fruits of their}} toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E
5|$|While East Timor's {{decision}} {{to form a}} military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as {{an effective means of}} integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Viking metal scene <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{impossible}} for someone to be a Viking unless they themselves are of northern European descent. According to Trafford and Pluskowski, the members of practically all Viking metal bands claim Viking ancestry, and after its inception in Scandinavia, Viking metal spread to areas historically settled by Vikings, including England, Russia, and Normandy. Viking metal bands have even formed in the United States and Canada, with their members claiming Viking descent either directly from Scandinavia or through England. The scene also spread {{to other parts of}} Northern Europe in areas united by a common Germanic heritage, such as Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. For instance, the Austrian band Valhalla makes extensive use of Viking iconography, including horned helmets. Another Austrian example is Amestigon, which on the cover of its promotional album Remembering Ancient Origins depicts a wood carved scene of Sigurd killing Regin, an image taken from a panel held in Hylestad stave church.|$|E

25|$|Although {{scientists}} favor biological {{models for}} the cause of sexual orientation, they do not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the result of any one factor. They generally <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> determined by biological and environmental factors; they state that most people's sexual orientation is determined at an early age, and sexual orientation development involves a complex interplay between nature and nurture. The biological factors are genetic and hormonal, both of which affect the fetal development of the brain, while environmental factors may be sociological, psychological, or involve the early uterine environment. Scientists generally do not believe that sexual orientation is a matter of choice.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} {{theories}} {{about the origins of}} Arabic Algebra.

25|$|Like Pinot noir, Sangiovese {{and many}} other grape varieties, Furmint has beget over centuries a variety of clones, {{including}} a pink-skinned color mutation known as Piros Furmint.
