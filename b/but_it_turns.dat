It is filled with looted treasure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> out that Imperial Security's headquarters has inadvertently been built {{just across the street}} from where the bunker is buried. Ivan is drawn into the scheme to dig their way to it (very quietly using an experimental biological organism).

25|$|An {{obvious way}} to {{generate}} permutations of n is to generate {{values for the}} Lehmer code (possibly using the factorial number system representation of integers up to n!), and convert those into the corresponding permutations. However, the latter step, while straightforward, is hard to implement efficiently, because it requires n operations each of selection from a sequence and deletion from it, at an arbitrary position; of the obvious representations of the sequence as an array or a linked list, both require (for different reasons) about n2/4 operations to perform the conversion. With n likely to be rather small (especially if generation of all permutations is needed) that is not {{too much of a}} problem, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> out that both for random and for systematic generation there are simple alternatives that do considerably better. For this reason it does not seem useful, although certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that would allow performing the conversion from Lehmer code to permutation in O(n log n) time.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure that}} Fiona {{falls in love}} with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This {{exchange}} is overheard by Shrek, Donkey and Puss, who are soon later arrested by the royal guards and thrown into a dungeon.

The gang creates a monster-sized gingerbread man, which breaks through the castle's defences so Shrek can prevent Charming from kissing Fiona. He is too late to stop them; instead of falling in love with Charming, though, Fiona knocks him out with a headbutt. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the now enraged Fairy Godmother attacks Shrek. In the ensuing melee, Harold sacrifices himself to save Shrek; Harold's armour ricochets the Fairy Godmother's spell which disintegrates her into bubbles; Fiona runs to her dad's clothing and thinks that he died <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> out that it actually returns Harold to his true form as the Frog Prince. He had used the Happily Ever After potion years before in order to marry Lillian, but she tells him that she loves him regardless of his appearance.|$|E

[...] This sentiment was echoed by Rosie Swash from The Observer who also gave the album three stars out of five.
