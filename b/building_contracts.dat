5|$|In {{preparation}} for redevelopment, {{the remains of}} the train shed roof had been demolished in 1958, and Barry's hotel (which had been used as offices since 1931) soon followed in 1960. The architect selected to design the new building was John Poulson who was good friends with Graham Tunbridge, a British Rail surveyor whom he had met during the war. Poulson took advantage of this friendship to win contracts for the redevelopment of various British Rail termini. He paid Tunbridge a weekly income of £25 and received in return <b>building</b> <b>contracts,</b> including the rebuilding of Waterloo and East Croydon stations. At his trial in 1974, Poulson admitted that, shortly before receiving the Cannon Street building contract, he had given Tunbridge a cheque for £200 and a suit worth £80. Poulson was later found guilty of corruption charges and was given a seven-year concurrent sentence; Tunbridge received a 15-month suspended sentence and £4,000 fine {{for his role in the}} affair.|$|E

Prior to the Tarsney Act of 1893, federal buildings were designed by architects at the treasury.

At the treasury, Fitzpatrick worked for Jeremiah O'Rourke and then for William Aiken. Fitzpatrick was assigned to the Chicago Federal Building project as an assistant to architect Henry Ives Cobb, and he moved to Chicago to become one of many supervisors of construction. Soon Fitzpatrick was the only supervisor of construction, and his relationship with Cobb deteriorated for reasons of procurement and process related to construction. Fitzpatrick resigned from the project in 1903 and returned to private practice two years before the building was completed.|$|E
40|$|Contract, generally, is {{a binding}} {{agreement}} between {{two or more}} persons which creates mutual rights and duties and which are enforceable at law. Remedy {{will be available to}} the innocent parties if the other party fails to perform his part of agreement. For <b>building</b> <b>contract,</b> damages will be an adequate compensation for a breach due to majority of issues and disputes in <b>building</b> <b>contract</b> involves money. The parties nonetheless can choose to seek for specific performance. Specific performance is one of the equitable remedies where the court will ask the party to perform his part of a contract. However, the parties in a <b>building</b> <b>contract</b> do not favour this right in remedying the breach, and similarly there is not much law cases that illustrate the specific performance has been exercised especially in <b>building</b> <b>contract.</b> Hence, this master project has been done to identify the reason for not granting specific performance by the court with respect of <b>building</b> <b>contract.</b> The law cases collected from year 1980 to year 2009 is done mainly through documentary analysis of law journals and law reports via Lexis-Nexis website, e. g. Malayan Law Journal, Building Law Report, Construction Law Report, etc. The results show that there are 7 reasons in which the specific performance will not be granted to the parties in a <b>building</b> <b>contract</b> such as when there is adequacy of legal remedies, constant supervision from the court, uncertainty terms in a contract, on the ground of hardship, vacant possession of site, willingness and readiness as well as whether valid contract has exists or not. This research will shed some light in exposing what are the possible reasons that the court may refuse to grant specific performance and forms a guideline for the parties in a <b>building</b> <b>contract</b> when they resort to specific performance...|$|R

25|$|<b>Building</b> <b>contracts</b> were advertised after {{a popular}} or elected {{assembly}} {{had passed the}} relevant motion. An appointed committee would choose the winner among the submitted plans. Afterwards, another committee would supervise the building process. Its responsibilities included the advertising and awarding of individual contracts, the practical supervision of the construction, the inspection and acceptance of completed parts, and the paying of wages. The original advert contained all the information necessary to enable a contractor to make a realistic offer for completing the task. Contracts were normally awarded to the competitor offering the most complete service for the cheapest price. In the case of public buildings, the materials were normally provided by the public sponsor, exceptions were clarified in the contract. Contractors were usually only responsible for specific parts of the overall construction, as most businesses were small. Originally, payment was by person and day, but from the 5th century BC onwards, payment by piece or construction stage became common.|$|E

Other engineering works included an aqueduct cut through a hill at Inveresk, and in 1741, an attempt to promote a Forth and Clyde canal, a project eventually realised by others some 30 years later. His main concern from 1731 became Blair Crambeth, the estate in Kinross-shire, near Kelty, which he purchased that year for £8,010 Scots. Renaming the estate Blair Adam, he set about expanding and improving it, planting trees, enclosing land, and setting up coal mines.

40|$|The {{forms of}} {{contract}} {{published by the}} Joint Contracts Tribunal Ltd (the JCT) are {{the most widely used}} standard forms of <b>building</b> <b>contract</b> in the UK. They have a long history, with the earliest form published in 1909 (known as “the RIBA form”). This subsequently evolved, through a series of editions published in 1931, 1939, 1963 and 1980, into the 1998 edition of the JCT Standard Form of <b>Building</b> <b>Contract.</b> In parallel with this, the JCT developed other standard forms to cover a wide variety of procurement options. Their widespread use stems from this long tradition, and their claimed advantage of being both standard and agreed by consensus between representatives of all the interested parties Over the last few months the JCT has republished many of its standard forms of contract, and expanded the range with new contracts, subcontracts and guidance documents. The JCT describes this exercise as “a complete update and redesign” of the suite. Publication took place over the period of May to December 2005, and at the time of writing (October 2005) many of the main forms have been published although some, for example the Construction Management Contract, the Management Contract and the Prime Cost Contract are not yet available and many of the subcontracts, warranties and guides are likewise still to appear. The forms for traditional procurement, including the Standard <b>Building</b> <b>Contract</b> 2005 (formerly the Standard Form of <b>Building</b> <b>Contract</b> 1998), the Intermediate <b>Building</b> <b>Contract</b> and the Minor Works <b>Building</b> <b>Contract,</b> are, however, all published, together with related guidance.

He obtained with his partners in about 1760 the contract to rebuild Plymouth docks, for which he used granite from Haytor, and moved to Devon.

2500|$|The {{duties of}} an {{administrator}} in Schedule B1, paragraph 3 are theoretically {{meant to be}} exercised {{for the benefit of}} the creditors as a whole. However the administrator's duties on paper lie in tension with how, and by whom, an administrator is appointed. The holder of a floating charge, which covers substantially all of a company's property (typically the company's bank), has an almost absolute right to select the administrator. Under Schedule B1, paragraph 14, it may appoint the administrator directly, and can do so out of court. The company need not be technically insolvent, so long as the terms of the floating charge allow appointment. The directors or the company may also appoint an administrator out of court, but must give five days' notice to any floating charge holder, who may at any point intervene and install his own preferred candidate. The court can, in law, refuse the floating charge holder's choice of administrator because of the 'particular circumstances of the case', though this will be rare. Typically banks wish to avoid the spotlight and any effect on their reputation, and so they suggest that company directors appoint the administrator from their own list. Other creditors may also apply to court for an administrator to be appointed, although once again, the floating charge holder may intervene. In this case, the court will grant the petition for appointment of an administrator only if, first, the company [...] "is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts" [...] (identical to IA 1986 section 123) and [...] "the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration." [...] In Re Harris Simons Construction Ltd Hoffmann J held that 'likely to achieve the purpose of administration' meant a test lower than balance of probabilities, and more like whether there was a 'real prospect' of success or a 'good arguable case' for it. So here the company was granted an administration order, which led to its major creditor granting funding to continue four <b>building</b> <b>contracts.</b>|$|E
