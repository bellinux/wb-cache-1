60|$|I {{remained}} thus in deep thought, sinking {{further and}} further into the tar-bucket. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{the bottom of it}} I realized that I was in love with Edith Croyden.|$|E
60|$|On the way I {{revolved}} in my {{mind all}} that had occurred within the past two hours, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Mr. Harrison's place I had the matter in such shape that I could tell a clear, straightforward story.|$|E
60|$|That very evening I {{went to see}} Irene. My {{brain was}} {{whirling}} even yet, and I hardly knew what I was doing; but the cool air revived me a little, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the Lathams' I almost felt myself again.|$|E

60|$|It was {{evening before}} I left Camberwell, and quite dark <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> home. My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, {{but he had}} disappeared. I looked about {{in the hope of}} seeing a note, but there was none.|$|E
60|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> home, it was sundown. Goton had kindly {{saved me}} {{a portion of}} dinner, which indeed I needed. She called me into the little cabinet to partake of it, and there Madame Beck soon made her appearance, {{bringing}} me a glass of wine.|$|E
6000|$|This {{feeling of}} bitterness, of rebellion, of dissatisfaction with myself, wore {{gradually}} away, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Chicago I had resolved to climb high. [...] "I will carry mother and Jessie to comfort {{and to some}} small share, at least, {{in the world of}} art," [...] was my resolve. In this way I sought to palliate my selfish plan.|$|E

6000|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{my house}} and had filled my pipe and sat myself down in the {{dilapidated}} cane chair on the veranda, that natural reaction set in which so often follows rejoicing at the escape from a great danger.

6000|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> {{the outer}} {{door of the}} cottage, he was a dark blur in the white blur of the fog which had {{swallowed}} up the cove, and was rising round the house-walls from the grass. I heard him shouting, [...] "Marion!" [...] and a faint mellow answer, far out in the cove, [...] "Hello!" [...] and then-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{walked back}} by my side, talking {{all the way}} of Daphne's many adorable qualities. He {{exhausted}} the dictionary for laudatory adjectives. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> his door it was not HIS fault if I had not learned that the angelic hierarchy {{were not in the}} running with my pretty cousin for graces and virtues. I felt that Faith, Hope, and Charity ought to resign at once in favour of Miss Daphne Tepping, promoted.|$|E

60|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the ridge, I had {{discovered}} that she had prophesied truly, for now an ominous change had come over nature. A dull grey vapour had overspread the entire western half of the heavens; down, beyond the forest, the sky looked black as ink, and behind this blackness the sun had vanished. It {{was too late to}} go back now; I had been too long absent from Rima, and could only hope to reach Nuflo's lodge, wet or dry, before night closed round me in the forest.|$|E
60|$|The more I {{thought about}} it the madder I got, so that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the valley I was furious, {{and the result of}} it was that I turned right around and went up that cliff again as fast as I had come down. I saw that Dian had left the ledge and gone within the cave, but I bolted right in after her. She was lying upon her face on the pile of grasses I had {{gathered}} for her bed. When she heard me enter she sprang to her feet like a tigress.|$|E
60|$|As soon as my duties at St. Nathaniel's {{permitted}} me, on {{the evening}} of the discovery, I rushed round to Mrs. Mallet's, Le Geyt's sister. I had been detained at the hospital for some hours, however, watching a critical case; and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Great Stanhope Street I found Hilda Wade, in her nurse's dress, there before me. Sebastian, it seemed, had given her leave out for the evening. She was a supernumerary nurse, attached to his own observation-cots as special attendant for scientific purposes, and she could generally get an hour or so whenever she required it.|$|E

[...] "I have heard tales of knights {{carrying}} damsels across their shoulder and outstripping the pursuit of caitiffs, from whom she had escaped. I indeed had believed them, but assuredly either those tales are false or I have but a small share {{of the strength of}} which I believed myself to be possessed; for, in truth, my arm and shoulder ached <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the hostelry more than it has ever done after an hour's practice with the mace." ...|$|E
60|$|I was choking and suffocating <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Wolf Larsen’s bunk. I {{reached my}} hand and felt for his. He was lying motionless, but moved {{slightly}} {{at the touch of}} my hand. I felt over and under his blankets. There was no warmth, no sign of fire. Yet that smoke which blinded me and made me cough and gasp must have a source. I lost my head temporarily and dashed frantically about the steerage. A collision with the table partially knocked the wind from my body and brought me to myself. I reasoned that a helpless man could start a fire only near to where he lay.|$|E

She had sold out two thousand pounds that morning and given them to Pump. Quarrelling was useless--Pump had the money; he was off to Dublin <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> his mother's, and Polly radiant still. He {{was going to make}} his fortune; he was going to embark the money in the Bog of Allen--I don't know what. The fact is, he was going to pay his losses upon the last Manchester steeple-chase, and I leave you to imagine how much principal or interest poor Polly ever saw back again.|$|E

60|$|I galloped {{away from}} Glenby in a rage. What a blessing Sara had not married {{me in my}} absurd youth! She would have driven me wild with her sighs and her obtuseness and her {{everlasting}} pink-and-whiteness. But there--there--there--gently! She was a sweet, good-hearted little woman; she had made Jack happy; and she had contrived, heaven only knew how, to bring a rare creature like Betty into the world. For that, much might be forgiven her. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> The Maples and had flung myself down in an old, kinky, comfortable chair in my library I had forgiven her and was even paying her the compliment of thinking seriously over what she had said.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have another}} boy, born the 10th of March. He {{is very much}} such a child as Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is [...] "short and low," [...] and I expect always will be. He talks very plainly--almost as plainly as anybody. He is quite smart enough. I {{sometimes}} fear that {{he is one of}} the little rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about five than ever after. He has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the offspring of such animal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger came to tell me Bob was lost; but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the house his mother had found him and had him whipped, and by now, very likely, he is run away again.|$|E
60|$|I {{will not}} {{describe}} my further adventures on the still steeper mountain road from Hornberg to Triberg and St. Georgen--how I got bites {{on the way}} from an English curate, an Austrian hussar, and two unprotected American ladies; nor how I angled for them all by riding my machine up impossible hills, and then reclining gracefully to eat my lunch (three times in one day) on mossy banks at the summit. I felt a perfect little hypocrite. But Mr. Hitchcock had remarked that business is business; and I will only add (in confirmation of his view) that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Lucerne, I had sown the good seed in fifteen separate human souls, no less than four of which brought forth fruit in orders for Manitous {{before the end of}} the season.|$|E
