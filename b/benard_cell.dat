50|$|By {{recognizing}} that asymmetry {{is a general}} property of work - that work is done as asymmetric systems spontaneously tend towards symmetry, Deacon abstracts the concept of work and applies it to systems whose symmetries are vastly more complex than those covered by classical thermodynamics. In a morphodynamic system, the tendency towards symmetry produces not global equilibrium, but a complex geometric form like a hexagonal <b>Benard</b> <b>cell</b> or the resonant frequency of a flute. This tendency towards convolutedly symmetric forms can be harnessed to do work on other morphodynamic systems, if the systems are properly coupled.|$|E
50|$|A {{convection}} cell, {{also known}} as a <b>Bénard</b> <b>cell</b> is a characteristic fluid flow pattern in many convection systems. A rising body of fluid typically loses heat because it encounters a cold surface. In liquid this occurs because it exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange. In the example of the Earth's atmosphere, this occurs because it radiates heat. Because of this heat loss the fluid becomes denser than the fluid underneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side. At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again and the cycle repeats itself.|$|E
50|$|Mesoscale {{cellular}} convection (MCC) {{is a form}} of buoyantly driven convection {{that can}} provide the planetary boundary layer with cumulus clouds {{at the top of the}} boundary layer. MCC generally occurs over ocean regions and is primarily found off the coasts of major continents particularly in North and South America.MCC {{is a form of}} the <b>Bénard</b> <b>cell</b> where the fluid will rise or fall in hexagonal cells creating hexagonal cloud structure. The capping inversion of the planetary boundary layer acts as a lid for the convection creating a horizontal plane for the hexagonal cloud structures. Satellite observations have been imperative for understanding the horizontal scale and the vertical scale of these cloud formations. MCC is generally too small for synoptic scale measurements, but too large for single point measurements. However, satellite observations are able to monitor the development of the cloud patterns because of their large field of view. Satellites images from TIROS helped to highlight one of the main differences between laboratory convection cells and those that occur in the atmosphere. The ratio of the diameter of the hexagon compared to the depth of the cloud was much larger in the atmosphere compared to the same ratio calculated in controlled experiments. This difference showed that viscosity and heat conduction were important for the laboratory measurements, but eddy diffusion of heat and momentum dominated the atmospheric cells. Wind shear must be low to form MCC cells otherwise cloud streaks will form in the direction of the wind shear. The cloud formations that occur as part of MCC can be placed into two categories: open cells and closed cells.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the application of exergy analysis for classifying the health and maturity of ecosystems {{as defined by the}} exergy destruction principle and to determine its suitability as a tool within the precision agriculture industry. In doing so, this thesis presents some initial background information of precision agriculture but then heavily focuses on the core principles of exergy theory, starting with a general thermodynamical background, followed by a review of solar exergy, and concluding with a thorough review of the exergy destruction principle. Finally, the experiments which were conducted as part of the field work for this thesis will be presented and discussed. Through the investigation of the interaction of exergy with living (and non-living) systems, a connection becomes clear between ecosystem development (complexity) and exergy destruction. As illustrated in principle with the <b>Bénard</b> <b>cell,</b> as systems become more complex they require increasing amounts of work potential in order to maintain structure. Conversely, as part of the redeveloped second law of thermodynamics, it is shown that any system which is imparted with a gradient will organize itself as to mitigate the effect. By identifying the importance of surface temperature to the exergy flows of an ecosystem via the exergy destruction principle, it allows for various characterizations of both health and maturity to be inferred through thermal remote sensing. With applications for precision agriculture in mind, the effectiveness of utilizing remotely sensed surface temperature in order to infer crop health (stress) and crop complexity (yield) is tested and discussed. Based on initial trials in both realistic field and controlled greenhouse conditions, {{there appears to be a}} statistically significant correlation between surface temperature and stress artificially induced in both the nitrogen and weed trials in corn and wheat.

Analysis of the cloud pattern on a monthly basis reveals that the cold front is more active during November-December and the main vortex activity starts in January, with the climax of the coastal front in December.
