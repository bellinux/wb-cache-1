5|$|You {{are serving}} many masters, and inevitably you are {{compromise}}d. The man speaks and you listen <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> take notes, the first compromise and perhaps betrayal. You may attempt through various stylistic conventions and devices to reconstitute {{for the reader}} your experience of hearing face to face the man's words. The sound of the man's narration may be represented by vocabulary, syntax, imagery, graphic devices of various sorts—quotation marks, punctuation, line breaks, visual patterning of white space and black space, markers that encode print analogs to speech—vernacular interjections, parentheses, ellipses, asterisks, footnotes, italics, dashes....|$|E
500|$|Forces {{act in a}} {{particular}} direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as [...] "vector quantities". This means that forces follow {{a different set of}} mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.|$|E
500|$|Following the battle, the {{commander}} of the Numidian cavalry, Maharbal, urged Hannibal to seize the opportunity and march immediately on Rome. It is told that the latter's refusal caused Maharbal's exclamation: [...] "Of a truth the gods have not bestowed all things upon the same person. You know how to conquer, Hannibal; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know how to make use of your victory." [...] Hannibal had good reasons to judge the strategic situation after the battle differently from Maharbal. As the historian Hans Delbrück pointed out, due to the high numbers of killed and wounded among its ranks, the Punic army was not in a condition to perform a direct assault on Rome. It would have been a fruitless demonstration that would have nullified the psychological effect of Cannae on the Roman allies. Even if his army was at full strength, a successful siege of Rome would have required Hannibal to subdue a considerable part of the hinterland to cut the enemy's supplies and secure his own. Even after the tremendous losses suffered at Cannae and the defection of a number of her allies, Rome still had abundant manpower to prevent this and maintain considerable forces in Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and elsewhere despite Hannibal's presence in Italy. Hannibal's conduct after the victories at Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae, {{and the fact that he}} first attacked Rome only five years later, in 211 BC, suggests that his strategic aim was not the destruction of his foe but to dishearten the Romans by carnage on the battlefield and to wear them down to a moderate peace agreement by stripping them of their allies.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theme of}} divine hiddenness, silence or {{darkness}} {{has a long}} history in Judeo-Christian theology. The roots of the Judeo-Christian description of God as hidden are in the Bible, for example in the Psalms, [...] "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?....I cry by day, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> answer....", and in Isaiah: [...] "Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Orthodox Christian is {{expected}} to uphold truth, at all times and in all places, without exception. Slander and gossip are equally evil, and the initial speaker is responsible for any further damage caused as the report is spread. Unless there is a compelling reason to speak ill of someone, {{as is the case}} of protect oneself or others against harm, it is not permissible even if the account be true. Saint Dorotheus of Gaza said, [...] "You may well know about the sin, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know about the repentance." ...|$|E

Therefore, according to the group, you are not that chatty, but you are either doing the proper performance. However the rater will only get the idea that your behavior is not as bad as other, thus, you will be rate higher.|$|E
2500|$|Konoe {{justified}} his demission to {{his secretary}} Kenji Tomita. [...] "Of course His Imperial Majesty is a pacifist and {{he wished to}} avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: 'You were worried about it yesterday <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have to worry so much.' Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.' In short, the Emperor had absorbed {{the view of the}} army and the navy high commands." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his speech}} to the House of Commons on the Inquiry, British Prime Minister David Cameron stated: [...] "These are {{shocking}} conclusions to read and shocking words to have to say. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> defend the British Army by defending the indefensible." [...] He acknowledged that all those who died were unarmed when they were killed by British soldiers, and that a British soldier had fired the first shot at civilians. He also {{said that this was}} not a premeditated action, though [...] "there was no point in trying to soften or equivocate" [...] as [...] "what happened should never, ever have happened". Cameron then apologised on behalf of the British Government by saying he was [...] "deeply sorry".|$|E
