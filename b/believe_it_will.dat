5|$|In August 2012, oxygen {{levels in}} the river {{were found to be}} low, {{following}} the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem. This was thought to result from naturally occurring algae, which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend, and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide, which is used to improve oxygen {{levels in the}} water, and traces of detergent. The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous. The Winsford and District Angling Association, who use the river for fishing, <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> take many years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident.|$|E

I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E

500|$|At the time, {{the use of}} such robust {{force against}} Katanga, {{including}} aircraft, artillery, and armoured vehicles, aroused much controversy. Though personally dismayed by the violence as a Bhuddist, Thant thought the operation was justified. His reasoning for such strong action fell in line with just war theory. Proponents of Katanga argued that the secessionist movement was a legitimate exercise of self-determination. Thant refuted the idea in his memoirs, listing three primary objections: first, the Congo had been admitted into the UN in 1960 as a [...] "unified state" [...] with the written agreement of Tshombe. Second, [...] "no sovereign state in the world ever recognized the independence of Katanga". Third, Tshombe's government was [...] "never able to exercise effective control" [...] over the entirety of the province. Military researcher Walter Dorn speculates that Thant may have been personally sensitive to the issue of secession, having suffered from the bloody Karen conflict in his native Burma and witnessed the consequences of the Partition of India. Holding office during a time of widespread decolonization in Africa and Asia, Thant was mindful of the precedent he was setting; recognizing or encouraging secession in one country could allow it to spread to others with fractious consequences. As late as February 1970, he denounced secession, declaring that the UN [...] "has never accepted and does not accept, and I do not <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> ever accept, the principle of secession of a part of its Member State." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Cycle Super Highways are {{a series}} of bike paths that connect Copenhagen to nearby suburbs.
