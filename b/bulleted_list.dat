25|$|Some wikis have an Edit button or link {{directly}} on the page being viewed, if the user has permission to edit the page. This {{can lead to a}} text-based editing page where participants can structure and format wiki pages with a simplified markup language, sometimes known as Wikitext or Wiki markup (it can also lead to a WYSIWYG editing page; see the paragraph after the table below). For example, starting lines of text with asterisks could create a <b>bulleted</b> <b>list.</b> The style and syntax of wikitexts can vary greatly among wiki implementations, some of which also allow HTML tags.|$|E

2500|$|My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness {{was written}} and drawn by Kabi Nagata, with art colored in a {{two-tone}} palette. According to Nagata, {{she does not}} hesitate to expose her private life {{for the sake of}} creating interesting content for a manga, despite being more introverted when speaking to people in person. She decided to do this {{because of a lack of}} work after she had become a manga artist, thinking that the only way for her to create something interesting that could earn her a living was to base her creation on her own experiences. The writing process involved her writing down things that have happened to her, and her feelings, in the form of a <b>bulleted</b> <b>list,</b> and rearranging the items to form a narrative. When writing, she strove towards neither lowering or glorifying herself, to avoid spreading too negative feelings and making readers unable to relate to the stories. She said that there were some things she [...] "couldn't touch on" [...] in the manga, that she would like to use in a future work.|$|E

5000|$|Some of this advice, such as {{the desire}} {{to tell a story}} about the writing center space, clashes {{directly}} with advice from administrators like Josephine Koster, who claims that [...] "administrators don't want to read essays.

These clashes appear to support the larger importance placed on local writing assessment practices [...] in determining what local administrators may expect.|$|R

5000|$|When {{considering}} abstract {{structure in}} planning a form or document, a technical communicator must {{also look at}} what Richard Power, Nadjet Bouayad-Agha, and Donia Scott call document structure: [...] "the organization of a document into graphical constituents like sections, paragraphs, sentences, <b>bulleted</b> <b>lists,</b> and figures". This document structure also goes hand-in-hand with the human-centered design aspect of visualization as pertaining to form and document creation. Technical communicators should look at their form or document {{to make sure that}} the abstract structure of the form or document is helping achieve the overall goal with the reader.|$|R

This is {{a highly}} {{condensed}} version of a paper [1] that presents automated methods to accurately transform regulations with <b>bulleted</b> <b>lists</b> into sets of complete sentences that include their proper context. We discuss the technical challenges addressed, including extracting intended structure from HTML documents, and correctly distributing preambles over nested text. Our work {{has been used to}} preprocess the corpus used for our experiments in classifying paragraphs in regulatory documents by several categories, including illocutionary point, regulation type, and reference structure.

40|$|Handwritten {{notes are}} complex {{structures}} which include blocks of text, drawings, and annotations. The main {{challenge for the}} newly emerging tablet computer is to provide high-level tools for editing and authoring handwritten documents using a natural interface. One frequent component of natural notes are lists and hierarchical outlines which correspond directly to the <b>bulleted</b> <b>lists</b> and itemized structures in conventional text editing tools. We present a system which automatically recognizes lists and hierarchical outlines in handwritten notes, and then computes the correct structure. This inferred structure provides the foundation for new user interfaces and facilitates the importation of handwritten notes into conventional editing tools. 1...|$|R

It was the final elimination competition for the K-1 World Grand Prix 2003, involving fourteen fighters from across the world, with all bouts being fought under K-1 Rules (100 kg/156-220 lbs). The fourteen fighters were a mixture of invitees or had qualified via previous events (for more information on this see the <b>bulleted</b> <b>list</b> below).|$|E
50|$|The {{specifics}} of a load test plan or script will generally vary across organizations. For example, in the <b>bulleted</b> <b>list</b> above, {{the first item}} could represent 25 VUsers browsing unique items, random items, or a selected set of items depending upon the test plan or script developed. However, all load test plans attempt to simulate system performance {{across a range of}} anticipated peak workflows and volumes. The criteria for passing or failing a load test (pass/fail criteria) are generally different across organizations as well. There are no standards specifying acceptable load testing performance metrics.|$|E

The earliest important match that is designated inter-county was in 1709 {{and the traditional}} county soon became the key unit of organisation. Until 1725, only nine counties (plus London which has on occasion been equated in status with the counties of Middlesex and Surrey for cricketing purposes) had been mentioned in surviving records in connection with cricket and the earliest mention of each is summarised below. Note that all are in the south-eastern quarter of the country. In a similar vein, although not always in association {{with one of the}} above matches, those players, venues, clubs and teams known to have been active or in use by 1725 are also listed.|$|R
