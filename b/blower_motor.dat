25|$|The Second Generation Prius {{contains}} a 1.310kWh battery, composed of 28 modules. Each battery module {{is made of}} 6 individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density. Each module {{contains a}}n integrated charge controller and relay. These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (traction battery), {{also known as the}} energy storage system. The computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery {{only a small portion of}} its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.|$|E
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the <b>blower</b> <b>motor,</b> but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E

50|$|On 7 June, {{responding}} to a radar contact, Tambor dived. An exploding bomb damaged both her periscopes and cracked all four battery <b>blower</b> <b>motors.</b> The bomb probably came from an American B-17; a similar incident had happened the day before, when another B-17 had bombed the submarine USS Grayling, mistaking it for a Japanese cruiser.

40|$|Residential gas {{furnaces}} contain blowers {{to distribute}} warm air. Currently, furnace blowers use either a Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) or a Brushless Permanent Magnet (BPM) <b>motor.</b> <b>Blowers</b> {{account for the}} majority of furnace electricity consumption. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important for understanding electricity consumption of furnaces. The electricity consumption of <b>blower</b> <b>motors</b> depends on the static pressure across the blower. This paper examines both types of <b>blower</b> <b>motors</b> in non-condensing non-weatherized gas furnaces at a range of static pressures. Fan performance data is based on manufacturer product literature and laboratory tests. We use field-measured static pressure in ducts to get typical system curves to calculate how furnaces would operate in the field. We contrast this with the electricity consumption of a furnace blower operating under the DOE test procedure and manufacturer rated conditions. Furnace electricity use is also affected by operating modes that happen {{at the beginning and end}} of each furnace firing cycle. These operating modes are the pre-purge and post-purge by the draft inducer, the on-delay and off-delay of the blower, and the hot surface ignitor operation. To accurately calculate this effect, we use the number of firing cycles in a typical California house in the Central Valley of California. Cooling hours are not considered in the DOE test procedure. We also account for furnace blower use by the air conditioner and stand-by power. Overall BPM motors outperform PSC motors, but the total electricity savings are significantly less than projected using the DOE test procedure conditions. The performance gains depend on the static pressure of the household ducts, which are typically much higher than in the test procedures...|$|R
50|$|Blowers provide {{clean air}} to prevent {{contamination}} of electrical and optical surfaces from dirt, corrosive gases and overheating. Mains electricity {{is responsible for}} powering the <b>blower’s</b> <b>motor.</b> Different power ratings ensure that the required air flow is provided under different application conditions, duct pressures and hose lengths. Air flow from the blower depends {{on the type of}} fan and the mains supply voltage and frequency.Most air purge systems consist of a fan with a motor, some type of filter housing, and a filter cartridge, all stored in a weatherproof environment. Sometimes, pressure switches are employed to designate deficient pressure to ensure that the required flow is maintained.|$|R
2500|$|A {{thermal fuse}} is {{often found in}} {{consumer}} equipment such as coffee makers, hair dryers or transformers powering small consumer electronics devices. [...] They contain a fusible, temperature-sensitive composition which holds a spring contact mechanism normally closed. When the surrounding temperature gets too high, the composition melts and allows the spring contact mechanism to break the circuit. The device {{can be used to}} prevent a fire in a hair dryer for example, by cutting off the power supply to the heater elements when the air flow is interrupted (e.g., the <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> stops or the air intake becomes accidentally blocked). Thermal fuses are a 'one shot', non-resettable device which must be replaced once they have been activated (blown).|$|E

2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells. The 7.2-volt modules each contain a charge controller and a relay. The 28 modules are connected in series to produce a total energy storage capacity of 1.310kWh (via 201.6-volts × 6.5Ah). The battery control computers keep the state of charge (SOC) between approximately 40 and 80percent (shallow cycling), where the average SOC hovers around 60percent, allowing about 400Wh of useful energy storage to capture energy from regenerative braking and to release {{it back into the}} hybrid drive-train through Motor-generator 1 and Motor-generator 2 in the power split device. [...] The shallow cycling enables the hybrid battery to last tens of thousands of cycles, which translates into decades of use and in many case more than [...] of operation. The computer controlled charging and discharging of the battery enhances its cycle life, calendar life, and thermal control performance. Passive battery cooling and heating is accomplished through the metal case of the battery assembly pack, while a forced air cooling system with a <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> and ducting system enables active cooling of the HV battery.|$|E

2500|$|The {{trial was}} {{successful}} with the locomotive {{noted for its}} clean running {{and the elimination of}} smoke, spark hazard and spark arrestor cleaning. With the grate automatically stoked via a tender-mounted conveyor screw and <b>blower</b> <b>motor,</b> it was now possible to harness the full steam-raising potential of the locomotive's boiler without the stamina of the fireman being a limiting factor. The steam requirements for both engine and booster were able to be met for unlimited periods at maximum steam pressure even against the action of both injectors. Comparative performance tests with black coal-fired X30 revealed that X32 was able to generate a drawbar horsepower output of [...] at , exceeding by 5 to 10% that which could be produced by X30 with good quality Maitland or Lithgow coals. The locomotive gained a reputation for both speed and dependability. On one occasion, X32 hauled a [...] load between Seymour and Melbourne in 105 minutes, where the working timetable for a full [...] load allowed 147 minutes. On 4 April 1951 it replaced a defective S class locomotive in hauling the Spirit of Progress from Wallan to Melbourne, taking 43 minutes to cover the same distance the S class-hauled train would normally cover in 40 minutes, despite having to start the train from standstill and running with a lower permissible maximum speed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blower</b> <b>Motor</b> Regulator - If {{this part}} fails, the climate control fan will not operate faster than {{approximately}} 50% power. Mercedes updated the regulator {{to improve its}} reliability, but the redesigned regulator requires the installation of a new blower motor—about $1,000 in parts. The old-style regulator, which {{is compatible with the}} existing <b>blower</b> <b>motor,</b> is no longer manufactured. The <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> regulator may be replaced with the much less expensive W140 S-class blower regulator, provided that the E-class wiring harness is re-attached to the S-class regulator.|$|E
50|$|Air-conditioning {{was never}} an option on right-hand-drive Saxos because the <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> was mounted in the bulk-head on the driver's side. As a result, there was {{insufficient}} space available to accommodate the evaporator, except by first ducting the air flow to the passenger's side {{and then at the}} expense of the glove-box. Although an after-market kit was available that did exactly this, the resultant pressure loss made the system noisy and ineffective. The <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> could also not be easily relocated, since the windscreen wiper motor was mounted in the passenger's side space.|$|E
40|$|Currently, total {{electricity}} consumption of furnaces is unregulated, tested at laboratory conditions using the DOE test procedure, and is {{reported in the}} GAMA directory as varying from 76 kWh/year to 1, 953 kWh/year. Furnace blowers account for about 80 {{percent of the total}} furnace {{electricity consumption}} and are primarily used to distribute warm air throughout the home during furnace operation as well as distribute cold air during air conditioning operation. Yet the furnace test procedure does not provide a means to calculate the electricity consumption during cooling operation or standby, which account for a large fraction of the total electricity consumption. Furthermore, blower electricity consumption is strongly affected by static pressure. Field data shows that static pressure in the house distribution ducts varies widely and that the static pressure used in the test procedure as well as the calculated fan power is not representative of actual field installations. Therefore, accurate determination of the blower electricity consumption is important to address electricity consumption of furnaces and air conditioners. This paper compares the potential regional and national energy savings of two-stage brushless permanent magnet (BPM) <b>blower</b> <b>motors</b> (the <b>blower</b> design option with the most potential savings that is currently available in the market) to single-stage permanent split capacitor (PSC) <b>blower</b> <b>motors</b> (the most common blower design option). Computer models were used to generate the heating and cooling loads for typical homes in 16 different climates which represent houses throughout the United States. The results show that the potential savings of using BPM motors vary by region and house characteristics, and are very strongly tied to improving house distribution ducts. Savings decrease dramatically with increased duct pressure. Cold climate locations will see savings even in the high static pressure duct situations, while warm climate locations will see less savings overall and negative savings in the high static pressure duct situations. Moderate climate locations will see little or no savings...|$|R
50|$|They {{also had}} four {{radiator}} fans {{at the center}} of the unit next to each other in line on the roof instead of two at each end. This external feature was the result of a major change in internal arrangement, the replacement of all mechanical and belt-drives for radiator fans and traction <b>motor</b> <b>blowers</b> with electric <b>motors.</b> Power for these accessories was produced by a new D14 three phase alternator built into the main DC generator, called a “companion alternator”.

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{configurations}} of extractor hoods: ducted (or vented) application, and ductless (or recirculating) application. In a ducted application, the output collar of the extractor hood's <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> {{is attached to a}} duct system, which terminates outside the building. In a ductless application, a filter, often containing activated charcoal, removes odor and smoke particles from the air before releasing the cleaned air back into the kitchen.|$|E
50|$|This {{is why a}} {{squirrel-cage}} <b>blower</b> <b>motor</b> {{may cause}} household lights to dim upon starting, but does not dim the lights on startup when its fan belt (and therefore mechanical load) is removed. Furthermore, a stalled squirrel-cage motor (overloaded or with a jammed shaft) will consume current limited only by circuit resistance as it attempts to start. Unless something else limits the current (or cuts it off completely) overheating and destruction of the winding insulation is the likely outcome.|$|E

5000|$|In 1973 (per {{the table}} below), DC {{traction}} at 3,000 volts, lost about 3 {{times as much}} energy (percentage-wise) in the catenary as AC at 25,000 volts. Paradoxically, {{it turned out that}} DC locomotives were somewhat more efficient overall than AC locomotives. [...] "Auxiliary Electric Motors" [...] are mainly used for air cooling electric machinery such as traction motors. Electric locomotives concentrate high power electric machinery in a relatively small space and thus require a lot of cooling. [...] Per the table below, a sizeable amount of energy (11-17%) is used for this, but when operating at nominal power only 2-4% is used. [...] The fact that the cooling motors run at full speed (and power) all the time makes their power consumption constant, so when the locomotive motors are operating at low power (far below the nominal regime) the percent of this power used for cooling blowers becomes much higher. The result is that under actual operating conditions, the percent energy used for cooling is a few times higher than [...] "nominal". Per the table below, AC locomotives used about 50% more energy for this purpose since in addition to cooling the <b>motors,</b> the <b>blowers</b> must cool the transformer, rectifiers and the smoothing reactor (inductors), which are mostly absent on DC locomotives. [...] The 3-phase AC power for these <b>blower</b> <b>motors</b> is supplied from a rotary phase converter which converts single phase (from the catenary via the main transformer) to 3-phase (and this also takes energy). It's proposed to reduce blower speeds when less cooling is needed.|$|R
