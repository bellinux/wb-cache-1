Therefore, the signal received at the receiver are totally not originally from the transmitter. In {{some cases the}} signal must be amplified. This project will focuses. {{on the concept of}} wireless optical in receiver communication system. The objectives of this project is to design a receiver amplifier using hybrid bandwidth enhancement in the approximately of Giga hertz range. The project involve developing a prototype of the designed receiver amplifier in PCB and to simulate the receiver amplifier using any existing electronic Software such as Micro-Cap, P-Spice and etc. The configuration of this design receiver is by using combination of bootstrapping and cascode technique. Bootstrapping technique offers the reduction on the photodetector capacitances which is the main limiting factor for the bandwidth of optical wireless front-end receiver. While, the cascode technique is used to arrange the electrical components such as transistor. The cascode is a two-stage amplifier composed of a transconductance amplifier followed by a current buffer. Compared to a single amplifier stage, this combination may have {{one or more of the}} following advantages: higher input-output isolation, higher input impedance, higher output impedance, higher gain or higher bandwidth.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic {{approach to the}} design of receiver for indoor optical wireless communication. In particular, it is concerned with how one can properly chooses the front-end preamplifier and biasing circuitry for the photodetector. A comparison between differences types of amplifier, and bandwidth enhancement technique is also discussed. For most photodetector applications, large values of RL and CD would severely restrict bandwidth. It is shown that a proper front-end design incorporates a transimpedance preamplifier which tends to integrate the detector output. Such a design provides significant reduction in photodiode capacitance and increase bandwidth when compared to a design which does not integrate initially. Two novel techniques, using bandwidth adjustment for better service quality with a <b>bootstrapped</b> transimpedance <b>amplifier</b> and <b>bootstrapped</b> composite transimpedance <b>amplifier</b> is presented. A controllable capacitance is introduced at the output of the second stage of the amplifier. These technique permits a bandwidth adjustment from 52 Hz to 233 MHz for a capacitance range of 10 uF to 1 pF, while the composite amplifier bandwidth adjustment of the circuit can be controlled in the frequency range of 6 MHz to 60 MHz for a capacitance range of 50 pF to 1 nF. </p...|$|R

40|$|Due to optical {{wireless}} link {{power budget}} considerations, the receiver {{is required to}} have a large collection area.

40|$|Abstract: Free Space Optic (FSO) or optical {{wireless}} link {{operates in}} high noise environments. On the other hand, the performance {{is subjected to}} several atmospheric factors like environmental temperature, fog, smoke, haze and rain. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can vary radically with the distance and ambient noise. A good sensitivity and a broad bandwidth will habitually use a small photodetection area where the aperture is small. However, FSO optical receiver requires a large aperture and accordingly, to have a large collection area, which possibly will be achieved by using a large area photodetector and large filter. Consequently, large area photodetector produces a high input capacitance that will be reduced the bandwidth.

40|$|Free space optical {{front-end}} receiver usually suffers high photodetector {{input capacitance}} which limits the bandwidth of the system. This {{is due to}} the large detection area required to collect as much optical radiant power as possible to increase the systemâ€™s sensitivity. In this work, the <b>bootstrap</b> transimpedance <b>amplifier</b> (BTA) is adopted as an alternative approach for free space optical front-end receiver design. This technique offers the usual advantages of the transimpedance amplifier (TIA) together with the effective capacitance reduction technique. An improved photodetector model and the both front-end structures; TIA and BTA have been simulated using harmonic balance technique offers by Microwave Office, and the results show that the design improves the system bandwidth by 6. 7 times in average. However, the performance of the BTA was found limited to a certain photodetector input capacitance.

The linear PC mode preamplifier does not need any compensating source to zero the effect of the detector bias current for the preamplifier output. The impedance multiplication concept with a positive feedback buffer amplifier was analyzed and utilized in a <b>bootstrap</b> PV transimpedance <b>amplifier</b> to measure photocurrent of a 200 ï¿½ shunt resistance photodiode with a maximum signal gain of 10 8 V/A. In spite of the high performance lock-in used as a second-stage signal-amplifier, the signalto-noise ratio had to be optimized for the output of the photocurrent preamplifiers. Noise and drift were equalized for the output of the PV mode preamplifier. The signal gain errors were calculated to determine the signal frequency range where photocurrent-to-voltage conversion can be performed with very low uncertainties.

40|$|Today's {{trend in}} mobile {{electronics}} towards smaller and lighter devices {{conflicts with the}} other market-driven interest for larger displays. Large displays can improve the user-friendliness of the devices. By using flexible and rollable displays made in organic electronics technology, small devices with large displays are enabled. In this technology a flexible plastic foil is used as the substrate for the electronic circuits. Asa result, the production of devices with flexible or even rollable displays is enabled. Besides the opportunities for flexible displays, {{there is also an}} interest for other appli-cations, such as RFID, printed solar cells, flexible lighting and organic smart sensor systems. For the realisation of these applications mostly digital building blocks are required. However, most of them also need analog building blocks for sensors, sensor read-out and analog-to-digital conversion. The design of analog organic circuits {{is the subject of this}} thesis. The main advantages of organic electronics technology are the low production temperatures, the low-cost and flexible plastic substrate and the printability. The production temperature for organic transistors stays below 150 degrees C during the process. This is very low compared to temperatures up to 1000 degrees C in standard Si CMOS technology. The low temperatures enable the use of low-cost flexible materials, such as a plastic foil, for substrates in the technology. Those materials would melt or burn at 1000 degrees C. Furthermore in recent years the solution-based deposition and the printing of organic electronics circuits have been reported. The combination of all these advantages creates a niche domain of large-area large-scale flexible applications. Despite all the advantageous properties, at the moment organic electronics technology suffers from some adverse properties that hamper the design of both digital andanalog organic circuits. The intrinsic gain of organic transistors is very low (typically 5). Only a limited component library is available at present. As active elements, onlyp-type transistors and, as passive elements, only capacitors are available. Resistive behavior is found through transistors biased in the linear regime. Furthermore, organic technology suffers from the variation of behavioral transistor parameters which result in mismatch and reliability issues for analog circuits. In this thesis the properties of organic electronics technology have been observed first. Then the design strategy for analog circuits has been adapted in such a way that adverse properties become harmless and that advantageous properties are fully exploited. One property of the organic transistors is the availability of a backgate pin. The use of this backgate pin is investigated and multiple techniques have been proposed to fully exploit this pin, e. g. for tuning the threshold voltage of the transistor. In this dissertation the design of several analog building blocks for organic smart sensor systems are presented. The presented building blocks are amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters, sensors and DC-DC converters. A single-stage differential amplifier is presented. Several analog techniques are applied to optimize the reliability and the gain of the single-stage <b>amplifier.</b> <b>Bootstrapped</b> gain enhancement is applied to the p-type load transistor. It combines both a low mismatch senstivity in DC and a high gain in AC for the load. Common-mode feedback is applied to reduce the mismatch sensitivity of the input transistors. Furthermore gate-backgate steering is used to increase the performance of all transistors. The amplifier has a gain of 15 dB. It is used in an AC-coupled 3 -stage opamp. Subsequently, the design of a DC-connected 2 -stage opamp is presented that applies the threshold voltage tuning technique to the input transistors in order to enable the DC connection of the stages. This 2 -stage opamp has a gain of 20 dB. The design of a 1 st -order DeltaSigma ADC is presented. It is built with an analog integrator, based on a 3 -stage opamp. Furthermore, a high-gain comparator and a level shifter are used in the ADCs. The measured accuracy of the converter amounts to 26. 5 dB in a 15. 6 Hz signal bandwidth and at a clock speed of 500 Hz. The implementation of a 1 D and a 2 D flexible capacitive touch sensor is discussed in this work. The 1 D sensor has a triangular capacitive touch pad with a position-dependent capacitance. In the sensor read-out, the charging current is copied and integrated on a fixed output capacitor. The sensor read-out has a sample rate of 1. 5 k S / s. The simulated accuracy of the 1 D sensor comes to 2 m m. The 2 D flexible touch pad is based on the same working principle. An array of 4 by 4 pixels is measured in turns and the output signal shows the measured capacitance of the 16 pixels in a serial way. This output signal contains all the information about the position of the finger. According to simulations, the accuracy of the 2 D sensor after interpolation is 0. 3 m m. The design of an organic Dickson DC-DC converter is presented. It is built with a ring oscillator, with buffer stages and with a Dickson converter core. The switches in the forward path have been implemented with diode-connected transistors. The presented converter reaches high and low output voltages of 48 V and - 33 V respectively at a power supply of 20 V. DC-DC converters are useful for biasing gates and back-gates with high or low voltages using the threshold voltage tuning technique. The proof of concept of this technique is given by the DC-connected 2 -stage opamp which is biased with the high bias voltage provided by the Dickson DC-DC converter. The power consumption of the converter is negligible compared to the power consumption of the building blocks which are or can be biased by this converter. As a result, the contribution of this building block is validated. status: publishe...|$|R
