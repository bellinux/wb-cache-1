5|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> {{head coach}} (1993–1996), elected in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Belichick {{served as}} head coach for a single day {{following}} the retirement of <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{making the}} playoffs in 1984 and 1985, the Giants entered the 1986 season {{as one of the}} {{favorites}} to win the Super Bowl. They began the season with 31–28 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, before winning five consecutive games. After losing 17–12 to the Seattle Seahawks in week seven, the Giants won their final nine regular season games. Following the regular season, coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> won the NFL Coach of the Year Award, and eight Giants were named to the Pro Bowl. The Giants' defense, nicknamed the Big Blue Wrecking Crew, finished second in the league in points and yards allowed.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Sanchez {{was praised}} {{for his ability}} to {{maintain}} composure in the pocket amidst defensive pressure and focus on finding an open receiver to extend the team's offensive series. In his four-year career, Sanchez has had ten fourth quarter comebacks and twelve game winning drives. These characteristics were highlighted by <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> and Sam Wyche and garnered comparisons to Ben Roethlisberger. Sanchez was also noted for his proficiency in short passing situations and competitive nature; in December 2010, following dismal performances, Rex Ryan threatened to reduce Sanchez's repetitions with the first team offense during practice which infuriated Sanchez.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the season}} eight Giants—tight end Mark Bavaro, {{offensive}} lineman Brad Benson, nose tackle Jim Burt, linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson, punter Sean Landeta, running back Morris, and defensive end Leonard Marshall—were selected to the Pro Bowl. Taylor, who recorded a league-leading 20.5 sacks, {{became one of}} just three defensive players to win the NFL Most Valuable Player award and the only defensive player to ever win the award unanimously.* Sprechman and Shannon. pg. 13 Taylor also won his record third Defensive Player of the Year Award and coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> won his first NFL Coach of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} in 1984 when <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> {{restored}} him to the starting quarterback's job, Phil Simms responded with a solid season in 1993. Playing in all 16 games, he completed almost 62% of his passes, threw for over 3,000yards, 15 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. The season {{marked the first time}} in seven years that Simms started every game for the Giants. Simms, Hampton, offensive linemen Jumbo Elliot and center Bart Oates all made the Pro Bowl. In addition, Reeves was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. Following the season Lawrence Taylor retired and Phil Simms was released by the team, leading to his eventual retirement. Simms and Taylor had been the faces of the franchise since 1979 and 1981 respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the Giants {{lost their}} first two games before the strike, and their first game upon returning. They won their next three games to even their record at 3–3. Perkins then {{announced}} that he was leaving to take the head coaching job at Alabama after the season, and the team lost the next two games, effectively eliminating them from the playoffs (despite defeating the Eagles in the season finale to go 4–5). Taylor remained a bright spot, repeating as the league's Defensive Player of the Year. Young chose <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> the Giants' defensive coordinator, as the team's new head coach.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{played the}} Cowboys at Giants Stadium in week nine. Defensive end George Martin {{recorded}} a late sack, termed by head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> {{as the biggest}} play of the game, to help the Giants to a 17–14 victory. The Giants held running backs Tony Dorsett to 45yards in 10 carries and Herschel Walker to 34yards in 10 carries. The Cowboys outgained the Giants 408 to 245 in total yardage, and had 25 first downs compared with the Giants' 14. Phil Simms struggled and completed only 6 of 18 passes for 67yards, but Joe Morris rushed 29 times for 181yards and two touchdowns as the Giants improved to 7–2.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{registered}} {{just two}} winning seasons from 1964 to 1980 and {{were unable to}} advance to the playoffs. From 1981 to 1990, the team qualified for the postseason seven times and won Super Bowls XXI and XXV. The team's success during the 1980s was aided by head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> quarterback Phil Simms and Hall of Fame linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson. New York struggled throughout much of the 1990s as Parcells left the team, and players such as Simms and Taylor declined and eventually retired. They returned to the Super Bowl in 2000, but lost to the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. The Giants upset the heavily favored New England Patriots in Super Bowls XLII and XLVI.|$|E
5|$|The period {{encompasses}} {{the careers of}} quarterback Phil Simms and linebacker Lawrence Taylor, {{two of the most}} accomplished players in team history. Simms was drafted to little fanfare from tiny Morehead State University in 1979, and struggled in his initial seasons before becoming a Pro Bowl quarterback. Taylor was the second selection in the 1981 NFL Draft and, in contrast to Simms, was an immediate success, winning the league's Defensive Player of the Year Award as a rookie. The team's success in this period was aided by head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> running back Joe Morris, and Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson. Following the 1990 season and a victory in Super Bowl XXV, Parcells resigned as coach and was replaced by the team's offensive coordinator, Ray Handley.|$|E
5|$|Though Orthwein's {{period as}} owner {{was short and}} controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former New York Giants coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> in 1993. Orthwein and his {{marketing}} team also commissioned the NFL {{to develop a new}} visual identity and logo, and changed their primary colors from the traditional red, white and blue to blue and silver for the team uniforms. Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including Super Bowl XXXI, which they lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35–21. Pete Carroll, Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 & 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season.|$|E
5|$|Simms' {{next four}} years were marred by {{injuries}} and inconsistent play. He finished the 1980 season with 15 touchdowns and 19 interceptions, while completing a subpar 48.0% of his passes for 2,321yards. In 1981, Simms threw for 2,031yards, 11 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions on 54.4% completion percentage before suffering a separated shoulder in a November 15 loss to the Washington Redskins. With Simms out, the Giants went on a run led by Scott Brunner and advanced to {{the second round of}} the playoffs. Simms suffered a torn knee ligament in a preseason game against the New York Jets, preventing him from playing the entire 1982 season. Following the season, Ray Perkins resigned as head coach to take over the same position at the University of Alabama, and was replaced by the team's defensive coordinator <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells.</b> In the coming years this change would prove crucial to the Giants and Simms.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{geographically}} {{has been}} the rivalry with the New York Jets. The Patriots and Jets {{have been in the}} same division (what is now the AFC East) since both teams' foundings in 1960, and have played each other at least twice a year since then. The rivalry between the Jets and Patriots has escalated since 1996, when Patriots head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> left the Patriots under controversy to become the head coach of the Jets; he was replaced by former Jets coach Pete Carroll. Four years later Carroll was fired, and Parcells's assistant, Bill Belichick, resigned the day he was named the Jets' head coach to become the head coach of the Patriots. Six years after that, Eric Mangini, an assistant under Belichick, became the head coach of the Jets.|$|E
5|$|After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired Tom Coughlin, a {{one-time}} assistant of former Giants' coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> {{to be the}} Giants new head coach. Coughlin had been the inaugural {{head coach of the}} Jacksonville Jaguars, and led them to the AFC championship game twice. He became the 16th head coach in franchise history. His stark, disciplinarian methods contrasted with the lax style employed by the departed Fassel. The Giants decided that their primary need was a franchise quarterback. Accorsi—who had coveted John Elway when he was Colts general manager in 1983—saw University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning as a similar talent. Manning's brother Peyton, and his father Archie, had already established successful careers as NFL quarterbacks. Though Accorsi wanted Manning, and Manning wanted to play in New York, Accorsi was unable to reach a deal to trade up to acquire him with the San Diego Chargers, who then used the first pick on Manning.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5–11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league's second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 million signing bonus, and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.|$|E
5|$|It {{was these}} 1986 Giants that popularized the {{football}} tradition of dousing {{the head coach}} with a cooler of Gatorade {{near the end of}} a victorious game. This originally started in 1985 when Jim Burt, incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received in practice the week leading up to a game, exacted revenge on <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him after the Giants won that week's game. Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often sneak up on Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head. The dousing was a big hit with fans, and the Gatorade dumping would continue on throughout the season after each win, with Taylor, Carson, and several other players (Burt had since ceased doing it) concocting increasingly elaborate, sneaky and playful ruses, so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise.|$|E
5|$|The impact Reeves had was immediate. As <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> {{had done}} before in 1984, Reeves named Phil Simms the {{starting}} quarterback and released Hostetler. They won their first three games, and five of their first six. The defense was back to its Parcells-era levels and allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two games to go, the Giants were 11–3 and battling for an Eastern Division crown and a first round bye. However, they were upset by Phoenix, 17–6, in the next to {{last week of the}} season, setting up a winner–take–all game against the Dallas Cowboys in the season finale. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder that led the Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first round game 17–10 over the Minnesota Vikings. However, they were then defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3, in their worst performance of the season in the second round.|$|E
5|$|Belichick, {{who came}} to the Browns after 12 years mostly with the Giants under <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> quickly made his mark by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, rolling his eyes and often giving short answers to long questions. This bred the {{perception}} that the new coach was not a good communicator and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying to remake the Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director Mike Lombardi, tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team. Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6–10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries. Kosar was a rare bright spot, passing for almost 3,500yards and 18 touchdowns. Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception. Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback Mike Tomczak under center. The team finished with a 7–9 record and did not make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Army {{football}} {{began in}} 1890, when Navy challenged the cadets {{to a game}} of the relatively new sport. Navy defeated Army at West Point that year, but Army avenged the loss in Annapolis the following year. The rival academies still clash every December in what is traditionally the last regular-season Division I college-football game. The 2015 football season marked Navy's fourteenth consecutive victory over Army, the longest streak in the series since inception. On December 10, 2016 Army won {{for the first time}} in 14 years, beating Navy, 21–17. Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds became the first Navy QB to beat Army in four consecutive seasons, and set the NCAA rushing touchdown record in the 2015 rivalry game. Army's football team reached its pinnacle of success under coach Earl Blaik when Army won consecutive national championships in 1944, 1945 and 1946, and produced three Heisman trophy winners: Doc Blanchard (1945), Glenn Davis (1946) and Pete Dawkins (1958). Past NFL coaches Vince Lombardi and <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> were Army assistant coaches early in their careers. The football team plays its home games at Michie Stadium, where the playing field is named after Earl Blaik. Cadets' attendance is mandatory at football games and the Corps stands for the duration of the game. At all home games, one of the four regiments marches onto the field in formation before the team takes the field and leads the crowd in traditional Army cheers. From 1992 through 1996, Army won all of the games against Navy for the first time since the legendary days of Blanchard and Davis, and it introduced the fraternal group of players identifying themselves as the Fat Man Club, initiated by the offensive linemen of the Class of 1996. Between the 1998 and 2004 seasons, Army's football program was a member of Conference USA, but has since reverted to its former independent status.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Patriots and {{new head}} coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> {{were looking to}} improve the quarterback spot on their roster. They signed Scott Secules, and {{attempted}} to sign Steve Beuerlein, but the latter deal did not happen. They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade. In April, Millen {{was traded to the}} Dallas Cowboys, and the Patriots chose Drew Bledsoe with the first pick in the 1993 NFL Draft. During the offseason, Carlson was released, leaving Secules, Zolak, Bledsoe, and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster. By the end of the preseason, Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut, with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third-string quarterback. Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993, and threw two incomplete passes. He became a restricted free agent in the offseason, but re-signed with the Patriots for three years. As Secules was released during preseason, Zolak was set as Bledsoe's backup as the 1994 season began. As {{was the case in the}} 1993 season, he did not make a starting appearance, as Bledsoe played the full 16 games, however Zolak did see action in every game, primarily as the holder for extra point and field goal attempts. Over the course of the season, he completed five of eight passes for 28yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback. The 1995 season was similar, with Bledsoe starting and Zolak backing him up. In September, Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal, allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992. On October 1, 1995, Zolak took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252yards and a touchdown, though the Patriots lost the game, 3017. Although Bledsoe's doctors wanted him to sit out another week, he refused and played the next week's game against the Denver Broncos. This again relegated Zolak to the backup position, where he remained for the rest of the season. He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282yards, a touchdown, and a quarterback rating of 80.5.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> (born 1941), former NFL {{coach of}} the New York Giants, New England Patriots, New York Jets, and Dallas Cowboys.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 {{season was}} the first with <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> as Executive Vice President of Football Operations, Jeff Ireland as General Manager, and Tony Sparano as head coach.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> (born 1941), former NFL Head Coach of the New York Giants, New England Patriots, New York Jets, and Dallas Cowboys and Executive Vice President of Football Operations for the Miami Dolphins.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the final}} game in the Hall of Fame {{coaching}} career of <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> who resigned his position with the Cowboys two weeks later. Parcells would later take a front office position with the Miami Dolphins but never returned to the sidelines.|$|E
25|$|Despite his injuries, Testaverde's {{performance}} with the Jets endeared him to head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> who retired from coaching in 1999. One year after Parcells was lured {{out of retirement}} by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, he brought Testaverde to the Cowboys in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Le Batard and {{his staff}} defended the {{original}} comments {{by pointing out that}} Le Batard had brought similar criticism to John Lynch, <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> and Phil Jackson, all of whom are white and who were given their executive roles in sports without previous executive qualification.|$|E
25|$|On December 27, 2007, Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga hired former NFL {{head coach}} and ESPN analyst <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> as Executive Vice President of Football Operations. Parcells signed a {{four-year}} deal with the Dolphins {{less than a day}} after turning down a similar offer from the Atlanta Falcons.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots {{were also}} {{considered}} a losing team {{for much of}} the late 1980s and early 1990s, including a dismal 1–15 regular season record in 1990. Then, in 1993, New England turned to veteran head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> to lead the team, hoping to repeat the success he had with the New York Giants.|$|E
25|$|Jones then lured <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> out of {{retirement}} to coach the Cowboys. The Cowboys became the surprise team of the 2003 season getting off to a hot 7–2 season, but went 3–4 {{for the rest of}} the season. They were able to win the division with a 10–6 record but lost in the Wild Card round to eventual conference champion Carolina Panthers 29–10.|$|E
25|$|In January 2002, {{after losing}} {{in the wild}} card round to the Eagles for the second {{consecutive}} year, the Buccaneers fired head coach Tony Dungy. After a recruiting effort aimed at former Jets coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> Tampa Bay settled on Raiders coach Jon Gruden in exchange for two first round draft picks (2002, 2003), two second round picks (2002, 2004) and US$8 million in cash payments.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{win over}} Chicago, Giants coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> {{mentioned}} travel arrangements {{in a team}} meeting during the week. Since the customary week off before the Super Bowl for this season {{was not on the}} schedule, Parcells told the team prior to leaving for Newark Airport that they had two packing options: either pack just for the trip to San Francisco, or pack for that trip and a second trip to Tampa. He then showed the team he was packing for both trips as a motivational tactic.|$|E
25|$|This Super Bowl {{featured}} two {{clubs that}} were considered losing teams {{for much of}} the late 1980s. The Packers' fortunes turned after head coach Mike Holmgren and quarterback Brett Favre joined the team in 1992. The Patriots' rise began in 1993 when <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> was hired as head coach, and the team drafted quarterback Drew Bledsoe. Under their respective head coaches and quarterbacks, Green Bay posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record in 1996, while New England advanced to their second Super Bowl after recording an 11–5 record.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{is remembered}} {{throughout}} the coaching realms as always being {{a student of}} football. Former Dallas Cowboys' head coach, <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells,</b> once {{told the story of}} how Wood drove five hours each day for weeks just to watch his Texas Tech linebackers practice. Baylor's former head coach, Grant Teaff, said that Wood once spent the night in his film room just to ask how a particular play had been run. He had also been a major opponent to the “no pass, no play” laws of the early 1980s. Wood hardly lost any players after the laws had been passed.|$|E
25|$|Though Orthwein's {{period as}} owner {{was short and}} controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team. Former New York Giants coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Parcells</b> was hired in 1993, and the drastic changes were made the same year to the Patriots uniforms, {{changing}} their primary colors from their traditional red and white to blue and silver, and introducing a new logo. Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including Super Bowl XXXI, which they lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 3521. Pete Carroll, Parcells' successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice.|$|E
