5|$|Watch the Throne was {{released}} by Roc-A-Fella Records, Roc Nation, and Def Jam Recordings, Jay-Z's and West's respective record labels. On July 4, 2011 it was made available to pre-order on Life + Times, Jay-Z's lifestyle webzine, which redirected to Island Def Jam's website that featured the deluxe version available for $16.99, standard CD for $13.99, a deluxe digital version for $14.99, and standard digital album for $11.99. On July 22, its pre-order was made available on the iTunes Store. Internationally the album {{was released}} digitally on August 8 exclusively through iTunes, while its physical release was made available on August 12. Its deluxe CD edition was sold exclusively by Best Buy through August 23, when it became available at other retailers. The sales strategy received criticism from other retailers, who accused the labels of giving preferential treatment to iTunes and Best <b>Buy.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> the most anticipated releases in 2011, Watch the Throne {{became one of the}} few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak.|$|E
25|$|Despite this success, Ludwig Mestler {{was unable}} to support himself at his art. Not only was he temperamentally unsuited to supplementing his income by {{teaching}} or lecturing, but he developed ideas {{about the value of}} his pictures which made it impossible to sell them.

25|$|In {{the years}} before his death, DeLorean planned to resurrect his car company, and gave {{interviews}} describing a new vehicle called the DMC2. According to his family, {{he spent much of}} his last several years working on this new venture. In an effort to gather funds, he designed and sold high-end watches via the internet under the name DeLorean Time. Made of what appeared in promotions to be injection molded stainless steel, the watches sold for $3,495.

[...] He still makes custom knives available for sale at knife shows, but takes no orders for new custom work. Since 1995 {{the only way to}} get a new custom knife from Emerson himself is through a lottery held at knife shows where he is present.

500|$|Hovering {{over all}} of these was the {{possibility}} that the-then five dreadnoughts of the South American dreadnought race could be put up for sale. Two, from Brazil, were already completed, and a third was under construction in Britain. Another two, for Argentina, were being built in the United States. Naval historian Paul G. Halpern wrote of this situation that [...] "the sudden acquisition by a single power of all or even some of these ships might {{have been enough to}} tip a delicate balance of power such as that which prevailed in the Mediterranean." [...] Both the Greeks and Ottomans were reportedly interested in the Argentine ships, and Venizelos attempted to <b>buy</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the s then being built in the United States for the Argentine Navy as an alternative to redesigning Salamis, in the process delaying her completion.|$|E

500|$|At the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich {{appeared}} with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized {{the idea of}} using Napster to share music. Marlon played a college student listening to Metallica's [...] "I Disappear". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation. Ulrich responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just [...] "sharing" [...] by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was [...] "borrowing things that were not yours without asking". He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt, saying, [...] "I borrowed this shirt from a friend.

500|$|In one of Seacology's projects, villagers in Fiji {{refused a}} $700,000 offer by foreign {{businessmen}} to <b>buy</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the islands and {{signed an agreement}} that prohibited development for 20years and established a 10-year no-take fishing reserve encompassing [...] around the island. On the island of Kendhoo, part of the Baa Atoll in the Maldives, Seacology paid $30,000 in 2003 to build a kindergarten {{in exchange for a}} ban on harvesting endangered sea turtle eggs, which the government did not prohibit. In the Trang Province of Thailand, another project helps protect the habitat of seagrass beds and mangrove forest to provide habitat for endangered marine mammals called dugongs (Dugong dugon). In 2003, Seacology and a Chinese organization worked together to form an agreement with the people of Hainan Island where in return for scholarships for nearly 200middle-school children, the people would stop cutting down the trees around Bawangling Reserve, home to one of the rarest primates in the world, the Hainan black crested gibbon (Nomascus nasutus hainanus) and the nearly extinct subspecies of Eld's deer (Panolia eldii) found on Hainan. In a project on Cát Bà Island in Vietnam, the organization helped protect the golden-headed langur, another one of the world's most endangered primates, by paying cash and helping establish exclusive harvesting and fishing rights for the local people in return for their efforts in patrolling the beaches and forests for poachers. In 1999, Seacology began work to establish a new national park around Mt. Angavokely, near Antananarivo in Madagascar. The mountain is home to 120species of endangered orchids and several medicinal herbs, including Helichrysum gymnocephalum, which is used as an antiseptic and treatment for bronchitis; Secneicia faujasiodides, which is used for healing wounds; Psiadia altissima, which is used to treat eczema; Bryophyllum proliferum, which is used to treat coughing; and Brachylaena ramiflora, which is used to lower malarial fever.|$|E
2500|$|Eggleston's early {{photographic}} {{efforts were}} inspired {{by the work of}} Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank, and by French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson's book, The Decisive Moment. Eggleston later recalled that the book was [...] "the first serious book I found, from many awful books...I didn't understand it a bit, and then it sank in, and I realized, my God, this is a great one.” First photographing in black-and-white, Eggleston began experimenting with color in 1965 and 1966 after being introduced to the medium by William Christenberry. [...] Color transparency film became his dominant medium in the later 1960s. Eggleston's development as a photographer seems to have taken place in relative isolation from other artists. In an interview with Director of Photography at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) John Szarkowski describes his first encounter with the young Eggleston in 1969 as being [...] "absolutely out of the blue". After reviewing Eggleston's work (which he recalled as a suitcase full of [...] "drugstore" [...] color prints) Szarkowski prevailed upon the Photography Committee of MoMA to <b>buy</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Eggleston's photographs.|$|E

2500|$|It was in {{the month}} of June 2003 that the Volkswagen Sedán Última Edición was introduced. A totally nostalgic car, which resembles the past glories of the Volkswagen Beetle. This Final Edition {{consisted}} of 2,999 units for sale to the general public in Volkswagen dealers across Mexico, while one (the last one to be produced), would be immediately shipped to the Volkswagen Museum in Wolfsburg, Germany, testifying a historic age which ended on July 30, 2003, when the last Volkswagen Beetle (the unit number 21'529,464) leaves the production line in what was now called [...] "the hall of sorrow", accompanied by a Mariachi singing the song [...] "Las Golondrinas" [...] (A Mexican folk song that speaks of a farewell). [...] This latter Beetle was headed to the port of Veracruz where a ship would take it to its final destination. The rest of the units, in spite of costing MXP$84,000 (a [...] "Unified" [...] Volkswagen Beetle cost MXP$69,000), moved very quickly from dealerships, leaving many people with the desire to own one of these copies unsatisfied. At this time, Volkswagen presented some advertising with a nostalgic tone. In some of them, they showed a small space to park, and many cars that tried unsuccessfully to occupy it, after what appeared to get a sedan, then showed a sentence saying: [...] "Es increíble que un auto tan pequeño deje un vacío tan grande. Adiós Sedán." [...] ("It was incredible that such a small a car leaves such a large emptiness. Goodbye Beetle"). One of the curious events that occurred was the fact that a group of owners of dealerships, in Mexico, came together to <b>buy</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these cars, which was sent to the Vatican City as a present for Pope John Paul II.|$|E
