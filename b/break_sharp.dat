40|$|We report NuSTAR {{observations}} of the millisecond pulsar - low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) transition system PSR J 1023 + 0038 from June and October 2013, {{before and after the}} formation of an accretion disk around the neutron star. Between June 10 - 12, a few days to two weeks before the radio disappearance of the pulsar, the 3 - 79 keV X-ray spectrum was well fit by a simple power law with a photon index of Gamma= 1. 17 +/- 0. 08 (at 90 % confidence) with a 3 - 79 keV luminosity of 7. 4 +/- 0. 4 x 10 ^ 32 erg/s. Significant orbital modulation was observed with a modulation fraction of 36 +/- 10 %. During the October 19 - 21 observation, the spectrum is described by a softer power law (Gamma= 1. 66 +/- 0. 06) with an average luminosity of 5. 8 +/- 0. 2 x 10 ^ 33 erg/s and a peak luminosity of ~ 1. 2 x 10 ^ 34 erg/s observed during a flare. No significant orbital modulation was detected. The spectral observations are consistent with previous and current multi-wavelength observations and show the hard X-ray power law extending to 79 keV without a spectral <b>break.</b> <b>Sharp</b> edged, flat bottomed `dips' are observed with widths between 30 - 1000 s and ingress and egress time-scales of 30 - 60 s. No change in hardness ratio was observed during the dips. Consecutive dip separations are log-normal in distribution with a typical separation of approximately 400 s. These dips are distinct from dipping activity observed in LMXBs. We compare and contrast these dips to {{observations of}} dips and state changes in the similar transition systems PSR J 1824 - 2452 I and XSS J 1227. 0 - 4859 and discuss possible interpretations based on the transitions in the inner disk.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents research carried out {{as part of a}} project undertaken in fulfilment {{of the requirements}} of Loughborough University for the award of Philosophical Doctorate. The main focus of this research is to investigate and develop an appropriate level of automation to the existing manual finishing operations of small metallic components to achieve required surface quality and to remove superficial defects. In the manufacturing industries, polishing processes {{play a vital role in}} the development of high precision products, to give a desired surface finish, remove defects, <b>break</b> <b>sharp</b> edges, extend the working life cycle, and meet mechanical specification. The polishing operation is generally done at the final stage of the manufacturing process and can represent up to a third of the production time. Despite the growth automated technology in industry, polishing processes are still mainly carried out manually, due to the complexity and constraints of the process. Manual polishing involves a highly qualified worker polishing the workpiece by hand. These processes are very labour intensive, highly skill dependent, costly, error-prone, environmentally hazardous due to abrasive dust, and - in some cases - inefficient with long process times. In addition, the quality of the finishing is dependent on the training, experience, fatigue, physical ability, and expertise of the operator. Therefore, industries are seeking alternative solutions to be implemented within their current processes. These solutions are mainly aimed at replacing the human operator to improve the health and safety of their workforce and improve their competitiveness. Some automated solutions have already been proposed to assist or replace manual polishing processes. These solutions provide limited capabilities for specific processes or components, and a lack of flexibility and dexterity. One of the reasons for their lack of success is identified as neglecting the study and implementing the manual operations. This research initially hypothesised that for an effective development, an automated polishing system should be designed based on the manual polishing operations. Therefore, a successful implementation of an automated polishing system requires a thorough understanding of the polishing process and their operational parameters. This study began by collaborating with an industrial polishing company. The research was focused on polishing complex small components, similar to the parts typically used in the aerospace industry. The high level business processes of the polishing company were capture through several visits to the site. The low level operational parameters and the understanding of the manual operations were also captured through development of a devices that was used by the expert operators. A number of sensors were embedded to the device to facilitate recording the manual operations. For instance, the device captured the force applied by the operator (avg. 10 N) and the cycle time (e. g. 1 pass every 5 sec.). The capture data was then interpreted to manual techniques and polishing approaches that were used in developing a proof-of-concept Integrated Robotic Polishing System (IRPS). The IRPS was tested successfully through several laboratory based experiments by expert operators. The experiment results proved the capability of the proposed system in polishing a variety of part profiles, without pre-existing geometrical information about the parts. One of the main contributions made by this research is to propose a novel approach for automated polishing operations. The development of an integrated robotic polishing system, based on the research findings, uses a set of smart sensors and a force-position-by-increment control algorithm, and transpose the way that skilled workers carry out polishing processes...|$|E

40|$|Level set method, {{introduced}} by Osher and Sethian [1], {{is a highly}} robust and accurate computational technique for tracking of moving interfaces in etching, deposition and photolithography processes. It originates from the idea to view the moving front as a particular level set of a higher dimensional function, so the topological merging and <b>breaking,</b> <b>sharp</b> gradients and cusps can form naturally, {{and the effects of}} curvature can be easily incorporated. The corresponding equations of motion for the propagating surfaces, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, can be solved using methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, ensuring in that the way correct entropy-satisfying solution [2]. In this paper we describe an application of the sparse field method for solving level set equations in 3 D plasma etching simulations. Sparse field method itself, developed by Whitaker [3] and broadly used in image processing community, is an alternative to the usual combination of narrow band and fast marching procedures for the computationally effective solving of level set equations. The obtained results for convex and non-convex Hamiltonians show correct behavior of etching profiles in simple model cases.
