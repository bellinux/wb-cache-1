40|$|Biologically active CAM may detrimentally {{interfere}} with chemotherapy treatment, so cancer patients require targeted, evidence-based information on chemotherapy-CAM integration consequences. The object {{of this study}} was to investigate the potential for medical doctor recommendation and patient acceptance of a purpose-designed patient educational <b>brochure</b> on the safe use of CAM with chemotherapy. Cancer care doctors () were provided a draft version of a patient educational <b>brochure</b> developed by the authors and completed a structured feedback form. Cancer patients receiving treatment () were provided with the <b>brochure</b> and completed the local health service consumer testing feedback form. All 17 doctors perceived a need for the <b>brochure</b> and all would recommend the <b>brochure</b> to their patients. Approximately 59 % of the doctors indicated they would recommend the <b>brochure</b> to all patients receiving chemotherapy and 41 % preferred that only patients using CAM or who enquired about CAM be given the <b>brochure.</b> Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy reported that the <b>brochure</b> information answered their questions and was easy to understand. This evidence-based CAM-chemotherapy patient <b>brochure</b> may be a useful adjunct for use by cancer care health professionals to educate patients on the potential dangers of biologically active CAM use with chemotherapy and to provide patients with safe CAM alternatives...|$|R

5|$|For proper {{protection}} of the wood turtle,in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging solution to the highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow the wood turtle to pass under the road, a solution that helps prevent accidental deaths. <b>Brochures</b> and other media that warn people to avoid keeping the wood turtle as a pet are currently being distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable the wood turtle's survival.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an effort to}} design and evaluate persuasive educational materials for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Although CRC screening is highly effective, screening rates in the US remain low. Educational materials represent one strategy for educating patients about screening options and increasing openness to screening. We developed a one-page <b>brochure,</b> leveraging factual information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and national guidelines, and strategies for persuasion from the human factors and behavioral economics literatures. We evaluated the resulting <b>brochure</b> with adults {{over the age of}} 50. Findings suggest that the educational <b>brochure</b> increases knowledge of CRC and screening options, and increases openness to screening. Furthermore, no significant difference was found between the new one-page <b>brochure</b> and an existing multi-page Screen for Life <b>brochure</b> recommended by the CDC. We interpret these findings as indication that the more practical and potentially less intimidating one-page <b>brochure</b> is as effective as the existing multi-page Screen for Life <b>brochure...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{major focus}} in {{secondary}} education {{for many students}} with disabilities is to improve independent living skills and prepare students with the vocational skills needed to participate in competitive employment. Yet the outcomes remain poor for these students when compared with their nondisabled peers. One factor accounting for poor outcomes is lack of preparation for the parents. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the impact of parent training on knowledge of transition agencies and supports for students with disabilities. The study was intended to connect parents with needed agencies and supports for the purpose of improving transition outcomes for students with disabilities. Two types of training were compared: (a) exposure to a <b>brochure</b> with transition information, and (b) <b>brochure</b> exposure plus 60 -min of small group training conducted by the researcher. The <b>Brochure</b> Only group consisted of 13 participants while the <b>Brochure</b> Plus Training Group had 16 participants. First, parents individually took a pretest to determine their knowledge of transition agencies and support services. Parents in the <b>Brochure</b> Only group showed a mean pretest score of 1. 38 out of 10. 0. Parents in the <b>brochure</b> plus training group showed a mean pretest score of 1. 13 out of 10. 0. Second, parents were given a copy of a transition <b>brochure</b> that included contact numbers and web site information for each agency discussed during the training. Parents in the <b>brochure</b> group reviewed the <b>brochure</b> information for up to 60 min. Parents in the <b>brochure</b> plus small-group training met with the researcher who described each agency and service. Third, immediately following the training, parents individually took the same test as a posttest. The <b>brochure</b> only group showed a mean posttest score of 3. 0 out of 10. 0, the mean difference score being 1. 62 when compared to the pretest. The <b>brochure</b> plus training group showed a mean posttest score of 7. 31 out of 10. 0, the mean difference score being 6. 19 when compared to the pretest. Finally, all participants were directed to select an agency from the <b>brochure</b> and set a goal to make contact with that agency. After 30 days, the researcher contacted all of the participants to verify if the contact was made. Results for the <b>brochure</b> plus training group showed that nine out of 16 parents made contact with a community agency. Results for the <b>brochure</b> only group showed that zero out of 13 made contact with a community agency. Parents who participated in the <b>Brochure</b> Plus Training showed a larger increase in their posttest knowledge score and were more likely to make contact with a community agency than parents in the <b>Brochure</b> Only group...|$|R

5|$|Rejtan's {{dramatic}} {{attempt to}} prevent the partition earned him lasting recognition in Poland, one that began even during the proceedings, as he was lauded by some other deputies. His action was also praised as patriotic and respectable by the Prussian and Russian military commanders in Warsaw, who offered him a military escort {{to protect him from}} some confederates (particularly Poniński was holding a grudge against him). Soon, <b>brochures</b> and newspaper articles spread the information about his patriotic gesture throughout Poland and abroad. During the Great Sejm of 1788–92, a decree was passed, commending Rejtan, and deputies discussed a project to put a plaque to his name in the Sejm Chambers.

Historians still debate over his potential authorship of several anonymous works (primarily political <b>brochures).</b> He distanced himself from activists discussing a new insurrection, but was nonetheless arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian authorities again in the years 1798–1800. In 1801 he joined the Warsaw Scientific Society. He returned to politics shortly after much of Galicia was liberated by Napoleon and attached to the Duchy of Warsaw. During the negotiations with Napoleon in Dresden he contracted severe diarrhea and died on 30 August 1809. He was buried in Wilanów.|$|E
