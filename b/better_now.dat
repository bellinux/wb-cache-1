5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some have embraced the Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no <b>better</b> <b>now</b> than {{it was at the}} time of Orwell's writing.|$|E

This time, Raonic upset Federer in {{straight}} sets, winning his eighth career title. Asked to talk about Raonic after the match, Federer observed: [...] "or a big guy he moves well ... He's improved his fitness the last few years. Also, tactically, I think he's <b>better</b> <b>now</b> than he's ever been. He's made a conscious effort of playing close to the baseline, which before when he was working with the Spanish coaches he was way back." ...|$|E

500|$|On 1 November, Benfica hosted Celtic; {{they scored}} two {{goals in the}} first 25 minutes and a third through Andrei Karyaka in the 90th minute, winning by the same margin they had lost in Glasgow.

[...] Four days later, Benfica hosted [...] Beira-Mar for a Primeira Liga match. Benfica did not score until the second half, when in the 51st minute, Katsouranis headed in the match's first goal. Three minutes later, Petit scored the second and an own-goal from Beira-Mar made the score 3–0.|$|E

[...] LaMorte did find some fault during his visit, describing the china as [...] "monotonous" [...] and saying the chef-waiters [...] "always dash off too quickly." [...] Martha Bayne of Chicago Reader, also {{writing about the}} post-relaunch menu, agreed saying, [...] "the food is better than ever." [...] Bayne called the food [...] "legendary", but did say the jellyfish pad Thai did not [...] "quite {{live up to their}} promise". [...] Her favorite dish of the night was the sweetbreads dessert, which she described as [...] "salty, savory, sweet, and deliriously complex, it shoots for the moon and succeeds by confounding every expectation." ...|$|E

5000|$|Over a {{yielding}} turf course, Star Over the Bay went to {{the early}} lead with Kitten's Joy tracking in third and <b>Better</b> Talk <b>Now</b> near {{the back of the}} pack. With a half mile remaining, Powerscourt made his move while Star Over the Bay started to tire, eventually finishing last. Looking for racing room {{at the top of the}} stretch, Kitten's Joy swung out just as <b>Better</b> Talk <b>Now</b> was starting his run on the outside of the field. Kitten's Joy checked sharply due to a lack of racing room and his jockey later claimed foul, saying contact between the two horses caused Kitten's Joy to lose momentum. Regardless, <b>Better</b> Talk <b>Now</b> continued with a powerful run down the stretch, then started to drift in, brushing with Powerscourt as he moved to the lead. <b>Better</b> Talk <b>Now</b> won by [...] lengths over a late-finishing Kitten's Joy, with Powerscourt in third.|$|R

500|$|Moreover, {{symmetrical}} positions may be disadvantageous to White {{in that he}} has {{to commit}} himself first. Watson notes that it is even difficult for White to play noncommittally in a symmetrical position, since almost every move has certain drawbacks. Fischer once {{went so far as to}} claim that after 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.0-0 0-0 5.d3 d6 (Reinhard–Fischer, Western Open 1963), Believe it or not,' Black stands <b>better!</b> <b>Now,</b> whatever White does, Black will vary it and get an asymmetrical position and have the superior position due to his better pawn structure!" [...] However, GM Paul Keres responded in CHESS magazine, [...] "We just don't believe it!" [...] In symmetrical positions, as the Hodgson–Arkell and Portisch–Tal games discussed below illustrate, Black can continue to imitate White as long as he finds it feasible and desirable to do so, and deviate when that ceases to be the case.|$|E

It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Blaine's cornea {{was deeply}} {{scratched}} {{in the incident}} and he needs surgery. The club wants revenge on Sebastian; Kurt says he should be expelled from Dalton, but Will asks them to let the system handle it. Artie (Kevin McHale) refuses: he is fed up with being told it will get better and says it should be <b>better</b> <b>now,</b> and leaves. Despite wanting revenge, Kurt is unwilling to use violence, so Santana goes to Dalton and accuses Sebastian of lying about {{the composition of the}} damaging slushie. He challenges her to a duel: the song [...] "Smooth Criminal". He admits after they finish that he rigged the slushie with rock salt, and hits her with an unadulterated one. Santana secretly recorded the encounter, and plays her evidence to New Directions, who in turn invite the Warblers to their auditorium, show them that they [...] "get" [...] Jackson better by performing [...] "Black or White", and reveal to the Warblers the proof that Sebastian deliberately tried to injure one of them.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again". In an {{interview}} with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album [...] "sound more personal than {{they might have been}} a few years ago", and she responded by saying [...] "Some of that could be just chance! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. Maybe people know me <b>better</b> <b>now,</b> and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right".

[...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing.

500|$|Michigan {{suffered}} an 80–70 overtime loss {{at the hands}} of ten-place Big Ten foe, Iowa, on February 22. Michigan had led 56–52 with 1 minute and 13 seconds remaining in regulation before allowing four straight free throws by Matt Gatens. [...] The game was notable because Harris did not play during the overtime. [...] At the time of the benching, Harris was in a battle with fellow sophomores Talor Battle and Evan Turner for the Big Ten Scoring leadership. [...] Beilein commented on the benching: [...] "That's what we had to do to make our team <b>better</b> <b>now</b> and in the future.". [...] In the subsequent game against #16-ranked Purdue, Michigan won 87–78, raising its record to 3–4 against ranked opponents on the season. Harris was one of Michigan's leaders with 27 points and 8 rebounds, while Sims had a career-high 29 points. [...] On March 1, Michigan lost to Wisconsin 60–55. After taking a 34–32 halftime lead, Michigan opened the second half shooting 1 for 12. Michigan closed the contest to a 52–50 game with 3 minutes and 55 seconds remaining. They stayed close as Wisconsin missed four of eight late free throws. [...] Prior to the final game of the season, the Wolverines adopted the slogan [...] "Queme los barcos," [...] which means [...] "burn the ships" [...] and which had been used by 16th-century Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortez as a command to his troops to remind them that there was no turning back in their battle with the Aztec. The team traded in their traditional warmup jersey's for shirts with their adopted slogan. [...] On March 7, they recovered from a 51–39 deficit to win their conference finale against Minnesota. Laval Lucas-Perry scored a career-high 19 points, including three straight three-pointers after Minnesota opened up the 12-point lead. Of the three teams that were ranked at the end of February and that Michigan had played twice (Duke, Illinois and Purdue), Michigan split the two games against each opponent, winning against each at home.|$|E
