Binary decision variables indicate whether a product is set up or not and continuous decision variables reflect the lot size of each product in the block.

The proposed low-cost approach has been applied and validated by the implementation of an industrial regulator in a real time hardware-in-the-loop simulation of a mixed islanded power network including precise models of the hydraulic system. The studied network is constituted of three different types of electrical power generation systems and a consumer...|$|R
