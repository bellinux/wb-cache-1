25|$|During this adventure, a {{great many}} friendships grow. Kate and Marek find {{themselves}} often thrown together. This shows trust. Kate and Chris also find themselves alone together. Not only does friendship grow out of this relationship, <b>but</b> <b>love</b> as well. Therefore, without friendship, this team might not have trusted enough in one another to survive, making friendship an important theme of the novel.|$|E
25|$|These interpreters {{also argue}} that the {{description}} in 2 Samuel 1:26 of the “love” (Hebrew: “ahava”) between David and Jonathan that {{is greater than the}} “love of women” should be understood in light of the two earlier mentions of “love” (ahava) between David and Jonathan where it is described not as love for a romantic partner <b>but</b> <b>love</b> for self (“he loved him as his own soul,” 1 Sam 18:3; 20:17).|$|E
25|$|The most shocking, frightening, and {{fascinating}} image in {{rock in the}} last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive... When some male performers do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, <b>but</b> <b>Love,</b> typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being raped, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.|$|E

25|$|Curtis {{made her}} {{television}} debut in {{an episode of}} Columbo, but her first starring TV role was opposite Richard Lewis in the situation comedy Anything <b>But</b> <b>Love,</b> which ran for four seasons from 1989 through 1992. Her performance as Hannah Miller received both a Golden Globe and People's Choice Award. She appeared as nurse Lt. Duran in the short-lived TV series Operation Petticoat (1977), based on the 1959 film which starred her real-life father Tony Curtis.|$|E
25|$|Houston later {{embarked}} on a world tour, entitled the Nothing <b>but</b> <b>Love</b> World Tour. It was her first world tour in over ten years and was announced as a triumphant comeback. However, some poor reviews and rescheduled concerts brought some negative media attention. Houston canceled some concerts because of illness and received widespread negative reviews from fans who were disappointed {{in the quality of}} her voice and performance. Some fans reportedly walked out of her concerts.|$|E
25|$|Curtis' other notable films include Blue Steel (1989) and Freaky Friday (2003), {{for which}} she {{received}} her third Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy.

25|$|Bea Arthur and Betty White {{worked well}} {{together}} in shared mutual respect {{but they did}} not pursue a personal friendship with one another outside of The Golden Girls set. However, both were close to Rue McClanahan off camera. Arthur and White were consummate professionals and thoroughly enjoyed their experiences on the show despite having only a work relationship with one another. Betty White has always expressed nothing <b>but</b> <b>love</b> and admiration for Bea Arthur. Only after Arthur's death in 2009 did she reveal the fundamental personality clash between Arthur and herself. White's positive, perky demeanor would sometimes irritate Arthur.|$|E
25|$|However, when Madoka {{appeared}} to retrieve Homura, {{she had forgotten}} about her duty as the Law of Cycles and her powers, thus Kyubey kept observing her until that point. Having recovered her memories, Homura forces herself to complete the witch transformation {{at the cost of}} having her soul destroyed, to protect Madoka from the Incubators. At that moment Sayaka and a new girl named Nagisa Momoe, whose witch form is actually Charlotte—the witch that killed Mami—lead Madoka and the others in breaking the barrier to reach Homura's real body. Madoka recovers her memories and power as the Law of Cycles and reaches for Homura, but the latter releases the curse in her Soul Gem which she reveals is not one of despair, <b>but</b> <b>love.</b> With this power, retaining her human form, Homura suppresses Madoka's powers while transcending into what she considers to be a demon.|$|E
25|$|A {{round of}} three-day games started at Hobart on 1 February, with the Warriors bowling out the Tigers for 86 on first innings, as Steve Magoffin took bowling figures of 17–12–15–3. Chris Rogers then outscored the Tigers by hitting 135 in the Warriors' total of 215, {{and though the}} Tigers posted 276 the second time around, the Warriors chased it down with seven wickets to spare after a {{partnership}} of 106 between Rogers and Shaun Marsh. On 2 February, play began at the 'Gabba, where Queensland built a 287-run lead on first innings after 116 from Martin Love and half-centuries from numbers eight and nine, Andy Bichel and Daniel Doran. The Blues responded with 378, <b>but</b> <b>Love</b> and Shane Watson took Queensland past the target of 92 inside 17 overs after the first two wickets fell for 20. The Redbacks also surrendered a first-innings lead at Adelaide, though Victoria fell from one for 164 to 249 all out, and despite 68 off 64 balls from Shaun Tait of the Redbacks, the Bushrangers chased down the target after a half-century from Jason Arnberger.|$|E

500|$|By February 18, {{the film}} {{had been cut}} to 9,204 feet. It had two advance previews in January 1938, where it {{received}} either As or A-pluses on audience-feedback cards. Producer Pandro S. Berman wanted to cut five more minutes, but relented when Hawks, Grant and Cliff Reid objected. At the film's second preview, the film received rave reviews and RKO expected a hit. The film's musical score is minimal, primarily Grant and Hepburn singing [...] "I Can't Give You Anything <b>But</b> <b>Love,</b> Baby". There is incidental music in the Ritz scene, and an arrangement of [...] "I Can't Give You Anything <b>But</b> <b>Love,</b> Baby" [...] during the opening and closing credits by musical director Roy Webb.|$|E
500|$|Whitney Houston {{performed}} [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] as {{the opening}} selection throughout her Greatest Love World Tour in 1986, which ran from July to December. In February 2010, she again performed the song, along with Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel", during her Nothing <b>but</b> <b>Love</b> World Tour.|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{initially}} {{scheduled to begin}} on September 1, 1937 and wrap on October 31, but was delayed for several reasons. Production {{had to wait until}} mid-September to clear the rights for [...] "I Can't Give You Anything <b>but</b> <b>Love,</b> Baby" [...] for $1,000. In August Hawks hired gag writers Robert McGowan and Gertrude Purcell for uncredited script rewrites, and McGowan added a scene inspired by the comic strip Professor Dinglehoofer and his Dog in which a dog buries a rare dinosaur bone. RKO paid King Features $1,000 to use the idea for the film on September 21.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical {{reference}} points in [...] are all quite interesting—if {{you consider the}} youth-obsessed reference collaborators {{of the first two}} singles and how uncomfortable it all feels. 'Superstar' offers a glimpse of something far more comfortable in its own skin. All the {{reference points}} will mean very little to your average 17-year-old. We suppose the idea is that they're icons whose imagery transcends generations blah blah blah but after all the aggressive positioning of the first two singles it's great to hear Madonna relaxing into this sort of song. The lyrics about being in love are a bit soppy <b>but</b> <b>love</b> makes you go a bit soppy sometimes.|$|E
500|$|Imelda says in one {{vignette}} {{that she}} had met United States Army General Douglas MacArthur during his landing in Tacloban {{at the end of}} World War II, and that McArthur insisted that she should perform for the composer Irving Berlin, She sang [...] "God Bless the Philippines" [...] and when Berlin asked her why she sang the lyrics incorrectly she said, [...] "what's the difference between America and the Philippines?" [...] The assassination attempt on Imelda and the assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr. are featured in the film. Footage from parties held by the Marcos couple, including one during which actor George Hamilton sang [...] "I can't give you anything <b>but</b> <b>love,</b> Imelda", are also used in the film.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} {{features}} scenes of Houston dancing {{in a setting}} of video screens and colored partitions. The music video gave Houston exposure to the teens and MTV. It also received nominations at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Female Video and Best New Artist in a Video, winning the former category. The song was performed on many of her tours including Greatest Love Tour (1986) and her Nothing <b>but</b> <b>Love</b> World Tour (2009–10). [...] "How Will I Know" [...] is also featured as a remix on Houston's compilation album [...] (2000), whereas the original version is featured on The Ultimate Collection (2007) and [...] (2012; remastered).|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Young Girls" [...] follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern. It {{begins with the}} singer [...] "dumbly" [...] trying to get noticed by [...] "these bright-eyed honeys", since he can't help to fall for their [...] "dubious charms", despite [...] "recognizing [...] sin while indulging in it". The song's lyrics {{are in the same}} vein as Gary Puckett & The Union Gap's [...] "Young Girl" [...] and The Knack's [...] "My Sharona" [...] as pointed out by HitFix's Melinda Newman. She added, the lyrics are [...] "sweet" [...] and tortuous as he sings [...] "Oh, I still dream of a simple life/ Boy meets girl/ makes her his wife/ <b>But</b> <b>love</b> don’t exist when you live like this... All these roads steer me wrong/ But I still drive them all night long/ all night long". There is a {{sentiment}} of [...] "lament" [...] in the song, [...] "Oh you young wild girls/ You’ll be the death of me".|$|E
500|$|In the Victorian period, Alfred, Lord Tennyson adopted many {{features}} of the Elegy in his own extended meditation on death, In Memoriam. He established a ceremonial, almost religious, tone by reusing {{the idea of the}} [...] "knell" [...] that [...] "tolls" [...] to mark the coming night. This is followed with the poet narrator looking through letters of his deceased friend, echoing Gray's narrator reading the tombstones to connect to the dead. Robert Browning relied on a similar setting to the Elegy in his pastoral poem [...] "Love Among the Ruins", which describes the desire for glory and how everything ends in death. Unlike Gray, Browning adds a female figure and argues that nothing <b>but</b> <b>love</b> matters. Thomas Hardy, who had memorised Gray's poem, took the title of his fourth novel, Far from the Madding Crowd, from a line in it. In addition, many in his Wessex Poems and Other Verses (1898) contain a graveyard theme and take a similar stance to Gray, and its frontispiece depicts a graveyard.|$|E
500|$|Mike Thompson {{discovered}} in a poll taken in March 1977 that women in Dade County opposed repealing the measure two to one; they saw their gay friends as relatively harmless. Save Our Children's strategy, therefore, worked to prove that homosexuals were amoral, promiscuous, and defiant of traditional gender roles, {{and that they were}} a specific danger to children. Bryant took this strategy as a crusade, delivering speeches that intoned that Dade County's passing of the ordinance [...] "guts the law {{on the side of the}} unrighteous. If homosexuals are allowed to change the law in their favor, why not prostitutes, thieves, or murderers?" [...] She specifically connected homosexuals with child molesters, saying [...] "Some of the stories I could tell you of child recruitment and child abuse by homosexuals would turn your stomach." [...] Bryant resented the media depiction of her as hateful, saying that her inspiration came [...] "out of love—not only love for God's commandment and His word, <b>but</b> <b>love</b> for my children and yours. Yes, and even love for all sinners—even homosexuals." ...|$|E
