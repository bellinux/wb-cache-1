500|$|The narrow {{building}} allows {{an external}} exposure {{to all of}} the 300 offices, which pass natural light via double hung outside windows through feather-chipped glass transoms and hallway partitions into the single central corridor. Skylights bring sunlight into the open stairwells. The north half corridors are [...] wide and the south half corridors are [...] In the north half, there are two open stairs in the center at the one third points, with perforated risers, white marble treads, and decorative steel railings. There are two banks of four elevators {{on the west side of}} the corridor, one for passengers and the other for freight. In the south half, there is a single <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> on the north half of the length. The southern bank was abandoned and slabbed over on each floor. There is a flight of stairs behind each of these shafts with marble treads, closed cast iron risers, and ornamental balusters. The basic office suite is , consisting of one outer office and two or more inner offices. Heavy internal walls at the quarter and halfway points, the arches of which manifest Root's innovative wind bracing, mark the boundaries of the four original buildings.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to being a hotel, the building also contains office space in its top 6 floors, this portion being known as CitySpace. These office suites are serviced by a separate <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> accessible on the third floor.|$|E
50|$|The hotel’s 316 {{rooms are}} located on the fourth to tenth floors, and are {{accessed}} by a separate <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> from the hotel lobby. The rooms surround an interior courtyard, which is floored by the glazed roof over the lobby.|$|E
5|$|The {{shopping}} {{levels in}} the Clal Building are exceptionally large, with space for stores and a cinema. Stores are situated {{around the perimeter of}} a large, central atrium. Originally the atrium was open-air, but weather damage forced planners to install a semi-transparent roof. Several <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> access upper-floor offices.|$|R
50|$|The lobby was {{particularly}} well finished, including terrazzo flooring, wooden panels of black walnut, and a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> Otis <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was built to}} function as two separate towers stacked directly {{on top of one}} another, one comprising the first forty floors and the other the forty-first to sixty-fourth. The building has separate <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> and lobbies for each of the two building sections. A majority of the bottom 40 floors are occupied by Williams. The remainder of the building is occupied by a variety of tenants.|$|R
5000|$|New York City, USA — the 190th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line) {{subway station}} has a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> {{that can be}} used by {{pedestrians}} without paying a fare. Also, the 34th Street (IRT Flushing Line) station has an incline elevator that, when open, can be used without paying a fare. Both stations are very deep.|$|E
50|$|Automatic {{elevators}} {{began to}} {{appear as early as}} the 1930s, their development being hastened by striking elevator operators which brought large cities dependent on skyscrapers (and therefore their elevators) such as New York and Chicago to their knees. These electromechanical systems used relay logic circuits of increasing complexity to control the speed, position and door operation of an elevator or <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|E
50|$|Eight {{passenger}} elevators {{provide access}} to the upper floors and are grouped in two banks of four with each bank having two cars facing each other linked by a hall. The West bank serves floors 2, 15-21 and the East most two cars also serve floor 1. Access to the elevators from floor 1 is just West inside the North entrance behind the security desk. The East <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> serve floors 2-14.|$|E
50|$|The north {{entrance}} is level with 6th Street, and is named BL (Bank Level since a Wells Fargo Bank branch occupies {{the eastern half}} of that floor). The east and west sidewalks slope downward to Wilshire Blvd. with steps leading up to the south entrance. Elevators {{on the south side of}} BL and escalators on the north side of BL both go up to the ML (Main Lobby) level, where additional <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> reach floors numbered 4-62. No 2nd floor exists, though the height of ML is twice that of ML (hence, this is a 62-story tower with only 61 floors). The BL/ML elevator also goes down to underground levels LBL (Lower Bank Level), LL1 (Lower Level 1 with evacuation tunnel used by firefighters in 1988), and LL2 (valet parking garage).|$|R
50|$|At {{the east}} side of the central lobby, molded marble {{surrounds}} with black granite plinth blocks enclose a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> six <b>elevators.</b> The north and south lobby walls contain marble-framed double doors with panelized details; these doors lead to the main stairwells, where flights of pink marble stairs and brass railings ascend to the north and south lobbies.|$|R
50|$|Until August 1962, the {{building}} at 223 ft was the second tallest in Portland after the Public Service Building. The building has two primary lower levels and a third service level beneath these. The first lower level was used for retail space until the mid-1980s. The levels beneath that were used for storage and various seasonal needs. The <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> hand-controlled <b>elevators</b> originally operated by store employees was {{closed to the public}} with the construction <b>of</b> new automatic <b>elevators,</b> but were still used to transport merchandise into the 1990s out of public view.|$|R
50|$|There was an {{electronic}} device {{to ensure that}} the train stopped with its doors adjacent to the platform doors; they were installed so that driverless trains could eventually be used on the line. Unlike other platform screen doors, which are lightweight units with extensive glazing installed on a normal platform edge, the St Petersburg units give the appearance of a solid wall with heavyweight doorways and solid steel sliding doors, similar to a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> in a large building, and the train cannot be seen entering from the platform; passengers become familiar with the sound alone to indicate a train arrival.|$|E
50|$|Independent {{service is}} a special service mode found on most elevators. It is {{activated}} by a key switch either inside the elevator itself or on a centralized control panel in the lobby. When an elevator is placed on independent service, it will no longer respond to hall calls. (In a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators,</b> traffic is rerouted to the other elevators, while in a single elevator, the hall buttons are disabled). The elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel. Independent service is useful when transporting large goods or moving groups of people between certain floors.|$|E
50|$|The {{downtown}} Davison's {{store was}} {{a classic example of}} a downtown shopping experience. The main entrance on Peachtree features a very stately marble-floored cosmetics and jewelry area, modelled after Macy's flagship store on Herald Square in New York. There is a mezzanine overlooking the level with escalators leading to that floor. A <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> in the rear serves floors from the basement through the sixth floor. The mezzanine and the third floor connected with the parking garage across Carnegie Way. When the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel opened next door in 1976, an entrance connected the two buildings, although the difference in floor heights required several steps up from Macy's into the hotel.|$|E
50|$|The Chrysler Building is {{considered}} a leading example of Art Deco architecture. The corners of the 61st floor are graced with eagles; on the 31st floor, the corner ornamentation are replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps. The building is constructed of masonry, with a steel frame, and metal cladding. The building currently contains a total of 3,862 windows on its facades. Inside, there are four <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> 8 <b>elevators</b> designed by the Otis Elevator Corporation. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and a New York City Landmark in 1978.|$|R
50|$|The John Hancock Center's sky lobby on the 44th floor serves {{only the}} {{residential}} {{portion of the}} building that occupies floors 45-92. Three express elevators run from the residential lobby {{on the ground floor}} to the 44th floor, with two <b>of</b> the <b>elevators</b> stopping at the parking garage's main level on floor 6. At floor 44, residents transfer to two <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> three <b>elevators.</b> One <b>bank</b> serves floors 45-65 and the other serves 65-92. Although all six elevators stop at floor 65, this floor is roughly the same layout as the residential floors immediately above and below it. It is not a sky lobby because residents can also board elevators to higher floors at floor 44.|$|R
5000|$|Double deck {{elevators}} {{are used}} in the Taipei 101 office tower. Tenants of even-numbered floors first take an escalator (or an elevator from the parking garage) to the 2nd level, where they will enter the upper deck and arrive at their floors. The lower deck is turned off during low-volume hours, and the upper deck can act as a single-level elevator stopping at all adjacent floors. For example, the 85th floor restaurants can be accessed from the 60th floor sky-lobby. Restaurant customers must clear their reservations at the reception counter on the 2nd floor. A <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> express <b>elevators</b> stop only on the sky lobby levels (36 and 60, upper-deck car), where tenants can transfer to [...] "local" [...] elevators.|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the towers}} has a one-floor lobby and nine {{residential}} floors; each has 270 apartments. The towers are stabilized with large rectangular pillars rising from subterranean 469 x 214 ft concrete platforms. A 220 car parking garage, four coin laundries, storage, and utility areas are in the basement. Each floor has twelve windows on {{the east and west}} and 108 on the north and south ends. Windows measure 41 in across including a narrow aluminum frame and are separated by 8 in columns. Windows are 72 in high and have a 3 in arch at the top. Each level extends 8 ft from floor to ceiling. Seventy-two studio apartments are each roughly 420 sq ft, 102 one-bedroom units are either 468 sq ft or 606 sq ft, and 90 two-bedroom units are 774 sq ft, 861 sq ft, or 893 sq ft. Each tower has two pairs of elevators. The lobbies are accessed by 12 x 12 ft foyers on the north and south ends of the buildings. Each <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> are located near the entrances. In 1988, security stations were installed on the north entrance of the 1451 building and the south entrance on the 1400 building.|$|E
50|$|The narrow {{building}} allows {{an external}} exposure {{to all of}} the 300 offices, which pass natural light via double hung outside windows through feather-chipped glass transoms and hallway partitions into the single central corridor. Skylights bring sunlight into the open stairwells. The north half corridors are 20 ft wide and the south half corridors are 11 ft. In the north half, there are two open stairs in the center at the one third points, with perforated risers, white marble treads, and decorative steel railings. There are two banks of four elevators {{on the west side of}} the corridor, one for passengers and the other for freight. In the south half, there is a single <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> on the north half of the length. The southern bank was abandoned and slabbed over on each floor.

5000|$|On September 11, 2001, {{minutes after}} United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower between floors 78 and 85 at 9:03 a.m., the 24 year-old Crowther called his mother {{from his office}} at 9:12 a.m., calmly leaving a brief message saying, [...] "Mom, this is Welles. I {{wanted you to know}} that I'm OK." [...] Crowther made his way down to the 78th floor sky lobby, where he {{encountered}} a group of survivors, huddled and waiting for help, including a badly burned Ling Young, who worked on the 86th floor in New York's Department of Taxation and Finance. Young had been one of approximately 200 people waiting at a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators</b> to evacuate when the plane hit the tower, {{and one of the few}} survivors. Blinded by the blood covering her glasses, she was rescued when Crowther appeared, carrying a young woman on his back, and directed them in a strong, authoritative voice, to the stairway. The survivors followed him 17 floors down, where he dropped off the woman he was carrying before heading back upstairs to assist others. By the time he returned to the 78th floor, he had a bandana around his nose and mouth to protect him from smoke and haze. He found another group of survivors, which included AON Corp. Employee Judy Wein, who worked on the 103rd floor and was in pain from a broken arm, cracked ribs and a punctured lung. According to Wein, Crowther assisted in putting out fires and administering first aid. He then announced to that group, [...] "Everyone who can stand, stand now. If you can help others, do so." [...] He directed this group downstairs as well. [...] "If he hadn't come back, I wouldn't have made it," [...] said Wein. [...] "People can live 100 years and not have the compassion, the wherewithal to do what he did." [...] As occupants of the Tower headed for the street, Crowther turned around and went back inside multiple times, according to witnesses. He was last seen doing so with members of the FDNY before the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} has 49500 m2 of floor space and is six storeys tall with four basement levels. The centre can house 950 researchers and 1400 students, with both {{wet and dry}} laboratory spaces. The ground and basement levels contain clinical facilities in affiliation with the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. The full-height interior atrium {{is reminiscent of the}} atrium inside the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Having been called the [...] "skeletal system of the building", the atrium features curved balconies and interconnecting sweeping stair cases, serving as the structural expression of the building's purpose. It is the most prominent and noticeable feature of the centre's interior. The curving atrium was designed by architects Francis-Jones Morehen Thorp who collaborated with the Cubic Group responsible for the fabrication and installation of the primary atrium elements. Additionally, it features a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> glazed <b>elevators</b> common in atrium-style buildings.|$|R
40|$|The areas {{visited by}} {{hospital}} staff in internal medicineare often on different floors, with staff making multi-ple trips by stairs or elevator each day. The reasons for choosing {{to take the}} elevator over the stairs include concerns about dyspnea and fatigue, {{and the amount of}} time saved. Although many people feel that taking the elevator saves time, there is little evidence to support this claim. We com-pared travel times for staff taking elevators and stairs in a typi-cal urban hospital. Methods Two male residents (aged 26 and 30 years) and two faculty members (a 56 -year-old woman and a 67 -year-old man) par-ticipated in this study.

50|$|Due to tracks resting at a {{depth of}} 196 ft, Forest Glen is the only station in the system without direct surface access by way of escalators.Instead, there is a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> six {{high-speed}} <b>elevators</b> that travel at a rate of 17 ft/s between the underground station and the surface.In addition, a 20-story staircase exists for emergency use. Because of the lack of escalators, Forest Glen is the only station equipped with smoke doors to protect customers during a train fire and evacuation.Building the tunnels through soft rock close to the surface would have been either very costly or impossible, so engineers decided to dig the tunnels through harder, more solid rock deeper in the ground.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} algorithm for exact calculation and minimization of expected waiting times of all passengers using a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>elevators.</b> The {{dynamics of the}} system are represented by a discrete-state Markov chain embedded in the continuous phase-space diagram of a moving elevator car.

An elevator group scheduler based on this method significantly outperforms a conventional algorithm based on minimization of proxy criteria such as the time needed for all cars to complete their assigned deliveries. For {{a wide variety of}} buildings, ranging from 8 to 30 floors, and with 2 to 8 shafts, our algorithm reduces waiting times up to 70 % in heavy traffic, and exhibits an average waiting-time speed-up of 20 % in a test set of 20, 000 building types and traffic patterns. While the algorithm has greater computational costs than most conventional algorithms, it is linear {{in the size of the}} building and number of shafts, and quadratic in the number of passengers, and is completely within the computational capabilities of currently existing elevator bank control systems...|$|E
500|$|An eastern {{mezzanine}} at Third Avenue, {{along with}} stairwells to the platforms, was partially {{completed in the}} 1980s but not opened {{along with the rest}} of the station. A shaftway, identical to the one on the Lexington Avenue side, contained a single stairway, as well as beams that may have been intended to support escalators. The stairway led up to an upper mezzanine whose street entrance was sealed off. This area was renovated as part of the Second Avenue Subway construction, and the shaftway was demolished. The new entrances under construction for the Second Avenue Subway will add two new staircases, two new escalators, and five new elevators (one elevator from street level to mezzanine, and four elevators from the mezzanine to the platforms). , the new entrances, escalators, and elevators had been completed. The <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> four <b>elevators</b> leads from the Third Avenue mezzanine to both platform levels at the eastern ends of both platforms, replacing the originally planned escalators, as they use the space more effectively. On each platform level, both waiting areas have a piece of the Jean Shin artwork [...] "Elevated." [...] The Third Avenue entrance and mezzanine opened on December 30, 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{neighborhood}} is on a bluff over the Potomac River and the shared rail line into Washington passes through a rock-bored tunnel, Rosslyn is deep — the deepest on the three lines servicing it, {{and one of the}} three deepest in the system, behind only Wheaton and Forest Glen on the Red Line. The upper platform is 97 feet below street level; the lower platform is another 20 feet below that. An escalator ride between the street and mezzanine levels takes about three minutes. It is one of three stations on the Metro with platform-level fare gates and <b>elevators.</b> A new <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> three high-speed <b>elevators</b> and an expanded mezzanine opened officially on October 7, 2013.
