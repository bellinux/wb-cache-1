5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E
5|$|The {{term was}} first used in a {{scientific}} context by Charles Lyell in the third edition (1851) of his book Elements of Geology in relation to missing parts of the geological column, but it was popularized in its present meaning by its appearance on page xi of his book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man of 1863. By {{that time it was}} generally thought {{that the end of the}} last glacial period marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew on new findings in his Antiquity of Man to put the origin of human beings much further back in the deep geological past. Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> beast could be bridged. Lyell's vivid writing fired the public imagination, inspiring Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and Louis Figuier's 1867 second edition of La Terre avant le déluge ("Earth before the Flood"), which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes, in place of the Garden of Eden shown in the 1863 edition.|$|E

The results supported the need for research to examine differences <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women besides examining the differences <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women PFFMs. Of the 20 variables employed in this study, only the money attitude of power/spending differentiated <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women PFFMs but not <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women in general. However, the money attitude of power/spending did differentiate <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women in general when tested individually. The sample consisted of 395 heterosexual couples from two rural counties in Arizona and in California.

40|$|Friendship as {{a virtue}} {{has been an}} {{integral}} part of ethical discussions in philosophy. However, friendships <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women have received little philosophical attention, and women were often denied this form of friendship {{on the basis of their}} sex. It is the intrinsic value placed on the friend, the direct concern for the other's good and a shared pursuit of goods that defines friendship as a virtue and gives it ethical value. This thesis defends the argument that friendship <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women can be a virtue. This defense is achieved through the critical analysis of classical theories about friendship, and the practical application of these theories to selected examples of friendship <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women philosophers. In contrast, philosophical theories that argued friendship <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women were not possible were also evaluated, and the philosophical basis of these theories was questioned. The examination of particular contemporary ethical theories disclosed specific insights into a philosophical conception of friendship. These theories provided a defense of a virtue-based ethics, and the relevance of friendship within such an ethic. The importance of this topic for contemporary ethics is evident. Our current social problems easily attest to a distorted understanding of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women and the re-examination of this relationship has taken on a vital urgency. The conception of friendship as a virtue provides a different perspective from which to view our relations with others, <b>and</b> specifically <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> wome...|$|R

25|$|The Bohemian Reformation {{was not an}} {{internally}} unified {{movement and}} did not remain immutable.

The Bohemian Reformation included particularly the efforts to reform the church before Hus, the Hussite movement (including e.g. Taborites and Orebites), the Unity of the Brethren and Utraquists or Calixtines.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard's {{theological}} work {{focuses on}} Christian ethics, {{the institution of}} the Church, the differences between purely objective proofs of Christianity, the infinite qualitative distinction <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> God, and the individual's subjective relationship to the God-Man Jesus the Christ, which came through faith. Much of his work deals with Christian love. He was extremely critical of the practice of Christianity as a state religion, primarily that of the Church of Denmark.

25|$|Elements of the Zohar {{crept into}} the liturgy of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the {{religious}} poets not only used the allegorism and symbolism of the Zohar in their compositions, but even adopted its style, e.g. the use of erotic terminology to illustrate the relations <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> God. Thus, {{in the language of}} some Jewish poets, the beloved one's curls indicate the mysteries of the Deity; sensuous pleasures, and especially intoxication, typify the highest degree of divine love as ecstatic contemplation; while the wine-room represents merely the state through which the human qualities merge or are exalted into those of God.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Disease {{risk and}} {{incidence}} {{between males and}} females reveal differences, and sex is an important component of any investigation of the determinants of phenotypes or disease etiology. Further striking differences <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women are known, for instance, at the metabolic level. The extent to which <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women vary {{at the level of the}} epigenome, however, is not well documented. DNA methylation is the best known epigenetic mechanism to date. RESULTS: In order to shed light on epigenetic differences, we compared autosomal DNA methylation levels <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women in blood in a large prospective European cohort of 1799 subjects, and replicated our findings in three independent European cohorts. We identified and validated 1184 CpG sites to be differentially methylated <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women and observed that these CpG sites were distributed across all autosomes. We showed that some of the differentially methylated loci also exhibit differential gene expression <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women. Finally, we found that the differentially methylated loci are enriched among imprinted genes, and that their genomic location in the genome is concentrated in CpG island shores. CONCLUSION: Our epigenome-wide association study indicates that differences <b>between</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women are so substantial that they should be considered in design and analyses of future studies...|$|R
25|$|Darwin's freethinking brother Erasmus {{was part}} of this Whig circle and {{a close friend of}} the writer Harriet Martineau, who {{promoted}} the Malthusianism underlying the controversial Whig Poor Law reforms (1834) to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty, which were then being implemented piecemeal in the face of opposition to the new poorhouses. As a Unitarian, Martineau welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, which was promoted by Grant and some medical men but anathema to Darwin's Anglican friends who saw it {{as a threat to the}} social order. Transmutation threatened the essential distinction <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> beast, and implied progressive improvement with the implication that the lower orders could aspire to the privileges of their aristocratic overlords.|$|E
25|$|Fallingwater {{stands as}} one of Wright's {{greatest}} masterpieces both for its dynamism and for its integration with its striking natural surroundings.

Wright's passion for Japanese architecture was strongly reflected in the design of Fallingwater, particularly in the importance of interpenetrating exterior and interior spaces and the strong emphasis placed on harmony <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> nature. Contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando has said of the house,I think Wright learned {{the most important aspect of}} architecture, the treatment of space, from Japanese architecture. When I visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, I found that same sensibility of space. But there was the additional sounds of nature that appealed to me.|$|E
25|$|As Clara Kaiser (1958) has {{indicated}} {{there have been}} numerous philosophical and theoretical influences on the development of social group work. Chief amongst these influences are the ethics of Judeo-Christian religions; the settlement house movement's charitable and humanitarian efforts; theories eminent in progressive education, especially those of John Dewey (1910); sociological theories {{about the nature of the}} relationship <b>between</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> society, i.e. Mead (1934); the democratic ethic articulated by early social philosophers; the psychoanalytic theories of Rank and Freud; the practice wisdom, theory building, educational and research efforts of early social group workers (Alissi, 1980; Kaiser, 1958; Wilson, 1976). Early theoretical, research and practice efforts of Grace Coyle (1930, 1935, 1937, 1947, 1948), Wilber Newstetter (1935), and Neva Boyd (1935) paved the way for the advancement and development of social group work.|$|E
