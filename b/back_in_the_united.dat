5|$|Mumma arrived <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States in December 1945, and {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships. The Bureau's immediate post war priority was to develop nuclear propulsion for ships. With the Chief of the Bureau, Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, and Captain Paul F. Lee, he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, who were willing to help, but would not offer any fissionable material. The Navy decided to proceed with the design of a nuclear-powered ship.|$|E

5|$|On 5 May 1892, Bennington was {{transferred}} to the South Atlantic Squadron and cruised South American waters until 19 July. Setting out from Bahia, Brazil, the gunboat visited Spanish and Italian ports during the 400thanniversary celebration of Columbus' voyage to the western hemisphere. She concluded the European portion of those festivities on 18 February 1893 when she departed Cadiz, with a replica of Columbus’s caravel Pinta in tow for Cuba. After stops in the Canary Islands, the Netherlands West Indies, and Havana, the gunboat arrived <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States at Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 March.|$|E
5|$|After this, No. 6 Commando was {{put into}} the role of mobile reserve in an effort to {{maintain}} the unit's integrity and spare it from incurring further losses that might render it unable to remain in the line. Nevertheless, throughout March and into April they continued to carry out patrol operations around Goubellat and Ben Arada. Finally, in early April {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the commandos from the fighting in North Africa. Lacking the administrative support and reinforcements of regular infantry units, the unit's strength had fallen to just 150 men and as a result it was no longer considered effective. On 7 April, No. 6 Commando arrived in Algiers, where it remained for two weeks before embarking on HMT Staffordshire on 24 April. After a short voyage, it arrived <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom on 2 May 1943 to begin preparations for the invasion of German-occupied France.|$|E
5|$|Arriving <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States in 1919, {{she began}} to {{undertake}} training and patrol duties, including at one point to the Caribbean {{with a number of}} other U.S. ships. During this year, she also saw a refit in Norfolk Navy Yard where five 5-inch guns were removed and three additional 3-inch/50 caliber AA guns were added, bringing the total to five. The secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch/51 caliber guns. In late 1919, she sailed to the Pacific Ocean and joined the newly formed United States Pacific Fleet. She continued to conduct training and patrol duties in the Pacific until the mid-1930s when she was transferred again to the Atlantic, and began operating out of the North Atlantic, with the exception of several occasional trips to the West Coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|When Cope arrived <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{after his}} tour of Europe in 1878, he had {{nearly two years}} of fossil {{findings}} from Lucas. Among these dinosaurs was Camarasaurus, {{one of the most}} recognizable dinosaur recreations of the time. The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and north to Oregon, where he was amazed at the rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean. In 1879, the United States Congress consolidated the various government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence King as its leader. This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh, an old college friend, as the chief paleontologist. The period of Cope's and Marsh's paleontological digs in the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892, by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources.|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{broke out}} Prince George, {{together}} {{with the rest of}} the squadron, was attached to the Channel Fleet during the early stages of the war. In early 1915, she was dispatched to the Mediterranean for service in the Dardanelles Campaign. She participated in bombardments of Turkish forts and supported the Allied operations at Gallipoli, including the evacuation from the peninsula late in 1915. She spent the remainder of the war <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom, initially as an accommodation ship before being converted to a depot ship for destroyers in 1918 and stationed at Scapa Flow. For this latter role, she was renamed Victorious II before reverting to her original name in 1919. Decommissioned in 1920, she was sold for scrapping to a German company but sank off the Netherlands during transit to Germany.|$|E
5|$|In March, {{the carrier}} loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and {{delivered}} them to Gibraltar on 29 March, {{where they were}} loaded onto Ark Royal and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of 812 Squadron for self-defence. After a brief refit, Argus sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to Ark Royal. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of 800X Squadron were also embarked to protect the ship against the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors that patrolled the Bay of Biscay and the Eastern Atlantic. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.|$|E

Arthur at the White House in Washington, D.C. There were no public or private appearances for the King in New York, only a day at Coney Island. Before leaving the eastern US, the King met with Thomas Edison to have a demonstration of electric lights, and visited Virginia's Fort Monroe. He toured Hampton Normal and Agricultural School, and shopped for horses in Kentucky. The royal party boarded a train to California, where they were house guests of Claus Spreckels at his estate in Aptos (near Santa Cruz), and had {{a few days of}} seeing the sights in the area before sailing back to Hawaii. Kalākaua was successful in jump-starting new immigration, with the first transplants arriving in Hawaii less than a year later. In the years that followed, he began emulating the lifestyles of European royalty with expensive furnishings in Iolani Palace, a public coronation of himself, and a two-week public celebration of his birthday.|$|E

The latter was a lifelong dream project for Spacey, who took on co-writing, directing, co-producing, and starring duties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> biography/musical about Darin's life, career, and relationship with actress Sandra Dee. Facing little interest for <b>backing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, Spacey went to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom and Germany for funding. Almost all of the film was made in Berlin. Spacey provided his own vocals on the Beyond the Sea soundtrack and appeared in several tribute concerts around the time of the film's release. He received mostly positive reviews for his singing, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. However, reviewers criticized the age disparity between Spacey and Darin, noting that Spacey was too old to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during the early stages of the singer's life depicted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|R

50|$|The {{issue of}} consent in BDSM {{has caused a}} {{controversy}} among <b>the</b> BDSM community <b>in</b> some countries, since certain activities (including some kinds of edgeplay) remain unlawful even when consent has been freely given. In such countries, these activities will always be viewed by law enforcement as unlawful when discovered, even though the activities have been entirely private. <b>The</b> Spanner case <b>in</b> England demonstrates <b>the</b> point, where participants in a consensual mutual BDSM play party were arrested. At all stages, the national and European Court ruled against them {{on the basis that}} a person under English law may not give consent to anything more than minor injury. Interested people may think that private mutual activities should not be the subject of law as a matter of public policy, a view which has some legal <b>backing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States from <b>the</b> case of Lawrence v.
