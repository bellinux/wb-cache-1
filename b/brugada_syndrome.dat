40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Recent {{progress}} in molecular biology {{led to the}} identification of the genes involved in various cardiac arrhythmias causing syncope and sudden death in young people. EXEGESIS: This article briefly describes the clinical features and the genes associated with the congenital long QT syndrome, the short QT <b>syndrome,</b> <b>Brugada's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardias and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. CONCLUSION: Identification of genetic variations that cause cardiac tachyarrhythmias can help to identify at risk-patients and to propose clinical follow-up and preventive therapy. Further studies are needed to discover other cardiac genetic disorders and to understand cellular mechanisms involved in these diseases...|$|R
25|$|Idiopathic {{ventricular}} fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1% {{of all cases}} of out-of-hospital arrest, as well as 3%-9% of the cases of {{ventricular fibrillation}} unrelated to myocardial infarction, and 14% of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients {{under the age of}} 40. It follows then that, {{on the basis of the}} fact that ventricular fibrillation itself is common, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality. Recently described syndromes such as the <b>Brugada</b> <b>Syndrome</b> may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias. In the <b>Brugada</b> <b>syndrome,</b> changes may be found in the resting ECG with evidence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ST elevation in the chest leads V1-V3, with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} {{can occur}} due to coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, <b>Brugada</b> <b>syndrome,</b> long QT syndrome, electric shock, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing irregular unformed QRS complexes without any clear P waves. An important differential diagnosis is torsades de pointes.|$|E
25|$|Familial {{conditions}} that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and {{sudden cardiac death}} are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels.

40|$|Inherited arrhythmic {{disorders}} {{comprise a}} group of syndromes with unique genetic abnormalities and presentations but with very similar clinical outcomes and complications, the most terrifying of which are life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Advances in molecular biology have enabled us to define and pinpoint many such disorders, which were previously labeled as idiopathic, to specific genes on various chromosomes. The current trend {{in the management of}} these potentially deadly disorders is to use pharmacotherapy (antiarrhythmic agents) and defibrillators for the prevention of sudden death; however, targeted therapy at a molecular level appears to be the path of the future. Herein, we review long QT and <b>Brugada</b> <b>syndromes</b> and focus on the genetics, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations of these inherited arrhythmogenic disorders that affect patients with structurally normal hearts...|$|R
40|$|Arrhythmogenic {{disorders}} {{of genetic}} origin include structural cardiomyopathies and inherited arrhythmic syndromes(1). Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is listed among the former, {{since it is}} characterized by structural and functional abnormalities of the right ventricle (RV), ranging from regional wall motion abnormalities and ventricular aneurysms, to global ventricular dilation and dysfunction, with or without left ventricular (LV) involvement(2 - 4). The clinical picture is usually dominated by ventricular arrhythmias, even at risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young people during effort(5 - 7), thus justifying the adjective "arrhythmogenic". However, it has been recently emphasized {{that in the early}} stages (concealed phase) the disease can resemble ion channel diseases, such as long QT and <b>Brugada</b> <b>syndromes,</b> since it can carry the risk of ventricular arrhythmias before the onset of overt structural abnormalities. Thus, early diagnosis and risk stratification pose major clinical challenges along the natural history of ARV...|$|R
40|$|Early repolarization is a well-described, common electrocardiographic variant.

The odds of early repolarization change being associated with poor outcomes are still exceedingly small. Nevertheless, the association of a fairly ubiquitous ECG finding with fatal or near fatal clinical outcomes has raised concern. How can we identify the truly high-risk patients? If a patient has a significant clinical event with a concerning ECG repolarization pattern, what should be done next?

25|$|At the Walford In Bloom competition, {{there is}} a gas {{explosion}} and Martin is panicked when he cannot find Stacey and hits a police officer, resulting in two weeks imprisonment. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, he is diagnosed with <b>Brugada</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> which is hereditary. Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex {{about the possibility of}} Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. After Stacey misses Lily's dance show, she tells Lily about Arthur's condition. Stacey is annoyed with Whitney when she takes Lily and Arthur for breakfast and Lily is fed up of being ignored by an exhausted Stacey. When Lily refuses to eat her tea, Stacey physically takes Lily to go upstairs in the presence of Carmel, who refuses to leave Stacey with Lily and Arthur. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells her sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back. Social worker Fiona Payne (Sandra James-Young) tells Stacey and Martin she will be conducting further home visits. Lily tells Stacey and Martin that she injured Arthur. After speaking with Lily, Fiona tells Stacey and Martin that Lily feels pushed out with Arthur and is anxious about the new baby. Kush and Carmel admit Carmel called social services, enraging Stacey, who bans them both from seeing Arthur before suffering an eclamptic seizure. She is taken to hospital, where her and Martin are told her baby will have to be delivered prematurely {{due to a lack of}} oxygen. The baby is delivered, though Martin is told that there are complications. Stacey goes to see her daughter, but changes her mind and snaps at Martin for allowing Carmel to look after Lily. Stacey later sees her daughter. Stacey and Martin's daughter is put on a ventilator. Stacey grows annoyed at Martin suggesting baby names, but confides in Max about her feelings. Stacey apologises to Martin and they name their daughter Hope.|$|E
40|$|Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} {{underlie the}} rapid regenerative upstroke of action potentials and are modulated by cytoplasmic calcium ions through a poorly understood mechanism. We describe the 1. 35 Å crystal structure of Ca 2 +-bound calmodulin (Ca 2 +/CaM) in complex with the inactivation gate (DIII-IV linker) of the cardiac sodium channel (NaV 1. 5). The complex harbors {{the positions of}} five disease mutations involved with long Q-T type 3 and <b>Brugada</b> <b>syndromes.</b> In conjunction with isothermal titration calorimetry, we identify unique inactivation-gate mutations that enhance or diminish Ca 2 +/CaM binding, which, in turn, sensitize or abolish Ca 2 + regulation of full-length channels in electrophysiological experiments. Additional biochemical experiments support a model whereby a single Ca 2 +/CaM bridges the C-terminal IQ motif to the DIII-IV linker via individual N and C lobes, respectively. The data suggest that Ca 2 +/CaM destabilizes binding of the inactivation gate to its receptor, thus biasing inactivation toward more depolarized potentials...|$|R
40|$|Sudden {{cardiac death}} {{exhibits}} diurnal variation in both acquired and hereditary forms of heart disease, but the molecular {{basis of this}} variation is unknown. A common mechanism that underlies susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias is abnormalities in the duration (for example, short or long QT syndromes and heart failure) or pattern (for example, <b>Brugada’s</b> <b>syndrome)</b> 6 of myocardial repolarization. Here we provide molecular evidence that links circadian rhythms to vulnerability in ventricular arrhythmias in mice. Specifically, we show that cardiac ion-channel expression and QT-interval duration (an index of myocardial repolarization) exhibit endogenous circadian rhythmicity {{under the control of}} a clock-dependent oscillator, krüppel-like factor 15 (Klf 15). Klf 15 transcriptionally controls rhythmic expression of Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (KChIP 2), a critical subunit required for generating the transient outward potassium current. Deficiency or excess of Klf 15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repolarization and enhanced susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias. These findings identify circadian transcription of ion channels as a mechanism for cardiac arrhythmogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} {{in our understanding}} {{of the role of the}} autonomic nervous system in the development of cardiac arrhythmias is reviewed. Our focus is on the translation of basic principles of neural control of heart rhythm that have emerged from experimental studies to clinical applications. Recent studies have made significant strides in defining the function of intrinsic cardiac innervation and the importance of nerve sprouting in electrical remodeling. A recurring theme is that heterogeneity of sympathetic innervation in response to injury is highly arrhythmogenic In addition, both sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on ion channel activity have been found accentuate electrical heterogeneities and thus to contribute to arrhythmogenesis in the long QT and <b>Brugada</b> <b>syndromes.</b> In the clinic, heart rate variability continues to be a useful tool in delineating pathophysiologic changes that result from the progression of heart disease and the impact of diabetic neuropathy. Heart rate turbulence, a noninvasive indicator of baroreceptor sensitivity has emerged as a simple, practical tool to assess risk for cardiovascular mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease and heart failure. Evidence of the proarrhythmic influence of behavioral stress has been further bolstered by defibrillator discharge studies and ambulatory ECG-based T-wave alternans measurement. In summary, the results of recent investigations underscore the importance of the autonomic influences as triggers of arrhythmia and provide important mechanistic insights into the ionic and cellular mechanisms involved...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the {{identification}} of the diverse genetic basis of most important inherited arrhythmia syndromes has remarkably changed our attitude toward these life-threatening diseases.

40|$|Early repolarization, {{involving}} ST-segment elevation and, sometimes, prominent J {{waves at}} the QRS-ST junction, {{has been considered}} a normal electrocardiographic variant for over 60 years.

Epidemiological evidence indicates a dose effect for the risk of cardiac and sudden death with the extent of J-point elevation. This paper reviews present knowledge regarding the epidemiology, presentation, therapeutic response, and mechanisms characteristic of early repolarization. We highlight major unanswered questions relating to our limited ability to determine which individuals with this common electrocardiographic variant {{are at risk for}} sudden death, our incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms, the inadequate information regarding genetic determinants and therapeutic responses, and the unclear relationship between early repolarization and other conditions involving accelerated repolarization and sudden arrhythmic death such as <b>Brugada</b> and short-QT <b>syndromes.</b> This review paper intends to inform the practicing physician about important clinical issues and to stimulate investigators to address the many unresolved questions in this rapidly evolving field...|$|R

40|$|The {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} {{plays an important role}} in the modulation of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmo-genesis. The mechanisms by which autonomic activation is arrhythmogenic or antiarrhythmic are complex and different for specific arrhythmias. In atrial fibrillation, simultaneous sympathetic and parasympathetic activations are the most common trigger. In contrast, in ventricular fibrillation in the setting of cardiac ischemia, sympathetic activation is proar-rhythmic, whereas parasympathetic activation is antiarrhythmic. In inherited arrhythmia syndromes, sympathetic stimulation precipitates ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death except in <b>Brugada</b> and J-wave <b>syndromes</b> where it can prevent them. Heart rate variability (an index of myocardial temporal dispersion), analyzed with QT variability index (QTVI), specifics segment of QT interval (QT peak-end) or intra-QT phase spectral coherence, may be considered a possible tool in stratifying the arrhythmic susceptibility in patients at risk of FV and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Moreover, direct nerve activity recordings (stellate ganglion and vagal nerve) in diseased animal models have provided insights into the understanding of the role of cardiac ANS in arrhythmogenesis. The identification of specific autonomic triggers in different arrhythmias has brought the idea of modulating autonomic activities for both preventing and treating these arrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|SADS {{is defined}} as sudden death {{under the age of}} 40 years old in the absence of {{structural}} heart disease. Family screening studies are able to identify a cause in up to 50 % of cases-most commonly long QT <b>syndrome,</b> <b>Brugada</b> and early repolarisation syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia using standard clinical screening investigations including pharmacological challenge testing. These diagnoses may be supported by genetic testing which can aid cascade screening and may help guide management. In the current era it is possible to undertake molecular autopsy provided suitable samples of DNA can be obtained from the proband. With the evolution of rapid sequencing techniques it is possible to sequence the whole exome for candidate genes. This major advance offers the opportunity to identify novel causes of lethal arrhythmia but also poses the challenge of managing the volume of data generated and evaluating variants of unknown significance. The emergence of induced pluripotent stem cell technology could enable evaluation of the electrophysiological relevance of specific ion channel mutations in the proband or their relatives and will potentially enable screening of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation survivors combining genetic and electrophysiological studies in derived myocytes. This also could facilitate the assessment of personalised preventative pharmacological therapies. This review will evaluate the current screening strategies in SADS families, the role of molecular autopsy and genetic testing and the potential applications of molecular and cellular diagnostic strategies on the horizon...|$|R
