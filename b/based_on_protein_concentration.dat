Present study was conducted on Aspergillus niger FTCC 5003 growth profile and models {{that are able to}} describe the growth in SSF using PKC substrate. Due to the difficulties of separating cell biomass quantitatively from the substrate for SSF systems, indirect method for measurement of cell growth during SSF of PKC by Aspergillus niger FTCC 5003 was studied based on the estimation of glucosamine and protein content. Preliminary relationships between glucosamine and protein contents to fungal dry cell weight (D w) were developed using simulated homogenous SSF data using glass beads as support materials. Both glucosamine and protein contents were well correlated to the fungal dry cell weight in SSF on support materials for protein and glucosamine, respectively. The equations obtained were used for the estimation of cell biomass profile during SSF of PKC from the data of glucosamine and protein as growth indicator study. The estimated fungal dry cell weight <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> and Î²-mannanase activity as metabolic activity for microbial growth were well correlated to PKC dry weight which, indicating that both were suitable marker in describing the growth of A. niger FTCC 5003 in this system.

40|$|Diverse {{physiological}} {{processes are}} regulated differentially by Ca 2 + oscillations through the common regulatory hub calmodulin. The capacity of calmodulin to combine specificity with promiscuity {{remains to be}} resolved. Here we propose a mechanism <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the molecular properties of calmodulin, its two domains with separate Ca 2 + binding affinities, and target exchange rates that depend on both target identity and Ca 2 + occupancy. The binding dynamics among Ca 2 + Mg 2 +, calmodulin, and its targets were modeled with mass-action differential equations <b>based</b> <b>on</b> experimentally determined <b>protein</b> <b>concentrations</b> and rate constants. The model predicts that the activation of calcineurin and nitric oxide synthase depends nonmonotonically on Ca 2 +-oscillation frequency. Preferential activation reaches a maximum at a target-specific frequency. Differential activation arises from the accumulation of inactive calmodulin-target intermediate complexes between Ca 2 + transients. Their accumulation provides the system with hysteresis and favors activation of some targets {{at the expense of}} others. The generality of this result was tested by simulating 60 000 networks with two, four, or eight targets with concentrations and rate constants from experimentally determined ranges. Most networks exhibit differential activation that increases in magnitude with the number of targets. Moreover, differential activation increases with decreasing calmodulin concentration due to competition among targets.

A large-scale study, including 99 stations, belonging to 33 transects, was carried out along 250 km of the Apulian coasts (Mediterranean Sea) in March and September 2000. The investigated area covered a wide range of anthropogenic impacts (industrial ports, tourist harbours, areas affected by power plants and industrial wastes, mariculture areas). Other sites, including marine protected areas (i. e., without any apparent impact), were used as 'control'. Water column and benthic parameters provided different indications and classifications of the trophic state of coastal marine systems. We found that phytopigment content of the sediments changed in response to all different sources of anthropogenic impact and resulted in a useful descriptor of the trophic state and environmental quality. Highest sediment chlorophyll-a concentrations, indicating conditions of increasing eutrophication, were found in areas impacted by the discharge of heated waters from a power plant. In particular, the contribution of the autotrophic biomass to the biopolymeric carbon pool appeared to be a good descriptor of the decreasing environmental quality. Independently from the sampling period or the pollution source such contribution was significantly lower in transects subjected to anthropogenic impact than in control areas. Differences in trophic conditions were evident both in terms of quantity (i. e., total organic matter content) and quality (i. e., biochemical composition) of sediment organic matter. In particular, sediment <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> appeared to be a good descriptor of the trophic state of the benthic systems at different spatial scales.

40|$|Apoptosis {{is driven}} by {{positive}} feedback activation between aspartate-specific cysteinyl proteases (caspases). These feedback loops ensure the swift and efficient elimination of cells upon initiation of apoptosis execution. At the same time, the signaling network must be insensitive to erroneous, mild caspase activation to avoid unwanted, excessive cell death. Sublethal caspase activation in fact was {{shown to be a}} requirement for the differentiation of multiple cell types but might also occur accidentally during short, transient cellular stress conditions. Here we carried out an in silico comparison of the molecular mechanisms that so far have been identified to impair the amplification of caspase activities via the caspase- 8, - 3, - 6 loop. In a systems model resembling HeLa cervical cancer cells, the dimerization/dissociation balance of caspase- 8 potently suppressed the amplification of caspase responses, surprisingly outperforming or matching known caspase- 8 and - 3 inhibitors such as bifunctional apoptosis repressor or x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. These findings were further substantiated in global sensitivity analyses <b>based</b> <b>on</b> combinations of <b>protein</b> <b>concentrations</b> from the sub- to superphysiological range to screen the full spectrum of biological variability that can be expected within cell populations and between distinct cell types. Additional modeling showed that the combined effects of x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and caspase- 8 dimerization/dissociation processes can also provide resistance to larger inputs of active caspases. Our study therefore highlights a central and so far underappreciated role of caspase- 8 dimerization/dissociation in avoiding unwanted cell death by lethal amplification of caspase responses via the caspase- 8, - 3, - 6 loop...|$|R

Since, CRP is known to play a role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the serum levels of CRP in periodontitis patients with or without atherosclerosis. Materials and Methods : A total of 45 patients, 15 chronic periodontitis patients with atherosclerosis (Group A), 15 chronic periodontitis patients with no history of any systemic disease (Group B), and 15 clinically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal or systemic disease (Group C) within age range of 30 to 55 years were selected for the study. PI, PBI, PPD, CAL and radiographic marginal alveolar bone level were assessed in all the three groups. CRP levels were assessed with &#x 2032;Turbi-latex&#x 2032; kit using turbidimetric analysis. Results : The mean CAL recorded was 4. 9 mm in group A, 4. 6 mm in group B and 1. 9 mm in group C. The mean radiographic marginal bone level was 45 to 50 &#x 0025; in group A, 45 to 50 &#x 0025; in group B and 90 to 95 &#x 0025; in group C.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to develop a plant protein-based microcapsule capable of carrying, protecting and delivering flaxseed oil within the food and gastrointestinal environment. Specifically, the research aimed to: a) screen a variety of plant proteins and pre-treatment conditions <b>based</b> <b>on</b> their emulsifying properties for use as a wall material; b) develop and optimize encapsulation protocols for entrapping flaxseed oil; and c) study the oxidative stability and delivery of entrapped oils from capsules under different environmental and simulated gastrointestinal conditions. In Chapter 3 and 4, the emulsifying and physicochemical properties of legume and oilseed protein isolates, respectively produced from isoelectric precipitation and salt extraction were investigated. Findings in Chapter 3 indicated that both the legume source and method of production showed significant effects on the emulsifying and physicochemical properties of chickpea (ChPI), faba bean (FbPI), lentil (LPI), pea (PPI), and soy (SPI) protein isolates. The emulsion capacity (EC) values ranged between 476 - 542 g oil/g protein with LPI showing the highest capacity. Isoelectric-precipitated ChPI and LPI displayed higher emulsion activity index (EAI) (~ 46. 2 m 2 /g), (emulsion stability index) ESI (~ 84. 9 min) and (creaming stability) CS (98. 6 %), which were comparable to those of SPI. In Chapter 4, findings indicated that both protein source and method of production had significant effects on the physicochemical and emulsifying properties of canola (CaPI) and flaxseed protein isolates (FlPI). CaPI showed significantly higher EC (~ 515. 6 g oil/g protein) than FlPI (~ 498. 9 g oil/g protein). EAI for FlPI was found to be higher (~ 40. 1 m 2 /g) than CaPI (~ 25. 1 m 2 /g) however, ESI values of CaPI and FlPI were similar. Creaming stability of emulsions stabilized by CaPI and FlPI ranged between 86. 1 and 96. 6 %. CaPI and FlPI were shown to have emulsion forming properties; however their stability was low. In Chapter 5, ChPI and LPI-stabilized emulsions were optimized <b>based</b> <b>on</b> pH, <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> and oil content for their ability to form and stabilize oil-in-water emulsions using response surface methodology. Droplet charge was shown to be only affected by pH, while droplet size and creaming index were affected by <b>protein</b> <b>concentration,</b> oil content and pH. Optimum conditions for minimal creaming (no serum separation after 24 h), small droplet size (40 mV) were identified as: 4. 1 % protein, 40. 0 % oil, and pH 3. 0 or 8. 0, regardless of the plant protein used for emulsion preparation. Flaxseed oil was microencapsulated by freeze (Chapter 6) or spray (Chapter 7) drying employing ChPI or LPI and maltodextrin. Effects of emulsion formulation (oil, protein and maltodextrin levels) and protein source (ChPI vs. LPI) on the physicochemical characteristics, oxidative stability, and release properties of the resulting capsules were investigated. Optimized capsule designs were found to have high encapsulation efficiencies, low surface oil, and afforded protection against oxidation over a 25 d room temperature storage study relative to free oil. Microcapsules were also able to deliver 84. 2 % of the encapsulated oil in the simulated gastrointestinal environments...|$|R

40|$|Most {{membrane}} attack complex-perforin/cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (MACPF/CDC) proteins {{are thought}} to form pores in target membranes by assembling into pre-pore oligomers before undergoing a pre-pore to pore transition. Assembly during pore formation is into both full rings of subunits and incomplete rings (arcs). The balance between arcs and full rings is determined by a mechanism dependent <b>on</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> in which arc pores arise due to kinetic trapping of the pre-pore forms by the depletion of free protein subunits during oligomerisation.

As both chemical and biological factors affect Pb(II) sequestration, when sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) converts sulphate into sulphide, this biological process results in the generation of bicarbonate ions and increases the alkalinity of the medium which in turn provides the favourable conditions for SRB to develop and the sulphide then combines with heavy metal and results in formation of metal sulphide precipitates.|$|R

Since no dependence of j 2 <b>on</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> was observed its values were equated with the corresponding specific volumes at the infinite dilution, v 20. The small {{positive changes in}} v 20 observed in urea and methylurea solutions at the highest denaturant concentration were ascribed to the complete unfolding of a-ctg A while significantly larger positive changes observed in N,N’-dimethylurea and ethylurea solutions were {{explained in terms of}} the incomplete unfolding of a-ctg A into a compact intermediate state...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{properties}} of phosphoglucose isomerases isolated {{from a variety}} of species have been compared by peptide fingerprinting, predicted amino acid sequence homologies and by denaturation and renaturation studies. The enzymes are more readily denatured in guanidinium chloride than in urea, and the isomerase isolated from yeast is more stable toward acid pH than the rabbit muscle enzyme. The rates of guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation are markedly increased by ionic strength and decreased by substrates, competitive inhibitors or glycerol. The enzyme can be renatured, but only in the presence of glycerol. The renaturation process is dependent <b>on</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentration</b> and temperature and provides a method for the formation of mixed species heterodimers...|$|R
