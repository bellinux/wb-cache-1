25|$|In February 2013, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works {{announced}} a new compact fusion machine, the high beta fusion reactor, that {{may be related to}} the <b>biconic</b> cusp and the polywell, and working at Î²=1.|$|E
25|$|According to Bussard, typical cusp {{leakage rate}} {{is such that}} an {{electron}} makes 5 to 8 passes before escaping through a cusp in a standard mirror confinement <b>biconic</b> cusp; 10 to 60 passes in a polywell under mirror confinement (low beta) that he called cusp confinement; and several thousand passes in Wiffle-Ball confinement (high beta).|$|E
25|$|Magnetic mirror: Developed by Richard F. Post {{and teams}} at LLNL in the 1960s. Magnetic mirrors {{reflected}} hot plasma {{back and forth}} in a line. Variations included the Tandem Mirror, magnetic bottle and the <b>biconic</b> cusp. A series of well-funded, large, mirror machines were built by the US government in the 1970s and 1980s, principally at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.|$|E
40|$|Pressure distributions, {{aerodynamic}} coefficients, shock shapes, and oil-flow {{patterns were}} measured on spherically blunted, 12. 84 deg/ 7 deg on-axis and bent <b>biconics</b> at Mach 6 in air. The angle of attack, referenced to {{the axis of}} the aft-cone, was varied from - 10 to 40 deg in nominal 5 deg increments. Predictions from an inviscid flowfield computer code referred to as STEIN and codes which solve the three-dimensional parabolized Navier Stokes (PNS) equations were compared with measurement. Three PNS codes were found which provided accurate predictions of windward and leeward pressure distributions for angles of attack to 25 deg...|$|R
40|$|A method {{based on}} the Parabolized Navier-Stokes {{equations}} {{is used to calculate}} the flow field and heat transfer of lifting entry vehicles. The method is {{based on the}} Bean and Warming implicit algorithm and uses a new procedure for preventing departure solutions. Calculations are carried out for blunt on-axis and bent <b>biconics,</b> assuming a perfect gas and laminar flow, and compared with available heat transfer, surface pressure and shock shape measurements for a range of Mach numbers and angles of attack. In all calculations presented here, the starting solution is obtained from available inviscid and boundary layer codes. Good agreement with experiment is indicated. Thus, the method provides an accurate and rather inexpensive procedure for calculating three-dimensional flows at supersonic Mach numbers...|$|R
40|$|Laminar heat-transfer {{rates were}} {{measured}} on spherically blunted, 13 degrees/F degrees on-axis and bent <b>biconics</b> (fore cone bent 7 degrees upward relative to aft cone) at hypersonic-hypervelocity flow {{conditions in the}} Langley Expansion Tube. Freestream velocities from 4. 5 to 6. 9 km/sec and Mach numbers from 6 to 9 were generated using helium, nitrogen, air, and carbon dioxide test gases, resulting in normal shock density ratios from 4 to 19. Angle of attack, referenced to the axis of the aft cone, was varied from zero to 20 degrees in 4 degree increments. The effect of nose bend, angle of attack, and real-gas phenomena on heating distributions are presented along with comparisons of measurement to prediction from a code which solves the three-dimensional 'parabolized Navier-Stokes' equations...|$|R
25|$|The polywell {{is a type}} {{of nuclear}} fusion reactor that uses an {{electric}} field to heat ions to fusion conditions. It is closely related to the fusor, the high beta fusion reactor, the magnetic mirror, and the <b>biconic</b> cusp. A set of electromagnets generates a magnetic field that traps electrons. This creates a negative voltage, which attracts positive ions. As the ions accelerate towards the negative center, their kinetic energy rises. Ions that collide at high enough energies can fuse.|$|E
25|$|A May 2010 paper {{discussed}} a small device's ability to capture electrons. The paper posited that the machine had an ideal magnetic field strength that maximized {{its ability to}} catch electrons. The paper analyzed magnetic confinement in the polywell using analytical solutions and simulations. The work linked the magnetic confinement in the polywell to magnetic mirror theory. The 2011 work used Particle-in-cell simulations to model particle motion in polywells with a small electron population. Electrons behaved {{in a similar manner}} to particles in the <b>biconic</b> cusp.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic Mirror One {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement {{is with the}} magnetic mirror effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices that try to use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, which {{was a series of}} large, expensive devices built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from the 1960s to mid 1980s. Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and <b>Biconic</b> cusp. Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second direct conversion energy capture, was easier to implement. As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.|$|E
40|$|Laminar heat {{transfer}} rates were measured on spherically blunted, 13 deg/ 7 deg on axis and bent <b>biconics</b> (fore cone bent 7 deg upward relative to aft cone) at hypersonic hypervelocity flow {{conditions in the}} Langley Expansion Tube. Freestream velocities from 4. 5 to 6. 9 km/sec and Mach numbers from 6 to 9 were generated using helium, nitrogen, air, and carbon dioxide test gases, resulting in normal shock density ratios from 4 to 19. Angle of attack, referenced to the axis of the aft cone, was varied from 0 to 20 deg in 4 deg increments. The effect of nose bend, angle of attack, and real gas phenomena on heating distributions are presented along with comparisons of measurement to prediction from a code which solves the three dimensional parabolized Navier-Stokes equations...|$|R
40|$|Previous work by {{our group}} {{has shown that}} an aerogravity assist {{maneuver}} at the moon Triton {{might be used to}} capture a spacecraft into a closed orbit about Neptune if a nominal atmospheric density profile at Triton is assumed. The present study extends that work and examines the impact of atmospheric dispersions, especially important in light of the very low density and large degree of uncertainty of Triton s atmosphere. Additional variables that are analyzed in the current study include ballute size and cut time and variations in the final target orbit. Results indicate that while blunt-body, rigid aeroshells penetrate too closely to the surface to be practical, ballutes of modest size show promise for this maneuver. Future studies will examine the application of inflatable aeroshells and rigid aeroshells with higher lift-to-drag ratios such as <b>biconics</b> and lifting bodies...|$|R
40|$|Hypersonic flows over {{straight}} and bent <b>biconics</b> are calculated {{for a range}} of freestream conditions in which the gas behind the shock is treated as either perfect or real. The Parabolized-Navier-Stokes (PNS) equations form the basis of the approximation scheme. Good comparisons with experimental data for pressures, forces and moments, heat transfer, and oil-flow patterns serve to validate the perfect-gas version of the code. Circumferential velocity vector plots further aid in the interpretation of leeside oil-flow patterns. A variable-effective-gamma (VEG) option is implemented for the real-gas calculations. Gamma, now defined as the ratio of enthalpy to internal energy, is determined from a locally valid linear relation in enthalpy and pressure at every mesh point which in turn is calculated from a benchmark equilibrium code. The VEG option is easily incorporated into a host PNS code because it uses the underlying perfect-gas structure of the code. Comparisons to experimental data for heat transfer and shock shape in high enthalpy air have been obtained using the VEG option...|$|R
500|$|The {{shells of}} {{juvenile}} queen conches are strikingly different in appearance {{from those of}} the adults. Noticeable is the complete absence of a flared outer lip; juvenile shells have a simple sharp lip, which gives the shell a conical or <b>biconic</b> outline. In Florida, juvenile queen conches are known as [...] "rollers", because wave action very easily rolls their shells, whereas it is nearly impossible to roll an adult specimen, due to its shell's weight and asymmetric profile. Subadult shells have a thin flared lip that continues to increase in thickness until death.|$|E
50|$|If one of {{the poles}} in the {{magnetic}} bottle is reversed, it becomes a <b>biconic</b> cusp, which can also hold charged particles. <b>Biconic</b> cusps were first studied by Harold Grad at the Courant Institute, studies reveal the presence {{of different types of}} particles inside a <b>biconic</b> cusp.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>biconic</b> is a sphere-cone with an {{additional}} frustum attached. The <b>biconic</b> offers a significantly improved L/D ratio. A <b>biconic</b> designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM. The higher L/D makes a <b>biconic</b> shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration. Arguably, the most significant <b>biconic</b> ever flown was the Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (AMaRV). Four AMaRVs {{were made by the}} McDonnell-Douglas Corp. and represented a significant leap in RV sophistication. Three AMaRVs were launched by Minuteman-1 ICBMs on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981. AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470 kg, a nose radius of 2.34 cm, a forward frustum half-angle of 10.4Â°, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6 cm, aft frustum half angle of 6Â°, and an axial length of 2.079 meters. No accurate diagram or picture of AMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature. However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.AMaRV's attitude was controlled through a split body flap (also called a [...] "split-windward flap") along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicle's sides. Hydraulic actuation was used for controlling the flaps. AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading anti-ballistic missile (ABM) interception. The McDonnell Douglas DC-X (also a <b>biconic)</b> was essentially a scaled-up version of AMaRV. AMaRV and the DC-X also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the Lockheed Martin X-33.|$|E
