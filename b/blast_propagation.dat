40|$|There is {{a demand}} for reliable, fast and easy-to-use {{simulation}} tools {{for the analysis of}} blast effects in urban environments. Most existing easy-to-use tools for this purpose are based on simplified calculation models, which limit their accuracy and/or their flexibility. General-purpose hydrocodes offer both accuracy and flexibility in application, they are however difficult to use and require long calculation times. Given this situation we have developed a fast and precise solver specifically for the simulation of <b>blast</b> <b>propagation</b> in urban scenarios. The method allows the simulation of <b>blast</b> <b>propagation</b> outside and inside of one or more buildings and can be coupled to damage models for the assessment of blast effects. An automated calculation setup makes the tool easy to use. The solver implements a first principles calculation, using an explicit finite volume scheme with Cartesian grids and automatic mesh refinement (AMR). The tool includes a 1 D multi-fluid method for the calculation of the initially spherical detonation, which provides the initial blast wave for the subsequent three-dimensional simulation phase. The computational domain is set up automatically based on the scenario information. The first version of this tool has been introduced in a previous contribution [1].

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to understand the <b>blast</b> <b>propagation</b> into the human skull and brain causing mTBI and use this knowledge for enabling design of effective protection measures against them. A shock tube including sensor system was optimized to simulate realistic IED blast profiles obtained from full scale field tests. Shock tube experiments and numerical simulations are combined in order to gain confidence in the measure devices (i. e. pressure, strain gages, etc) and understand the mechanisms of wave propagation in air and simplified ‘head’ surrogate. A cube and a sphere containing gelatin (brain simulant) are used for this purpose. The shock tube experiments are used as a reference to validate the numerical simulations combining a CFD (computations fluid dynamics) model of the air and a finite element model of the simplified ‘head’ surrogate. An accurate IED shock tube pressure-time profile depends on the dimensions of tube and driving unit and is highly sensitive to the exact location in the tube. The validity of the results depends on an accurate material characterization in the highly dynamic blast loading rate.

40|$|Accurate {{characterisation}} of blast loading on intricate structural components is {{a challenging}} task. This paper reports experimental results {{pertaining to the}} effects of planar long-duration blast waves interacting with exposed I-shape steel sections about multiple axes. Long-duration blasts are defined by a positive phase duration t+> 100 ms, characteristic of very large explosion events in the far field. These can result in significantly large impulses and dynamic pressures. Multi-axis long-duration blast interaction with intricate I-sections gives rise to rapid blast diffraction and translational drag loading effects which are complex to characterise, generally requiring approximation using crude drag coefficients. Blast drag coefficients available in literature lack provision for multi-axis interaction with I-shape geometries. Four full-scale long-duration blast experiments investigate the blast interaction with an I-shape column as a function of section orientation with respect to the incident shock wave. High-fidelity pressure instrumentation record coupled incident and reflected surface blast parameters. It was found that constituent surface specific impulse varied with section orientation due to relative exposure to the blast and local shielding aerodynamic effects. Results demonstrate that I-section orientation with respect to <b>blast</b> <b>propagation</b> has significant influence on the resultant translational loading. Experimental drag force coefficients as a function of section orientation are calculated from experimental data and compared to values proposed in literature providing conclusions of direct relevance to both design practitioners and academics...|$|E

The <b>blast</b> wave <b>propagation</b> of an explosive detonation can cause disastrous damage on the buildings, vehicles and also injuries to vehicle occupants.

Repeated shock tube tests were conducted on a surrogate head, i. e., water-filled polycarbonate shell.

A numerical model was developed to capture the shock wave propagation within the shock tube and the fluid-structure interaction between the shock wave and the surrogate head. The obtained numerical results were compared with the experimental measurements. The experiment-validated numerical model was then used to further understand the wave transmission mechanisms from the blast to the surrogate head, including the flow field around the head, structural response of the skull simulant, and pressure distributions inside the brain simulant.

40|$|Iconic and {{significant}} buildings are the common target of bombings by terrorists causing {{large numbers of}} casualties and extensive property damage. Recent incidents were external bomb attacks on multi-storey buildings with reinforced concrete frames. Under a blast load circumstance, crucial damage initiates at low level storeys in a building and may then lead to a progressive collapse of whole {{or part of the}} structure. It is therefore important to identify the critical initial influence regions along the height, width and depth of the building exposed to blast effects and the structure response in order to assess the vulnerability of the structure to disproportionate and progressive collapse. This paper discusses the blast response and the propagation of its effects on a two dimensional reinforced concrete (RC) frame, designed to withstand normal gravity loads. The explicit finite element code, LS DYNA is used for the analysis. A complete RC portal frame seven storeys by six bays is modelled with reinforcement details and appropriate materials to simulate strain rate effects. Explosion loads derived from standard manuals are applied as idealized triangular pressures on the column faces of the numerical models. The analysis reports the influence of <b>blast</b> <b>propagation</b> as displacements and material yielding of the structural elements in the RC frame.

40|$|Terrorist {{attacks are}} usually {{committed}} {{in urban areas}} where the expanding blast encounters many obstacles during its propagation. The blast loading on buildings {{and people in the}} neighbourhood of an attacked building will be determined by the interaction of the blast wave with surrounding buildings, which may lead to relatively lower overpressures when blast shielding occurs or higher overpressures when blast focussing occurs. Within the framework of a practical research, TNO has charted the influence of the urban area on the <b>blast</b> <b>propagation.</b> The problem has been approached by defining several explosion scenarios and configurations of streets, and calculating the blast loading at an assumed building at some distance. The environmental aspects were the subject of study and were changed in each scenario. The explosion charge and distance were kept constant. The calculations were done with both, semi-empirical tools and with a numerical code, i. e. the in-house developed BLAST 3 D code. The study resulted in a range of blast loads, which are relevant for a building at some distance (150 m) of an exploding charge of 1000 kg. The scenarios range from densely built-up districts with small streets and low to intermediate buildings to spaciously built-up areas with wide streets and high buildings. In addition, the vulnerability of some typical structural elements of normal urban buildings has also been charted. The two surveys together give a tool to estimate the damage that can be expected from an explosion in an urban area...|$|E

Presently, however, other types of models are available which {{do not have the}} fundamental objections TNT Equivalency models have. TNO Multi-Energy method is increasingly accepted as a more reasonable alternative {{to be used as a}} simple and practical method. Computer codes based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) like AutoReaGas, developed by TNO and Century Dynamics, could be used also in case a more rigorous analysis is required. Application of the Multi-Energy method requires knowledge of two parameters describing the explosion: a charge size and a charge strength. During the last years, research has led to an improved determination of the charge strength (i. e., the class number or source overpressure) to be chosen to apply the blast charts. A correlation has been derived relating the charge strength to a set of parameters describing the boundary conditions of the flammable cloud and the fuel in the cloud. A simple approach may not be satisfactory in all situations. The overpressure distribution inside a vapour cloud explosion is generally not homogeneous and the presence of obstructions causes directional <b>blast</b> <b>propagation</b> in the near field. A CFD approach, in which the actual situation is modeled, supplies case-specific results. An overview of the key aspects relevant to the application of the Multi-Energy method and CFD modeling is provided.

40|$|TNO is {{developing}} a flexible blast effects module suited {{to be used in}} simulations of MOUT scenarios. The aim of the module is to fill the gap between semi-empirical free-air blast relations (with a lower fidel-ity and complexity) and CFD (with larger computational efforts). The module is suited for vulnerabil-ity/lethality (V/L) assessments and is implemented in the V/L TARVAC simulation suite. The TNO blast effects module consists of the BeamBlast model and response models. BeamBlast in-cludes an engineering level path-based <b>blast</b> <b>propagation</b> model, that has proven to be robust (capable of complex geometries) and fast (results within seconds or minutes). Once a set of paths is found, a blast loading model calculates from the set of blast paths a combined pressure time graph. The blast-path model looks for paths around a free triangle-based geometry that agree to the gas-dynamics law concerning diffractions and different kinds of reflections. The user has flexibility with specifying the recursion depth of the algorithm, which strongly influences the completeness of the result-ing set of paths. If the scenario involves an indoor explosion, the recursion number is usually required to be high; an outdoor scenario does not, but may involve more complex geometry. The algorithms find all paths, within the given recursion depth, that lead from the source to the observer. In many cases, there will be multiple diffraction paths around the same object. This is in contrast with Dijkstra-based path-finding algorithms, which find only the approximate shortest route. Furthermore, the paths are not dependent on nodes, but follow the shortest path around corners, which increases the accu-racy of the path length and angles involved. This paper explains the algorithms involved, shows a few early performance indicators, and describes the current developments for improvement...|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Blast barrier walls have been shown to reduce the blast load on structures in most scenarios. Analysis of existing data for blast barrier response reveals that a need exists to determine the bounds of the problem and produce a fast-running accurate model for the effects of barrier walls on blast wave propagation. Since blast experiments are very time intensive and extremely cost prohibitive, it is vital that computational capabilities be developed to generate the required data set that can be utilized to produce simplified design tools. The combination of high fidelity first principles model-based simulation with artificial neural network techniques for providing solutions to blast barrier problems results in a very effective means to tackle the challenging problem. A review of current methods of modeling blast wave propagation identifies a need for a modeling approach that is both fast and versatile in its scope for application. Artificial neural network approaches to modeling the propagation of blast waves in a built-up environment are developed. A comprehensive study of numerical simulation approaches for modeling <b>blast</b> <b>propagation</b> is presented and applied to populating data for blast barrier site configurations. The proposed approach is demonstrated to estimate the peak pressure, impulse, time of arrival, and time of duration of blast loads on buildings protected by simple barriers, using data generated from validated computational hydrocode simulations.

Anti-Vehicle (AV) mines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED's) are capable of inflecting damage to heavy vehicles. For the last decades, numerical simulation of <b>blast</b> wave <b>propagation</b> and its interaction with surrounding structures becomes more and more the focus of computational engineering, since experimental tests are very expensive and time consuming. This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation of <b>blast</b> wave <b>propagation</b> in air, using an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) multi-material formulation developed in LS-DYNA with the contribution of the first author. To accurately capture peak pressure values of the shock wave, a very fine mesh, in the explosive material and the surrounding air mesh, is needed. For three dimensional problems, this condition leads to large size problems that can be CPU time consuming and not appropriate to run several times for engineering design purposes and structure analysis to resist blast loading. In order to calibrate numerical models to experimental data, using reasonable fine mesh, explosive masse scaling is used in this paper. Good correlations in terms of pressure and impulse between numerical results and experimental data were obtained when using the right combination of solution parameters and multiplying the explosive mass by an appropriate scaling factor. This procedure is commonly used in defence industry for structural design and to avoid running large scale problems...|$|R

Based on the used mathematical model and algorithm the applied programs in programming langvige DELFI which allows conducting the calculation of seismic stability of protected object for the specific conditions of the explosion with the possibility of rapid adjustment of blasting parameters ware developed. ??????????? ?? ????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ??????????? ???? ?? ????????????? 05. 15. 09 ? ?????????????? ? ?????? ????????. ? ???????? ????????????? ???????????? ???????? ???? ???????, ????, 2015. ??????????????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????- ??????????? ??????, ????????? ? ???????????? ??????????????? ??????????????? ?????????????? ???? ? ????????? ??????? ? ?? ?????????????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?????????, ??????-????????????, ?????????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ?????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ?? ?????? ?????????? ?????????????. ????????? ????????? ?????????, ??????? ? ?????????? ????????? ? ?????? ???????? ???????? ?????. ?????? ????? ???????????? ????????????????? ??????? ???????? ????????????????? ??????. ??? ????????? ?????? ????? ????? ???????????? ? ???????? ???????????? ??????????????? ? ???????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ???? ??? ??????????? ?????????, ? ? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? - ? ?????????????? ???????????????? ?????? ????????????. ? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ???? ? ?? ? ? ????????? ??????? ?? ??????? ? ?????????? ?? ????????? ?????? ? ?????? ??????-???????????? ??????? ?????? ? ????????????? ????????????? ??. ???????? ????????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ? ????????? ?? ?????????????? ??????????. ??-?? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ???? ? ??????? ? ??????? ????? ?????? ????????????? ????????? ???????????? ??? ???? ???????? ? ???? ????????? ???????, ??????? ????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ? ??????????? ??????? ??? ???? ???? ???, ? ????? ??? ????????? ????? ??????? ? ????????, ????? ? ??????????, ??? ??????????? ???, ??? ? ??????? ???? ?????????? ???????????? ???????????? ??????, ? ? ??????? - ???????. ???????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ???? ? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ???? ??? ?????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ?????? ??????-???????????? ??????? ?????, ????????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????, ?????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????, ?????????? ????? ???? ? ??????????????????? ?????????. ??? ???? ???????????, ??? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ??????, ??? ?????????????? ?????????????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????. ?????? ?????????? ???? ??????????????????? ????????? ? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ???????????? ????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ? ????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????. ??????????? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????-????????? ????????????? ???????? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ???????????? ????? ?? ?????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ?????? ?????????, ??????-????????????, ??????????? ? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????????? ????????? ? ??????????. ????????, ??? ? ??????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ??? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????-????????? ????????????? ????????? ??? ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????. ??? ??????????? ??????? ?????, ????????, ????? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ????????? ?????????? ?????. ?? ????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ?????????? ????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ????? ????????????????

It uses the Arbitrary Lagrange Euler coupling formulation with proper state material parameters and equations. <b>Blast</b> wave <b>propagation</b> in soil, horizontal pile deformation and pile damage are presented to facilitate failure evaluation of piles. Effects of end restraint of pile head and the number and spacing of piles within a group on their blast response and potential failure are investigated. The techniques developed and applied in this paper and its findings provide valuable information on the blast response and failure evaluation of piles and will provide guidance in their future analysis and design...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{guidelines}} for protecting against and mitigating explosion hazards require knowledge and either the experimental or theoretical evaluation of blast wave parameters. To this end, this article proposes a numerical method for simulating <b>blast</b> wave <b>propagation</b> in complex geometries. This method permits an on-the-ground TNT-like explosion {{and the subsequent}} blast wave to be simulated, {{with the possibility of}} modifying the ground topology by adding a number of obstacles. The numerical model is explored from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view by comparing it to experimental data, with a correct determination of the wave amplitude and phase signature at different key-positions. The pressure and Mach number distributions deduced from simulations in complex congested areas highlight various fluidsolid interactions, such as regular reflections and diffractions. The iso-damage diagrams of different obstacle layouts are also presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{reflection}} of a blast wave from a C 4 charge detonated above a planar surface is simulated with our ALE 3 D code. We used a finely-resolved, fixed Eulerian 2 -D mesh (167 {micro}m per cell) to capture the detonation of the charge, the <b>blast</b> wave <b>propagation</b> in nitrogen, and its reflection from the surface. The thermodynamic properties of the detonation products and nitrogen were specified by the Cheetah code. A programmed-burn model was used to detonate the charge at a rate based on measured detonation velocities. Computed pressure histories are compared with pressures measured by Kistler 603 B piezoelectric gauges at 8 ranges (GR = 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12 inches) along the reflecting surface. Computed and measured waveforms and positive-phase impulses were similar, except at close-in ranges (GR < 2 inches), which were dominated by jetting effects...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experimental}} investigations {{reported in}} the open literature have indicated that the application of reduced pressures of air (within a closed vessel) carrying detonation-induced blast waves can substantially reduce the intensity of blast loading experienced by the target test-structure (placed inside the vessel). To examine the feasibility and potential of this air-vacation concept in protecting target structure/personnel under more realistic combat-theatre conditions, the use of air-vacated buffers {{placed in front of}} the target structure is investigated in the present work. Towards that end, advanced fluid-structure interaction, non-linear dynamics, finite-element analyses are carried out on the phenomena and processes accompanying <b>blast</b> wave generation, <b>propagation</b> and interaction with air/buffer and buffer/target-structure interfaces. To verify and validate the employed computational methods and tools, it was first shown that they can quite accurately reproduce analytical solutions for a couple of well-defined <b>blast</b> wave <b>propagation</b> and interaction problems. To quantify the blast/mitigation efficiency of the air-vacated buffer concept, two metrics are utilized: (a) the peak pressure experienced by the target structure; and (b) the total momentum/impulse transferred by the incident blast wave to the target structure. The results obtained clearly revealed that significant blast-mitigation effects can be achieved through the use of the air-vacated buffer concept and that the extent of the blast-mitigation effect is a sensitive function of the buffer geometrical and vacated-air material-state parameters (e. g., pressure, mass density, etc.). It has also been shown that, in order to fully exploit the air-vacated buffer concept, timely deployment of the buffer is very critical...|$|R
