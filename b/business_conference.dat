25|$|Sondhi {{expanded}} and diversified widely. He owned {{a hotel in}} China’s Yunnan province, ran a cement factory in Vietnam, {{and set up a}} regional <b>business</b> <b>conference</b> company.

Sondhi himself kept few direct holdings in any of the companies, but was ultimately in control through his ownership of holding companies like M Group and other holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands. Such a structure minimized Sondhi's tax bill and provided maximum protection in case of financial difficulties.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{also noted}} that the {{potential}} for interracial conflict remained unexplored; Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "The movie wants to tease us with intimations of a steamy biracial liaison; it just doesn't want to actually go there." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe was disappointed that [...] "Obsessed basically plays it safe. The obvious racial buttons are never pushed". Greg Quill from the Toronto Star agreed, and wrote that Shill and Loughery [...] "stripped the drama of its potentially gripping – and obvious – racial overtones". However, Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer pointed out that having the two female roles of differing races [...] "creates racial tension", and noted similarities to [...] "the racially charged" [...] Lakeview Terrace (2008), which Loughery also wrote. Braun was of the impression that a well-written script was replaced by the film's [...] "racial politics". When Derek confronts Lisa at the <b>business</b> <b>conference,</b> she threatens him with a sexual harassment complaint; Sady Doyle from The Guardian wrote that this alludes to [...] "the history of black men being lynched for their perceived threat to white women". Doyle pointed out that historically white women are more revered for their beauty than black women, which is a side theme of the fight between Sharon and Lisa. Melissa Anderson of LA Weekly suggested that awkwardness of the interracial relationship of Derek and Lisa as a reason why the filmmakers did not have the two characters partake in any sexual activity.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} moonlight night, and he was returning to a bedroom at the hotel which he temporarily occupied during the painting of his house. It was quite late, he having spent the evening with a San Francisco friend after a <b>business</b> <b>conference</b> which assured him of the remarkable prosperity of Excelsior. It was therefore with some human exaltation that {{he looked around the}} sleeping settlement which had sprung up under the magic wand of their good fortune. The full moon had idealized their youthful designs with something of their own youthful coloring, graciously softening the garish freshness of paint and plaster, hiding with discreet obscurity the disrupted banks and broken woods {{at the beginning and end}} of their broad avenues, paving the rough river terrace with tessellated shadows, and even touching the rapid stream which was the source of their wealth with a Pactolean glitter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Charles Gould," [...] {{said the}} engineer-in-chief, [...] "has {{said no more}} about his motive than usual. You know, he doesn't talk. But we all here know his motive, and he has only one--the safety of the San Tome mine with the {{preservation}} of the Gould Concession in the spirit of his compact with Holroyd. Holroyd is another uncommon man. They understand each other's imaginative side. One is thirty, the other nearly sixty, and they have been made for each other. To be a millionaire, and such a millionaire as Holroyd, is like being eternally young. The audacity of youth reckons upon what it fancies an unlimited time at its disposal; but a millionaire has unlimited means in his hand--which is better. One's time on earth is an uncertain quantity, but about the long reach of millions there is no doubt. The introduction of a pure form of Christianity into this continent is a dream for a youthful enthusiast, and I have been trying to explain to you why Holroyd at fifty-eight is like a man on the threshold of life, and better, too. He's not a missionary, but the San Tome mine holds just that for him. I assure you, in sober truth, that he could not manage to keep this out of a strictly <b>business</b> <b>conference</b> upon the finances of Costaguana he had with Sir John a couple of years ago. Sir John mentioned it with amazement in a letter he wrote to me here, from San Francisco, when on his way home. Upon my word, doctor, things seem to be worth nothing by what they are in themselves. I begin to believe that the only solid thing about them is the spiritual value which everyone discovers in his own form of activity----" ...|$|E
