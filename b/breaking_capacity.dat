40|$|Vegetative buds of peach (Prunus persica L.

Analysis of xylem sap revealed seasonal changes in concentrations of sorbitol and hexoses (glucose and fructose). Sorbitol concentrations decreased and hexose concentrations increased with increasing bud <b>break</b> <b>capacity.</b> Sucrose concentration in xylem sap increased significantly but remained low. To clarify their respective roles in the early events of bud break, carbohydrate concentrations and uptake rates, and activities of NAD-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), sorbitol oxidase (SOX) and cell wall invertase (CWI) were determined in meristematic tissues, cushion tissues and stem segments. Only CWI activity increased in meristematic tissues shortly before bud break. In buds displaying high bud <b>break</b> <b>capacity</b> (during January and February), concentrations of sorbitol and sucrose in meristematic tissues were almost unchanged, paralleling their low rates of uptake and utilization by meristematic tissues, and indicating that sorbitol and sucrose play a negligible role in the bud break process. Hexose concentrations in meristematic tissues and glucose imported by meristematic tissues correlated positively with bud <b>break</b> <b>capacity,</b> suggesting that hexoses {{are involved in the}} early events of bud break. These findings were confirmed by data for buds that were unable to break because they had been collected from trees deprived of cold. We therefore conclude that hexoses are of greater importance than sorbitol or sucrose in the early events of bud break in peach trees...|$|R

2500|$|Fuses {{have been}} used as {{essential}} safety devices from the early days of electrical engineering. Today there are thousands of different fuse designs which have specific current and voltage ratings, <b>breaking</b> <b>capacity</b> and response times, depending on the application.

Miniature fuses may have an interrupting rating only 10 times their rated current. Some fuses are designated High Rupture Capacity (HRC) and are usually filled with sand or a similar material. Fuses for small, low-voltage, usually residential, wiring systems are commonly rated, in North American practice, to interrupt 10,000 amperes. Fuses for commercial or industrial power systems must have higher interrupting ratings, with some low-voltage current-limiting high interrupting fuses rated for 300,000 amperes.

40|$|Plant seeds used {{rely on a}} {{wide range}} of {{internal}} mechanisms and physio-chemical factors to ensure their germination under favorable environmental conditions. Most plant seeds have complex process of germination, including water, oxygen, temperature availability, genome-wide gene expression, signal transduction, hormones stimulations, inhibitors removal and catalytic protein synthesis. In addition, influences of seeds nutrient values such as, protein, lipids, sugars and free amino acids have a special importance. Regarding, seeds free amino acids. Discussion of these individual factors needs to be put in context of their role in germination processes. Regarding, free amino acids seed storage, there is limited information about their relevant functions in activation and/or deactivation of required metabolic mechanisms and interactive compounds involved in this process in commercial plant cultivars. Therefore, current study was aimed to determine the probable influence of free amino acid compositions of seeds on germination process of two different (Punica granatum L.) pomegranate cultivars including wild type Automi cultivar and edible Khazemi cultivar. In particular, we focused on the impact of amino acids contents variations on germination process and associated AAs compositional changes during various stages of germination and seedlings establishment. Amino acid analysis using HPLC detected all the essential and non-essential amino acids in the raw seeds of the studied cultivars, Automi and Khazemi along with AAs compositional changes occurred during different stages of seed germination. These AAs have been extensively analyzed in the context of their role in dormancy <b>breaking</b> <b>capacities</b> in plants species. Automi raw seeds are rich in Phe, that, is strongly related to ABA synthesis and hence might be responsible for the dormancy of Automi seeds, Khazemi raw seeds have sufficient levels of Arg, Glu and Met that have been reported to enhance seeds germination in plant, therefore Khazemi germination capacity was assumed to be regulated more or less by these AAs. In addition, changes in amino acid composition in the germinated Khazemi cultivar during various stages of seeds germination including imbibition, germination, and sprouts stages have been noticed to change in response with germination demands. This suggests that amino acids reserves in dry seeds are major determinant for germination capacity and germination behavior in the following steps of germination. The noticed particular AAs increase/decrease along the time course of Khazemi pomegranate germination till establishment of heterotrophic seedlings were used as cornerstones for elucidation and deduction of putative function and relevant biochemical pathways controlling initiation of seeds germination and seedlings developments. Based on publicly available databases of model plants and literatures surveys, we established correlations between prevailing AAs factors as biochemical parameters actively involved in seeds dormancy-breaking and germination process...|$|R

40|$|Oxobiodegradable {{agriculture}} mulch films {{made from}} polyethylene (PE) {{are known to}} have many benefits for agriculture practice, including increased yields and resource efficiency, without the drawback of removing the film after the growing season. However, anecdotal evidence suggested when pesticides are applied to these films, their rate of degradation may be affected. The goal of this investigation was to characterize the delay in degradation that occurs when pesticides are applied to oxobiodegradable agriculture mulch films. Two pesticides, Pyrinex 480 and Round Up, were tested in the field and laboratory environment to determine the effects on degradation with normal and accelerated exposure conditions for the films. Exposure tests indicated the pesticides were having stabilizing effects on the PE films, delaying degradation. Therefore, tests were designed to explore the chemical mechanisms underlying each pesticide?s stabilizing influence. These included experimental and computational measurements of redox potential to define chain breaking donor and chain <b>breaking</b> acceptor <b>capacities</b> of the pesticides. UV (ultraviolet) screener capacity of the pesticides was also investigated. We concluded that Pyrinex 480 likely has the ability to absorb UV energy that would normally break bonds in PE, along with some other capacity to stabilize degradation, such as the ability to accept electrons. In contrast, Round Up likely donates electrons or atoms to prevent degradation reactions and stabilize PE films...|$|R

To further investigate the influence of pore structure on its adsorption performance, two SBA- 15 samples with different microspores were also selected. It is shown that microporous material NaY has the largest adsorption capacity of 0. 2873 mL/g, and the amorphous SiO 2 exhibits the least capacity of 0. 1003 mL/g. MCM- 41 also shows a lower <b>break</b> through <b>capacity</b> {{in spite of the}} relatively small pore diameter, because it can not provide the necessary small geometric confinement for the tiny adsorbates. However, the mesoporous SBA- 15 silica with certain micropore volume shows relatively higher adsorption capacity than that of MCM- 41 silica. The presence of micropores directly leads to an increase in the dynamic adsorption capacity of toluene. Although NaY has the highest adsorption capacity for toluene, its complete desorption temperature for toluene is high (> 350 degrees C), which limits its wide application. On the contrary, mesoporous silica materials exhibits a good desorption performance for volatile organic compounds at lower temperatures. Among these materials mesoporous SBA- 15 samples, with a larger amount micropores and a lower desorption temperature, are a potentially interesting adsorbent for the removal of volatile organic compounds.

We have {{conducted a study}} to assess the predictivity of the OGG 1, XRCC 1 and XRCC 3 genotypes and the in vitro single strand break repair phenotype for the induction of genotoxic effects. At the population level, a significant contribution of the OGG 1 genotypes to the in vitro DNA strand <b>break</b> repair <b>capacity</b> was found. At an individual level, the OGG 1 variants Ser/Cys and Cys/Cys genotypes showed a slower in vitro DNA repair than the Ser/Ser OGG 1 genotype. A multivariate analysis performed with genotypes, age, cumulative dose, exposure status and smoking as independent variables indicated that in the control population, repair capacity is influenced by age and OGG 1 polymorphisms. In the exposed population, DNA damage is greater in older men and in smokers. Repair capacity is slower in individuals with Ser/Cys or Cys/Cys OGG 1 genotypes compared to those with the Ser/Ser OGG 1 genotype. Micronuclei (MN) frequencies increased with age and the cumulative dose of gamma-rays. Analysis {{of the total population}} revealed that genetic polymorphisms in XRCC 1 resulted in higher residual DNA (RDNA) values and the Met/Met variant of XRCC 3 resulted in an increased frequency of micronuclei. The analysis confirms that MN frequencies are reliable biomarkers for the assessment of genetic effects in workers exposed to ionising radiation (IR). A combined analysis of the three genotypes, OGG 1, XRCC 1 and XRCC 3 polymorphisms is advised in order to assess individual susceptibility to ionising radiation. As an alternative or complement, the in vitro DNA strand break repair phenotype which integrates several repair pathways is recommended. Smokers with OGG 1 polymorphisms who are exposed to ionising radiation represent a specific population requiring closer medical surveillance because of their increased mutagenic/carcinogenic risk.
