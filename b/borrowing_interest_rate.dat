In addition to, and independent from, the standard transmission mechanism associated with sticky prices, financial frictions combined with asymmetric asset positions introduce a wealth redistribution role for monetary policy in our model. Financial frictions also lead to a spread between the deposit and <b>borrowing</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and variation in the spread affects both aggregate variables, by affecting total spending, and relative (cross-country) variables, by redistributing wealth across countries. Moreover, the interactions between nominal and financial frictions amplify the effects of monetary policy; imply that a strict inflation targeting policy of setting union-wide inflation to zero is never optimal and that optimal policy never attains efficiency; and lead to a novel policy trade-o¤ for the central bank in stabilizing relative consumption versus the relative price gap (the deviation of relative prices from their efficient level). Finally, under optimal monetary policy, {{in response to an}} aggregate purely financial shock that causes an increase in the interest rate spread, the central bank strongly decreases the deposit rate, which reduces aggregate and distributional inefficiencies by mitigating the drop in output and inflation and the rise in relative consumption and prices.

The analysis departs from an environment that combines asymmetric information about cash flows and limited commitment by borrowers. Incentive for repayment comes from the possibility of liquidation of projects by a court, but courts are costly and may fail to liquidate. The value of liquidated assets can be used as collateral: it is transferred to the lender when courts liquidate. Examples reveal that costly use of courts may be optimal, which contrasts with results from most limited commitment models, where punishments are just threats, never applied in optimal arrangements. I show that when voluntary liquidation is allowed, both asymmetric information and uncertainty about courts are necessary conditions for legal punishments ever to be applied. Numerical solutions for several parametric specifications are presented, allowing for heterogeneity on initial wealth and variability of project returns. In all such solutions, wealthier individuals <b>borrow</b> with lower <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and run higher scale enterprises, which is consistent with stylized facts. The reliability of courts has a consistently positive effect on the scale of projects.

These disparities could not be explained by considering individual corporate financial situations (e. g., credit risk, funds demand), leading me to conclude that the loan market is segmented regionally and that the economic and financial environment in Okinawa affects <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> With regard to specific environmental factors, variables that show what the economic and financial environment is - for example, the number of banks operating in each region (the larger the number, the lower the <b>interest</b> <b>rates)</b> and the proportion of lending within a region that is accounted for by city banks (the larger the share, the lower the <b>interest</b> <b>rates)</b> - have an impact throughout Japan, and in Okinawa there is a general tendency for lenders to react to financial data and other factors that increase credit risk in a way that raises <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{to a greater extent than}} in Japan as a whole.
