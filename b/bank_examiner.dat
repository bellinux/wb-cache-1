25|$|Heald was a {{national}} <b>bank</b> <b>examiner</b> in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon from 1888 until 1892, when he {{was admitted to the}} Bar in Wilmington in 1897. He was appointed Postmaster for Wilmington from 1901 until 1905.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, George is {{ineligible for}} service {{because of his}} bad ear. Harry becomes a Navy pilot and shoots down a kamikaze plane that would have bombed an amphibious transport; he is awarded the Medal of Honor. On Christmas Eve morning 1945, the town prepares a hero's welcome for Harry. Uncle Billy goes to Potter's bank to deposit $8,000 for the Building and Loan. (The $8,000 was worth over $100,000 in 2017 dollars.) He teases Potter, taking his {{newspaper}} and bragging about Harry being on the front page; the banker angrily grabs the newspaper, inside of which Billy has unintentionally tucked the envelope containing the money. Upon seeing the money, Potter realizes the potential scandal {{could lead to the}} Building and Loan's downfall. Potter hides the money, knowing its loss will cause severe financial problems for the Building and Loan. When Uncle Billy cannot find the money, he and George frantically search for it. When the <b>bank</b> <b>examiner</b> arrives to review their records, George berates his uncle for endangering the Building and Loan, goes home and takes out his frustration on his family. He apologizes to his wife and children, then leaves.|$|E
2500|$|Born {{and raised}} in Mattoon, Illinois, Williams {{graduated}} from Mattoon High School in 1953, where he acquired the nickname [...] "Chub." [...] He attended The Citadel in South Carolina. According to his high school girlfriend, Williams had been nervous about The Citadel's swimming requirement, as he had always had a fear of water. After graduation he served {{two years in the}} military in a stateside post and then went into banking, eventually becoming a <b>bank</b> <b>examiner</b> for the Federal Reserve System in Atlanta. A divorced father of two, he was engaged to be remarried.|$|E

40|$|In {{the years}} before the Financial Crisis, banks got to pick their regulators, {{engaging}} in a form of regulatory arbitrage that we now know was a race to the bottom. We propose to turn the tables on the banks by allowing regulators, specifically, <b>bank</b> <b>examiners,</b> to choose the banks they regulate. We call this “reverse regulatory arbitrage,” {{and we think it}} can help improve regulatory outcomes. Building on our prior work that proposes to pay <b>bank</b> <b>examiners</b> for performance—by giving them financial incentives to avoid bank failures—we argue that bank supervisory assignments should be set through an auction among examiners. Examiner bidding would generate information about examiners 2 ̆ 7 skills, experience and preferences, as well as information about each <b>bank.</b> Provided <b>examiners</b> bear the upside and downside of their regulatory behavior, a bidding system for regulatory assignments could improve the fit between <b>examiners</b> and the <b>banks</b> they supervise, thereby enhancing regulatory efficiency...|$|R
50|$|He took a {{leadership}} role for the Florida delegation in sending a letter to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chairman Sheila Bair, claiming that <b>banking</b> <b>examiners</b> may be pursuing an unreasonably tough analysis of Florida banks’ asset quality and are regularly requiring downgrades of performing loans.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "sixth passenger," [...] who {{had survived}} the crash and had {{repeatedly}} given up the rescue lines to other survivors before drowning, was later identified as 46-year-old <b>bank</b> <b>examiner</b> Arland D. Williams Jr. The repaired span of the 14th Street Bridge complex over the Potomac River at the crash site, which had been named the Rochambeau Bridge, was renamed the [...] "Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge" [...] in his honor. The Citadel in South Carolina, from which he graduated in 1957, has several memorials to him. In 2003, the new Arland D. Williams Jr. Elementary School was dedicated {{in his hometown of}} Mattoon in Coles County, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{scene that}} was in {{an earlier version of}} the script had young George visiting his father at his work. After George tells off Mr. Potter and closes the door, he {{considers}} asking Uncle Billy about his drugstore dilemma. Billy is talking on the phone to the <b>bank</b> <b>examiner,</b> and lights his cigar and throws his match in the wastebasket. This scene explains that Tilly (short for Matilda) and Eustace are both his cousins (not Billy's kids though), and Tilly is on the phone with her friend Martha and says, [...] "Potter's here, the bank examiner's coming. It's a day of judgment." [...] As George is about to interrupt Tilly on the phone, Billy cries for help and Tilly runs in and puts the fire out with a pot of coffee. George decides he is probably better off dealing with the situation by himself.|$|E

40|$|Information Technology (IT) <b>bank</b> <b>examiners</b> have {{difficulty}} in making practical use of explicit IT knowledge documents {{stored in the}} IT examiners 2 ̆ 7 document repository. This repository contains insufficient context to make it immediately and totally relevant to examiners, especially new IT examiners. At times, the document repository is not available for examiners 2 ̆ 7 use due to limited remote access while examiners are in the field or during systems upgrades. In addition, there are no formal mechanisms for validating and updating the content. The {{purpose of this study}} was to ascertain whether the IT examiners information technology knowledge sharing sessions/community of practice (CoP) provide a mechanism for reusing tangible knowledge assets, transferring knowledge, improving job performance, and providing the kinds of support that benefit IT <b>bank</b> <b>examiners.</b> The participants in this study, eight IT <b>bank</b> <b>examiners,</b> work in the bank information technology regulatory environment. Their skills are in their IT domain areas such as information security, business continuity planning, and systems disaster recovery testing, IT project management, and audit rather than computer programming. Using case study methodologies, the data collected was based on questionnaires, interviews, participant observations - meeting and field notes, and storytelling notes. The field data was analyzed using selected principles from Grounded Theory - constant comparative analysis, narrative pattern analysis, and the ATLAS. ti quantitative analysis software. The study found that the examiners reported, perceived, and believed that IT knowledge sharing sessions facilitated the capturing, validating, and transferring of knowledge among IT <b>bank</b> <b>examiners</b> while improving their individual job performance. Specifically, emerging from the research were eight knowledge transfer themes that supported five benefits/critical functions of the IT knowledge sharing sessions - examiner development, knowledge transfer, social interaction, problem solving, and learning opportunities. However, a community facilitator, mutual trust, and respect among examiners and active participation in the knowledge sharing sessions are essential to the process to enable improved examiner performance and, by extension, organizational performance...|$|R
50|$|In response, Smith led {{a review}} of the agency's {{examination}} practices, which changed the way the agency did business: more emphasis was placed on assessment of a bank's own policies, procedures, decision making, and management information system, and the importance of training and career development for national <b>bank</b> <b>examiners</b> was recognized. After his resignation, Smith became a financial consultant.|$|R
2500|$|After {{serving as}} Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi for four years, Bilbo was elected {{governor}} in 1915.

60|$|The <b>bank</b> <b>examiner</b> was shocked. It was, perhaps, {{his duty}} to step out to the {{telegraph}} office and wire the situation to the Comptroller. But he did not.

50|$|To {{get onto}} the FDIC problem bank list, a bank must receive a CAMELS rating by <b>bank</b> <b>examiners</b> of “4” or “5.” The CAMEL rates each element of Capital, Assets, Management, Earnings, and Liquidity from “1” to “5,” with “1” {{being the best}} and “5” being the worst. A {{composite}} rating is then assigned, and banks in the two lowest categories are placed on the FDIC’s problem bank list.|$|R
6000|$|I hear there's one of Uncle Sam's grayhounds {{going through}} [...] you, {{and that means}} that we'll catch him inside of a couple [...] of hours, maybe. Now, I want you to do {{something}} for me. [...] We've got just $2,200 in the bank, and the law requires [...] that we have $20,000. I let Ross and Fisher have $18,000 [...] late yesterday afternoon to buy up that Gibson bunch of [...] cattle. They'll realise $40,000 in less than thirty days on [...] the transaction, but that won't make my cash on hand look [...] any prettier to that <b>bank</b> <b>examiner.</b> Now, I can't show him [...] those notes, for they're just plain notes of hand without [...] any security in sight, but you know very well that Pink [...] Ross and Jim Fisher are two of the finest white men God [...] ever made, and they'll do the square thing. You remember [...] Jim Fisher--he was the one who shot that faro dealer in El [...] Paso. I wired Sam Bradshaw's bank to send me $20,000, and [...] it will get in on the narrow-gauge at 10.35. You can't let [...] a <b>bank</b> <b>examiner</b> in to count $2,200 and close your doors. [...] Tom, you hold that examiner. Hold him. Hold him if you have [...] to rope him and sit on his head.

60|$|Nettlewick settled {{himself in}} his chair. There would be no leaving San Rosario for him that day. He would have to {{telegraph}} to the Comptroller of the Currency; {{he would have to}} swear out a warrant before the United States Commissioner for the arrest of Major Kingman; perhaps he would be ordered to close the bank on account of the loss of the securities. It was not the first crime the examiner had unearthed. Once or twice the terrible upheaval of human emotions that his investigations had loosed had almost caused a ripple in his official calm. He had seen bank men kneel and plead and cry like women for a chance--an hour's time--the overlooking of a single error. One cashier had shot himself at his desk before him. None of them had taken it with the dignity and coolness of this stern old Westerner. Nettlewick felt that he owed it to him at least to listen if he wished to talk. With his elbow on the arm of his chair, and his square chin resting upon the fingers of his right hand, the <b>bank</b> <b>examiner</b> waited to hear the confession {{of the president of the}} First National Bank of San Rosario.|$|E

Examiners, particularly those employed by a regulatory agency, may assign ratings to institutions and impose civil penalties or other punishments for noncompliance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{history of}} {{technology}} and banking is examined {{as it relates to}} risk and technological determinism. It is proposed that the services that banks offer are determined by technology and that banks must adopt new technologies to be competitive. The adoption of technologies paradoxically forces the adoption of other new technologies to protect the bank from the increased risk of technology. This cycle will lead to <b>bank</b> <b>examiners</b> and regulators to focus on human behavior, not on the ever changing technology. Keywords—Banking, information security, risk, technological determinism...|$|R

50|$|The {{higher the}} {{estimated}} risk of uncollectable {{assets in the}} portfolio, the larger the ALLL reserve should be. The allowance is a topic of much regulatory scrutiny, and {{a review of the}} ALLL methodology is a significant portion of a financial institution’s safety and soundness exam because it is important for federal <b>bank</b> <b>examiners</b> to ensure that an institution has a sufficient amount of capital in the allowance reserve. The allowance is also significant to bank management and directors as it has a large impact on an institution’s earnings and capital.|$|R
50|$|The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) was {{originally}} enacted under President Jimmy Carter in 1977 {{in an effort}} to encourage banks to halt the practice of lending discrimination. In 1995 the Clinton Administration issued regulations that added numerical guidelines, urged lending flexibility, and instructed <b>bank</b> <b>examiners</b> to evaluate a bank’s responsiveness to community activists (such as ACORN) when deciding whether to approve bank merger or expansion requests. Critics claim that the 1995 changes to CRA signaled to banks that relaxed lending standards were appropriate and could minimize potential risk of governmental sanctions.|$|R
