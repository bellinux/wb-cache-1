5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable narrow <b>band</b> <b>filter,</b> Michelson interferometers {{exhibit a}} number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E
25|$|Title of Record is {{the second}} album by American {{industrial}} rock <b>band</b> <b>Filter.</b> It was released on August 24, 1999, via Reprise Records. The album's earlier sessions were marred with slow progress due to line-up changes and frontman Richard Patrick deciding to create his own studio for recording. Upon solidifying the line-up, and bringing in further production help, progress improved, and the album was eventually released on August 24, 1999. The album would be a commercial success for the band, being their second of two platinum-selling albums, selling over one million copies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{synthesis}} method for a generalized symmetric multiple <b>band</b> bandpass <b>filter.</b> By using frequency transformations on the low pass prototype, the poles and zeros of the single/dual <b>band</b> <b>filtering</b> function are obtained. These poles and zeros are combined and re-arranged to get the multiband filtering function. The coupling matrix is obtained from this multiband filtering function. A variety of filters are synthesized in order to validate the proposed theory. A triple band and quadruple <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> have been designed, fabricated and measured. The measured results have good agreement with the simulated results. 1...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} WFPC 2 {{close-out}} calibrations, {{we examine}} {{the stability of the}} bandwidths of the narrow band and linear ramp filters. We measure the FWHM of the spots produced by VISFLAT exposures using linear ramp filters crossed with narrow <b>band</b> <b>filters.</b> We do this for eight different pairings of narrow band and linear ramp filters. We then compare results from 1995 and 2008, and find negligible change in the bandpass FWHM for all eight filter pairs tested. Any change in the combined bandwidth is less than about 1 % of the bandwidth. Our constraints on any changes in the narrow <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> (taken alone) are less strong, but we can rule out bandwidth changes larger than about 5 % for typical narrow <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> (16 % for the narrowest filter, F 656 N). 1...|$|R
500|$|For all {{of their}} efficiency, atomic line filters are not perfect; there are many sources of error, or [...] "noise", in a given system. These are {{manifest}} as electromagnetic radiation independent of the working processes of the filter {{and the intensity of}} the signal light. One source of error is the thermal radiation of and within the ALF itself. Some thermal radiation comes directly from the filter and happens to be within the bandpass of the second broad <b>band</b> <b>filter.</b> More noise is created if the filter is designed for output in the infrared range, as most of the thermal radiation would be in that spectrum. These emissions may stimulate the vapor and create the radiation it is trying to detect in the first place.|$|E

500|$|Nine Inch Nails toured North America as {{an opening}} act for The Jesus and Mary Chain in 1990, and later for Peter Murphy. During these tours, Reznor began to smash {{equipment}} while on stage, and Rockbeat interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the band's early success to this aggressive attitude. In 1991, the band undertook a world tour that {{continued through the}} first Lollapalooza festival, where, according to biographer Martin Huxley, they [...] "stole the show". New Musical Express had a sentiment after the performance, describing the show as [...] "genuinely frightening", and asking the reader to [...] "decide for yourself if it's choreographed chaos or unbridled grievous bodily harm". Nine Inch Nails was then invited to open for Guns N' Roses on their European Tour, though they were reportedly poorly received yet again. [...] Before the Lollapalooza date, Chris Vrenna left the band due to a fall out with Reznor, and was replaced {{for the remainder of}} the tour by drummer Jeff Ward. Vrenna would rejoin the band for the Self-Destruct tour in 1994.

40|$|AbstractMaximum sound {{pressure}} levels {{are commonly used}} for environmental noise and building acoustics measurements. This paper investigates the signal processing errors due to Fast or Slow time-weighting detectors when combined with octave <b>band</b> <b>filters,</b> one-third octave <b>band</b> <b>filters</b> or an A-weighting filter. For 6 th order Butterworth CPB filters the inherent time delay caused by the phase response of filters is quantified using three different approaches to establish the following rules-of-thumb: (1) time-to-gradient/amplitude matching occurs when Bt≈ 1, (2) time-to-peak matching occurs when Bt≈ 2 and (3) time-to-settle matching occurs when Bt≈ 4 for octave <b>band</b> <b>filters,</b> and when Bt≈ 3 for one-third octave <b>band</b> <b>filters.</b> Four different commercially-available sound level meters are used to quantify the variation in measured maximum levels using tone bursts, half-sine pulses, ramped noise and recorded transients. Tone bursts indicate that Slow time-weighting is inappropriate for maximum level measurements due to the large bias error. The results also {{show that there is}} more variation between sound level meters when considering Fast time-weighted maximum levels in octave bands or one-third octave bands than with A-weighted levels. To reduce the variation between measurements with different sound level meters, it is proposed that limits could be prescribed on the phase response for CPB filters and A-weighting filters...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEdges are {{intensity}} change, which {{occur on}} the boundary between two regions in an image. Edges {{can be used as}} feature descriptors of an object. Hence, edge detection {{plays an important role in}} computer vision applications. This paper presents the application of sparse <b>banded</b> <b>filter</b> matrices in edge detection. The filter design is formulated in terms of banded matrices. The sparsity property of the designed filter leads to efficient computation. In our proposed method, we applied sparse <b>banded</b> high-pass <b>filter</b> row-wise and column-wise to extract the vertical and the horizontal edges of the image respectively. The proposed technique is experimented on standard images and the results are compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The visual comparison of the experimental results shows that the proposed approach for edge extraction based on sparse <b>banded</b> <b>filter</b> matrices produces result comparable to the existing methods. The advantage of the proposed approach is that the continuous edges are attained without any parameter tuning...|$|R
