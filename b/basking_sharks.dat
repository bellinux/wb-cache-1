5|$|Most {{sharks are}} carnivorous. <b>Basking</b> <b>sharks,</b> whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have {{independently}} evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.|$|E

5|$|Red {{deer are}} common {{on the hills}} and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland. Colonies of seals are found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles. The rich {{freshwater}} streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore, minke whales, Killer whales, <b>basking</b> <b>sharks,</b> porpoises and dolphins are among the sealife that can be seen.|$|E
5|$|Smoke was not {{the only}} thing emitted from the power station. In July 1956, the {{discharge}} of cooling water from the stations was noted to have increased the water temperature of the river by 1.5°C between Ryton and Scotswood. However, this was found to not be too deleterious, as it did not seem to affect the passage of migratory fish. In fact, because of the stations' introduction of warm water into the river, <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E

50|$|On 11 December 2004, an {{approximately}} three-year-old <b>basking</b> <b>shark,</b> Cetorhinus maximus, was beached on {{the coast}} near Petten. The animal was 3.65 m long and weighed 250 kg. The material surplus was put on ice and was exhibited in the aquarium of Fort Kijkduin at Den Helder.

5|$|Due to its {{isolated}} coastal location, the Isle of Portland has {{an extensive}} range of flora and fauna; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists {{from around the}} country. Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and <b>basking</b> <b>sharks.</b> Chesil Beach {{is one of only}} two sites in Britain where the scaly cricket can be found; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop. Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters of}} {{south-west}} Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including <b>basking</b> <b>sharks,</b> Atlantic grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion {{in particular are}} recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins, and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins {{in the whole of}} the UK. River fish of note include char, eel, salmon, shad, sparling and Arctic char, whilst the Gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake. Wales is also known for its shellfish, including cockles, limpet, mussels and periwinkles. Herring, mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's seafish.|$|E
5|$|Virtually {{every type}} of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on {{cetaceans}} (including porpoises, dolphins, beaked whales, sperm whales, and baleen whales), pinnipeds (including fur seals, leopard seals, and elephant seals), dugongs, sharks (including blue sharks, goblin sharks, <b>basking</b> <b>sharks,</b> great white sharks, megamouth sharks and smalltooth sand tiger sharks), stingrays (including deepwater stingrays, pelagic stingrays and sixgill stingrays), and bony fishes (including billfishes, tunas, dolphinfishes, jacks, escolars, opahs, and pomfrets). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|E
5000|$|Although several {{scientists}} {{insisted it}} was [...] "not a fish, whale, {{or any other}} mammal", analysis later indicated it was most likely the carcass of a <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> by comparing the number of sets of amino acids in the muscle tissue. Decomposing <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> carcasses lose most of the lower head area and the dorsal and caudal fins first, making them resemble a plesiosaur.|$|R

The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore minke whales, killer whales, <b>basking</b> <b>sharks,</b> porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life {{that can be seen}} and edible crab and oyster are also found, in for example, the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs.|$|E
