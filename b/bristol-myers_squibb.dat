5|$|Broad {{interest}} in metformin was not rekindled until {{the withdrawal of}} the other biguanides in the 1970s. Metformin was approved in Canada in 1972, but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes until 1994. Produced under license by <b>Bristol-Myers</b> <b>Squibb,</b> Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the U.S., beginning on March 3, 1995. Generic formulations are now available in several countries, and metformin is believed to have become the world's most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1629 and 1638 for Sir Edmund Wright, {{the house}} {{replaced}} an existing structure {{dating back to}} the 14th century. In later years the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Sports Association bought the house, followed by the London Postal Region Sports Club. Cricket matches between the club and local teams from Ickenham and Uxbridge were played within the grounds. The house was bought by three local residents in the 1980s and restored, whereupon it was leased to <b>Bristol-Myers</b> <b>Squibb</b> for 25 years.

2500|$|Hobbs {{retained}} his Seton Hall post. [...] Hobbs {{asserted that}} Christie {{had given him}} [...] "full authority and independence" [...] and would leave the job if he felt impeded. The United States Ombudsman Association recommends, however, that ombudsmen be appointed by entities outside of their jurisdiction, preferably by a legislature, to avoid any questions about independence. In 2006, as U.S. Attorney, Christie approved <b>Bristol-Myers</b> <b>Squibb's</b> endowment of an ethics chair at Seton Hall's law school in a controversial prosecution settlement. After a controversy arose over this agreement, Hobbs wrote a letter in 2006 {{to the editor of}} The Wall Street Journal praising Christie.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{lessons learned}} from independent evaluations of nine home-based care (HBC) projects in Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland. Projects were funded through <b>Bristol-Myers</b> <b>Squibb's</b> Secure the Future (STF) initiative and evaluated through the STF Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) at Yale University. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: assess the management capacity of the HBC organisations reviewed, concentrating on monitoring and supervision mechanisms identify innovations in responding to the challenges of delivering care in resource-poor settings, and explore the nature of linkages between HBC projects and governments. Specific strategies to assure quality are discussed, as are policy changes necessary to provide system-wide improvements in quality and the integration of HBC. These are particularly important as governments seek ways to use existing resources to make antiretroviral (ARV) roll-outs successful. More than 25 million people were HIV positive in sub-Saharan Africa at the end of 2004, and during 2004 alone, 2. 3 million people died of AIDS. 1 The HIV/AIDS pandemic is affecting the welfare of nations, communities and families, but its impact begins with the suffering of the infected individual.

25|$|However, {{the primary}} {{sponsors}} {{are part of}} the breast cancer industry, particularly cancer drug makers like AstraZeneca, <b>Bristol-Myers</b> <b>Squibb,</b> and Novartis.

25|$|Paclitaxel (Taxol) was a novel {{antimitotic agent}} that {{promoted}} microtubule assembly. This agent proved difficult to synthesize and {{could only be}} obtained from the bark of the Pacific Yew tree, which forced the NCI into the costly business of harvesting substantial quantities of yew trees from public lands. After 4 years of clinical testing in solid tumours, it was found in 1987 (23 years after its initial discovery) to be effective in ovarian cancer therapy. Notably, this agent, although developed by the NCI in partnership with <b>Bristol-Myers</b> <b>Squibb,</b> was exclusively marketed by BMS (who had utilized the synthetic methodology developed by Robert Holton at Florida State University) who went on to make over a billion dollars profit from Taxol.|$|E
25|$|Economists {{note that}} {{governors}} generally have relatively {{little impact on}} their states' employment numbers, good or bad, as these are dominated by forces beyond their control. The statewide health care reforms that Romney helped enact, and signed into law in April 2006, exemplified the state's national leadership role in that industry; overall, there was a 7.6percent increase in job growth in healthcare and social assistance positions during Romney's term, the strongest growth during that time of any sector. Romney also personally intervened to help attract to the state, or maintain within the state, several large employers, such as <b>Bristol-Myers</b> <b>Squibb</b> and the Gillette division of Procter & Gamble. However, some business leaders said Romney’s policies that increased fees and corporate tax revenue drove up business costs and may have weakened job growth.|$|E
25|$|At the American Society of Clinical Oncology Conference in June 2010, the <b>Bristol-Myers</b> <b>Squibb</b> {{pharmaceutical}} company reported the clinical findings of their drug ipilimumab. The study found {{an increase in}} median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one-year survival rate of 25% {{in the control group}} using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone. However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional control arm, rather than comparing the drug against a placebo or standard treatment. The criticism was that although Ipilimumab performed better than the vaccine, the vaccine has not been tested before and may be causing toxicity, making the drug appear better by comparison.|$|E
