40|$|Short <b>Backfire</b> <b>Antennas</b> (SBAs) {{are widely}} {{utilized}} for mobile satellite communications, tracking, telemetry, and wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN) applications due to their compact structure and excellent radiation characteristics [1 - 3]. Typically, these SBA s consist of an excitation element (i. e., a half-wavelength dipole), a reflective bottom plane, a planar sub-reflector located above the "exciter", and an outer circular rim. This configuration is capable of achieving gains on the order of 13 - 15 dBi, but with relatively narrow bandwidths (approx. 3 %- 5 %), making it incompatible with the requirements of the next generation enhanced Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System-Continuation (TDRSS-C) Multiple Access (MA) array [1]. Several {{attempts have been made to}} enhance the bandwidth performance of the common dipole-fed SBA by employing various other feeding mechanisms (e. g., waveguide, slot) with moderate success [4 - 5].

40|$|Abstract—The short <b>backfire</b> <b>antenna</b> (SBA) {{has been}} widely used for mobile {{satellite}} communications, tracking, telemetry, and wireless local-area network applications due to its compact structure and excellent radiation characteristics. The most common excitation topology for the SBA is a balance-fed wire dipole, which has the disadvantage of a narrow frequency bandwidth for the input impedance. In this paper, an H-shaped slot is employed to excite the SBA for the first time. The H-shaped slot is unbalance-fed from a coaxial line. It is demonstrated that the H-shaped slot-excited SBA can achieve a bandwidth for input impedance of more than 20 % (VSWR P) while maintaining good radiation performance. The antenna structure is described and the simulation and experimental results are presented. The operating principle is investigated {{to explain why the}} slot-excited SBA can result in good impedance and radiation characteristics.

40|$|Abstract ⎯ A new {{excitation}} {{technique is}} developed {{to improve the}} impedance bandwidth and to lower the manufacturing cost of a short <b>backfire</b> <b>antenna</b> (SBA). The new excitation structure consists of a planar monopole and a microstrip feed line, {{both of which are}} printed on the same dielectric substrate. By splitting the printed monopole with a slot, a wideband performance can be achieved. It is demonstrated that the split-monopole-excited SBA can achieve an impedance bandwidth of about 15 % (VSWR< 2) while maintaining the good radiation performance. As an example, an SBA configuration with the new excitation topology designed at the 5 GHz UNII band is described and the simulation and experimental results show good agreement. The effects of the geometric parameters of the excitation structure on the impedance performance are investigated and the operating mechanism of the split-monopole-excited SBA is discussed.

As the primary source of potential complexity in shipboard antennas, which have beamwidths less than hemispherical as the beam pointing or selecting mechanism, major emphasis was directed at this aspect.

40|$|The cup {{cylindrical}} waveguide antenna (CCWA) {{is a short}} backfire {{microwave antenna}} capable of simultaneously supporting the transmission or reception of two distinct signals having opposite circular polarizations. Short backfire antennas are widely used in mobile/satellite communications, tracking, telemetry, and wireless local area networks because of their compactness and excellent radiation characteristics. A typical prior short <b>backfire</b> <b>antenna</b> contains a half-wavelength dipole excitation element for linear polarization or crossed half-wavelength dipole elements for circular polarization. In order to achieve simultaneous dual circular polarization, {{it would be necessary}} to integrate, into the antenna feed structure, a network of hybrid components, which would introduce significant losses. The CCWA embodies an alternate approach that entails relatively low losses and affords the additional advantage of compactness. The CCWA includes a circular cylindrical cup, a circular disk subreflector, and a circular waveguide that serves as the excitation element. The components that make it possible to obtain simultaneous dual circular polarization are integrated into the circular waveguide. These components are a sixpost polarizer and an orthomode transducer (OMT) with two orthogonal coaxial ports. The overall length of the OMT and polarizer (for the nominal middle design frequency of 2. 25 GHz) is about 11 in.
