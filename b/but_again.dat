5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in September 1970 <b>but</b> <b>again</b> failed to achieve significant success.

5|$|As {{he began}} to read up on the written {{accounts}} of cultural cannibalism, {{he was struck by}} inconsistencies and other problems in these tales. In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, <b>but</b> <b>again</b> failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases.

On 28 June, Brazil revoked its neutrality between all of the Allied and Central Powers <b>but</b> <b>again</b> stopped short of declaring war; this move allowed Brazilian merchantmen to travel in Allied convoys.|$|E

Also on Pfefferberg's initiative, in 1964 Schindler received a $20,000 advance from MGM for a proposed film treatment titled To the Last Hour. Neither film was ever made, and Schindler quickly spent the money he received from MGM. He was also approached in the 1960s by MCA of Germany and Walt Disney Productions in Vienna, <b>but</b> <b>again</b> nothing came of these projects.|$|E

5|$|In 863, Khafaja {{sent his}} son Muhammad to raid the environs of Syracuse, {{but he was}} {{defeated}} by the Byzantines and forced to retire.

In 865, Khafaja led in person an expedition against the environs of Enna—which may signify that the Byzantines had retaken it, or that they still held forts in its vicinity—before moving onto Syracuse, <b>but</b> <b>again</b> his son Muhammad was defeated in an ambush, losing 1,000 men.|$|E

5|$|In natural diamonds, several hydrogen-related IR {{absorption}} peaks {{are commonly}} observed; the strongest ones are located at 1405, 3107 and 3237cm−1 (see IR absorption figure above). The microscopic {{structure of the}} corresponding defects is yet unknown {{and it is not}} even certain whether or not those defects originate in diamond or in foreign inclusions. Gray color in some diamonds from the Argyle mine in Australia is often associated with those hydrogen defects, <b>but</b> <b>again,</b> this assignment is yet unproven.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{victory over}} Sunderland in the 1992 FA Cup Final {{qualified}} {{them for the}} 1992–93 European Cup Winners' Cup, but this campaign was short-lived, as they were eliminated {{in the second round}} by Russian side Spartak Moscow. Liverpool finished no higher than sixth in the Premier League during the next two seasons, thus failing to qualify for European competition. In the 1995–96 season, they entered the UEFA Cup, <b>but</b> <b>again</b> progressed no further than the second round, this time losing to Brøndby of Denmark.|$|E
