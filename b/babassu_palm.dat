40|$|<b>Babassu</b> <b>palms</b> (Orbignya spp.) cover nearly 200, 000 km 2 in Brazil, {{providing}} cash income, fuel, fibre, {{edible oil}} and food {{to a large}} number of tenant farm households. Babassu is closely integrated within pastoral and shifting cultivation systems of Mid-North Brazil. In pastures, babassu provides shade for cattle, aids soil moisture retention, produces organic matter, generates supplementary farm income at little cost, and offers year-round employment. On the other hand, the persistence of juvenile palms reduces pasture grass productivity due to plant competition, and therefore there is a trend to eradicate babassu through clearcutting and understorey suppression. At moderate densities of less than 100 individuals per ha, mature <b>babassu</b> <b>palms</b> in cropland do not appear to harm crop productivity. In such cases, palms are thinned and leaves of the remaining ones are cut back, supplying fuel for the burn and nutrients to the soil. However, reduced fallow cycles due to pasture conversion threaten babassu as well as crop productivity. 198...|$|R

Babassu's cryptogeal germination, establishing the apical meristem of the plant below ground for its early growth and development, enables it to survive human disturbance, making the palm {{an integral part of}} shifting cultivation and pastoral farming systems. People obtain a multitude of products from <b>babassu</b> throughout the <b>palm's</b> life cycle: leaves are used widely for thatch, basketry, and construction; trunks for palmito and bridges; the fruit for feed, oil and, charcoal. As many as 450, 000 subsistence-level households rely on the sale of babassu kernels, used in a regional vegetable oil industry, for an important share of their cash incomes. Deforestation pressures and technological innovation toward an industry based on mechanical processing of whole babassu fruit threaten to reduce benefits the palm provides to the region's rural poor.

Stemflow samples were collected from 24 trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) > 5 cm, as well as eight young and four full-grown <b>babassu</b> <b>palms</b> (Attalea speciosa Mart.) for 5 weeks during the peak of the wet season. We calculated rainfall, throughfall and stemflow concentrations and fluxes of Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +,, Cl-, SO 42 -, NO 3 - and H+ and stemflow volume-weighted mean concentrations and fluxes for three size classes of broadleaf trees and three size classes of palms. The concentrations of most solutes were higher in stemflow than in rainfall and increased with increasing tree and palm size. Concentration enrichments from rainfall to stemflow and throughfall were particularly high (81 -fold) for NO 3 -. Stemflow fluxes of NO 3 - and H+ exceeded throughfall fluxes but stemflow fluxes of other solutes were less than throughfall fluxes. Stemflow solute fluxes to the forest soil were dominated by fluxes on <b>babassu</b> <b>palms,</b> which represented only 4 % of total stem number and 10 % of total basal area. For NO 3 -, stemflow contributed 51 % of the total mass of nitrogen delivered to the forest floor (stemflow + throughfall) and represented more than a 2000 -fold increase in NO 3 - flux compared what would have been delivered by rainfall alone on the equivalent area. Because these highly localized fluxes of both water and NO 3 - persist in time and space, they have the potential to affect patterns of soil moisture, microbial populations and other features of soil biogeochemistry conducive to the creation of hotspots for nitrogen leaching and denitrification, which could amount to an important fraction of total ecosystem fluxes. Because these hotspots occur over very small areas, they have likely gone undetected in previous studies and need to be considered as an important feature of the biogeochemistry of palm-rich tropical forest.

The {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) of eight chosen plant oils {{was defined as the}} mode of the lowest concentrations that were able to reduce the bacterial growth of 13 pathogenic and 6 beneficial intestinal strains of bacteria by 80 %. Coconut (Cocos nucifera), palm, red palm and palm kernel (Elaeis guineensis), Cuphea (C. lanceolata and C. ignea), babassu (Attalea speciosa, syn. Orbignya speciosa), tucuma (Astrocaryum vulgare), and muru-muru (Astrocaryum murumuru) oils were selected. Their antibacterial activity was tested towards following bacteria: Bifidobacterium animalis, B. longum, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus cecorum, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, S. infantis, S. typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. To identify the fatty acids composition of tested oils a gas chromatography was used. Consequently, the MIC of each oil towards all the bacteria was determined by a broth-microdilution test in 96 -well microtitration plates. The essentiality of cleavage of selected oils by lipase was observed, in order to activate their antibacterial effect. None of the tested oils exhibited any potential to inhibit the growth of Gramnegative bacterial strains even after cleavage. Furthermore palm and palm red oil did not exhibit any antibacterial action towards any of the tested bacterial strains. The strongest antibacterial activity was observed in tucuma oil, that inhibited C. perfringens by MIC= 0. 14 mg/ml. Other oils inhibited the growth of C. perfringens in concentrations from 0. 25 to 4. 5 mg/ml. The growth of E. cecorum was inhibited by coconut, <b>babassu,</b> Cuphea, <b>palm</b> kernel, muru-muru and tucuma oil in MIC range between 1. 12 - 4. 5 mg/ml. The only compound active against L. monocytogenes was Cuphea oil (MIC 1. 12 mg/ml).

For example, in Brazil, the production of soap stock (one of the wastes of the oil neutralization process in soybean oil refining) amounts to 2 - 3 % of the total oil production and is affected by the fatty acid content of the oil. Brazil is also among the main producers of vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, <b>babassu</b> oil and <b>palm</b> oil (Oliveira et al. 2009). India, another major developing country, has a high capacity to generate vegetable oil and there are significant waste from industries associated with soybean, sunflower, olive, groundnut, rapeseed, safflower, sesame, coconut, palm and mustard oils refining among many others (Pandey et al. 2003). The contribution of developed countries is also significant, in the United States for example, soybean oil refining processes potentially produce 100 million pounds of soap stock, which retails at 1 / 10 th the cost of the refined vegetable oil (Dumont and Narine 2007). The raw waste and the wastewaters generated from these industries are major source of water and land pollution because of problems in degradability of high lipid components of these wastes (Cammarota and Freire 2006).|$|R
40|$|The {{oil palm}} (Elaeis guineensis) and the babassu (Orbignya phalerata) are palms of {{commercial}} interest in tropical countries and {{are found in}} the Brazilian Amazon. The oil from these palms has diverse uses, such as food, production of charcoal, soap and, most recently, biodiesel. The remainder of the plant, which is the bulk, is not normally commercialized, making it an ideal alternative source of low-cost energy for animal feed. The systems for breeding wild animals in captivity for commercialization and sustainability have an important role in conservation, because these species of game animals are under constant environmental pressure. For the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) production system, the major part of the cost is feed. If alternative sources of low-cost animal feed could be used in the animal?s diet, the production of the collared peccary could provide a new source of income for rural Brazilian producers. The use of co-products of oil <b>palm</b> and <b>babassu</b> {{has been found to be}} positive both for performance and for carcass characteristics of those animals bred in captivity. The replacement of 40 percent and 15 percent of the energy components of the traditional collared peccary diet with <b>babassu</b> and oil <b>palm,</b> respectively, showed the best improvement in the productive performance, demonstrating that they could reduce feeding costs while maintaining good animal development. 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiment was to classify 20 protein co-products and by-products of the biodiesel industry with potential to use in ruminant feeding. The meals evaluated were: cottonseed, canudo-de-pito, crambe, sunflower, castor-oil seeds detoxified with calcium, non-detoxified castor-oil seeds and soybean; and the cakes were: cottonseed, peanut, <b>babassu,</b> crambe, <b>palm</b> oil, sunflower, licuri, macauba seeds, non-detoxified castor-oil seeds, turnip and jatropha. The samples were quantified to determine dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein (NDFap), non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC), acid detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein (ADFap), lignin, cutin and starch levels. The CP profile was characterized in fractions A, B 1, B 2, B 3 and C. The in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility (IVNDFD), rumen degradable and undegradable protein, intestinal digestibility, indigestible neutral detergent fiber and undegradable neutral detergent insoluble protein were evaluated. The OM, CP, EE, NDFap, NFC, ADFap, lignin, cutin and starch contents varied from 81. 95 to 95. 41 %, 18. 92 to 57. 75 %, 0. 56 to 18. 40 %, 10. 13 to 62. 30 %, 3. 89 to 27. 88 %, 6. 15 to 36. 86 %, 1. 19 to 5. 04 %, 0 to 17. 87 % and 0. 68 to 14. 50 %, respectively. The values of fractions A, B 1, B 2, B 3 and C ranged from 5. 40 to 43. 31 %, 0. 08 to 37. 63 %, 16. 75 to 79. 39 %, 1. 86 to 59. 15 % and 0. 60 to 11. 47 %, respectively. Concentrations of IVDMD, IVNDFD, rumen-degradable and undegradable protein, intestinal digestibility, indigestible NDF and undegradable neutral detergent insoluble protein ranged from 31. 00 to 95. 92 %, 55. 04 to 97. 74 %, 41. 06 to 97. 61 %, 2. 39 to 58. 94, 9. 27 to 94. 26 %, 1. 05 to 40. 80 % and 0. 29 to 2. 92 %, respectively. Some of these products can replace soybean meal, specially the Macauba seeds cake, cottonseed meal and peanut and turnip cakes based on digestive characteristics...|$|R
