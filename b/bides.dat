2500|$|A band of brigands {{has been}} terrorizing {{planters}} in the area, and Georges learns that his master {{will be the}} next target. He tries to warn Alfred, who suspects Georges of being part of the plot. Georges nevertheless defends Alfred against four assailants, and is himself seriously wounded. Alfred finally recognizes Georges' loyalty, and has him carried home to his cabin to be cared for. But while demonstrating his gratitude with frequent visits, Alfred becomes desirous of Georges' young and beautiful wife, Zélie, who like Georges is a mulatto. Zélie is virtuous and dignified, and rejects Alfred. He finally lures her into a situation where he can attempt to rape her, but she pushes him away so forcefully that he falls and sustains a head injury. Zélie knows at once that by the Code noir she will have to die: [...] "Any slave who strikes his master, his mistress, the husband of his mistress, or their children, causing bruises or effusion of blood shall be punished by death." [...] Although Georges begs Alfred to pardon her, Zélie is executed by hanging. Georges escapes to the depths of the forest, where he joins the slave rebels or Maroons and <b>bides</b> his time.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, response to the ode by critics was mostly positive. Andrew Bradley declared in 1909 that [...] "The Immortality Ode, like King Lear, is its author's greatest product, but not his best piece of work." [...] When speaking of Grasmere and Wordsworth, Elias Sneath wrote in 1912: [...] "It witnessed the composition {{of a large number of}} poems, many of which may be regarded among the finest products of his imagination. Most of them have already been considered. However, one remains which, in the judgment of some critics, more than any other poem of the numerous creations of his genius, entitles him to a seat among the Immortals. This is the celebrated ... It is, in some respects, one of his most important works, whether viewed from the stand point of mere art, or from that of poetic insight." [...] George Harper, following Sneath in 1916, described the poem in positive terms and said, [...] "Its radiance comes and goes through a shimmering veil. Yet, when we look close, we find nothing unreal or unfinished. This beauty, though supernal, is not evanescent. It <b>bides</b> our return, and whoever comes to seek it as a little child will find it. The imagery, though changing at every turn, is fresh and simple. The language, though connected with thoughts so serious that they impart to it a classic dignity, is natural and for the most part plain.... Nevertheless, a peculiar glamour surrounds the poem. It is the supreme example of what I may venture to term the romance of philosophic thought." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the direct numerical evaluation of singular integrals arising in Boundary Integral Equations for displacement (BIE) and displacement gradients (<b>BIDE),</b> and {{the formulation of}} a Traction Boundary Integral Equation (TBIE) for solving general elastostatic crack problems. Subject to certain continuity conditions concerning displacements and tractions at the source point, singular integrals in the BIE and the <b>BIDE</b> corresponding to coe¦cients of displacement and displacement gradients at the source point are shown to be of a form that allows application of StokesÕ theorem. All the singular integrals in 3 -D BIE and <b>BIDE</b> are reduced to non-singular line integrals, and those in 2 -D BIE and <b>BIDE</b> are evaluated in closed form. Remaining terms involve regular integrals, and no references to Cauchy or Hadamard principal values are required. Continuous isoparametric interpolations used on continuous elements local to the source point are modiÞed to include unique displacement gradients at the source point which are compatible with all local tractions. The resulting numerical <b>BIDE</b> is valid for source points located arbitrarily on the boundary, including corners, and a procedure is given for constructing a TBIE from the <b>BIDE.</b> Some example solutions obtained using the present numerical method for the TBIE in 2 -D and 3 -D are presented...|$|R
