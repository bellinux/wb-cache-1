25|$|The Supreme Court of Canada {{ruled that}} the Government has the {{authority}} to amend the definition of marriage, but did not rule on whether or not such a change is required by the equality provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court stated that such a ruling is not necessary <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> had accepted the rulings of provincial courts to the effect that the change was required. The Court also ruled that given freedom of religion in the Charter of Rights, and wording of provincial human rights codes, it was highly unlikely that religious institutions could be compelled to perform same-sex marriages, though because solemnization of marriage is a matter for provincial governments, the proposed bill could not actually guarantee such protections.|$|E
500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> {{had been}} unable to raise any {{significant}} number of troops and Bowdoin could no longer trust local militias in the western counties, he proposed in early January 1787 the creation of a private militia to be funded by eastern merchants. [...] Revolutionary War General Benjamin Lincoln raised funds and men for the effort, and had 3,000 men in Worcester by January 19. [...] A standoff at the Springfield Armory on January 25 resulted in the death of several rebels, and Lincoln broke the main rebel force on February 4 in Petersham, ending large-scale resistance.|$|E
500|$|On December 17, Shumlin {{announced}} that he was dropping his plan to implement single-payer healthcare. The reforms, which required business and personal tax increases, had never advanced beyond the framework stage. Shumlin, who had missed two earlier financing deadlines, said that [...] "this is not the right time" [...] <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> had offered less funding than expected and [...] "the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state's economy." [...] The media also cited controversy surrounding comments made by economist Jonathan Gruber, who was involved in crafting and advocating for the plan, and Shumlin's failure to win a majority in the election as reasons for the cancellation. The decision, which Shumlin called the [...] "biggest disappointment" [...] of his career, drew a mixed response. Business groups lauded his [...] "pragmatic" [...] move but supporters of health care reform organized protests and said that it would end his political career.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> {{is legally}} obligated to provide Medicare {{benefits}} to older and disabled Americans, it cannot cut costs by restricting eligibility or benefits, except by {{going through a}} difficult legislative process, or by revising its interpretation of medical necessity. By statute, Medicare may only pay for items and services that are [...] "reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member", unless there is another statutory authorization for payment. Cutting costs by cutting benefits is difficult, but the program can also achieve substantial economies of scale {{in terms of the}} prices it pays for health care and administrative expenses—and, as a result, private insurers’ costs have grown almost 60% more than Medicare’s since 1970. Medicare’s cost growth is now the same as GDP growth and expected to stay well below private insurance’s for the next decade.|$|E
2500|$|By late May 1941, the Clark {{opposition}} {{group had}} successfully organized {{in advance of}} municipal elections and replaced all township leaders responsible for bringing the Winfield Park project to Clark. Attention now turned to stopping the mutual housing project, or at least transferring most of its costs and impact to someone else. [...] Opposition leaders carefully studied the publicity surrounding the earlier construction of the Audubon Park Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Project just outside Camden, New Jersey. [...] The community in that case had followed an unsuccessful strategy of attempting to stop the project with building codes and local ordinances. [...] All of these attempted blocks to construction were overturned by courts sympathetic to the powers given to the [...] by the Lanham Act. [...] The Clark opposition developed a new and innovative opposition strategy. [...] They would attempt to have the entire Winfield Park Mutual Housing project declared as a separate municipality by the New Jersey State Legislature. [...] As a separate municipality all costs for public services and facilities would be {{the responsibility of the}} residents of Winfield Park, and not the residents of Clark. [...] With Winfield Park Township established as a separate municipality, opponents believed the project would be killed <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> and potential residents would shy away from the overwhelming expenses and confusing legalities of this new governmental structure. Immediately Westbrook and other project supporters reacted to this strategy by declaring that the opposition was attempting the sabotage the entire national defense program. [...] In defiance, Westbrook declared that he was sure the project would not only survive this attack, but would actually outlive its surrounding communities.|$|E
6000|$|Yes; {{it will be}} a {{spectacle}} for all the world to watch, this big, slashing colt of a nation, that has got off with a flying start on a freshly littered course, being pulled back to the ruck by that very mutton-fisted jockey Necessity. There will be excitement in America when a few score millions of [...] "sovereigns" [...] discover that what they considered the outcome of their own Government is but the rapidly diminishing bounty of Nature; and that if they want to get on comfortably they must tackle every single problem from labour to finance humbly, without gasconade, and afresh. But at present they look [...] "that all the to-morrows shall be as to-day," [...] and if you argue with them they say that the Democratic Idea will keep things going. They believe in that Idea, and the less well-informed fortify themselves in their belief by curious assertions as to the despotism that exists in England. This is pure provincialism, of course; but it is very funny to listen to, especially when you compare the theory with the practice (pistol, chiefly) as proven in the newspapers. I have striven to find out where the central authority of the land lies. It isn't at Washington, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> can't do anything to the States save run the mail and collect a Federal tax or two. It isn't in the States, because the townships can do as they like; and it isn't in the townships, because these are bossed by alien voters or rings of patriotic homebred citizens. And it certainly is not in the citizens, because they are governed and coerced by despotic power of public opinion as represented by their papers, preachers, or local society. I found one man who told me that if anything went wrong in this huge congress of kings,--if there was a split or an upheaval or a smash,--the people in detail would be subject to the Idea of the sovereign people in mass. This is a survival from the Civil War, when, you remember, the people in a majority did with guns and swords slay and wound the people in detail. All the same, the notion seems very much like the worship by the savage of the unloaded rifle as it leans against the wall.|$|E

40|$|After {{winning the}} right to {{same-sex}} marriage in all 50 states in June, 2015, the LGBT community is once again battling in court for its rights, this time for the right of transgender people to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. In its “Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students,” <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> has recently interpreted federal law as requiring that transgender students be permitted to use bathroom and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity in schools receiving federal funding. In two separate lawsuits, 20 states have challenged the legitimacy of this interpretation. This Article examines the current court battles over transgender bathroom and locker room rights and discusses possible outcomes of the most contentious legal issues in dispute. These issues include: the procedures used by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> in issuing its interpretation; the substantial legitimacy of the interpretation; and the Constitutional authority of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> to issue its interpretation. The Article concludes that courts should uphold <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government’s</b> recent interpretation of federal civil rights law <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government’s</b> interpretation is a reasonable interpretation, lawfully issued, that mirrors the best medical and psychiatric practices for the protection and inclusion of a vulnerable group...|$|R

6000|$|There are two {{different}} modes of organizing a federal union. The federal authorities may represent the governments solely, and their acts may be obligatory only on the governments as such, or they may have the power of enacting laws and issuing orders which are binding directly on individual citizens. The former is the plan of the German so-called Confederation, and of the Swiss Constitution previous to 1847. It was tried in America {{for a few years}} immediately following the War of Independence. The other principle is that of the existing Constitution of the United States, and has been adopted within the last dozen years by the Swiss Confederacy. The Federal Congress of the American Union is a substantive part of the government of every individual state. Within the limits of its attributions, it makes laws which are obeyed by every citizen individually, executes them through its own officers, and enforces them by its own tribunals. This is the only principle which has been found, or which is ever likely to produce an effective federal government. A union between the governments only is a mere alliance, and subject to all the contingencies which render alliances precarious. If the acts of the President and of Congress were binding solely on the governments of New York, Virginia, or Pennsylvania, and could only be carried into effect through orders issued by those governments to officers appointed by them, under responsibility to their own courts of justice, no mandates of the federal government which were disagreeable to a local majority would ever be executed. Requisitions issued to a government have no other sanction or means of enforcement than war, and a federal army would have to be always in readiness to enforce the decrees of the federation against any recalcitrant state, subject to the probability that other states, sympathizing with the recusant, and perhaps sharing its sentiments on the particular point in dispute, would withhold their contingents, if not send them to fight in the ranks of the disobedient State. Such a federation {{is more likely to be}} a cause than a preventive of internal wars; and if such was not its effect in Switzerland until the events of the years immediately preceding 1847, it was only <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> felt its weakness so strongly that it hardly ever attempted to exercise any real authority. In America, the experiment of a federation on this principle broke down in the first few years of its existence, happily while the men of enlarged knowledge and acquired ascendancy who founded the independence of the Republic were still alive to guide it through the difficult transition. The [...] "Federalist," [...] a collection of papers by three of these eminent men, written in explanation and defense of the new federal Constitution while still awaiting the national acceptance, is even now the most instructive treatise we possess on federal government. In Germany, the more imperfect kind of federation, as all know, has not even answered the purpose of maintaining an alliance. It has never, in any European war, prevented single members of the confederation from allying themselves with foreign powers against the rest. Yet this is the only federation which seems possible among monarchical states. A king, who holds his power by inheritance, not by delegation, and who can not be deprived of it, nor made responsible to any one for its use, is not likely to renounce having a separate army, or to brook the exercise of sovereign authority over his own subjects, not through him, but directly by another power. To enable two or more countries under kingly government to be joined together in an effectual confederation, it seems necessary that they should all be under the same king. England and Scotland were a federation of this description during the interval of about a century between the union of the crowns and that of the Parliaments. Even this was effective, not through federal institutions, for none existed, but because the regal power in both Constitutions was so nearly absolute as to enable the foreign policy of both to be shaped according to a single will.|$|E

50|$|Towards the {{beginning}} of the 1900s, the Silver Party was formed, bringing many Republicans and Democrats together from the western states.

The Silver Party played a prominent role in Nevada’s politics in the 1894 and 1898 elections. The Silver Party later formed the Silver Democratic Party. The Silver Democratic Party was prominent in Nevada until the election of 1906. After the election of 1906, the Democratic and Republican parties became the two primary parties in Nevada.|$|R
