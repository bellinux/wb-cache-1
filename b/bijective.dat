5|$|The time-reversed {{dynamics}} of the automaton can be described by another cellular automaton. Clearly, {{for this to be}} possible, the update rule must be <b>bijective.</b> In the other direction, if the update rule is <b>bijective,</b> then it has an inverse function that is also <b>bijective.</b> This inverse function must be a cellular automaton rule. The proof of this fact uses the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata rules as the translation-invariant functions that are continuous with respect to the Cantor topology on the space of configurations.|$|E
5|$|They {{are defined}} as surjective homomorphisms (i.e., {{something}} maps to each vertex) that are also locally <b>bijective,</b> that is, a bijection on the neighbourhood of each vertex.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} maximal {{directed}} pseudoforests on n vertices, allowing self-loops, is nn, because for each vertex there are n possible endpoints for the outgoing edge. André Joyal used this fact {{to provide a}} <b>bijective</b> proof of Cayley's formula, {{that the number of}} undirected trees on n nodes is n'n2, by finding a bijection between maximal directed pseudoforests and undirected trees with two distinguished nodes. If self-loops are not allowed, the number of maximal directed pseudoforests is instead (n1)n.|$|E
5|$|The update rule is an {{injective}} function, that is, {{there are}} no two configurations that both map to the same common configuration. This condition is obviously implied by {{the assumption that the}} update rule is a bijection. In the other direction, the Garden of Eden theorem for cellular automata implies that every injective update rule is <b>bijective.</b>|$|E
5|$|Any general {{property}} of Banach spaces {{continues to hold}} for Hilbert spaces. The open mapping theorem states that a continuous surjective linear transformation from one Banach space to another is an open mapping meaning that it sends open sets to open sets. A corollary is the bounded inverse theorem, that a continuous and <b>bijective</b> linear function from one Banach space to another is an isomorphism (that is, a continuous linear map whose inverse is also continuous). This theorem is considerably simpler to prove {{in the case of}} Hilbert spaces than in general Banach spaces. The open mapping theorem is equivalent to the closed graph theorem, which asserts that a function from one Banach space to another is continuous if and only if its graph is a closed set. In the case of Hilbert spaces, this is basic in the study of unbounded operators (see closed operator).|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} is <b>bijective</b> {{if it is}} both injective and surjective. A <b>bijective</b> {{function is}} a bijection (one-to-one correspondence). A function is <b>bijective</b> {{if and only if}} every possible image is mapped to by exactly one argument. This equivalent condition is formally expressed as follow.|$|E
25|$|A bijection: a surjective {{one-to-one}} or surjective injective {{function is}} said to be <b>bijective,</b> also known as one-to-one correspondence. The green relation is <b>bijective,</b> but the red is not.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} all <b>bijective</b> affine transformations.|$|E
25|$|The {{dependence}} is reversible: The operators Fs,t are <b>bijective.</b>|$|E
25|$|This was proven by Georg Cantor in his 1874 uncountability proof, {{part of his}} {{groundbreaking}} {{study of}} different infinities, and later more simply in his diagonal argument. Cantor defined cardinality in terms of <b>bijective</b> functions: two sets have the same cardinality {{if and only if}} there exists a <b>bijective</b> function between them.|$|E
25|$|The {{continuous}} function in this theorem {{is not required}} to be <b>bijective</b> or even surjective.|$|E

25|$|Thus a Möbius {{transformation}} {{is always a}} <b>bijective</b> holomorphic function from the Riemann sphere to the Riemann sphere.|$|E
25|$|For most {{algebraic}} structures, including {{groups and}} rings, a homomorphism is an isomorphism if {{and only if}} it is <b>bijective.</b>|$|E
25|$|They {{are called}} {{isometric}} if {{there exists a}} <b>bijective</b> isometry between them. In this case, the two metric spaces are essentially identical.|$|E
25|$|This map is <b>bijective</b> since every {{function}} in C(βN) must be bounded and {{can then be}} restricted to a bounded scalar sequence.|$|E
25|$|Symmetric to {{the concept}} of a {{continuous}} map is an open map, for which images of open sets are open. In fact, if an open map f has an inverse function, that inverse is continuous, and if a continuous map g has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a <b>bijective</b> function f between two topological spaces, the inverse function f−1 need not be continuous. A <b>bijective</b> continuous function with continuous inverse function is called a homeomorphism.|$|E
25|$|A <b>bijective</b> monoid {{homomorphism}} {{is called}} a monoid isomorphism. Two monoids {{are said to be}} isomorphic if there is a monoid isomorphism between them.|$|E
25|$|If X is a {{set with}} no {{additional}} structure, a symmetry is a <b>bijective</b> map from the set to itself, giving rise to permutation groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{case with}} all {{threshold}} values equal to 1 corresponds to <b>bijective</b> numeration, where the zeros correspond to separators of numbers with digits which are non-zero.|$|E
25|$|And since α {{is also an}} injection, {{the lines}} in P3 are thus in <b>bijective</b> {{correspondence}} with the points of this quadric in P5, called the Plücker quadric or Klein quadric.|$|E
25|$|One {{can also}} {{consider}} actions of monoids on sets, {{by using the}} same two axioms as above. This does not define <b>bijective</b> maps and equivalence relations however. See semigroup action.|$|E
25|$|Two Lie {{groups are}} called {{isomorphic}} if {{there exists a}} <b>bijective</b> homomorphism between them whose inverse is also a Lie group homomorphism. Equivalently, it is a diffeomorphism {{which is also a}} group homomorphism.|$|E
25|$|A <b>bijective</b> module {{homomorphism}} is an isomorphism of modules, {{and the two}} modules {{are called}} isomorphic. Two isomorphic modules are identical for all practical purposes, differing solely in the notation for their elements.|$|E
25|$|Composing {{these two}} maps either way: Qε(M) → Qε(M) → Qε(M) or Qε(M) → Qε(M) → Qε(M) yields {{multiplication}} by 2, and thus these maps are <b>bijective</b> if 2 is invertible in R, with the inverse given by multiplication with 1/2.|$|E
25|$|The Euclidean transformations or Euclidean motions are the (<b>bijective)</b> {{mappings}} {{of points}} of the Euclidean plane to themselves which preserve distances between points. There are four types of these mappings (also called isometries): translations, rotations, reflections and glide reflections.|$|E
25|$|If a {{morphism}} f is <b>bijective,</b> {{then its}} inverse {{is also a}} morphism, and we call f an isomorphism and the two G-sets X and Y are called isomorphic; for all practical purposes, they are indistinguishable in this case.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} <b>bijective</b> proof, {{while being}} more involved {{than the previous}} one, provides a more natural explanation for the term n+1 appearing in the denominator of the formula forC'n.

25|$|The {{covariance}} matrix defines a <b>bijective</b> transformation (encoding) for all solution vectors into a space, where the sampling takes place with identity {{covariance matrix}}. Because the update equations in the CMA-ES are invariant under linear coordinate system transformations, the CMA-ES can be re-written as an adaptive encoding procedure {{applied to a}} simple evolution strategy with identity covariance matrix.|$|E
25|$|Möbius transformations {{can be more}} {{generally}} defined in spaces of dimension n>2 as the <b>bijective</b> conformal orientation-preserving maps from the n-sphere to the n-sphere. Such a transformation is the most general form of conformal mapping of a domain. According to Liouville's theorem a Möbius transformation can be expressed as a composition of translations, similarities, orthogonal transformations and inversions.|$|E
25|$|From {{these two}} axioms, {{it follows that}} for every g in G, the {{function}} which maps x in X to g⋅x is a <b>bijective</b> map from X to X (its inverse being the function which maps x to g−1⋅x). Therefore, one may alternatively define a group action of G on X as a group homomorphism from G into the symmetric group Sym(X) of all bijections from X to X.|$|E
25|$|The {{symmetric}} group S'n on a finite set of n symbols {{is the group}} whose elements are all the permutations of the n symbols, and whose group operation is the composition of such permutations, which are treated as <b>bijective</b> functions from the set of symbols to itself.

25|$|A {{cellular}} automaton is reversible if, for every current {{configuration of the}} {{cellular automaton}}, there is exactly one past configuration (preimage). If one thinks of a cellular automaton as a function mapping configurations to configurations, reversibility implies that this function is <b>bijective.</b> If a cellular automaton is reversible, its time-reversed behavior can also {{be described as a}} cellular automaton; this fact is a consequence of the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata. For cellular automata in which not every configuration has a preimage, the configurations without preimages are called Garden of Eden patterns.|$|E
