40|$|Abstract—With {{the phenomenal}} {{growth in the}} {{popularity}} of social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, {{there has been an}} ever increasing concern about the privacy threats posed by these sites. Typical users enter lots of personal details about themselves and are oblivious to the possible consequences like identity theft and stalking. There is an urgent need to educate users about how their personal data is being manipulated by other users on these sites and there has been surprisingly little work on this. In this paper, we introduce the concept of negotiated audit in social networking sites which gives users valuable feedback about how their data is being used. Our design has three levels of auditing for both sharing and browsing data: no audit, complete audit and anonymous audit. Users can classify their data as requiring some level of auditing and can also set their <b>browsing</b> <b>preference</b> to one of the auditing levels. Users can only see some data if their <b>browsing</b> <b>preference</b> is compatible with the data’s audit level thus giving rise to negotiation of how much users are willing to reveal about their activities and how much data {{they will be able to}} access. We implemented Sh@re, a simple social network which incorporates privacy feedback for users based on these three levels of auditing. Index Terms—Privacy, Social networks, Negotiated audit. I...|$|E

To describe the importance and to estimate the influence of cattle on groves, the behavior of cattle around trees and shrubs was observed on six semi-open pastures in the mountain range of Thuringia and the Southern Black Forest (Germany). The groves were divided into formations, species and structures. The cattle used the groves more for browsing than rubbing. Significantly preferred species calculated by Chesson-Index were dogwood (Cornus sanguinea), black elder (Sambucus nigra), fly honeysuckle (Lonicera xylosteum), plum (Prunus domestica), osier (Salix viminalis), white beam (Sorbus chamaemespilus), and guelder rose (Viburnum opulus). The <b>browsing</b> <b>preference</b> is discussed in relation to nutritional importance and as self-medication. Cattle suppressed some species according to the utilization frequency, but for other species, there was no correlation. The animals preferred the tree hedges in comparison to the other formations. Hedges were utilized as shelter in extreme weather. In addition, under high browsing pressure, hedges were sustained and regenerated. Hedges on pastures turned out to be important for cattle under several aspects and accordingly should be preserved...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature is}} available on <b>browsing</b> <b>preference</b> for certain tree species. However, useful predictive tools for estimating the impact of deer on forests production and biodiversity can still be improved. A {{step in that direction}} is not only to rank preference among tree species but also to quantify the relative risk of being browsed. The foraging selectivity of moose was evaluated using three different statistical methods developed to study habitat utilization. The general pattern for the three methods was consistent. From the results, groups of forage species were clustered and a quantitative index of selectivity was calculated for the groups. The selectivity index showed that rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), willow (Salix ssp.) and aspen (Populus tremula) had a 14 times higher probability of being browsed than a group consisting of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and downy birch (Betula pubescens), while juniper (Juniperus communis) and silver birch (Betula pendula) had a 3. 5 times higher probability than Scots pine and downy birch. Since the most preferred species were the least abundant, one should be cautious about the generality of the index between areas, as it may indicate that preference depends on plant species composition. The method used can easily be applied in forest management. Information on quantitative selectivity indices may improve the possibility of managing moose in accordance with acceptable browsing damage...|$|E

Department of Wildland Resources, Utah State University, Logan, UT 84322, USA In the Intermountain West, elk (Cervus elaphus) {{often occur}} in high numbers {{and in some}} cases over-use the best quality rangeland, potentially threatening other wildlife species such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Many shrub-dominated communities are in late successional stages, dominated by mature even-aged shrubs with little recruitment of young plants. Elk supplementation is an attractive option for reducing competition and for rejuvenating sagebrush stands through browsing since nutrients allow ungulates to ingest a greater proportion of low-quality and secondary compound-containing woody species like sagebrush. We offered choices of high-energy (molasses) and high-protein (soybean meal) supplements presented in 4 feeders (2 feeders/supplement) to encourage elk to visit and forage an unproductive sagebrush stand. Elk preferred (2 : 1) molasses to soybean meal and a scan sampling technique using trail cameras revealed elk consuming supplement and browsing sagebrush on 69 ± 8. 5 % and 40 ± 4. 8 % of the scans recorded (N= 820), respectively. Sagebrush utilization was measured in a 5 m wide belt transect within a distance of 100 m from the feeders and it was 75 - 100 %, 50 - 75 %, 25 - 50 %, 5 - 25 %, and 0 - 5 % at 0, 40, 80 and 100 m from the feeders.

This method is useful for studying cryptic browsing in particular. When presented with a choice to forage on willow and aspen versus pine (mimicking natural tree stands) all deer species tended to not use pine. In addition, we found that the deer species had different preferences for willow and aspen. Moose and roe deer preferred goat willow whereas red deer showed no clear preference. These preferences have implications in the area of forest management. The knowledge of deer preferences for certain trees may allow forest managers to better predict forest damages and successional stages based on the amount and species’ of trees available to ungulates.|$|R
40|$|Reindeer {{can have}} strong {{effects on the}} plant species {{composition}} and functioning of tundra ecosystems, and often promote a transition towards a graminoid-dominated vegetation type. As a result, they influence many ecological processes, such as nutrient dynamics, soil biotic composition and functioning, and carbon storage. Several {{studies suggest that the}} effect of reindeer on vegetation may follow predictable patterns and could induce an alternative stable vegetation state. However, little empirical data on the long-term stability of reindeer effects on vegetation exist, as it is inherently challenging to study these ecological processes experimentally on a sufficiently long timescale. The main objective of this thesis was therefore {{to gain a better understanding}} of the long-term ecological processes following reindeer-induced vegetation shifts. In order to gain a more mechanistic insight in what initially drives this transition, I used a field-based grazing simulation experiment in which I separated defoliation, trampling, moss removal and the addition of feces. This allowed me to test the relative contribution of reindeer-related activities to initiating the shift from moss and heath- dominated tundra towards a graminoid-dominated vegetation state. Additionally, I studied the long-term ecological stability following such a vegetation shift. I did this by addressing historical milking grounds (HMGs) : sites where high reindeer concentrations associated with historical traditional reindeer herding practices induced a vegetation transition from shrubs towards graminoids several centuries earlier, but which were abandoned a century ago. Studying HMGs allowed me to address: 1. The potential stability of reindeer-induced vegetation shifts; 2. The ecological mechanisms contributing to the long-term stability of these vegetation shifts; and 3. How such long-lasting vegetation changes influence soil carbon- and nutrient cycling. I found that trampling by reindeer is an important mechanism by which reindeer cause vegetation change. Addressing HMGs further revealed that this vegetation change can be hightly persistent, as the studied HMGs showed only a low encroachment at the surrounding borders in the last 50 years. The vegetation in the core areas of all studied HMGs had remained strikingly stable, and were hardly invaded by surrounding shrubs. Interestingly, soil nutrient concentrations and microbial activities were still different from the surrounding area as well, and even comparable to actively grazed areas. Even after many centuries of changed vegetation composition and soil processes, there was no difference in total carbon sequestration. This suggests that the environmental conditions for microbial decomposition were more important than vegetation composition for the soil carbon stocks, in our study site. After studying the contemporary habitat use of HMGs by reindeer and other herbivores, investigating the potential plant-soil feedbacks mechanisms and detailed soil analyses, I concluded that several ecological mechanisms contribute to the long-term stability of HMGs: first, the altered soil biotic and abiotic conditions appear to have a stronger advantage for HMG vegetation than for the surrounding tundra vegetation. Furthermore, I found a clear <b>browsing</b> <b>preference</b> of small rodents on single shrubs proliferating in HMGs, causing a strong limitation on shrub expansion. Moreover, the dense established sward of graminoids likely poses a strong direct competition for space and nutrients, hindering seedling establishment. Finally, I conclude that HMGs are highly stable on relevant ecological timescales, and propose how the concepts of historical contingency and ASS can be applied to understand stability of these reindeer-induced vegetation transitions...|$|E

30|$|Large herbivores {{may affect}} {{ecosystem}} processes and states, but such {{effects can be}} difficult to quantify, especially within multispecies assemblages. To better understand such processes and improve our predictive ability of systems undergoing change, herbivore diets can be studied using controlled feeding trials (or cafeteria tests). With some wildlife, such as large herbivores, it is impractical to empirically verify these findings, because it requires visually observing animals in forested environments, which can disturb them from their natural behaviors. Yet, in field-based cafeteria trials it is nearly impossible to differentiate selection between herbivore species that forage on similar plants and make very similar bite marks. However, during browsing ungulates leave saliva residue which includes some buccal cells and DNA that can be extracted for species identification. Here we used a newly developed eDNA-based method (biteDNA) to test the <b>browsing</b> <b>preferences</b> of four sympatric ungulate species in the wild. Overall, food preferences varied between species, but all species strongly preferred deciduous over coniferous species. Our method allows the study of plant-animal interactions in multispecies assemblages at very fine detail.|$|R

In a pairwise <b>browse</b> <b>preference</b> experiment, deer <b>browsed</b> at similar levels on branches of L. maackii with fruits removed and fruits intact (mean ± 95 % CI 57 ± 14 and 62 ± 14 %, respectively).

We quantified the spatial and temporal variation in four key aspects of the foliar chemistry (total nitrogen, available nitrogen, in vitro dry matter digestibility and tannin effect) of 275 trees representing five native tree species. Simultaneously, we assessed the severity of browsing damage caused by possums on those trees in order to relate selective browsing to foliar nutritional quality. We found significant spatial and temporal variation in nutritional quality among individuals of each tree species examined, as well as among tree species. There was a positive relationship between the available nitrogen concentration of foliage (a measure of in vitro digestible protein) and the severity of damage caused by browsing by possums. This study highlights the importance of nutritional quality, specifically, the foliar available nitrogen concentration of individual trees, in predicting the impact of an invasive mammal.

Diet preference and a selection order was established for the 8 browse species by calculating instantaneous intake rates (IIR, mg/sec) following 2 types of feeding trials. A 30 -sec single species feeding trial allowed for the observation of IIR by goats on only one species. The multiple species trial allowed for goats to select their <b>browse</b> <b>preference</b> during a 5 -min time period. According to IIR, goat diet preference for both trials was: lime pricklyash > brasil > hogplum > spiny hackberry > catclaw acacia > Texas persimmon > huisache > kidneywood. Physical and chemical attributes of the browse species were measured and either elicited or deterred a grazing response. For both trials (single and multiple) significant correlations (P < 0. 05) between physical traits and IIR included leaf weight (0. 65, 0. 61) and canopy volume (0. 44, 0. 51). Additionally, three wavelengths were identified by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as contributors or deterrents to intake. These included: 1612 nm, 2148 nm and 2452 nm. Wavelength 1612 nm is associated with olefins, a form of alkenes, and wavelengths 2148 nm and 2452 nm are associated with aromatic compounds. One common olefin is ethylene, which is involved in plant growth responses and abscission of leaves.

Two cafeteria trials, each lasting 10 days, were conducted using four local mature male goats of 2 - 2. 5 years receiving a daily ration of grass hay (4 % of body weight) and 200 g wheat bran. In trial 1, goats were offered 25 g of each browse species {{for a total of}} 30 min with intake, time spent on consumption and the number of visits to specific browse species recorded at 10 -min intervals. In trial 2, the same procedure was followed except that 25 g of PEG 4000 was added to the daily wheat bran ration. Crude protein and neutral detergent fibre in browse species ranged from 69. 0 - 245. 5 to 159. 8 - 560. 6 g/kg dry matter (DM) respectively. Total phenols and total tannins contents ranged between 3. 7 - 70. 6 and 2. 5 - 68. 1 mg tannic acid equivalent/g DM, respectively, and condensed tannins 1. 7 - 18. 4 Abs 550 nm /g DM.

40|$|W i t h 6 T a b l e s] The {{relative}} selectivity by moose of twigs f rom 26 browse {{species was}} {{tested in a}} small enclosure from June 1971 to March 1973. Twigs of Vaccinium vitis-idaea, V. myrtillus, Pirus communis, Rubus idaeus, and Salix cinerea were highly preferred by moose on a year long basis. Sixteen species were moderately preferred. Fraxinus excelsior, Sa-rothamnus scoparius, Ribes nigrum, Oxycoccus quadripetalus, and Evonymus verrucosa were classed as low <b>preference</b> <b>browse.</b> Selectivity varied significantly among seasons. Species preference by season were: Spring — Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Ledum palustre, Vaccinium myrtillus...|$|R
40|$|Herbivory by {{white-tailed deer}} (Odocoileus virginianus) can affect forest regeneration. Typical {{measures}} to ensure forest regeneration have included physical barriers or direct manipulation of deer densities. However, altering silvicultural practices to provide abundant deer forage {{has not been}} tested thoroughly. We examined <b>browse</b> species <b>preferences</b> and changes in herbivory rates in 1 – 6 year old regeneration areas from 2001 to 2004 in the central Appalachians on the MeadWestvaco Wildlife and Ecosystem Research Forest in West Virginia. Woody vegetation reached the maximum plot coverage by the 4 th growing season. However, the establishment of less abundant woody species, such as northern red oak (Quercus rubra),may be inhibited when browsed greater than or proportionally to occurrence. Herbivory rates declined precipitously {{as the amount of}} early successional habitat increased on our study site. We conclude that providing approximately 14 % of an area in well-distributed, even-aged managed forests can have substantial impacts on reducing herbivory rates. However, management practices also should consider harvesting effects on hard mast production, habitat requirements of other species, and hardwood lumber marketability...|$|R
40|$|This MFS was {{conducted}} in Ninh Thuan province, in the south-central of Vietnam, a developing country in the south-east of Asia. The Ninh Thuan province consists of large areas of natural rangelands, which are used for animal grazing. The area is unique in Vietnam because of the hot and dry climate, {{which means that the}} vegetation is limited and the botanical composition very special. Due to the low amount of rainfall over the last years there has been a decrease in productivity and changes in the botanical composition. Ninh Thuan has the highest production of sheep in Vietnam and in 2005 there was a total number of 56, 800 sheep. The sheep are of the breed Phan Rang, which can only be found in this area, and is very well adapted to the harsh and dry climate. Sheep are grazers, but when feed is scarce they are dependent on browsing. One herd of between 20 - 200 sheep was followed on pasture during 17 days between 4 th of April and 13 th of May, in order to study their behaviour and <b>browse</b> <b>preferences.</b> Observations were taken every 15 minutes to a total number of 438 registrations. The sheep were on pasture approximately between 7 am and 5 pm with a break between 11 am and 1 : 30 pm. Activities that were recorded are walking, grazing, browsing, eating dead plants, and other activities such as sniffing, scratching, suckling and urinating. Twelve interviews with local farmers were also conducted in order to achieve an insight of the farmers’ view of the agricultural situation. The results showed that the most common activities are grazing (61. 2 %), walking (22. 5 %), eating dead plants (7. 0 %) and browsing (6. 6 %). There {{was no significant difference between}} the proportions of different activities in the morning and afternoon, but still a higher proportion of browsing could be seen in the morning. The most preferable browse species among the sheep were Xuong Rông (Opuntia monacantha Haw, cactus), 21. 9 %, Long giâý (not classified), 18. 8 %, Bôn bôn (Calotropis gigantean), 15. 6 %, Chùm lê´ (Azima sarmentosa), 9. 4 % and Dái chôn (not classified), 6. 3 %. This study will hopefully contribute to the species selection for reseeding the browse species...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate environmental factors influencing use of several plant communities by cattle, elk and deer; determine under story production by plant species and the amount utilized by cattle, elk and deer in certain plant communities; evaluate the interactions of range use between cattle, elk and deer; and look closely at potential and use of seeded clearcut forest communities during the spring, summer and fall on the Hall Ranch of the Northeastern Oregon Experiment Station, in Union County. Understory production was classified into three significant groups: the bunchgrass, forest, and clearcut groups. Soil depth and tree canopy cover accounted for 96 percent of the variability in understory production. Forested communities had a high potential for producing forage after logging. The Grand fir - pachistima habitat type had the greatest potential for producing quality seeded forage. The vegetation group most heavily utilized during spring and summer by deer, elk, and cattle was the clearcut. The four logged stands provided 66 percent of the forage consumed by deer and elk, and 63 percent of the forage consumed by cattle. Seeded grasses on the clearcut accounted for 30 percent of the big game diet and 55 percent of the cattle diet. Grass species generally did not have high preference indices for big game or cattle. Shrubs and forbs tended to have a high preference ratings for big game during spring and early summer. Forbs were generally unavailable for cattle by mid-summer, <b>Browse</b> <b>preference</b> indices for cattle were low. Factors having the greatest effect on pounds and percent of forage removed by big game during spring and early summer were pounds of palatable species produced per acre, soil depth, canopy cover and distance to water. Factors highly correlated with utilization by cattle during summer were distance to salt and water, soil depth and canopy cover. Big game pellet groups did not correlate with forage use among plant communities. Logged communities provided 66 percent of the total forage consumed by big game while they accounted for only 20 percent of the big game pellet groups. Cattle and big game animals utilized the study area during different seasons of the year. Big game were primarily present on the pasture during the winter, spring and early summer, By mid-summer elk and the majority of deer had moved to higher elevations. Cattle were present during mid- and late summer. Utilization measurements during the spring, summer and fall indicated no direct forage competition occurred between cattle and big game. Combined utilization by big game and cattle on forage species did not exceed acceptable levels...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the dynamics of language use among Swedish-speaking Finns regarding two specific aspects of internet use: browsing and blogging. The data was collected from persons with Swedish as their registered mother tongue in 2009. The results indicate a preference for using either Finnish or English when <b>browsing</b> and a <b>preference</b> for Swedish when blogging. Examining the background of these results, we found that people's linguistic environment {{played an important role}} in shaping their language competence and language identity, which, in turn, guided their language choice when using the internet. While browsing in Swedish and Finnish was directly affected by language competence, language identity and the composition of linguistic environment, blogging in Swedish and Finnish was only directly affected by language identity...|$|R
