To access the final edited and published work see [URL] improved performance of the cold fiber solid phase micro extraction (CF-SPME) technique was accomplished {{with the use of}} the pressure <b>balanced</b> <b>procedure.</b> In order to obtain a pressure-balanced state during extraction at 200 degrees C, 7 mL of air volume was withdrawn from 10 mL commercial vials, while 15 mL was withdrawn from vials where 5 mu L of diethylamine was added as a modifier/displacer. The benefits of the balanced system were demonstrated for determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from solid matrixes, including sand and certified sediment samples. Results showed the pressure-balanced procedure enhanced the extraction efficiency of the method, especially for high volatility compounds, as the leakage of analytes was mitigated under sample temperature conditions of 200 degrees C. Analytical precision was also improved, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranging from 4 % to 8 % for all analytes under study. For the determination of PAHs in certified sediment samples, pressure-balanced CF-SPME yielded more accurate results in comparison to nonpressure-balanced CF-SPME. The proposed methodology provided the additional benefit of improved recoveries at lower pressures. Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canad...|$|E
40|$|In {{civil and}} {{military}} aviation, ground based navigation aids (NAVAIDS) are still crucial for flight guidance {{even though the}} acceptance of satellite based systems (GNSS) increases. Part of the calibration process for NAVAIDS (ILS, DME, VOR) is to perform a flight inspection according to specified methods as stated in a document (DOC 8071, 2000) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). One major task {{is to determine the}} coverage, or, in other words, the true signal-in-space field strength of a ground transmitter. This has always been a challenge to flight inspection up to now, since, especially in the L-band (DME, 1 GHz), the antenna installed performance was known with an uncertainty of 10 dB or even more. In order to meet ICAO's required accuracy of &plusmn; 3 dB it is necessary to have a precise 3 -D antenna factor of the receiving antenna operating on the airborne platform including all losses and impedance mismatching. Introducing precise, effective antenna factors to flight inspection to achieve the required accuracy is new and not published in relevant papers yet. The authors try to establish a new <b>balanced</b> <b>procedure</b> between simulation and validation by airborne and ground measurements. This involves the interpretation of measured scattering parameters gained both on the ground and airborne in comparison with numerical results obtained by the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) accelerated method of moments (MoM) using a complex geometric model of the aircraft. First results will be presented in this paper...|$|E

50|$|Balancing an {{installation}} {{is a complicated}} and involved procedure because closing or throttling a valve will increase the flow {{in other parts of}} the installation.

The complicated nature of these <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure</b> is the reason that automatic solutions are gaining traction because it reduces or eliminates the need for complicated <b>balancing</b> <b>procedures.</b> Because of that differential pressure controllers and pressure independent valves are getting more and more popular.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundPatients having {{unilateral}} breast reconstruction {{often require}} a second stage procedure on the contralateral breast to improve symmetry. In {{order to provide}} immediate symmetry and minimize the frequency and extent of secondary procedures, we began performing simultaneous contralateral balancing operations {{at the time of}} initial reconstruction. This study examines the indications, safety, and efficacy of this approach. MethodsOne-hundred and two consecutive breast reconstructions with simultaneous contralateral <b>balancing</b> <b>procedures</b> were identified. Data included patient age, body mass index (BMI), type of reconstruction and <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure,</b> specimen weight, transfusion requirement, complications and additional surgery under anesthesia. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare BMI, specimen weight and need for non-autologous transfusion. ResultsAverage patient age was 48 years. The majority had autologous tissue-only reconstructions (94 %) and the rest prosthesis-based reconstructions (6 %). <b>Balancing</b> <b>procedures</b> included reduction mammoplasty (50 %), mastopexy (49 %), and augmentation mammoplasty (1 %). Average BMI was 27 and average reduction specimen was 340 grams. Non-autologous blood transfusion rate was 9 %. There was no relationship between BMI or reduction specimen weight and need for transfusion. We performed secondary surgery in 24 % of the autologous group and 100 % of the prosthesis group. Revision rate for symmetry was 13 % in the autologous group and 17 % in the prosthesis group. ConclusionsPerforming balancing at the time of breast reconstruction is safe and most effective in autologous reconstructions, where 87 % did not require a second operation for symmetry...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{ligament}} <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure</b> during total knee arthroplasty a force-sensing device to intraoperatively measure knee joint forces and moments has been developed. It {{consists of two}} sensitive plates, one for each condyle, a tibial base plate {{and a set of}} spaces to adapt the device thickness to the patient-specific tibiofemoral gap. Each sensitive plate is equipped with three deformable bridges instrumented with thick-film piezoresistive sensors, which allow accurate measurements of the amplitude and location of the tibiofemoral contact forces. The net varus-valgus moment is then computed to characterize the ligamentous imbalance. The developed device has a measurement range of 0 - 500 N and an intrinsic accuracy of 0. 5 % full scale. Experimental trials on a plastic knee joint model and on a cadaver specimen demonstrated the proper function of the device in situ.

40|$|Conclusion In {{users of}} a {{cochlear}} implant (CI) and {{a hearing aid}} (HA) in contralateral ears, frequency-dependent loudness balancing between devices did, on average, not lead to improved speech understanding as compared to broadband balancing. However, nine out of 15 bimodal subjects showed significantly better speech understanding with either one of the fittings. Objectives Sub-optimal fittings and mismatches in loudness are possible explanations for the large individual differences seen in listeners using bimodal stimulation. Methods HA gain was adjusted for soft and loud input sounds in three frequency bands (0 - 548, 548 - 1000, and > 1000 Hz) to match loudness with the CI. This procedure was compared to a simple broadband <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure</b> that reflected current clinical practice. In a three-visit cross-over design with 4 weeks between sessions, speech understanding was tested in quiet and in noise and questionnaires were administered to assess benefit in real world. Results Both procedures resulted in comparable HA gains. For speech in noise, a marginal bimodal benefit of 0. 3 +/- 4 dB was found, with large differences between subjects and spatial configurations. Speech understanding in quiet and in noise did not differ between the two loudness <b>balancing</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new scheme {{to balance the}} DC bus voltages of a cascaded H-bridge converter which {{is used as a}} Distribution Static Synchronous Series Compensator (D-SSSC) in electrical distribution network. The aim of D-SSSC is to control the power flow between two feeders from different substations. As a result of different cell losses and capacitors tolerance the cells DC bus voltage can deviate from their reference values. In the proposed scheme, by individually modifying the reference PWM signal for each cell, an effective <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure</b> is derived. The new <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure</b> needs only the line current sign and is independent of the main control strategy, which controls the total DC bus voltages of cascaded H-bridge. The effect of modulation index variation on the capacitor voltage is analytically derived for the proposed strategy. The proposed method takes advantages of phase shift carrier based modulation and can be applied for a cascaded H-bridge with any number of cells. Also the system is immune to loss of one cell and the presented <b>procedure</b> can keep <b>balancing</b> between the remaining cells. Simulation studies and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the balancing of DC bus voltages...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of load {{balancing}} in 802. 11 -based wireless networks, operating in infrastructure mode. In a large wireless network with multiple collocated Access Points (AP), a load balancing policy {{is necessary for the}} distribution of the wireless stations (WS) to the AP’s, so as the network performance to be maximized. Already proposed algorithms, which are based only on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), may cause all the WS to be associated to a single or to a very few number of AP, and result in an overall network performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a load <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure,</b> which acts in two separate levels. First, the AP’s are either distributed across the channels (if the number of AP is small) or located in the same channel that is specified by taking into account the channel-location and the received RSSI of the neighbor AP. Second, the WS are distributed across all the available AP based not only on RSSI measurements but also on the number of WS already associated to the AP and other link quality measurements. Besides, in this paper we describe the signaling extension needed for the implementation of the proposed load <b>balancing</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Based on the {{determination}} of the zero-flux plane, a water <b>balance</b> <b>procedure</b> for large-scale experimental databases was automated to estimate the soil water balance based on soil water content distribution with depth through time. The automated procedure was verified using data from the BOREAS project obtained in three Intensive Field Campaigns during {{the spring and summer of}} 1994. The data used correspond to four tower sites measuring atmospheric fluxes above the forest canopy from the Northern and Southern Study Areas and are designated according to the predominant vegetation in the area as Old Jack Pine and Young Jack Pine. The total hydraulic head through time at these sites is determined to identify the position of the zero-flux plane, which separates that part of the soil profile in which water flow is upward from the region in which the water flow is downward. In conjunction with precipitation and soil water content data, the procedure allows estimation of the actual soil water balance, the water used from the region above the zero-flux plane being evapotranspiration, and the change in soil water content below the mean zero-flux plane being drainage. Prior to this study, no published attempt had been made to automate a water <b>balance</b> <b>procedure</b> for large-scale experimental databases based on the position of the zero-flux plane and soil water content distribution through time...|$|R
