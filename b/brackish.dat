5|$|The <b>Brackish</b> Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility, a Bureau of Reclamation {{laboratory}} {{doing research}} and development on desalination of <b>brackish</b> water, is located in Alamogordo.|$|E
5|$|In Cartagena, Colombia {{a marine}} biologist, Fredy Orjuela, found ctenophores in <b>brackish</b> water (20-28 upp.).|$|E
5|$|The ditches are {{populated}} with aquatic and bankside plant species. These include the nationally restricted rootless duckweed (Wolffia arrhiza). Other uncommon {{species such as}} frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae) and water fern (Azolla filiculoides) can also be found. The nationally restricted <b>brackish</b> water-crowfoot (Ranunculus baudotii) and sea clubrush (Scirpus maritimus) indicate the slightly <b>brackish</b> nature of the water.|$|E
5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in <b>brackish</b> water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. <b>Brackish</b> water populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea or up to 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from <b>brackish</b> water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. <b>Brackish</b> water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense <b>brackish</b> water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from <b>brackish</b> to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump {{water out of the}} mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are a very}} widespread {{group of}} fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or <b>brackish</b> water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the <b>brackish</b> dolphins). There are five extant species of river dolphins, and two subspecies. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is a habitat generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including <b>brackish</b> marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits <b>brackish</b> marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to <b>brackish</b> and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis, {{common name}} the river nerite, is {{a species of}} small {{freshwater}} and <b>brackish</b> water snail with a gill and an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Neritidae, the nerites.|$|E
5|$|As deduced {{from the}} {{presence}} of freshwater molluscs, Lake Cahuilla was a freshwater lake during its highstand, while lower lake level stages show fossil evidence of increased salinity. Alternatively the lake may have been <b>brackish.</b> The salinity may have been lower where the Colorado entered the lake and higher farther north.|$|E
5|$|Following the film's success, a prequel novel {{entitled}} Independence Day: Silent Zone {{was written}} by Molstad in February 1998. The novel {{is set in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, and details the early career of Dr. <b>Brackish</b> Okun.|$|E
5|$|Representatives of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are also found in aquatic habitats, {{including}} freshwater and <b>brackish</b> marshes. Several members are associated with plants and {{are found in the}} rhizosphere, having certain relationships with the plant. Some strains are also found in the cocoons of the earthworm Eisenia fetida.|$|E
5|$|The {{aquifers}} of shallow wells with depths varying from , yielding {{little more}} than 2 cubic metres/hour (71 cu ft), vary widely in availability. Deeper aquifers offer larger quantities of water, but its quality is generally <b>brackish.</b> The wadis are generally dry, usually only inundated after rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} pintail's breeding {{habitat is}} open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or tundra. In winter, it will utilise {{a wider range}} of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, <b>brackish</b> marshes and coastal lagoons. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the shell of <b>brackish</b> water populations is 9.3mm. <b>Brackish</b> water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|This {{cladogram}} {{shows that}} the sister group to clade B is clade C. They split in 5–11.5 Ma, when Lake Pannon existed. Theodoxus species living in <b>brackish</b> water include Theodoxus fluviatilis and Theodoxus jordani, but they are apparently not closely related.|$|E
5|$|This widely {{distributed}} neritid snail species occurs from Europe to Central Asia. It has a thick shell with a calcified operculum. The coloration {{pattern on the}} shell is very variable. Theodoxus fluviatilis lives in freshwater and in <b>brackish</b> water, in rivers and lakes on stones. It feeds mainly by grazing on biofilms and diatoms.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{movements}} are poorly known, tagging patterns {{indicate that the}} smooth toadfish spends most of its life cycle and reproduces in estuaries. It can venture well into freshwater past <b>brackish</b> areas. In 1964 a school of toadfish {{were found in the}} Lang Lang River at the South Gippsland Highway—34km (21mi) from Western Port Bay and well beyond tidal areas.|$|E
5|$|Behind the sea wall, {{the marshes}} were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but {{the bank was}} {{breached}} in the North Sea flood of 1953, returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea aster. The {{construction of a new}} sea wall across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon, with a reed bed on its northern side and a vegetation-free <b>brackish</b> marsh.|$|E
5|$|Brent Spiner as Dr. <b>Brackish</b> Okun, the unkempt {{and highly}} excitable {{scientist}} {{in charge of}} research at Area 51. Dr. Okun {{appeared to have been}} killed by an alien but returned in the sequel, where it was revealed that the character had merely been in a coma. The character's appearance and verbal style are based upon those of visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun, with whom Emmerich had worked on Stargate.|$|E
5|$|Disjunct {{populations of}} the giant {{freshwater}} stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another; though the species occurs in <b>brackish</b> environments, {{there is no evidence}} that it crosses marine waters. This is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat. Unexpectedly, it can sometimes be found near heavily populated urban areas.|$|E
5|$|Facilities {{include three}} bird hides, a seawatching platform, two nature trails, and a visitor centre. Because of {{concerns}} about climate change, a major project in 2010 and 2011 brought improvements to the banks around the freshwater lagoon and {{the conversion of the}} <b>brackish</b> lagoon to tidal saltmarsh, a more effective barrier to encroachment by the sea.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit <b>brackish</b> water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with the}} Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Next is the Menefee Formation, {{the middle}} {{formation}} whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of <b>brackish</b> water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional {{environment and the}} organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to <b>brackish</b> water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789)– was {{described}} from <b>brackish</b> water by Linnaeus {{as a separate}} species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that {{its status as a}} subspecies is unjustified, being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although these so-called forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, they are probably just ecomorphs.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis serves an {{indicator}} species for river monitoring (in Germany); however the spreading populations {{also have a}} high tolerance for degraded habitats. Theodoxus fluviatilis has a large phenotypic plasticity: it was found living on stones and on dead wood in freshwater environments; whereas it lives on stones and on Fucus vesiculosus, Potamogeton spp. and Zostera marina in <b>brackish</b> water in the Baltic Sea. The species {{can also be found}} on aggregates of Mytilus.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Boston Fire of 1872, workers used {{building}} rubble as landfill {{along the}} downtown waterfront. During the mid- to-late 19th century, workers filled almost 600acres (2.4km2) of <b>brackish</b> Charles River marshlands west of Boston Common with gravel brought by rail {{from the hills}} of Needham Heights. The city annexed the adjacent towns of South Boston (1804), East Boston (1836), Roxbury (1868), Dorchester (including present day Mattapan and a portion of South Boston) (1870), Brighton (including present day Allston) (1874), West Roxbury (including present day Jamaica Plain and Roslindale) (1874), Charlestown (1874), and Hyde Park (1912). Other proposals were unsuccessful for the annexation of Brookline, Cambridge, and Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|As {{distance}} between {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the salinity in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as <b>brackish</b> water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9ppt and falls again to 0.81ppt at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{appear in}} the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of living species is about 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine {{bivalves}} (including <b>brackish</b> water and estuarine species) represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The freshwater bivalves include seven families, the largest of which are the Unionidae, with about 700 species.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large <b>brackish</b> river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in <b>brackish</b> water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|Green Lake formed {{initially}} as {{a northern}} inlet of San Antonio Bay. As the Guadalupe River shifted westward about 2,500 years ago, it deposited silt, developing a delta that prograded into San Antonio Bay. Around 2,200years ago the delta discharge extended completely across the bay, severing the northern extension from the system, which formed present-day Green Lake. Pottery and burial grounds {{found in the}} area suggest a presence of Karankawa Indians {{at the time of}} formation. Middens uncovered north of the lake contained shells from the <b>brackish</b> water-species of rangia clams (rangia cuneata).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili caused great {{environmental}} {{damage to the}} marshes and barrier islands in Louisiana. Huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp. The barrier islands {{to the east of}} the landfall point, those subjected to the highest surge, were severely eroded. Sand was also deposited behind them into the <b>brackish</b> marshes, burying vegetation. The freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.|$|E
5|$|Mysids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world in both shallow and deep marine waters {{where they can be}} benthic or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and <b>brackish</b> ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E
5|$|The American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is also {{native to}} the region and has been {{designated}} as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in <b>brackish</b> or salt-water habitats such as estuarine or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females to abandon their nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road in the Florida Keys. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000crocodiles in southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|The Guimarota {{locality}} {{is located}} in the eastern Lusitanian Basin, {{which is part of the}} Iberian Meseta. The vertebrate-bearing Guimarota-strata was deposited in a <b>brackish</b> lagoon that periodically received both freshwater and saltwater influxes. Ecologically, the environment would have been akin to a modern mangrove swamp. Plants known from megafossils include the horsetails Equisetum and Schizoneura; the seed fern Caytonia; the cycad Otozamites; the araucaria Brachyphyllum; Ginkgo; and the charophyte algae Porochara. Additionally, plant families known only from pollen include lycopods, forked ferns, possible scaly tree ferns (which may be matoniaceans or dicksoniaceans instead), royal ferns, the seed fern Sphenopteris, cypresses, and pines. Most of the preserved organisms probably originated from around the swamp, although there may have been minimal transportation by water currents.|$|E
