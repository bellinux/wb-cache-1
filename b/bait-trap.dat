40|$|The {{honeypot}} {{has been}} proved effective in understanding intruders ’ tactics and tools which exploit system or software vulnerabilities. However, most current honeypots are manually and statically composed and deployed, leading to the following disadvantages: (1) It only exhibits a small and fixed spatial vulnerability window in terms of number and variety of vulnerable services; (2) It ignores current network activities and can only provide information on threats to deployed services. New vulnerabilities in a service not deployed in the honeypot will remain undetected. To address the limitations, this paper proposes the notion of catering honeypots and presents a catering honeypot architecture called <b>BAIT-TRAP.</b> The catering honeypot is a honeypot architecture that constantly monitors network traffic, identifies “bait ” services that are currently attractive to intruders, and dynamically creates honeypots running such services {{in the hope of}} quickly trapping the subsequent exploitations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal and implementation of catering honeypots. Our real-world deployment of <b>BAIT-TRAP</b> has captured a number of “trendy ” attack incidents, demonstrating the timeliness and trend awareness of catering honeypots. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate three packages viz., perforated polyethylene bagging, covering fruits by PVC pipe and poison bait trap against fruit fly on cucumber. Bagging of cucumber with perforated polyethylene bags at immature stage significantly reduced the fruit fly infestation. The level of fruit fly infestation under PVC pipe was higher compared with bagged ones but it was lower than <b>bait-trap</b> used. The bagging of fruits for combating the fruit fly on cucumber might be considered as an IPM package...|$|E
40|$|Twelve bait-traps {{were tested}} and {{compared}} {{in order to}} find the best lure for studying social wasp populations in North West Italy. Polistes associus Kohl, Polistes dominula (Christ), Polistes gallicus (L.), Polistes nimpha (Christ), Vespa crabro L., Vespa velutina Lepeletier, Vespula germanica (F.), Vespula vulgaris (L.), and Dolichovespula media (Retzius) were trapped for a total of 5, 077 specimens in the period 2007 - 2012. V. velutina was captured at Loano (Liguria) {{for the first time in}} Italy by means of a yellow cap trap filled with beer. V. crabro, V. germanica and V. vulgaris were the most abundant species in the social wasp communities studied. Beer in clear, colourless and transparent, 1. 5 l polyethylene bottles with yellow and white coloured caps was a good <b>bait-trap</b> combinations for all social wasp species, while it trapped only some Bombus terrestris (L.) specimens. A white cap trap filled with commercial mint syrup solution was a good combination for trapping Bombus argillaceus (Scopoli) and a yellow cap trap filled with a solution of vinegar, sugar and honey was the best combination for trapping Apis mellifera L...|$|E
40|$|Snow voles (Chionomys nivalis) were <b>bait-trapped</b> in the Tatra Mountains, Western Carpathians, Slovakia, and Vitosha and Rila Mountains, Bulgaria. Lead (Pb) {{content in}} the tail {{vertebrae}} was determined. Adult voles were <b>bait-trapped</b> and sampled in September - October (Slovakia 2009 - 2010, Bulgaria 2009). The sampling yielded a total of 33 animals from Slovakia and 24 from Bulgaria. Lead concentrations in bones of voles from the Rila and Vitosha Mountains were approximately three-fold lower than in bones of voles from the Tatra Mountains. The concentration of lead in the bones of voles from Rila Mountains was statistically indistinguishable from that of vole bones from Vitosha Mountains. The content of lead in the bones of voles indicates that the Western Carpathians {{are one of the}} most polluted with lead alpine regions in Europe. The usefulness of snow voles as a bioindicator of environmental contamination in alpine ecosystems was highly recognised. At regional as well as at global scale, this species is a suitable biological indicator of the environmental hazards of lead pollution...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Bait-trapping</b> {{appears to}} be a {{generally}} useful method of studying fly populations. The aim {{of this study was to}} construct a new adult flytrap by some modifications in former versions and to evaluate its applicability in a subtropical zone in southern Iran. Methods: The traps were constructed with modification by adding some equipment to a polyethylene container (18 × 20 × 33 cm) with lid. The fresh sheep meat was used as bait. Totally 27 adult modified traps were made and tested for their efficacies to attract adult flies. The experiment was carried out in a range of different topographic areas of Fars Province during June 2010. Results: The traps were able to attract various groups of adult flies belonging to families of: Calliphoridae, Sarcophagidae, Muscidae, and Faniidae. The species of Calliphora vicina (Diptera: Calliphoridae), Sarcophaga argyrostoma (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) and Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) include the majority of the flies collected by this sheep-meat baited trap. Conclusion: This adult flytrap can be recommended for routine field sampling to study diversity and population dynamics of flies where conducting of daily collection is difficult...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt: 2 ̆ 2 Sugaring 2 ̆ 2 and {{attraction}} to artificial light {{have long been}} favorite methods of collecting adults of the genus Catocala, and both have been very successful. Each of the many collectors who uses the English method of applying bait to the trunks of trees has his own preferred mixture. Usually molasses is the base, and fragrance is the measure. Feed molasses is widely used in this country, augmented by various combinations of beer, rum, aromatic oils and decaying fruits. Temperature, humidity, wind and amount of moonlight are all well-known factors affecting the success of 2 ̆ 2 bait, 2 ̆ 2 whether applied according to the old method or used in the modern variant of <b>bait-traps.</b> The advent of ultra-violet and mercury-vapor light has been a boon to students of this genus. According to the present low level of evidence, certain species {{would seem to have}} a preference for either bait or light. Experienced. lepidopterists insist that some species are not attracted to one or the other, but the phenomenon has not at all been carefully studied...|$|R
