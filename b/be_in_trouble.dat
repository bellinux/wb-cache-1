5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lucas di Grassi {{challenged}} Jarno Trulli for the lead, but Trulli closed the racing line into turn one. As Trulli lost the rear end of the car going into turn three, di Grassi took the lead. The other Audi Sport Abt of Daniel Abt was less fortunate, being sent into a spin at the same corner, dropping {{to the back of the}} field. Nelson Piquet, Jr. immediately made up for ground lost in qualifying, gaining three positions during the first lap, running in tenth place. At turn six on the following lap, he went past Stéphane Sarrazin (Venturi) for ninth. While di Grassi built an early lead, several manoeuvres were made behind him, with Nicolas Prost (e.dams-Renault) losing two positions to Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Dragon Racing) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Trulli GP), dropping back to seventh. Pole sitter Jarno Trulli looked to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with his car and lost positions continuously, running in thirteenth after lap twelve. Third placed Nick Heidfeld was also unable to hold onto his podium position, being overtaken by d'Ambrosio on lap thirteen.|$|E

25|$|The North Channel naval duel was in {{some respects}} a {{small-scale}} dress-rehearsal, in reverse, for Jones's 1779 battle with HMS Serapis. Drake had been built as a merchant ship with defensive capability, and bought by the Royal Navy to help fill the gap left when many ships had {{to be sent to}} America; even the 20 four-pound guns were not official Navy issue, but her armament as a merchant vessel. The hull was the wrong shape for rapid battle manoeuvres, and not designed to resist cannon fire. Ranger had been built as a fighting ship, and modified by Jones for maximum efficiency: for example, although there were ports for 20 guns, he found it safest to install only 18 six-pound guns. That made for a total broadside weight of 54 pounds, slightly more than Drake 40 pounds total. However, those dozens of Irish volunteers meant that if Drake could grapple and board Ranger the Americans would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|E
25|$|While Ferrari {{celebrated their}} dominance, the sport itself {{was seen by}} many to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> Two more privateers, Prost and Arrows, had closed their doors for good. Benetton was also no more, the team having been {{completely}} bought out by Renault and turned into their factory team. Even more troubling was the one team in seemingly no danger of disappearing: Ferrari. While Formula One {{was no stranger to}} teams monopolizing the winner's stand, Ferrari's actions throughout the 2002 season annoyed many; in particular the staged finishes of the Austrian Grand Prix and the US Grand Prix. It seemed to many {{that it was possible to}} take the dictum of 'win at all costs' too far. Ratings and attendance noticeably declined in the later half of 2002, a serious problem for a sport which was by far the most expensive (and, more importantly, most lucrative) in the world by this time. Also, a number of major manufacturers had joined Formula One since 2000 - there were now 8 manufacturers participating in some form in Formula One. Toyota, Ford/Jaguar and Renault had joined as full works teams, and Mercedes, Honda, BMW and Cosworth were all supplying engines to specific teams.|$|E

The survivors are captured and brought before two men, Dogen (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese man, and his translator, Lennon (John Hawkes). Hurley tells them that Jacob sent him, and offers the guitar case as proof. Inside is a wooden ankh, which Dogen breaks open, revealing a note that tells the Others they will all <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> if Sayid dies. Sayid is brought to a spring, noted to have gone murky, where he is held underwater until the time of an hourglass passes. Jack administers CPR, but Sayid does not respond. They believe Sayid has died. Sawyer and Miles are brought into the temple, having been captured after burying Juliet. Dogen questions Hurley in a separate room, where Hurley reveals Jacob is dead. Shocked by this news, the Others sound an alarm, prepare their defenses, and send fireworks into the air in preparation for an attack. Lennon insists on speaking with Jack privately. Jack refuses, leading to an altercation, when suddenly Sayid comes back to life.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} toss and electing to bat North Otago looked to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> {{in the first}} innings being 116-9 but a record {{breaking}} 10th wicket partnership of 91 between Duncan Drew and David Sewell bought some respectability to the score. North Otago all out for 207 with Duncan Drew top scoring with 102, notching up his second century at Hawke Cup level and Sewell 37 not out. Bryan Templeman took 6-56 for the home side. At {{the end of the}} first day, the game was even with Manawatu 61-3 at stumps and just after lunch during the second day North Otago had a 48 run lead when the home side was bowled out for 159. Ben Cant (3-29) and David Sewell (3-50) were the main wicket takers with three wickets each. When stumps was called at the end of the second day North Otago was in a strong position, being 138-3 with a lead of 186. the inning was completed just after lunch on the third day and North Otago had 262 on the board to set Manawatu 311 of 58 overs for an outright victory. Darren Broom scored the second century of the game, combining with Drew for an 83 run partnership for the 4th wicket. For Manawatu J Cunningham took the a five wicket bag, finishing with 5-99 of his 33 overs. Manawatu started aggressively in their innings looking to put North Otago under pressure, however with wickets constantly falling and good partnerships failing to materialize they fell short by 159 runs to retain the Hawke Cup. Once again David Sewell picked up three wickets finishing with 3-31 of 8 overs while captain Chirs Smith took 3-23 including the final wicket. North Otago victors in its fourth Hawke Cup Challenge and for the first time in the 99-year history of the cup, holders of the Hawke Cup.|$|E
