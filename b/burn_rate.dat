5|$|Steam was {{provided}} by 12 Schulz-Thornycroft boilers, each of which had 2 fireboxes, {{for a total of}} 24. The machinery was divided into three engine and six boiler rooms. The wing turrets and their magazines further divided the machinery into three separated groups, thereby increasing survivability. The ships carried 2,700tons of coal, and were later modified to carry an additional 160tons of oil that was to be sprayed on the coal, to increase its <b>burn</b> <b>rate.</b> Electrical power {{was provided}} by eight turbo-generators, producing 1,280kW at 225V.|$|E
25|$|French war {{powder in}} 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 12.5% {{charcoal}}, 12.5% sulfur. English war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, 10% sulfur. The British Congreve rockets used 62.4% saltpeter, 23.2% charcoal and 14.4% sulfur, but the British Mark VII gunpowder {{was changed to}} 65% saltpeter, 20% charcoal and 15% sulfur. The explanation for the wide variety in formulation relates to usage. Powder used for rocketry can use a slower <b>burn</b> <b>rate</b> since it accelerates the projectile for a much longer time—whereas powders for weapons such as flintlocks, cap-locks, or matchlocks need a higher <b>burn</b> <b>rate</b> to accelerate the projectile in a much shorter distance. Cannons usually used lower <b>burn</b> <b>rate</b> powders, because most would burst with higher <b>burn</b> <b>rate</b> powders.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradeoff}} {{comes in}} terms of power and accuracy; AA #2 is designed for small cases, and will burn inconsistently in the large 44 Magnum case. AA #9, however, will fill the case much better, and the slow <b>burn</b> <b>rate</b> of AA #9 is ideal for magnum handgun rounds, producing 20% higher velocities (at maximum levels) while still producing less pressure than the fast burning AA #2. A medium burning powder might actually be a better choice, as it could split the difference in powder weights while delivering more power and accuracy than the fastest powder.|$|E

A money-losing company's lifespan was measured by its <b>burn</b> <b>rate,</b> {{the rate at which}} a non-profitable company lacking a viable business model spent its existing capital. Many dot-coms ran out of capital and were acquired or went through liquidation; the domain names were purchased by old-economy competitors, speculators or cybersquatters. Several companies and their executives were accused or convicted of fraud for misusing shareholders' money, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fined top investment firms including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch millions of dollars for misleading investors. Various supporting industries, such as advertising and shipping, scaled back their operations as demand for their services fell.|$|E

Analysis of the data revealed strong associations between <b>burn</b> <b>rates</b> and six of the variables. The six variables were the percentage of families below the poverty level with a householder under age 65 years, the percentage of persons over 5 years of age whose residence in 1975 was a different dwelling but in the same county, the percentage of persons in the civilian labor force who were unemployed at the time of census enumeration, the average age of occupied dwelling units, the percentage of occupied housing units occupied on a rental basis, and the percentage of persons age 25 years or older who acquired some college education but did not complete college. Interpretation of the findings is not straightforward but seems to suggest that the previously observed association between poor socioeconomic status and increased burn risk for individuals can be quantified at the census tract population level...|$|R

40|$|Fire is a {{dominant}} mechanism of forest renewal {{in most of}} Canada’s forests and its activity is predicted to increase over the coming decades. Individual fire events have been considered to be non-selective with regards to forest properties, but evidence now suggests otherwise. Our objective was therefore to quantify the effect of forest properties on fire selectivity or avoidance, evaluate the stability of these effects across varying <b>burn</b> <b>rates,</b> and use these results to map local fire risk across the forests of Canada. We used Canada-wide MODIS-based maps of annual fires and of forest properties to identify burned and unburned pixels for the 2002 – 2011 period and to bin them into classes of forest composition (% conifer and broadleaved deciduous), above-ground tree biomass and stand age. Logistic binomial regressions were then used to quantify fire selectivity by forest properties classes and by zones of homogeneous fire regime (HFR). Results suggest that fire exhibits a strong selectivity for conifer stands, but an even stronger avoidance of broadleaved stands. In terms of age classes, fire also shows a strong avoidance for young (0 to 29 year) stands. The large differences among regional <b>burn</b> <b>rates</b> do not significantly alter the overall preference and avoidance ratings. Finally, we combined these results on relative burn preference with regional <b>burn</b> <b>rates</b> to map local fire risks across Canada...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to characterize the combustion of a monopropellant isopropyl nitrate (IPN). Quartz tubes of 3, 5, 7. 5, and 9 mm inner diameter and 1 mm thickness were utilized to create the strands of varying dimensions. The experiments were conducted in a quiescent atmosphere of air and the ambient pressure was varied from atmospheric pressure to 50 bar. Ignition of the IPN strands was achieved by using a heated 60 mu m Nichrome wire dipped in the liquid and was retracted after ignition. The effect of ambient pressure and strand diameter on the linear burning rates of pure IPN was elucidated. The ambient pressure variation was investigated for a diameter of 5 mm, while the diameter-variation was studied at 1, 10, 20, and 40 bar. The linear burning rate of IPN strands of 5 mm diameter was found to exhibit two distinct regimes, where a steep rise in burning rate with pressure was observed after an initial decreasing trend. The values of the <b>burn</b> <b>rates</b> increased with a pressure exponent of 1. 54, from approximately 0. 2 mm/s at atmospheric pressure to 1. 6 mm/s at 50 bar. In the first stage, the <b>burn</b> <b>rates</b> {{were found to be}} controlled by diffusion-dominated combustion, characterized by a single bipropellant flame up to a pressure of 10 bar, beyond which monopropellant-dominated combustion was found to be dominant in the second stage, with a distinct monopropellant flame and a bipropellant flame. The bipropellant flame was found to exhibit an oscillatory behavior in the second stage of combustion. A semi-empirical model was utilized successfully to predict the experimental <b>burn</b> <b>rates</b> of IPN in both regimes. The <b>burn</b> <b>rates</b> were found to depend on the strand diameters under the conditions applied, with a generalized decreasing trend at high pressures and atmospheric pressures, and an initial decrease followed by an increase at intermediate pressures.

Results on ignitability and average beat release, mass loss and charring rates are reported for a heat flux range between 15 and 55 kW m- 2. In this range, burning rate increased linearly with heat flux. <b>Burning</b> <b>rate</b> was very species dependent. Heat release rate was related to mass loss by effective heat of combustion, which also increased with beat flux. Charring rate was related to mass loss rate and original wood density.
