5|$|Hog Island sheep are a <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> {{descended from}} animals first brought to Virginia's Hog Island in the 18th century.

5|$|The Polled Dorset is a <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> {{developed}} for meat at the North Carolina State University Small Ruminant Unit in 1956. The name {{refers to the}} fact that it is a hornless variation of the Horned Dorset breed. The Polled Dorset is the result of a genetic mutation by which some of the offspring of a certain ram grew no horns. After some years of breeding work, a strain of Dorset was developed which had lost the characteristic horns and which bred true.|$|E

50|$|Wages {{are higher}} than {{was the case in}} the past. Keeping a {{shepherd}} in constant attendance can be costly. Also, the eradication <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> predators in parts of the world have lessened the need for shepherds. In places like Britain, hardy <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> are frequently left alone without a shepherd for long periods of time. More productive <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> can be left in fields and moved periodically to fresh pasture when necessary. Hardier <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> can be left on hillsides. The sheep farmer will attend to the sheep when necessary at times like lambing or shearing.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Navajo {{acquired}} the Iberian Churra, a <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> from Spanish explorers. These animals were {{developed into a}} unique breed by the Navajo, today called the Navajo-Churro. These sheep were well-suited to the climate in Navajo lands, and that produced a useful long-staple wool. Hand-spun wool from these animals was {{the main source of}} yarn for Navajo blankets until the 1860s, when the United States government forced the Navajo people to relocate at Bosque Redondo and seized their livestock. The 1869 peace treaty that allowed the Navajo to return to their traditional lands included a $30,000 settlement to replace their livestock. The tribe purchased 14,000 sheep and 1,000 goats.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh uplands {{were most}} suited to grazing {{animals such as}} sheep and goats, and the animals became {{associated}} with Wales. Sheep-farming {{on a large scale}} was introduced by Cistercian monks, largely for wool, but also for meat. By the start of the 16th century Welsh mutton was popular {{in the rest of the}} UK. Once modern synthetic fibres became more popular than wool, Welsh sheep were raised almost exclusively for meat. Towards the end of the 20th century, there were more than 11 million sheep in Wales. The most popular <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> is the Welsh Mountain sheep which is notably smaller than other breeds but better-suited to the Welsh landscape and only rears one lamb, rather than the lowland breeds which rear two or more; the mountain sheep are regarded as having more flavoursome meat. Welsh farmers have started using scientific methods, such as artificial insemination or using ultrasound to scan a sheep's depth of fat, to improve the quality of their meat.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} after the British had {{established}} themselves in the islands, {{a number of new}} British settlements were started. Initially many of these settlements were established in order to exploit the feral cattle on the islands. Following the introduction of the Cheviot <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> to the islands in 1852, sheep farming became the dominant form of agriculture on the Islands.|$|E

The breed originated in Southwestern Iberia, but the modern Merino was domesticated in New Zealand and Australia. Today, Merinos are still regarded as having {{some of the}} finest and softest wool of any sheep. Poll Merinos have no horns (or very small stubs, known as scurs), and horned Merino rams have long, spiral horns which grow close to the head.|$|E

25|$|MiR-1 has {{key roles}} in the {{development}} and differentiation of smooth and skeletal muscles. For example, in the lineage-specific differention of smooth muscle cells from embroyonic stem cell derived cultures, MiR-1 is required; as its loss of function resulted in a reduction in smooth muscle cell biomarkers and a reduction in the derived smooth muscle cell population. There is evidence that the control of smooth muscle cell differentiation by MiR-1 may be mediated by the down regulation of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), since a MiR-1 recognition site is predicted in the 3' UTR of KLF4 and inhibition of MiR-1 results in reversed down-regulation of KLF4 and an inhibition of smooth muscle cell differentiation. A mutation in the 3' UTR of the myostatin gene in Texel sheep creates a miR-1 and miR-206 target site. This is likely to cause the muscular phenotype of this <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Shetland sheep is a small, wool-producing <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> {{originating}} in the Shetland Isles, but is now also kept in {{many other parts of}} the world.

[...] Lafone became a director and his brother-in-law J.P. Dale the company's first manager in the Islands.
