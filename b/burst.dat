40|$|Correlation {{studies of}} prompt and {{afterglow}} emission from gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> (GRBs) between different spectral bands {{have been difficult}} to do in the past because few <b>bursts</b> had comprehensive and comparable afterglow measurements. In this paper we present a large and uniform data set for correlation analysis based on <b>bursts</b> detected by the Swift mission. For the first time, short and long <b>bursts</b> can be analyzed and compared. It is found for both classes that the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are linearly correlated, but with a large spread about the correlation line; stronger <b>bursts</b> tend to have brighter afterglow, and <b>bursts</b> with brighter X-ray afterglow tend to have brighter optical afterglow. Short <b>bursts</b> are, on average, weaker in both prompt and afterglow emission. No short <b>bursts</b> are seen with extremely low optical-to-X-ray ratios, as occurs for "dark" long <b>bursts.</b> Although statistics are still poor for short <b>bursts,</b> there is no evidence yet for a subgroup of short <b>bursts</b> with high extinction, as there is for long <b>bursts.</b> Long <b>bursts</b> are detected in the dark category in the same fraction as pre-Swift <b>bursts.</b> Interesting cases of long <b>bursts</b> that are detected in the optical, and yet have a low enough optical-to-X-ray ratio to be classified as dark, are discovered. For the prompt emission, short and long <b>bursts</b> have different average tracks on flux versus fluence plots. In Swift, GRB detections tend to be fluence-limited for short <b>bursts</b> and flux-limited for long events...|$|R
40|$|Starting from 1960 s Type III-like <b>bursts</b> (Type III <b>bursts</b> {{with high}} drift rates) {{in a wide}} {{frequency}} range from 300 to 950 MHz have been observed. These new <b>bursts</b> observed at certain frequency being compared to the usual Type III <b>bursts</b> at the same frequency show similar behaviour but feature frequency drift 2 - 6 {{times higher than the}} normal <b>bursts.</b> In this paper we report the first observations of Type III-like <b>bursts</b> in decameter range, carried out during summer campaigns 2002 - 2004 at UTR- 2 radio telescope. The circular polarization of the <b>bursts</b> was measured by the radio telescope URAN- 2 in 2004. The observed <b>bursts</b> are analyzed and compared with usual Type III <b>bursts</b> in the decameter range. From the analysis of over 1100 Type III-like <b>bursts,</b> their main parameters have been found. Characteristic feature of the observed <b>bursts</b> is similar to Type III-like <b>bursts</b> at other frequencies, i. e. measured drift rates (5 - 10 MHz/s) of this <b>bursts</b> are few times larger than that for usual Type III <b>bursts,</b> and their durations (1 - 2 s) are few times smaller than that for usual Type III <b>bursts</b> in this frequency band.

5|$|About 5hours {{after the}} <b>burst</b> the {{apparent}} {{magnitude of the}} object—a logarithmic measure of its brightness with a higher number indicating a fainter object—was 20.3±0.3 in the U-band (the ultraviolet region of the spectrum) and 21.2±0.1 in the R-band (the red region of the spectrum). The afterglow reached its peak luminosity in both bands approximately 2days after the <b>burst</b> was first detected—19.6±0.3 in the U-band at 02:13UTC on May11, and 19.8±0.2 in the R-band at 20:55UTC on May 10.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous <b>burst.</b> The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the <b>burst</b> {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This <b>burst</b> provided the first strong clue {{about the nature of the}} systems that produce GRBs.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{observations}} of the herringbone (HB) fine structure on type II solar radio <b>bursts</b> are presented. Data from the Culgoora radiospectrograph, radiometer and radioheliograph are analyzed.

Correlations between individual <b>bursts</b> within the characteristic groups of <b>bursts</b> and {{the properties of the}} associated type II <b>bursts</b> are examined. These data are compatible with HB <b>bursts</b> being radiation at multiples of the plasma frequency generated by electron streams accelerated by the type II shock.

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} {{statistical}} {{study of the}} characteristics of type-II radio <b>bursts</b> ob-served in the metric (m) and deca-hectometer (DH) wavelength range during 1997 – 2008. The collected events are divided into two groups: Group I contains the events of m-type-II <b>bursts</b> with starting frequency ≥ 100 MHz, and group II contains the events with starting fre-quency of m-type-II radio <b>bursts</b> < 100 MHz. We have analyzed both samples considering three different aspects: i) statistical properties of type-II <b>bursts,</b> ii) statistical properties of flares and CMEs associated with type-II <b>bursts,</b> and iii) time delays between type-II <b>bursts,</b> flares, and CMEs. We find significant differences in the properties of m-type-II <b>bursts</b> in duration, bandwidth, drift rate, shock speed and delay between m- and DH-type-II <b>bursts.</b> From the timing analysis we found that the majority of m-type-II <b>bursts</b> in both groups occur during the flare impulsive phase. On the other hand, the DH-type-II <b>bursts</b> in both groups occur during the decaying phase of the associated flares. Almost all m-DH-type-II <b>bursts</b> are found to be associated with CMEs. Our results indicate that {{there are two kinds of}} shock in which group I (high frequency) m-type-II <b>bursts</b> seem to be ignited by flares whereas group II (low frequency) m-type-II <b>bursts</b> are CME-driven...|$|R
5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one <b>burst</b> every 10,000 years, to one <b>burst</b> every 1,000,000 years. Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E

This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E

40|$|Gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> {{are usually}} {{classified}} through their high-energy emission into short-duration and long-duration <b>bursts,</b> which presumably reflect {{two different types}} of progenitors. However, it has been shown on statistical grounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classification scheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so far not been done. The large amount of follow-up studies generated during the Swift era allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this third population through the properties of their prompt emission and their afterglows. Our study is focused on a sample of GRBs observed by Swift during its first four years of operation. The sample contains those <b>bursts</b> with measured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties. Intermediate <b>bursts</b> are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than long GRBs, especially when considering the X-ray light curves, which are on average one order of magnitude fainter than long <b>bursts.</b> There is a less significant trend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate <b>bursts</b> closer than long <b>bursts.</b> Except for this, intermediate <b>bursts</b> show similar properties to long <b>bursts.</b> In particular, they follow the Epeak vs. Eiso correlation and have, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that of long <b>bursts.</b> Like long GRBs, they normally have an associated supernova, although some intermediate <b>bursts</b> have shown no supernova component. This study shows that intermediate <b>bursts</b> are different from short <b>bursts</b> and, in spite of sharing many properties with long <b>bursts,</b> there are some differences between them as well. We suggest that the physical difference between intermediate and long <b>bursts</b> could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while for the latter they are thick shells.
