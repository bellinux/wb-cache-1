5|$|After the match, which Galatasaray won 4–1 on penalties, {{approximately}} 300 Arsenal {{fans in the}} Finsbury Park area of Islington in London attacked Turkish {{restaurants and}} <b>businesses,</b> <b>with</b> bottles being used to break windows. They then broke into an apartment building to threaten Kosovan refugees with a knife, mistakenly believing them to be Turkish. Six people were arrested and three Metropolitan Police officers were injured. In Turkey, nine people were accidentally shot and injured by Galatasaray fans firing guns in celebration despite police warning them not to.|$|E
5|$|Driving to the Emirates Stadium is {{strongly}} discouraged {{as there are}} strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium. An hour before kick-off to one hour after the final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement {{on a number of}} the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and <b>businesses</b> <b>with</b> a road closure access permit. The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation. Industrial action forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, some Georgia Tech {{faculty members}} {{belonging}} to Sigma Xi started a research club that met {{once a month}} at Tech. One of the monthly subjects, proposed by ceramic engineering professor W.

Such a station would theoretically assist local <b>businesses</b> <b>with</b> engineering problems via Georgia Tech's established faculty and resources. This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiments at universities around the country, and the report was compiled by Harold Bunger, Montgomery Knight, and Vaughan in December 1929.|$|E

5|$|After Napoleon's total {{defeat in}} 1815, the Congress of Vienna merged the French {{territory}} in Belgium with the Netherlands {{to form the}} United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a buffer state against the French. It was ruled by William I of Orange. The synergy of combining the manufacturing centers in Belgium with the important exporting ports in the Netherlands encouraged growth of the industrial cloth manufacturing and metallurgic centers in Wallonia. Keen to promote the economic development of the southern provinces as well, William I founded the Société Générale des Pays-Bas in 1822 to provide <b>businesses</b> <b>with</b> capital to invest in machinery. The Société Générale served as a driving force behind Belgian industrialization in the 19th century, and at its height controlled large swathes of the national economy. William I also encouraged the creation of educational facilities in the Southern Provinces, founding the State University of Leuven, the University of Liège and Ghent University in 1817.|$|E
5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis on religion and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of <b>businesses</b> <b>with</b> more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E

At this point, the two routes head into a commercial area and split into the one-way pair of Mitch Road eastbound and Main Street westbound. DE 7 splits from DE 4 by heading northwest on Limestone Road. DE 4 continues east along the one-way pair past homes and <b>businesses</b> <b>with</b> two lanes in each direction, crossing Red Clay Creek. The directions of the route rejoin and the route becomes four-lane divided West Newport Pike, heading through suburban areas and crossing Hershey Run.

Local magazine Echo Australe, which named then-mayor of Antananarivo Marc Ravalomanana their Entrepreneur of the Year in 1999, bestowed the same honor on Rajoelina in 2000. Following Rajoelina's marriage in 2000, his wife's wealthy parents invested in Injet and allowed Rajoelina in 2001 to acquire Domapub, a competing Antananarivo-based billboard advertising business that they owned. The couple worked together to manage the family <b>businesses,</b> <b>with</b> Rajoelina responsible for Injet and his wife handling the affairs of Domapub.

5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the <b>businesses.</b> <b>With</b> the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E

Immediately after this crossing, U.S. Route 40 splits from Route 47 by heading southeast on Harding Highway while Route 47 turns northwest to continue along Delsea Drive, a two-lane road. Route 47 leaves Malaga and passes through a mix of dwellings and <b>businesses</b> <b>with</b> some areas of farms and woods, running a short distance to the east of the railroad line. The road heads into more forested areas before it comes to an intersection with County Route 612 in the residential and business community of Iona. Route 47 continues past homes and commercial establishments as it comes to a crossroads with County Route 538, where it turns to the north. The route passes more development with some farmland before it enters Clayton.|$|E
5|$|The two {{aftershocks}} {{the following}} morning were separated by less than four hours and both caused {{at least as much}} damage as the mainshock. A large fire was triggered following the first aftershock at a shopping center in Scotia that destroyed four <b>businesses,</b> <b>with</b> the resulting damage at that site alone estimated at $15 million, and was the largest individual financial misfortune of the sequence of earthquakes. The water supply in Rio Dell was terminated when the water main was severed at the abutment to the Eel River bridge and power outages were widespread throughout Humboldt County. Some were mere seconds while others lasted for hours, but the hydroelectric plant's performance at Ruth Reservoir was deemed acceptable, and power that was not generated locally was unaffected.|$|E
5|$|At this point, PA 997 turns {{east for}} a short {{concurrency}} with US 30 on Lincoln Way East before turning north onto Black Gap Road.

Farther northwest, the route runs through farmland with some residential and commercial development, and gains a center left-turn lane as it passes to the northeast of the Chambersburg Mall. PA 997 widens to a four-lane divided highway and comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of PA 696 and an interchange with I-81, with the ramps serving the northbound lanes of I-81 connecting to PA 696. Past this interchange, the route narrows to a two-lane undivided road and turns north and northwest through fields and woods to bypass the community of Scotland, coming to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Lurgan Branch. The road curves west and then northwest and becomes Cumberland Highway, running through farmland with some woods and residential and commercial development. PA 997 comes to an intersection with US 11 {{in the community of}} Green Village, where PA 997 Truck heads south along US 11.
