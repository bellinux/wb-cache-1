Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, — it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse.|$|E
500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used to sluice and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> a cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|E
500|$|Players {{dispatch}} enemies {{by either}} thrusting {{at them with}} his Dragon Sword or by defeating them using Power Boosting Items. These special items consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power", also located {{on the top of}} the screen. Power Boosting Items include the following: shurikens; [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] that move <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> a boomerang; [...] "The Art of the Fire Wheel" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally upwards; [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally downwards; and the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that creates a barrier of three fireballs around Ryu, destroying any enemy that touches them. These items can be found in various crystal balls scattered throughout the levels, and they can be switched out by collecting another Power Boosting Item. The amount of ninja power used depends on the type of Power Boosting Item used. At the end of each Act Ryu fights a boss which has its own strength meter, located {{on the top of the}} screen. The boss's strength meter decreases every time the player damages it, and the boss is destroyed when the player completely depletes its strength meter.|$|E

500|$|Verlaine and Lloyd interplayed their guitars {{around the}} rhythm section's drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing drew on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the layered power chords of {{contemporary}} punk rock {{in favor of}} melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine established the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd played dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos {{by the time they}} recorded Marquee Moon, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. The two traded rhythmic and melodic lines several times on some songs while producing tension. [...] "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> a jigsaw puzzle", Lloyd said. Most of the solos on Marquee Moon followed a pattern wherein Verlaine ran up a major scale but regressed slightly after each step. On [...] "See No Evil", he soloed through a full octave before playing a blues-influenced riff, and on the title track, he played in a Mixolydian mode and lowered the seventh by half a step. Lloyd opened [...] "Friction" [...] by playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing harmonics and series of descending scales.|$|E
500|$|Historians {{have not}} been kind to Gebhard. E.A. Benians, in the Cambridge Modern History, {{was perhaps the most}} generous: [...] "Few men {{personally}} insignificant have made more stir in the world." [...] Walter Goetz described him in less complimentary terms: he [...] "was impelled by no great idea, nor could he claim through virile activity the title to any high striving ambition" [...] and was [...] "wanting in both depth and tenacity". [...] Goetz was not particularly kind to Ernst either: [...] Ernst was not Gebhard's superior; the victory that placed him in the Electorate belonged to his brothers' influence and to that of the Curia (papacy), not to his own striving ambition; Ernst was, fundamentally, riding on the Counter Reformation tide that lifted all boats. [...] Philip Motley described Gebhard thus: despite his swearing an oath to renounce his See if he should marry, [...] "the love of Truchsess for Agnes Mansfeld had created disaster, not only for himself but for all of Germany." [...] Like Goetz, he describes both Gebhard and Ernst as cut from the same cloth: [...] "two pauper Archbishops without men or means of their own were pushed <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> puppets, by the highwaymen" [...] on either side, while murder and robbery, in the name of Catholicism and Protestantism, were the [...] "for a time the only motive or result of the contest." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryu can defeat enemies {{by attacking}} with his Dragon Sword or by using {{secondary}} weapons which consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power"; such weapons include the following: [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] which move <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> boomerangs, [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which launch fireballs downward at an angle, the [...] "Fire Wheel Art" [...] which launches fireballs upward at an angle, the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that forms {{a series of}} rotating of fireballs around Ryu and destroys any enemy who comes into contact, and a new weapon in this series called the [...] "Vacuum Wave Art" [...] which hurls vacuum blades above and below Ryu simultaneously. Players can collect red and blue capsules to refill Ryu's ninja power, and they can also collect [...] "Scrolls {{of the spirit of}} the Dragon" [...] to increase Ryu's maximum ninja power level. Another new item in Ninja GaidenIII is the [...] "Dragon Spirit Sword" [...] that increases Ryu range of his sword. At the end of each Act is a boss which has its own life meter that decreases when damaged; Ryu can defeat the boss by completely depleting its life meter. Ninja GaidenIIIs first four bosses consist of the [...] "bio-noids"– super-human creatures created and controlled by Foster to take over the world; they each represent the four elementals: earth, wind, fire, and water.|$|E

5000|$|The {{use of the}} tri-oval {{shape for}} {{automobile}} racing was conceived by Bill France, Sr. during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as Indianapolis) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans to look <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> much <b>like</b> a tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to [...] "lean" [...] to see oncoming cars, and creates more forward sight lines.|$|R

500|$|Gyromancer {{received}} a generally positive reception from reviewers. While many critics noted its similarity to Puzzle Quest, the gameplay was still {{described as being}} [...] "fun and addictive" [...] by Brett Todd of GameSpot, and similar praises were made by Daemon Hattfield of IGN and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. Welsh claimed {{that it had a}} great deal of replay value, and praised the [...] "surprisingly varied story missions". Game Informers Matt Miller disagreed slightly, stating that while the game had some replay value, it was limited by the lack of depth to the RPG elements of the game. Although the paintings of the monsters and game world were rated highly by critics, the art direction itself was criticized. Todd called the graphics [...] "murky and grainy" [...] and noted the lack of animation in the battles or cutscenes, in which two-dimensional pictures of the characters speaking [...] "slide <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> cardboard cutouts" [...] rather than perform realistic movements. Welsh added that the stage maps were [...] "crudely portrayed". Hattfield did not share those concerns, but did note say that they felt that the portraits of monsters were reused for different monsters too often. Miller disagreed completely with the other critics, saying that the game [...] "looks great" [...] and that [...] "even the map screen between battles has a polished appearance". A reviewer from GameTrailers also enjoyed the aesthetic of the game, saying that despite the [...] "still images" [...] and [...] "simple effects", the game made an [...] "effort to look and sound the part" [...] of a deeper game, which they felt would increase the player's enjoyment.|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals {{began at}} Broadway's Belasco Theatre on February 2, 1949. [...] There was no formal chorus; {{each of the}} nurses and Seabees was given a name, and, {{in the case of}} the men, $50 to equip {{themselves}} with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. Don Fellows, the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots. [...] Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship. [...] Of the mood backstage, [...] "everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive." [...] He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in Allegro), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless. [...] He soon had the Seabees pacing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> caged animals during [...] "There Is Nothing Like a Dame", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show. One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking. As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage. [...] This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst on tour, {{the band}} became reacquainted with Claritys {{producer}} Mark Trombino, {{and decided to}} work with him once again for their forthcoming album. Trombino also produced the band's second studio album, Static Prevails (1996), and their commercial breakthrough, Bleed American (2001). Jimmy Eat World subsequently began recording tracks at their home studio and rehearsal space, Unit 2 in Tempe, Arizona. After [...] "taking [...] songs as far as [...] could," [...] the band emailed them to Trombino, who was based in Los Angeles. Jim Adkins remarked, [...] " [...] would do a mix of it and add production ideas and we would just kind of go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> that. [...] is the wizard at computers, and the history that we have working with him we don't have with anybody else, so it made sense on the familiarity level and the ease of working level." [...] Although the band and Trombino spent little time together in the studio, Trombino joined Jimmy Eat World [...] "a couple of times", with Adkins travelling to Los Angeles to join Trombino during the mixing process. Regarding the overall recording process, Adkins stated: [...] "I could definitely see our approach being a standard working method in the future for a lot of people. It frees up a lot of our geographic restrictions for both the producer and the band; it's not just someone next door." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stepper motors can {{be rotated}} to a {{specific}} angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives. They {{were used for the}} same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term [...] "voice coil" [...] in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> something <b>like</b> a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.) ...|$|R

50|$|The Matrix uses a {{spool valve}} system to propel a paintball. The spool valve {{utilizes}} an airspace with a fixed volume and a regulated air source {{to deliver a}} consistent amount of force to each ball that is shot. The valve works {{in the matter of}} a spool that slides <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> much <b>like</b> a piston. In one position the spool allows the fixed air chamber to be filled. In the firing position the spool moves forward and dumps the contents of the fixed air chamber into the breech of the marker, which in turn fires the paintball. The movement of the spool is controlled by the flow of air to it. This flow of air is controlled by a solenoid (electronically actuated valve). The Matrix has a sleek look and lacks external hoses that can become damaged over time. The gas is instead routed through passages inside the body of the marker and plugs in the front and rear of the marker keep these passages airtight. A low pressure regulator can also be attached {{to the front of the}} marker to help the consistency and help lower the force of the air hitting the ball.|$|R

Hippolyte explains that the heroes will need to go back in time to August 13, 1942, to prevent the threat caused by four people: the Ravager, the man who can disrupt time; Wonder Woman, an Amazon who is (and is not) her daughter, Diana; and the true crux of the disaster, Green Arrow and the Black Canary. Even though Superman and Batman managed to remember most of the Justice League members including Wonder Woman, they did not remember the existence of Green Arrow or Black Canary. Superman used his time travel abilities to transport the two heroes.|$|R

40|$|To {{generate}} complex bilateral motor patterns such {{as those}} underlying birdsong, neural activity must be highly coordinated across the two cerebral hemispheres. However, it remains largely elusive how this coordination is achieved given that interhemispheric communication between song-control areas in the avian cerebrum is restricted to projections received from bilaterally connecting areas in the mid- and hindbrain. By electrically stimulating cerebral premotor areas in zebra finches, we find that behavioral effectiveness of stimulation rapidly switches between hemispheres. In time intervals in which stimulation in one hemisphere tends to distort songs, stimulation in the other hemisphere is mostly ineffective, revealing an idiosyncratic form of motor dominance that bounces <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between hemispheres <b>like</b> a virtual ping-pong ball. The intervals of lateralized effectiveness are broadly distributed and are unrelated to simple spectral and temporal song features. Such interhemispheric switching could be an important dynamical aspect of neural coordination that may have evolved from simpler pattern generator circuits...|$|R
5000|$|WXRV (The River 92.5 FM) is {{an adult}} album {{alternative}} radio station based in Andover, Massachusetts, with a signal covering most of northeast Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, and audible {{as far away}} as Plymouth, Massachusetts. Originating in 1947 as WHAV, an AM station in Haverhill, an FM station was founded in 1948, but went dark in the early 1950s. The FM station was restored on its current frequency in 1959; it became soft rock-formatted WLYT (Lite 92.5) in 1983, and gained its current identity as WXRV on August, 1, 1995, presumably taking the River moniker from the nearby Merrimack River (though with its wider reach, it uses Boston's Charles River for publicity purposes), but some say that the [...] "river" [...] moniker is for its diverse format of music that winds <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> flowing <b>like</b> a river. Despite the station's transmitter location, WXRV attempts to primarily serve the Greater Boston area; its signal also reaches into the nearby Manchester and Portsmouth markets. To overcome signal issues near Boston, the station applied for four on-channel booster stations in the Boston and metro-west areas in August 2015. The studios are still located in Haverhill, in the original WHAV art deco building. The current station inherited a facility {{on the top floor of}} its studio now called the River Music Hall, which was designed for broadcasting live performances in the pre-rock era, and is used today to broadcast live performances and to record performances for later broadcast.|$|R

When they moved me from one location to another, the soldiers were extremely rough and shoved me around with their knees and elbows in a very painful and frightening way. In the morning before sunrise, I was taken into a room and interrogated by three or four soldiers. They told me that they would kill me if I didn’t talk. After I told them I didn’t know the answers to their questions, one of them knocked me to the floor. He took out a long knife and started sharpening it in front of me. I could hear the sounds of the knife being sharpened. He then lifted my hood and showed me the knife.

50|$|Omri also meets {{one of the}} thatchers {{who worked}} on the roof when Jessica was dying, a man named Tom, and learns from him that Jessica {{somewhat}} let him in on the secret. She also gave him a little person to care for on his own named Jenny, a servant girl from the 1800s who sought to escape her home life after she lost her position, but after having lived as a little person for thirty years she had died a few months before Omri met Tom; Tom speculates that, based on the timing of the era when she would have left, hospitals were becoming so overcrowded that the doctors simply decided to let Jenny's seemingly comatose body die. Omri initially suspects that the stolen earrings are in the cashbox he found with the Account and realizes that the magic key could probably open it. He goes {{to get it out of}} the bank during his half-term, during which time he also has Patrick join him. Patrick breaks his arm and has to go to the hospital; while he's away, Omri opens the cashbox and finds five wrapped bundles, four of whom are people brought to life by the magic key (although one has died since he was last 'summoned' and only his damp uniform is left). He suspects the fifth bundle is the earrings. The people turn out to be Elsie, a widowed shop owner; Bert, a thief from Elsie's time; Ted, a retired policeman from around twenty years after them; and (the one who had died) Sergeant Charlie Ellis, a naval officer who apparently fought at the Battle of Trafalgar; all of whom Jessica herself brought to life repeatedly with the cupboard, along with Jenny. They reveal that Jessica knew of the power of the key and the cupboard but only found out when she accidentally brought them to life for the first time. She brought them <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> many times <b>like</b> Omri did with Little Bear and the others and eventually revealed to them that she was dying before sending them all back, except for Jenny who had only a horrible life to go back to. Omri learns that one of them, Bert, is the one who stole his great-grandmother's jewelry box after her husband had died and made her live a poor life. After learning this (Bert had only just done it before he was brought forward, although he defends himself on the grounds that he believed that he had robbed the woman before her husband had died), Omri insists that Bert return the jewelry box to her hoping to change her future for the better. He finally convinces him and then sends them back one final time through the cupboard.|$|R
