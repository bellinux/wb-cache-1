However, it can <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>in</b> a crisp or soft version. Traditional soft kompia dipped in pork sauce can be sought from Chung Hua road and the Sunday Market at Pedada road. There are deep fried variations available throughout the town of Sibu.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} after myth, most gods {{were said to}} <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>in</b> the sky or invisibly present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, {{their homes in the}} human world. There they {{inhabited}} the cult images, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth. As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region. Deities' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods had more than one cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They could establish themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), they elevated Thebes' patron gods—first the war god Montu and then Amun—to national prominence.|$|E

25|$|The {{iron ion}} may <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>in</b> the Fe2+ {{or in the}} Fe3+ state, but ferrihemoglobin (methemoglobin) (Fe3+) cannot bind oxygen. In binding, oxygen {{temporarily}} and reversibly oxidizes (Fe2+) to (Fe3+) while oxygen temporarily turns into the superoxide ion, thus iron must exist in the +2 oxidation state to bind oxygen. If superoxide ion associated to Fe3+ is protonated, the hemoglobin iron will remain oxidized and incapable of binding oxygen. In such cases, the enzyme methemoglobin reductase {{will be able to}} eventually reactivate methemoglobin by reducing the iron center.|$|E
25|$|The online {{multiplayer}} had {{an integrated}} friends system which allowed players {{to add one}} another without becoming friends on the PSN. The online friends list showed a player's friend to <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>In</b> Lobby, staging or in-game. From here players could Invite to Game, Invite to Party or Send a Message. This in game system allowed for user-friendly interaction between friends and bypassed the need for players to exit the game to talk to friends; a feature that was absent from most other PS3 titles, until system firmware 2.40 was released.|$|E

25|$|In {{any given}} time period, the {{government}}’s budget can <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>in</b> deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. MMT states that {{as a matter of}} accounting, it follows that government budget deficits add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited more money into private bank accounts than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money from private bank accounts via taxes than it has put back in via spending.|$|E
25|$|In 1712 {{the church}} {{requested}} a royal charter; {{seven years later}} it was granted by King George I {{in exchange for a}} peppercorn in rent every year. Two years later, in 1721, it was expanded, early in the half-century tenure of Dominie Petrus Vas. A doop huys, a sort of chapel, was built to handle baptisms, meetings and other consistorial activities. Vas would, three decades later, oversee the construction of a second church building. Surviving prints show a gambrel-roofed meetinghouse two bays wide with a tower on the front. Its siding seems to have been limestone rubble, although the first print shows a material that could <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>in</b> a coursed ashlar pattern or parging to mimic coursed stone. Fenestration consisted of three round-arched windows along the sides. It was dedicated on November 29, 1752, by Georg Wilhelm Mancius, Vas's assistant.|$|E
25|$|According to GlobalSecurity, police {{impunity}} {{and corruption}} are serious problems. In 2008 President Assad issued {{a law that}} mandates that only the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces may issue an arrest warrant {{in the case of}} a crime committed by a military officer, member of the internal security forces, or customs police officer in the pursuit of his normal duties, and that such cases must be tried in military courts. Arbitrary and false arrests are also problems, and detainees had no legal redress. According to the accusations, the authorities use the Emergency Law to detain persons critical of the government and charge them with a wide range of political crimes, including treason. Incommunicado detention was a severe problem. Many persons who disappeared were believed to <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>in</b> long-term detention without charge or possibly to have died while detained. Many detainees brought to trial were held incommunicado for years, and their trials were often marked by irregularities and lack of due process. A shortage of available courts and lack of legal provisions for a speedy trial or plea bargaining led to lengthy pretrial detentions.|$|E

From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead. Before 1957, there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.|$|E
500|$|The goal of circuit {{analysis}} {{is to determine}} all the branch currents and voltages in the network. [...] These network variables are not all independent. [...] The branch voltages {{are related to the}} branch currents by the transfer function of the elements of which they are composed. [...] A complete solution of the network can therefore <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>in</b> terms of branch currents or branch voltages only. [...] Nor are all the branch currents independent from each other. [...] The minimum number of branch currents required for a complete solution is l. [...] This is a consequence of the fact that a tree has l links removed and there can be no currents in a tree. [...] Since the remaining branches of the tree have zero current they cannot be independent of the link currents. [...] The branch currents chosen as a set of independent variables must be a set associated with the links of a tree: one cannot choose any l branches arbitrarily.|$|E

He said that the Cardiff proposals were [...] "too compelling to resist", because [...] "in making this decision, I am mindful that Wales has invested 40 years in promoting Cardiff as our capital city." [...] The National Assembly building would <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>in</b> Bute Square or Capital Waterside. The Welsh Office decided that the Capital Waterside proposal carried less risk and would cost less than the Bute Square proposal. Capital Waterside would cost £43.9M, while Bute Square would cost £52.5M. On 28 April 1998, Davies announced that {{the site of the}} National Assembly building would be Capital Waterside. The site was acquired by the National Assembly from Grosvenor Waterside Investments Ltd, which was owned by Associated British Ports. The agreement covered extending the lease of Crickhowell House, later known as Tŷ Hywel, until 2023, renting the Pierhead Building for 15 years and purchasing Site 1E for £1, which would be where the Senedd was built.|$|E

Below this temperature, honey can <b>be</b> <b>either</b> <b>in</b> a metastable state, {{meaning that it}} will not crystallize until a seed crystal is added, or, more often, it is in a [...] "labile" [...] state, being saturated with enough sugars to crystallize spontaneously. The rate of crystallization is affected by many factors, but the primary factor is the ratio of the main sugars: fructose to glucose. Honeys that are supersaturated with a very high percentage of glucose, such as brassica honey, [...] crystallize almost immediately after harvesting, while honeys with a low percentage of glucose, such as chestnut or tupelo honey, do not crystallize. Some types of honey may produce very large but few crystals, while others produce many small crystals.|$|E
