He {{wrote a letter to}} his mother describing the town: Wick lies at the end or elbow of an open triangular bay, hemmed on either side by shores, either cliff or steep earth-bank, of no great height. The grey houses of Pulteney extend along the southerly shore almost to the cape; and it is about half-way down this shore — no, six-sevenths way down — that the new breakwater extends athwart the bay.Certainly Wick in itself possesses no beauty: bare, grey shores, grim grey houses, grim grey sea; not even the gleam of red tiles; not even the greenness of a tree.

You bruise against them, tumble over them, elbow them against the wall — all to no purpose; they will not budge; and you are forced to leave the pavement every step.To the south, however, is as fine a piece of coast scenery as I ever saw. Great black chasms, huge black cliffs, rugged and over- hung gullies, natural arches, and deep green pools below them, almost too deep to let you see the gleam of sand among the darker weed: there are deep caves too. In one of these lives a tribe of gipsies. The men are ALWAYS drunk, simply and truthfully always. From morning to evening the great villainous-looking fellows are either sleeping off the last debauch, or hulking about the cove ‘in the horrors.’ The cave is deep, high, and airy, and might be made comfortable enough. But they just live among heaped boulders, damp with continual droppings from above, with no more furniture than two or three tin pans, a truss of rotten straw, and a few ragged cloaks. In winter the surf bursts into the mouth and often forces them to abandon it.|$|E

The population of the town is sure to have known about the curative qualities of the local mud that can be found here from time immemorial, which is witnessed by the manuscripts of Pliny the Elder, a Roman scholar (ca 80 BC).|$|R
50|$|In 1949, a {{deep water}} survey {{reported}} anomalously hot brines {{in the central}} portion of the Red Sea. Later work in the 1960s confirmed the presence of hot, 60 °C (140 °F), saline brines and associated metalliferous muds. The hot solutions were emanating from an active subseafloor rift. The highly saline character of the waters was not hospitable to living organisms. The <b>brines</b> and associated <b>muds</b> are currently under investigation {{as a source of}} mineable precious and base metals.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that silica {{nanoparticles}} based fresh water drilling muds had good thermal stability up to 160 °C; however its performance at high salt concentration was rather poor. Therefore, high performance silica nanoparticles based <b>brine</b> <b>mud</b> (NPBMs) with high temperature resistance for horizontal shale gas wells was proposed. Thermal stability tests from ambient temperature to 180 °C, along with pressure transmission tests and rheology analysis, were performed to evaluate comprehensive properties of the NPBMs. Results show that the NPBMs embody excellent salt tolerance and thermal resistance for their rheological parameters did not suffer significant fluctuation. Fluid loss of the NPBM- 1 (4 % NaCl plus 3 % KCl) at 180 °C was only 7. 6 [*]mL while the NPBM- 2 (10 % NaCl plus 3 % KCl) had a fluid loss of 6. 6 [*]mL at 150 °C. Low water activity and good lubricity of the NPBMs were beneficial to improve wellbore stability and reduce friction resistance. Pressure transmission tests on the NPBM- 1 show that it can mitigate or even prevent the transmission of drilling mud pressure into shale thus improving wellbore stability. Additionally, optimal rheological models for the NPBM- 1 and the NPBM- 2 were Herschel-Bulkley model and Power Law model separately...|$|E
40|$|After {{synthesis}} of mixed fatty acid triethanolamine ester surfactant based on animal and vegetable mixed oils, the reaction solution was added into 4 % (wt/wt) liquid nitric acid or 9 % (wt/wt) solid nitric acid as eliminating fluorescent agent continuing to react from 1 to 2 hours. The low fluorescence lubricant named E 167 for drilling fluid was prepared, in which maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax) {{was less than}} 10 in three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of excitation wavelength range. When the E 167 was added into fresh water based drilling fluid at the dosage of 0. 5 % (wt/wt), the sticking coefficient reduced rate (ΔKf) is 78 % and the extreme pressure (E-P) friction coefficient reduced rate (Δf) is 79 %. In the case of 4 % <b>brine</b> <b>mud</b> with 0. 5 % (wt/wt) E 167 in it, the ΔKf and Δf are 75 % and 62 %, respectively. After the hot rolling ageing test 180 °C × 16 [*]h with the E 167 was added into fresh water based drilling fluid at the dosage of 1 % (wt/wt), the ΔKf and Δf are greater than 70 %, which shows a much better lubrication properties of strong resistance to high temperature.

40|$|Submarine brine lakes feature {{sharp and}} {{persistent}} concentration gradients between seawater and brine, though {{these should be}} smoothed out by free diffusion in open ocean settings. The anoxic Urania basin of the Eastern Mediterranean contains an ultra sulfidic, hypersaline brine of Messinian origin above {{a thick layer of}} suspended sediments. With a dual modeling approach we reconstruct its contemporary stratification by geochemical solute transport fundamentals, and show that thermal convection is required to maintain mixing in the <b>brine</b> and <b>mud</b> layer. The origin of the Urania basin stratification was dated to 1650 years before present, which may be linked to a major earthquake in the region. The persistence of the chemoclines may be key to the development of diverse and specialized microbial communities. Ongoing thermal convection in the fluid mud layer may have important, yet unresolved consequences for sedimentological and geochemical processes, also in similar environments...|$|R
2500|$|The {{great variety}} of fauna present in chemosynthetic environments is a real {{challenge}} to scientists. [...] Only {{a tiny fraction of}} microorganisms at vents and seeps has been identified, and a huge amount is still to be discovered. Their identification, their association with fauna, and the relationship between their diversity, function and habitat, are vital areas of research as biological communities act as important filters, controlling up to 100% of vent and seep emissions. [...] By using DNA barcoding and genome analysis in addition to traditional methods of identification and experimentation, HERMIONE scientists will study the relationship between community structure and ecosystem functioning at a variety of vents, seeps, <b>brine</b> pools and <b>mud</b> volcanoes.|$|R
40|$|Enrichment {{media were}} {{formulated}} using {{analysis of the}} chemistry of the salt lakes Shangmatala, Ejinnor, Bagaejinnor, and Erliannor in Inner Mongolia. These enrichments contained yeast extract with either glycerol, betaine or starch as carbon sources. Samples of salt, <b>brine</b> and <b>mud</b> from the lakes were used as inoculants and enrichments were incubated at 37 ◦C for 18 days. A total of twenty different bacterial isolates were selected. All isolates were genotypically characterised by their 16 S rDNA sequences, thirteen were phenotypically characterised. Despite the unusual carbon sources in the enrichment media analyses revealed {{that the majority of}} the isolates were related to organisms previously isolated from similar hypersaline sites. A large number have gene sequence identity to not validly published bacteria. Most isolates were Gram positive bacilli and cocci although there were a small number of Gram negative halomonads. Phenotypically the isolates were different. The majority of isolates could grow over a range of pH and salt concentrations. Isolates from the same lake appear to show similar ability to grow on different culture media. Three isolates significantly degraded starch. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol and to ampicillin. Most isolates have an ribosomal RNA gene sequence identity above 99 % to data base entries (lowest identities observed were isolate En 1 98 % to Bacillus sp. SL 5 - 2 and isolate EJBB 2 97 % to Bacteroidetes bacterium KMM). It is therefore unlikely that many of the isolates represent new species...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{investigation}} results of thermal springs of the Mutnovsky Volcano (Kamchatka, Russia) are provided. Mud pots in the Donnoe Field of this volcano {{have a unique}} solution composition. High concentrations of {{a wide spectrum of}} chemical elements such as Al, Ti, V, Cr, Ni, Co, REE and PGE were discovered there. To explain the mechanisms of solution formation it was made an attempt to describe the fluid evolution and the resulting mixing waters by physical and mathematical modeling. A model illustrates fluid migration from magma chamber to the surface. It is shown that formation of <b>brines</b> corresponding to <b>mud</b> pots composition is possible under the secondary boiling border.

40|$|The Gulf of Cádiz, {{located in}} the NE Atlantic Ocean, between the Iberian Peninsula and {{northern}} Africa, contains more than 50 mud volcanoes (MVs). MVs are seafloor edifices that result from the release of <b>mud,</b> <b>brine</b> and hydrocarbon fluids in areas with gas-rich over pressure sediments. These MVs are in different stages of seepage activity, bearing a broad diversity of chemosymbiotic and heterotrophic organisms. Some previous works focussed on the bryozoans from {{some areas of the}} Gulf of Cádiz (e. g. López de la Cuadra & García Gómez, 1994, Harmelin & d’Hondt, 1992 a, b) however, information on bryozoans colonizing the different substrate types (bioclasts, authigenic carbonates, mud breccias) of MVs is almost nule. During 2010 and 2011 and {{within the framework of the}} INDEMARES-CHICA project, 25 samples were collected with beam trawl and benthic dredge at six MVs (Gazul, Almazán, Aveiro, Pipoca, Tarsis and Chica). Forty-five taxa belonging to 26 families and 31 genera were identified. Most taxa (39) was found in a single MV (Gazul) and others in several MVs, including the taxa Adeonellopsis, Palmicellaria, Tessaradoma, Reteporellina, and Schizomavella sp. 2. Several factors may influence the observed bryozoan biodiversity such as the sampling effort and sampling method used, the type and heterogeneity of substrates, and habitats as well as the depth. The identification to species level of the bryozoan material will improve the information on benthic communities of these MVs {{located in the}} recently established Site of Community Importance of “Volcanes de fango del Golfo de Cádiz”.

40|$|The Ducktown Tennessee mining {{district}} consists of several massive sulfide lenses that are generally conformable with the host Ocoee meta-sediments of late Precambrian age. Sulfur isotope {{results from the}} Calloway and Cherokee mines show a mean of + 4 %ø and a range from 0 to 10 %o. In a detailed study of Calloway section one south, two ore types characterized by differing Fe/S ratios were shown to exhibit rough stratigraphic conformity with the contacts (assay boundaries) of the ore masses. The distributions of copper, zinc and magnetite also are roughly consistent with the stratigraphic contacts. Of the two ore types, the high pyrite ore showed lower 8 S a 4 mean values for pyrite and pyrrhotite than the high pyrrhotite ore. Thus gross compositional, internal compositional, and isotopic characteristics are congruent in a stratigraphic sense. The ores have been metamorphosed at load and fluid pressures in excess of 5 kbars and temperatures of from 540 to 690 ø C, based {{on the presence of}} kyanite, staurolite, the absence of cordierite, and iron content in sphalerite. Pyrite-pyrrhotite isotopic differences and the iron con-tent of pyrrhotite both show equilibration temperatures of 275 ø C. Although local iso-topic equilibrium was attained, variations were identified that probably relate to strati-graphic position. The compositional and isotopic patterns are regarded as having survived in a modified way from initial sedimentary depositional patterns. The Red Sea <b>brine</b> pool sulfide <b>muds</b> are chosen to illustrate how the Ducktown de-posits may have formed as sediments deposited around an ancient submarine hot spring vent. The isotopic characteristics of the lead and strontium, and the positive 8 S a 4 values for the sulfides are all compatible with a model in which compaction waters are expelled from sediments in a deep basin. Metals are leached from the sediments by the rising compaction waters and deposited where these waters issue {{from the top of the}} sedimentary pile as submarine springs...|$|R
