5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy. No astronomical <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> count has been proved, {{and it may be}} that the 260-day count is based on the human gestation period. This is reinforced by the use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.|$|E

5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Stratton went on {{to become}} a first-generation {{experimental}}ist in psychology. Wundt's lab in Leipzig, with experimental programs bringing together the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory physiology and nervous-system studies, was a part of the career of most of the first generation. It was the exposure there, added to the graduate work at Yale, that influenced Stratton into becoming a psychologist. It was there that he started his binocular vision experiments as well. In these experiments, he found himself adapting to the new perception of the environment over a few days, after inverting the images his eyes saw on a regular <b>basis.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this,</b> he wore a set of glasses inverting images both upside-down and left-right. Stratton wore these glasses over his right eye and covered the left with a patch during the day, and slept blindfolded at night. Initial movement was clumsy, but adjusting to the new environment took only a few days.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{government}} {{found it}} bizarre that Britain was making independent states out of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, less developed territories with little experience of self-rule, while withholding sovereign statehood from Southern Rhodesia, the Federation's senior partner, {{which had already}} been self-governing for four decades and {{which was one of}} the most prosperous and developed countries in Africa. The principle of majority rule, the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> apparent inconsistency, was considered irrelevant by the Southern Rhodesians. They had presumed that in the event of Federal dissolution they would be first in line for independence without major adjustments to the 1961 constitution, an impression confirmed to them by prior intergovernmental correspondence, particularly the oral promises they claimed to have received from Butler. When it did not prove forthcoming they felt cheated. Salisbury contended that its predominantly white legislature was more deserving of independence than the untried black nationalist leaders as it had proven its competence over decades of self-rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in {{willow grouse}} differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when they have more dark feathers. They seem to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in {{a hierarchy of}} six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was changed into a system where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies. The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E
