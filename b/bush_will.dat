500|$|One of {{the themes}} that dominates {{the latter part of}} Blair's time in office is his {{decision}} to join US President George W. Bush in committing troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the aftermath of which he describes as a [...] "nightmare", but that he believes to have been necessary because Saddam Hussein [...] "had not abandoned the strategy of WMD , merely made a tactical decision to put it into abeyance". He would make the same decision again with regard to Iran, warning that if that country develops nuclear weapons it will change the balance of power of the Middle East, to the region's detriment. Blair believes some problems in Iraq still require a [...] "resolution" [...] and will fester if left unattended. Of the war dead he says, [...] "I feel desperately sorry for them, sorry for the lives cut short, sorry for the families whose bereavement is made worse by the controversy over why their loved ones died, sorry for the utterly unfair selection that the loss should be theirs." [...] A year on from the invasion he hopes <b>Bush</b> <b>will</b> win a second term as US President: [...] "I had come to like and admire George," [...] he writes.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2004, Robertson {{said that}} God told him President <b>Bush</b> <b>will</b> be re-elected in a [...] "blowout" [...] in November. [...] "I think George Bush {{is going to}} win in a walk", Robertson told viewers of his The 700 Club program. [...] "I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout {{election}} in 2004. It's shaping up that way." [...] Bush did in fact win re-election, but not in a landslide. The 2004 race between Bush and John Kerry was one of the closest large elections in history.|$|E
2500|$|Before the Iraq War began, Alexander {{supported}} {{sending troops}} to Iraq and expressed his agreement with President Bush that Iraq must {{be dealt with}} immediately. A year after the war began, Alexander stated that the Iraq War had provided [...] "lessons" [...] to the nation, but {{went on to say that}} American troops should not be withdrawn, saying [...] "It would be even worse if we left before the job was done." [...] In 2007, Alexander touted implementing the Iraq Study Group recommendations, noting that he believes <b>Bush</b> <b>will</b> be viewed as a Truman-esque figure if he implements the Group's recommendations.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2008 {{nomination}} of Sarah Palin for Vice President of the United States, senior pastor Ed Kalnins' preaching was scrutinized by the media. His sermons were {{available on the}} church website. USA Today reported the Huffington Post assertion that [...] "Kalnins has preached that critics of President <b>Bush</b> <b>will</b> be banished to hell; questioned whether {{people who voted for}} Sen. John Kerry in 2004 would be accepted into heaven; and preached that the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Iraq were part of a world war over Christianity". Kalnins preached [...] "I believe that Alaska is one of the refuge states... in the Last Days, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} people are going to come to this state to seek refuge. And the church has to ready to minister to them".|$|E
2500|$|Vedder {{is known}} for his social and {{political}} views. Discussing his views on current issues in the United States, Vedder said, [...] "People on death row, the treatment of animals, women's right to choose. So much in America is based on religious fundamentalist Christianity. Grow up! This is the modern world!" [...] In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled [...] "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion. Vedder and Pearl Jam have consistently supported abortion rights and performed at Rock for Choice in 1994. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000 and played at Green Party super rallies in Chicago and New York City. Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the 2004 Vote for Change tour, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. President. Vedder told Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in." [...] In 2005, during Pearl Jam's first South American tour, Vedder stated, to the immediate and effusive support from the crowd in Rio de Janeiro, that [...] "next time we come to Brazil, the world will be a better place to live, as George <b>Bush</b> <b>will</b> no longer be the President of the United States." [...] Vedder supported the candidacy of Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and Bernie Sanders in 2016.|$|E

A few minutes' gliding through darkness tangible, and they found themselves in the open air among thick bushes. Though the night was very dark there was sufficient light to enable Considine to see the glittering of white teeth close to his face, as a voice whispered in broken English--"You's better tink twice when you try for to chases Tottie next time!

There is a good rest house at the place, I hear, and we sha'n't be pigged in, as we were at Akroful." ...|$|R

6000|$|This homely bush doth to mine eyes expose A very fair, yea, comely ruddy rose. This rose doth also bow {{its head}} to me, Saying, Come, pluck me, I thy rose will be; Yet offer I to gather rose or bud, Ten to one but the <b>bush</b> <b>will</b> have my blood. This {{looks like a}} trapan,[34] or a decoy, To offer, and yet snap, who would enjoy; Yea, the more eager on't, the more in danger, Be he the master of it, or a stranger. Bush, why dost bear a rose if none must have it. Who dost expose it, yet claw those that crave it? Art become freakish? dost the wanton play, Or doth thy testy humour tend its way? ...|$|E
6000|$|George frowned savagely. [...] "You {{ought to}} know my sister, Mrs. Farnam! When she {{undertakes}} a job she leaves nothing to chance, and I guess she's had it all fixed some time since." [...] He turned to Agatha. [...] "I've got to relieve my feelings, if I do nothing else! Well, I suppose you understand what this adventure means? Unless you get back before the new term begins, you'll lose your post, and you take steep chances of ruining your health. You're not used to sleeping on wet ground and going without food. Then you'll {{have to live with}} half-tamed voyageurs and perhaps help them track the canoes. They'll upset you in the rapids and the <b>bush</b> <b>will</b> tear your clothes. I hate to think of my sister going about, draggled and ragged, with a bunch of strange men. But that, while bad enough, is certainly not the worst!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can quite {{understand}} that, lad. At night all {{the sounds of}} a tropical forest seem mysterious and weird, but in the broad daylight the <b>bush</b> <b>will</b> be comparatively still. The nocturnal animals will slink away to their lairs, and there will seem nothing strange to you in the songs and calls of the birds. I should recommend you all to take a sound dose of quinine tonight; I have a two and a half gallon keg of the stuff mixed, and any officer or man can go and take a glass whenever he feels he wants it. It would be good for your nerves, as well as neutralize the effect of the damp rising from the river. I should advise you who are not on the watch to turn in early; it is of no use your exposing yourselves more than is necessary to the miasma." ...|$|E
50|$|Normally, the <b>bushes</b> <b>will</b> be cut {{around the}} mid dry season periods, {{and then set}} on fires and {{prepared}} for planting. Towards {{the end of the}} dry season the crops would normally be planted, and the gardeners will await the approaching rainy season months. After the rain has watered the gardens, it is now weeding time, and the first lots of vegetables such as cucumbers and corn would normally be harvested, and then followed by the Jimi's stable food, the sweet potatoes (or normally called Kaukau).|$|R

25|$|In {{forensic}} biology, pollen {{can tell}} a lot about where a person or object has been, because regions of the world, or even more particular locations such a certain set of <b>bushes,</b> <b>will</b> have a distinctive collection of pollen species.

5000|$|This {{chameleon}} also readily adapts {{to living}} in gardens. However not all suburban areas are suitable. Chameleons can only survive in gardens with lots of bushy and varied vegetation. Most suitable are bushes and small trees which have fine foliage or thin twigs that chameleons can grasp with their hands and use as perches. Pruning or trimming of <b>bushes</b> <b>will</b> usually injure and kill the chameleons. They will avoid lawns too. Chameleons wander and, in suburbs with smaller gardens, they also avoid properties which are not connected to larger [...] "green corridors" [...] which extend over several properties.|$|R
