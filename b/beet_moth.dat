50|$|Scrobipalpa ocellatella, the <b>beet</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth in the Gelechiidae family. It was {{described}} by Boyd in 1858. It is found on Madeira and the Canary Islands, and in North Africa, most of Europe, the Middle East, Iran, from {{the southern part of}} European Russia to the Caucasus, as well as in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Turkmenistan.|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{damage has}} been noticed in beet {{plantations}} at Al-Hayer, Al-Ammariyah and Al-Dirriyah during the autumn of 1990 and 1991. A small <b>beet</b> <b>moth,</b> identified as Phthorimacae ocellatella (Boyd.) proved {{to be responsible for}} such damage. The neonate larva is green with a dark head capsule which turns purplish-green. Each body segment bears a transverse row of red spots, the prothorax and the last abdominal segment are brown. The adult moth is yellowish-grey, spotted with dark brown spots. Wing spread is 15 mm. The fringe of hair in fore-wings is long laterally and short at the end. Hind wings are entirely with long hair fringe. Body length is 5 - 7 mm. The young larvae nibble the leaves while older larvae mine into the veins and gnaw galleries, 3 cm. long in the roots, allowing moulds and decaying bacteria to enter. Many plants are entirely exterminated by the larvae. Up to 28 larvae have been recovered from a single plant. Pupation may take place either in the galleries or between the bases of petioles. The pupae are enveloped in small silken cocoons. As mentioned in the literature, the insect is a Mediterranean species. Its occurrence in Europe (Portugal, Spain, France and Italy); in Asia (Iran, Ussr, Turkey, Iraq and Palestine); in Africa (Island of Madeira, Morocco and Egypt) is on record...|$|E

40|$|The beet {{armyworm}} pheromone dispenser, Yotoh-con-S, was evaluated {{for its ability}} to inhibit mate location and subsequent population growth of {{beet armyworm}} in head lettuce. Pheromone dispensers were very effective in preventing male <b>beet</b> armyworm <b>moths</b> from locating point pheromone sources. Pheromone dispensers also appeared to result in an approximately 75 % reduction in beet armyworm larvae relative to untreated fields...|$|R

40|$|Current anticholinesterase {{pesticides}} {{were developed}} during World War II and are toxic to mammals because they target a catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) in insects and in mammals. A sequence analysis of AChEs from 73 species and a three-dimensional {{model of a}} malaria-carrying mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) AChE (AgAChE) reported here show that C 286 and R 339 of AgAChE are conserved {{at the opening of}} the active site of AChEs in 17 invertebrate and four insect species, respectively. Both residues are absent in the active site of AChEs of human, monkey, dog, cat, cattle, rabbit, rat, and mouse. The 17 invertebrates include house mosquito, Japanese encephalitis mosquito, African malaria mosquito, German cockroach, Florida lancelet, rice leaf beetle, African bollworm, <b>beet</b> armyworm, codling <b>moth,</b> diamondback moth, domestic silkworm, honey bee, oat or wheat aphid, the greenbug, melon or cotton aphid, green peach aphid, and English grain aphid. The four insects are house mosquito, Japanese encephalitis mosquito, African malaria mosquito, and German cockroach. The discovery of the two invertebrate-specific residues enables the development of effective and safer pesticides that target the residues present only in mosquito AChEs rather than the ubiquitous serine residue, thus potentially offering an effective control of mosquito-borne malaria. Anti-AgAChE pesticides can be designed to interact with R 339 and subsequently covalently bond to C 286. Such pesticides would be toxic to mosquitoes but not to mammals...|$|R
