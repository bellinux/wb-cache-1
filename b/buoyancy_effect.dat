40|$|Most {{explicit}} algebraic stress {{models are}} formulated for turbulent shear flows without accounting for external body force effects, {{such as the}} buoyant force. These models yield fairly good predictions of the turbulence field generated by mean shear. As for thermal turbulence generated by the buoyant force, the models fail to give satisfactory results. The {{reason is that the}} models do not explicitly account for <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effects,</b> which interact with the mean shear to enhance or suppress turbulent mixing. Since applicable, coupled differential equations have been developed describing these thermal turbulent fields, it is possible to develop corresponding explicit algebraic stress models using tensor representation theory. While the procedure to be followed has been employed previously, unique challenges arise in extending the procedure for developing the algebraic representations to turbulent buoyant flows. In this paper the development of an explicit algebraic stress model (EASM) is confined to the homogeneous buoyant shear flow case to illustrate the methodology needed to develop the proper polynomial representations. The derivation is based on the implicit formulation of the Reynolds stress anisotropy at buoyant equilibrium. A five-term representation is found to be necessary to account properly for the effect of the thermal field. Thus derived, external <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effects</b> are represented in the scalar coefficients of the basis tensors, and structural <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effects</b> are accounted for in additional terms in the stress anisotropy tensor. These terms will not vanish {{even in the absence of}} mean shear. The performance of the new EASM, together with a two-equation (2 -Eq) model, the non-buoyant EASM of Gatski and Speziale (1993) and a full second-order model, is assessed against direct numerical simulations of homogeneous, buoyant shear flows at two different Richardson numbers representing weak and strong <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effects.</b> The calculations show that this five-term representation yields better results than the 2 -Eq model and the EASM of Gatski and Speziale where <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effects</b> are not explicitly accounted for.

The phenomenon of combustion by itself is unlikely to induce significant pressure nonuniformities which can describe the observed levels of overshoot in velocity. The <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effects</b> can, however, induce velocity overshoot to a certain extent.

This was not disproved until careful experiments were performed in which chemical reactions such as rusting were allowed to take place in sealed glass ampoules; {{it was found that the}} chemical reaction did not change the weight of the sealed container and its contents.

50|$|Natural {{ventilation}} {{in buildings}} can rely mostly on wind pressure differences in windy conditions, but buoyancy effects can a) augment {{this type of}} ventilation and b) ensure air flow rates during still days. Buoyancy-driven ventilation can be implemented in ways that air inflow in the building does not rely solely on wind direction. In this respect it may provide improved air quality in some types of polluted environments such as cities. For example air can be drawn through the backside or courtyards of buildings avoiding the direct pollution and noise of the street facade. Wind can augment the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effect</b> but can also reduce its effect depending on its speed, direction and the design of air inlets and outlets.

50|$|The {{depth of}} the surface mixed layer is {{affected}} by solar insolation and thus {{is related to the}} diurnal cycle. After nighttime convection over the ocean, the turbulent surface layer is found to completely decay and restratify. The decay is caused by the decrease in solar insolation, divergence of turbulent flux and relaxation of lateral gradients.During the nighttime, the surface ocean cools because the atmospheric circulation is reduced due to the change in heat with the setting of the sun each day. Cooler water is less buoyant and will sink. This <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effect</b> causes water masses to be transported to lower depths even lower those reached during daytime. During the following daytime, water at depth is restratified or un-mixed because of the warming of the sea surface and buoyancy driving the warmed water upward. The entire cycle will be repeated and the water will be mixed during the following nighttime.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a spatial {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS) of the flow transition of a buoyant diffusion flame established on a rectangular nozzle with an aspect ratio of 2 : 1. Combustion is represented by a one-step finite-rate Arrhenius chemistry. Without applying external perturbations, large vertical structures develop naturally in the flow field due to <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effects.</b> The vortex dynamics of the rectangular buoyant reacting jet has been analysed. The interaction between density gradients and gravity initiates the flow vorticity in the cross-streamwise directions. The streamwise vorticity is mainly generated by the vortex stretching. Downstream of the reacting jet, a more disorganized flow regime characterized by small scales has been observed, following {{the breakdown of the}} large vortical structures due to three-dimensional vortex interactions. Analysis of the energy spectra shows that the spatially developing reacting jet has a tendency of transition to turbulence under the <b>effects</b> of combustion-induced <b>buoyancy.</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> <b>effects</b> are found to be very important to the formation, development, interaction and breakdown of vortices. In contrast with the relaminarization effects of chemical exothermicity on non-buoyant jet diffusion flames via volumetric expansion and viscous damping, the tendency towards transition to turbulence in buoyant reacting jets is greatly enhanced by the overwhelming <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effects.</b> Calculations of the mean flow property show that the rectangular buoyant reacting jet has a higher entrainment rate than its non-reacting counterpart...|$|R
50|$|If {{the flow}} is {{neutrally}} buoyant, i.e., , (see, e.g., Bagnold, 1954) the debris mass is fluidized and moves longer travel distances. This {{can happen in}} highly viscous natural debris flows. For neutrally buoyant flows, Coulomb friction disappears, the lateral solid pressure gradient vanishes, the drag coefficient is zero, and the basal slope effect on the solid phase also vanishes. In this limiting case, the only remaining solid force is due to gravity, and thus the force associated with buoyancy.Under these conditions of hydrodynamic support of the particles by the fluid, the debris mass is fully fluidized (or lubricated) and moves very economically, promoting long travel distances. Compared to buoyant flow, the neutrally buoyant flow shows completely different behaviour. For the latter case, the solid and fluid phases move together, the debris bulk mass is fluidized, the front moves substantially farther, the tail lags behind, and the overall flow height is also reduced. When , the flow does not experience any <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effect.</b> Then the effective frictional shear stress for the solid phase is that of pure granular flow. In this case the force due to the pressure gradient is altered, the drag is high {{and the effect of}} the virtual mass disappears in the solid momentum. All this leads to slowing down the motion.|$|E
50|$|Note, however, {{that this}} is not the sole effect to be taken into {{consideration}} when assessing the likelihood of capsize. The change in hull windage as the vessel heels is also important. In the case of a trimaran designed for cruising, with solid wing decks (as opposed to racing-type designs with mesh or open wings), those with wide-beam floats able to support the whole weight of the vessel are more likely to capsize than those with narrow-beam floats of lesser buoyancy that can be submerged as the vessel heels. As the wide-beam float comes to take the entire weight of the heeling vessel, the centre hull lifts out of the water; this exposes the entire area of the underside of both wings to the wind, and also increases the turning moment of the wind force on the weather wing. There is now a considerable overturning force due to the wind and the vessel is very likely to capsize. In contrast, a trimaran with narrow-beam floats will simply submerge the lee float, exposing only the weather wing and that with a lesser moment. In practical sea situations the windage effect is greater than the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effect</b> and so cruising trimarans with highly buoyant floats are more, not less, likely to capsize than those with less buoyant floats.|$|E
50|$|Archimedes' principle, {{physical}} law of buoyancy, {{stating that}} any body completely or partially submerged in a fluid (gas or liquid) at rest is acted upon by an upward, or buoyant, force {{the magnitude of}} which {{is equal to the}} weight of the fluid displaced by the body. The volume of displaced fluid is equivalent to the volume of an object fully immersed in a fluid or to that fraction of the volume below the surface for an object partially submerged in a liquid. The weight of the displaced portion of the fluid is equivalent to the magnitude of the buoyant force. The buoyant force on a body floating in a liquid or gas is also equivalent in magnitude to the weight of the floating object and is opposite in direction; the object neither rises nor sinks. If the weight of an object is less than that of the displaced fluid, the object rises, {{as in the case of}} a block of wood that is released beneath the surface of water or a helium-filled balloon that is let loose in air. An object heavier than the amount of the fluid it displaces, though it sinks when released, has an apparent weight loss equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. In fact, in some accurate weighing, a correction must be made in order to compensate for the <b>buoyancy</b> <b>effect</b> of the surrounding air. The buoyant force, which always opposes gravity, is nevertheless caused by gravity. Fluid pressure increases with depth because of the (gravitational) weight of the fluid above. This increasing pressure applies a force on a submerged object that increases with depth. The result is buoyancy.|$|E

Wang and Wu[6] proposed a discrete numerical model and demonstrated the flow and temperature distribution in a flat-plate solar collector for U- and Z-configurations by taking into account the <b>effects</b> of <b>buoyancy</b> and longitudinal heat conduction.
