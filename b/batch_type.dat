50|$|In sunny, warm locations, where freeze {{protection}} is not necessary, an ICS (<b>batch</b> <b>type)</b> {{solar water heater}} can be cost effective.In higher latitudes, design requirements for cold weather add to system complexity and cost.This increases initial costs, but not life-cycle costs. The biggest single consideration is therefore the large initial financial outlay of solar water heating systems. Offsetting this expense can take years.The payback period is longer in temperate environments.Since solar energy is free, operating costs are small.At higher latitudes, solar heaters may be less effective due to lower insolation, possibly requiring larger and/or dual-heating systems. In some countries government incentives can be significant.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: On {{concrete}} dam construction work, {{it is necessary}} to manufacture a large amount of concrete and CSG (Cemented Sand and Gravel). The manufacture plant of concrete and CSG is operated in very long term, therefore the effect of its environmental impact could be serious. In general, {{there are two types of}} manufacture plant on the process of manufacturing concrete or CSG. The one is <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> plant; its mixing process is not continuous and {{it is necessary to}} repeat the processes of measuring and mixing every batch. The other is continuous mixing plant; mixing process is completely continuous, at the same time, the measurement and supplement of materials are also carried out continuously. Since continuous mixing plant can manufacture a large amount of products at short time, continuous mixing plant is suitable for manufacture plant of {{concrete dam}} construction. But it is hard to control the quality of products, so <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> plant used to be adopted as the mixer of the manufacture plant. In recent years, the new continuous mixing plant which can control the quality of products accurately has developed and been put to practical use on several projects of concrete and CSG dam construction. The best feature of this plant is its energy saving effect. This plant is equipped with a static continuous mixer for mixing concrete or CSG. This mixer is set up in vertical direction, and then it is possible to mix materials with no electric power but only by gravity force. In this study, environmental impact due to manufacture concrete and CSG by conventional <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> plant and new continuous mixing plant are estimated and compared, and then the advantage of new continues mixing plant for environment is discussed...|$|E
