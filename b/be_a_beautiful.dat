500|$|The prom itself {{took three}} very long days to shoot, {{according}} to Criss, and involved {{a lot of}} hard work, though he added that it was [...] "so much fun" [...] and the actors and extras involved [...] "had a blast." [...] In the original script, Kurt was persuaded to attend his coronation by Blaine. Colfer requested that Kurt [...] "do that for himself and not be persuaded by a second party", and events were duly changed. The actor had serious reservations about the episode, and called it [...] "the most difficult" [...] he had worked on; he explained that the combination of Kurt as prom queen, wearing a kilt and tiara and dancing to [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] caused him concern that [...] "they were just pushing it way too much", and that Kurt's [...] "helpful and progressive" [...] depiction would be tarnished. Once completed, Colfer conceded, [...] "it did turn out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> episode. I was so wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Peter Bradshaw {{similarly}} lauded the film, also awarding it five stars out of five. Bradshaw {{considered it}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> film, describing its sound design as [...] "industrial groaning, as if filmed inside some collapsing factory or gigantic dying organism". He highlighted the film's body horror elements, {{comparing it to}} Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien. Keith Phipps, writing for AllRovi, also gave the film a rating of five stars out of five; he highlighted the disturbing sound design of the film and described it as [...] "an open metaphor". He felt that Eraserhead [...] "sets up the obsessions that would follow [...] through his career", adding his belief that the film's surrealism enhanced {{the understanding of the}} director's later films. In an article for The Daily Telegraph, film-maker Marc Evans praised both the sound design and Lynch's ability [...] "to make the ordinary seem so odd", considering the film an inspiration on his own work. A review of the film in the same newspaper compared Eraserhead to the works of Irish playwright Samuel Beckett, describing it as a chaotic parody of family life. Manohla Dargis, writing for The New York Times, called the film [...] "less a straight story than a surrealistic assemblage". Dargis felt that the film's imagery evoked the paintings of Francis Bacon and the Georges Franju 1949 documentary Blood of the Beasts. Film Threat Phil Hall called Eraserhead Lynch's best film, believing that the director's subsequent output {{failed to live up to}} it. Hall highlighted the film's soundtrack and Nance's [...] "Chaplinesque" [...] physical comedy as the film's stand-out elements.|$|E

2500|$|After {{escaping}} the musketeers, Don Quixote and Sancho ride {{to a nearby}} inn. Once again, Don Quixote imagines the inn is a castle, although Sancho is not quite convinced. Don Quixote is given a bed in a former hayloft, and Sancho sleeps on the rug next to the bed; they share the loft with a muleteer. When night comes, Don Quixote imagines the servant girl at the inn, Helen, to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> princess, and makes her sit on his bed with him, scaring her. Seeing what is happening, the muleteer attacks Don Quixote, breaking the fragile bed and leading to a large and chaotic fight in which Don Quixote and Sancho are once again badly hurt. Don Quixote's explanation for everything is that they fought with an enchanted Moor. He also believes that he can cure their wounds with a mixture he calls [...] "the balm of Firearbras", which only makes them sick. Don Quixote and Sancho decide to leave the inn, but Quixote, following {{the example of the}} fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho, however, remains and ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed up in the air (blanketed) by several mischievous guests at the inn, something that is often mentioned over the rest of the novel. After his release, he and Don Quixote continue their travels.|$|E
