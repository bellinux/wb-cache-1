40|$|Semi-permeable {{membrane}} devices (SPMDs) {{were loaded}} with deuterated anthracene and pyrene as performance reference compounds (PRCs) and deployed at a test site in four different chambers (open and closed box chamber, <b>bowl</b> <b>chamber</b> and cage chamber) for 29 days. The losses of PRCs and the uptake of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the ambient air were quantified. UV-B levels measured in each deployment chamber indicated that SPMDs would {{be exposed to}} the most UV-B in the cage chamber and open box chamber. Significantly less PAHs were quantified in SPMDs deployed in the cage chamber and open box chamber compared to samplers from the other two chambers, suggesting that photodegradation of PAHs had occurred. The loss of PRCs confirmed these results but also showed that photodegradation was occurring in the closed box chamber. The <b>bowl</b> <b>chamber</b> appears to provide the best protection from the influence of direct photodegradation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{combination}} of high-pressure injection and small orifices {{will be one}} of the strategies to achieve lean combustion. However, equispaced small orifices tend to increase soot under high-load conditions because the spray penetration becomes exceedingly inadequate. For this reason, the cluster concept was chosen as the means to realize lean combustion. To make the use of clusters in a diesel engine feasible, a significant redesign of the typical in-cylinder geometry would probably be required to promote efficient air utilization. The new combustion chamber was designed with a smaller diameter and deeper bowl. It is expected to improve fuel–air mixing by better spray guidance. The study identifies the aspects of combustion and pollution formation that are affected by mixing processes and offers guidance for better matching of the piston geometry with the spray plume geometry for enhanced mixing. Various clusters were investigated to achieve variation in the injection timing for different test points in the original piston <b>bowl</b> <b>chamber</b> and the new <b>bowl</b> <b>chamber,</b> and the results are compared with those for a conventional nozzle. The cluster with the best results for smoke emissions in the first set of tests was also tested for different swirl ratios and different nozzle protrusion lengths...|$|E
40|$|In the {{periplasm}} of Escherichia coli, DegP (also {{known as}} HtrA), which has both chaperone-like and proteolytic activities, prevents {{the accumulation of}} toxic misfolded and unfolded polypeptides. In solution, upon binding to denatured proteins, DegP forms large cage-like structures. Here, we show that DegP forms a range of bowl-shaped structures, independent of substrate proteins, each with a 4 -, 5 -, or 6 -fold symmetry and all with a DegP trimer as the structural unit, on lipid membranes. These membrane-bound DegP assemblies {{have the capacity to}} recruit and process substrates in the <b>bowl</b> <b>chamber,</b> and they exhibit higher proteolytic and lower chaperone-like activities than DegP in solution. Our findings imply that DegP might regulate its dual roles during protein quality control, depending on its assembly state in the narrow bacterial envelope...|$|E

40|$|Semipermeable {{membrane}} devices (SPMDs) {{were deployed}} in water using four different methods: a typical SPMD cage {{with and without}} a mesh cover, a <b>bowl</b> <b>chamber</b> and without any protection. In addition to routinely used performance reference compounds (PRCs), perdeuterated dibenz[a,h]anthracene was added. Due to its high sampler to water partition coefficient no measurable clearance due to diffusion was expected during the deployment period, hence any observed loss {{could be attributed to}} photodegradation. The loss of PRCs was measured and SPMD-based water concentrations determined. Results showed that a typical SPMD deployment cage covered with mesh provided the best protection from photodegradation. Samplers which had undergone the highest photodegradation underestimated PAH water concentrations by up to a factor of 5 compared to the most protected SPMDs. This study demonstrates that the potential for photodegradation needs to be addressed when samplers are deployed in water of low turbidity. Our study indicates that photodegradation of PAHs occurs from passive water samplers (SPMDs) deployed in different devices. Copyright © 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|My {{starting}} point for this paper is a Victorian jug, bowl and chamber-pot set, that I encountered displayed in the toilet of a small Yorkshire Museum. The story of this set is the framework for an exploration of literature on how we invest personal, domestic possessions with meaning. Before starting its life in the museum, the jug, <b>bowl</b> and <b>chamber</b> pot set belonged {{to the secretary of}} the museum board. It was gifted to her by a friend 4 or 5 years ago, and she kept it in her bathroom, filled with potpourri, dried flowers and soaps. When she had her bathroom replaced, there was no longer enough surface space for displaying the set. She moved it into storage in the shed, where she still kept it on view to remind her that it needed a new home. Then she thought of putting it on display in the new museum toilet, on an old wooden cabinet she had in her conservatory. Her decision to move it out of her home and into the museum toilet was a creative and caring one, which triggered the washstand’s transformation from a personal possession, into a public historical artifact. The Victorian washstand set has an interesting -and in many ways ordinary- ‘life’ story, punctuated by transitions in meaning, value and purpose. By writing this paper I will ‘visit’ the most significant transitions, and use my visits as the basis for considering literature that discusses peoples’ relationships to their domestic possessions, and practices of keeping them that influence transitions in meaning. In particular, I am seeking instances where the physical and material properties of an object are discussed in relation to meaning-making. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccurate {{simulations}} on combustion and emission {{characteristics of}} direct injection diesel engines are {{highly dependent on}} detailed prediction of equivalence ratio distribution inside the combustion chamber. In this study, Open-FOAM and Lib-ICE multi-dimensional CFD frameworks were used in order to model engine flow, liquid diesel fuel spray, break-up, evaporation and mixing. Simulations were conducted {{on the basis of}} experimental data from SANDIA optical engine. Initial simulation results showed tangible discrepancy with the experimental equivalence ratio data in distribution of fuel-rich zones. Investigations on three different injection angles in three different combustion <b>chamber</b> <b>bowl</b> geometries showed that cavitation phenomenon was most probably occurred in injector nozzle during the experiments. Onset of cavitation in injector nozzle internal flow can noticeably change the spray break-up length and cause asymmetric spray angle later inside the combustion chamber. Taking cavitation effects into account, simulations were performed by corrected values of spray break-up length and injection angle based on experimental injection pressure and nozzle orifice dimensions. Final spray simulations showed better agreement with experimental results for all of three bowl geometries. This enhanced accuracy of numerical prediction without unacceptable tuning of spray sub-model parameters...|$|R

5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many <b>bowls</b> in the <b>chamber</b> indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{literature}} review of 34 families of flowering plants containing {{at least one}} species pollinated primarily by beetles is presented. While the majority of species are represented by mag-noliids and basal monocotyledons specialized, bee-tle-pollinated systems have evolved independently in 14 families of eudicotyldons and six families of petaloid monocots. Four, overlapping modes of floral presentation i plants pollinated xclusively by beetles (Bilabiate, Brush, Chamber Blossom and Painted <b>Bowl)</b> are described. <b>Chamber</b> Blossoms and Painted Bowls {{are the two most}} common modes. Chamber Blossoms, found in magnoliids, primitive monocotyledons and in some families of woody eudicots, exploit the greatest diversity of beetle pollinators. Painted Bowls are restricted to petaloid monocots and a few families of eudicots dependent primarily on hairy species of Scarabaei-dae as pollen vectors. In contrast, generalist flowers pollinated by a combination of beetles and other animals are recorded in 22 families. Generalist systems are more likely to secrete nectar and exploit four beetle families absent in specialist flowers. Centers of diversity for species with specialized, beetle-pollinated systems are distributed through the wet tropics (centers for Brush and Chamber Blossoms) to warm temperate-Mediterranean zones (centers for Painted Bowls and a few Bilabiate flowers). It is unlikely that beetles were the first pollinators of angiosperms but specialized, beetle-pollinated flowers must have evolved by the mid-late Cretaceous to join pre-existing guilds of beetle-pollinated gymnosperms. The floras of Australia and western North America suggest that mutualistic interactions between beetles and flowers has been a continuous and labile trend in angiosperms with novel interactions evolving through the Tertiary...|$|R
