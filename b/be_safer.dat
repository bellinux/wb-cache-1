5|$|In all, double-hull tankers {{are said}} to <b>be</b> <b>safer</b> than a single-hull in a {{grounding}} incident, especially when the shore is not very rocky. The safety benefits are less clear on larger vessels and in cases of high speed impact.|$|E
5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would <b>be</b> <b>safer</b> to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that {{spent nuclear fuel}} and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would <b>be</b> <b>safer</b> than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.|$|E

5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would <b>be</b> <b>safer</b> to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops, and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Pennington, {{who lived}} near Lanesville, {{became one of}} the county's early leading {{citizens}} and speaker of the territory's legislature. Corydon began competing with other southern Indiana settlements to become the new capital of the territory after its reorganization in 1809. Hostilities broke out in 1811 with the Native American tribes on the frontier, and the territorial capital was moved to Corydon on May1, 1813, after Pennington suggested it would <b>be</b> <b>safer</b> than Vincennes. For the next twelve years, Corydon was the political center of the territory and subsequent state. A state constitution was drafted in Corydon during June 1816 and after statehood the town served as the state capital until 1825.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may <b>be</b> <b>safer</b> from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E

5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. Animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to <b>be</b> <b>safer</b> alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to <b>be</b> <b>safer</b> and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E
5|$|The initial aim of {{treatment}} is {{to settle the}} symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes {{several times a day}} to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. While steroids and NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may <b>be</b> <b>safer.</b> Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied. It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.|$|E
