25|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, Polo {{witnessed}} {{the disintegration of}} her family. On 31 January 1976, she left El Pardo for the last time. In 1978, Carmencita was arrested at Madrid Barajas International Airport for attempting to smuggle 300 million pesetas worth of gold, jewellery, and medals which had <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father. María del Carmen separated from her husband and moved to Paris, where she lived with the antiquarian Jean-Marie Rossi.

Badlesmere, who by then had become disaffected with King Edward and had joined the swelling ranks of his opponents, was away {{at a meeting of the}} Contrariants in Oxford at the time and had left Margaret in charge of the castle.|$|E

25|$|During {{her early}} years, Dinesen {{spent part of}} her time at her mother's family home, the Mattrup seat farm near Horsens, while in later years there were visits to Folehavegård, an estate near Hørsholm that had <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father's family. Longing for the freedom she had enjoyed when her father was alive, {{she was able to}} find some {{satisfaction}} in telling her younger sister Ellen hair-raising good-night stories, partly inspired by Danish folk tales and Icelandic sagas. In 1905, these led to her Grjotgard Ålvesøn og Aud in which her literary talent began to emerge. Around this time, she also published fiction in Danish periodicals under the pseudonym Osceola, the name of her father's dog, which she had often walked in her father's company.|$|E
25|$|Harry also {{inherits}} indirectly {{two of his}} father's prized possessions. One is the Marauder's Map, {{given to}} him by interim owners Fred and George Weasley, which endows Harry with comprehensive knowledge of Hogwarts' facilities, grounds, and occupants. The other is his father's Invisibility Cloak, {{given to him by}} Dumbledore, which eventually proves Harry's descent from the Peverell family. Harry uses these tools both to aid in excursions at school and to protect those he cares about; the Invisibility Cloak, in particular, can hide two full-grown people. If three fully-grown people hide under the cloak their feet will be visible. When Harry reaches his age of maturity at seventeen, Molly Weasley gives him a pocket watch which had once <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brother Fabian Prewett, as it is traditional to give a boy a watch when he turns seventeen.|$|E
25|$|Her brother's {{departure}} was {{to cause}} the remaining great distress, as the regulations of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy put into law by the National Constituent Assembly, which had declared all property of the Church to be declared national goods, were then being applied to émigrés like Laurent Bichier des Âges. Under this law, their ancestral castle was liable to confiscation, so Elizabeth and her mother moved to their house in the village. Under the Law of Suspects, the local Revolutionary Surveillance Committee then began to harass the family with daily visits, urging them to take the oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution. The pair steadfastly refused. In {{the course of one}} such visit, some weapons which had <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father from his younger days were discovered in the attic of the house. Elizabeth was then briefly imprisoned together with her mother in Châteauroux. Another brother, who had joined the forces of Revolution, quickly obtained their release.|$|E

25|$|It was presumably in {{the year}} of her father's {{appointment}} (c. 1057) that Ealdgyth married his political ally, King Gruffudd ap Llywelyn. William of Jumièges describes her as a woman of considerable beauty. Walter Map also wrote of a beautiful lady much beloved by the king and so he may have had Ealdgyth in mind. On her marriage, she was given a modest amount of land in England, though the only estate which can be certainly identified as having <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> is one at Binley, Warwickshire. She bore the king a daughter called Nest. Nest later became the wife of Osbern fitz Richard, a marcher lord on the Herefordshire border, who acquired Binley. Nest and Osbern had a daughter who married Bernard de Neufmarché, also a marcher lord. The chronicles also record two of Gruffudd's sons, Maredudd and Ithel, probably for Idwal, who died in 1069, and a third son may be Owain ap Gruffudd (d. 1059).|$|E
25|$|Chaos erupts {{throughout}} {{the streets and}} Quintana is killed by a bull stampede. At the docks, Miller saves Feck from a bullet wound after handing over the Zephyr in a small pouch. Feck later reveals that the battery is unstable and it explodes, killing Fitzgerald. Miller collapses from the gunshot and is hospitalized in Washington D.C.. George apologizes to Miller about him and Fitzgerald, but tells him {{to let go of}} Havens and return to the C.I.A. Miller is later drugged by a nurse, who turns out to be Havens. After Havens breaks Miller out of the hospital, he wakes up in the rebuilt GTO that <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father. After Miller asks what day it is, Havens kisses him and says it is someday. This is a reference {{from the start of the}} film that they both have things they want to do someday, and Havens begins to drive towards Cape Horn. As the credits begin to roll, Miller's parents unwittingly receive tickets to Cape Horn in the mail and accept to go.|$|E

Bianca assumes Carl is the plumber, {{but when the}} real plumber arrives, Carl says he is the friend of Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) that Bianca called. He learns that Derek is dead, and claims to know his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks), so Bianca gives him her address. He visits Alice, who gives him the box that contained the phone number, which Alice says was found by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Bianca's friend Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) realises that Carl lied about knowing Alice and warns Alice and Bianca {{to be wary of}} him. Carl visits Ian, who denies knowing Derek. Carl realises Ian took £10,000 from the box that Derek owed him, and Ian is terrified of Carl. The next day, Carl sees his ex-girlfriend, Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), who says she is now married and pregnant, and he has no reason to stay. At the restaurant, Carl makes Ian confess to taking his money, and tells Ian to pay him £500 a week for the foreseeable future. He then tells Kirsty he is not leaving. Ian soon realises the situation between Carl and Kirsty, so he threatens to tell Kirsty about Carl's blackmail. Carl responds by burning Ian's hand.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} a young woman were found frozen in a creek by hunters on November 23, 2008, in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, near an {{abandoned}} farm. To extract the body, investigators were forced to chisel away the ice and scuba divers searched the bottom for evidence. Some articles of clothing were found, including a black and pink top with a pink bow, originating from Family Dollar, distributed in the spring of 2008. The underclothing that she wore, also from Family Dollar, was shipped only between July 1 and July 15, 2008. Her jeans were that of the Angels brand and the bottom of the legs had been rolled up, somewhat, and an elastic ponytail holder was found on her wrist. No socks or shoes were found at the scene. Initially, no jewelry was found, until a penny-sized St. Benedict medal was found by divers, but it may not have <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> as examiners could not be certain how long {{it had been in the}} water. However, some reports claim that a bracelet containing several pendants was also found on the girl's remains. The hair was a shoulder-length light brown, possibly having hair highlights due to having some different shades. The clothing had caused some issues with investigators, as many of the different articles were in various sizes.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Ryder sent a videotaped audition, {{where she}} recited a {{monologue}} from the novel Franny and Zooey by J. D. Salinger, {{to appear in}} the film Desert Bloom. Although the part went to Annabeth Gish, writer/director David Seltzer noticed her talent and cast her in his film Lucas (1986), about a boy called Lucas (Corey Haim) and his life at high school. Shot in the summer of 1985, the film co-starred Charlie Sheen and Kerri Green with Ryder playing Rina, one of Lucas's friends at school. When asked how she wanted her name {{to appear in the}} credits, she suggested [...] "Ryder" [...] as her surname because a Mitch Ryder album that <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father was playing in the background.|$|E
