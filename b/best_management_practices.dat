25|$|Porto Alegre {{was one of}} {{the first}} cities in Brazil to develop a {{recycling}} program and has been acknowledged as having the <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> in the country. The city produces about 1,600 tonnes of household waste per day. Since 1997, all non-recyclable waste has been disposed of in landfill sites. Infiltration into the soil is prevented by the double-walled construction of a clay layer and a high-density polythene geo-membrane, the lowering of the water table and the draining off and treatment of any effluent.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{watershed}} of Little Buffalo Creek is on forested land or agricultural land, {{but there are}} other land uses as well. A number of bridges have been constructed over the creek. In 2014, a $329,851 grant from the Growing Greener program was issued to the Union County Conservation District for agricultural <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> in the its watershed. The creek's drainage basin is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery and wild trout naturally reproduce in a reach of it. American eels have also been released into the creek.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{have also}} been raised {{regarding}} the impact of geoduck aquaculture on the natural habitat, particularly in Puget Sound. Currently, geoduck aquaculture in Puget Sound occupies 80 ha of private tidelands which are either owned by aquaculture companies or leased from other landowners. (another report put the area at 141 ha) Because geoduck aquaculture occurs on private lands, there is minimal government oversight, and environmental concerns raised by the residents are most often left to the aquaculture companies to address, {{and in some cases}} for the courts to arbitrate.

25|$|<b>Best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> (BMPs) {{to control}} weeds may help delay resistance. BMPs include {{applying}} multiple herbicides with different modes of action, rotating crops, planting weed-free seed, scouting fields routinely, cleaning equipment {{to reduce the}} transmission of weeds to other fields, and maintaining field borders. The most widely planted GM crops are designed to tolerate herbicides. By 2006 some weed populations had evolved to tolerate {{some of the same}} herbicides. Palmer amaranth is a weed that competes with cotton. A native of the southwestern US, it traveled east and was first found resistant to glyphosate in 2006, less than 10 years after GM cotton was introduced.|$|E
25|$|Wetlands {{are another}} major {{attractant}} of wildlife {{in the airport}} environment. They are of particular concern because they attract waterfowl which have a high potential to damage aircraft (Federal Aviation Administration 2013). With large areas of impervious surfaces, airports must employ methods to collect runoff and reduce its flow velocity. These <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> often involve temporarily ponding runoff. Short of redesigning existing runoff control systems to include non-accessible water such as subsurface flow wetlands (DeVault et al. 2013), frequent drawdowns and covering of exposed water with floating covers and wire grids should be employed (International Civil Aviation Organization 1991). The implementation of covers and wire grids must not hinder emergency services.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} {{of the collapse of}} governmental authority that accompanied the civil war was the emergence of piracy in the unpatrolled Indian Ocean waters off of the coast of Somalia. The phenomenon arose as an attempt by local fishermen to protect their livelihood from illegal fishing by foreign trawlers. In August 2008, a multinational coalition took on the task of combating the piracy by establishing a Maritime Security Patrol Area (MSPA) within the Gulf of Aden. A maritime police force was also later formed in the Puntland region, and <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices,</b> including hiring private armed guards, were adopted by ship owners. These combined efforts led to a sharp decline in incidents. By October 2012, pirate attacks had dropped to a six-year low, with only 1 ship attacked in the third quarter compared to 36 during the same period in 2011.|$|E
50|$|A {{stormwater}} detention vault is {{an underground}} structure designed to manage excess stormwater runoff on a developed site, often {{in an urban}} setting. This type of <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> may be selected when there is insufficient space on the site to infiltrate the runoff or build a surface facility such as a detention basin or retention basin.|$|R
50|$|A {{filter strip}} {{is a type}} of buffer strip that is an area of vegetation, {{generally}} narrow and long, that slows the rate of runoff, allowing sediments, organic matter, and other pollutants that are being conveyed by the water to be removed by settling out.

25|$|Non-stormwater permits {{typically}} include numeric effluent {{limitations for}} specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration {{allowed in the}} discharge, e.g., 30mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes {{a violation of the}} permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices,</b> but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.|$|E
500|$|About {{three-quarters of}} U.S. {{production}} comes from Idaho, particularly the Snake River area, {{due in part}} to the quality and temperature of the water available there. California and Washington also produce significant amounts of farmed trout. [...] In the east, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and West Virginia have farming operations. Rainbow trout farming is one of the largest finfish aquaculture industries in the U.S. They are raised inland in facilities where raceways or ponds have continuously flowing water with little pollution and a low risk of escape. The U.S. industry is noted for using <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> Imports constitute only about 15percent of farmed rainbows sold in the U.S., and nearly all domestic production is consumed within the country; very little is exported. The U.S. produces about 7percent of the world's farmed trout. Rainbow trout, especially those raised in farms and hatcheries, are susceptible to enteric redmouth disease. A considerable amount of research has been conducted on redmouth disease, given its serious implications for rainbow trout farming. The disease does not infect humans.|$|E

40|$|This report compares {{evaluation}} {{frameworks for}} selecting landholder proposals to improve water quality. A water quality tender {{performed in the}} Burdekin region in Northern Australia in 2007 / 2008 {{was used as a}} case study. Tender bids can be assessed using an inputs-based <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> scorecard or an outputs-based auction metric. Where landholder proposals are rated by inputs-based criteria, the scorecard approach, and other variants of multi-criteria analysis are commonly applied. Output-based approaches are typically applied in water quality and conservation tenders. This approach uses an environmental benefits index to summarise the cost-effectiveness of each proposal. The case study evaluation reported in this paper shows how multi-criteria analysis-type assessments are flawed. It demonstrates how public funding efficiency can be more than doubled by using auction metrics to assess landholder water quality improvement proposals. water quality tender, auction metric, <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practice,</b> input-based, output-based, Great Barrier Reef., Environmental Economics and Policy, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|R
40|$|Vegetative filter strips (VFSs) are a <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> (BMP) {{consisting}} of planted areas that remove pollutants from surface water runoff. These systems are traditionally implemented along {{streams and rivers}} (referred to as riparian zones), but a joint study conducted by Washington State University and the University of Florida explored {{the possibility of using}} VFSs as an option to mitigate the flow of pollutants from rill (furrow) irrigated fields to irrigation canals. A 10 -foot wide VFS was found to remove over 98 % of the sediment and soluble nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) when operated and maintained correctly (Bodah et al, 2012). An additional aim {{of the study was to}} examine the potential for harvesting the biomass for use as animal feed.

40|$|The {{management}} of nonpoint source water pollution presents an immense challenge to economists {{and policy makers}} alike. A complex array of physical, economic, political and institutional barriers lie between theoretically appealing textbook prescriptions and their transition into successful real-world solutions. Underlying beliefs about property rights, interest group politics and the transaction costs associated with designing and implementing successful measures have all played a particularly critical role. Building on the theoretical literature and the lessons provided by the practical use of economic instruments for nonpoint source water pollution management around the world, this paper considers these issues {{in the context of}} the Swan-Canning river system in Perth. Four innovative economic instruments for the {{management of}} nonpoint source nutrient pollution in that system are discussed: auctioned <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> payments; <b>best</b> <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> incentive charges; an urban nonpoint source emissions offset bank; and a catchment based licensing/trading program.
