The Norwegian crashed the brush, sent the avalanches roaring, and eventually reached us, all dirty, ragged, bloody, with fire in his eye. He had come all the way from the rim in short order. What a performance that must have been! He said he thought he might be needed. R.C. guided by Edd's yells, came cracking the brush down to us. Pale he was and wet with sweat, and there were black <b>brush</b> <b>marks</b> across his face. His eyes were keen and sharp. He had started down for the same reason as Nielsen's. But he had to descend a slope so steep that he had to hold on to keep from sliding down. And he had jumped a big bear out of a bed of leaves. The bed was still warm. R.C. said he had smelled bear, and that his toboggan slide down that slope, with bears all around for all he knew, had started the cold sweat on him.|$|E

This project derives from an interest in exploring the concept of timelessness. Jean Baptiste Simeon Chardin's Little Girl with Shuttlecock, 1737, gave me the idea to convey timelessness figuratively. The project has employed some of the strategies established by both Chardin and Johannes Vermeer's single figure paintings in relation to composition and design, colour and tone, the <b>brush</b> <b>mark</b> and the narrative. Nevertheless, the expression of stillness is vital in conveying a sense of timelessness...|$|R

Following the loss of the effective benzimidazole fungicides, benomyl and carbendazim, {{there is a need to}} identify alternatives for the protection of pruning wounds against infection by ascospores of Eutypa lata. In this study, 24 fungicide and natural treatments were evaluated in the laboratory and field. Tebuconazole and carbendazim were the most effective fungicides for reducing colonization of pruning wounds inoculated with E. lata. Pyrimethanil and fluazinam also provided some control but were less effective than tebuconazole at the rates tested. Other treatments, such as cyprodinil + fludioxionil, pyraclostrobin, a garlic extract, and lactoferrin, reduced colonization of wounds by E. lata but require further evaluation at higher concentrations. Carbendazim applied to pruning wounds using tractor-driven sprayers reduced the incidence of pruning wound infection by E. lata to levels similar to that achieved by application with a paint <b>brush.</b> <b>Mark</b> R.

Alternatively, a natural bristle which is more porous works best for powder foundations such as mineral makeup.

40|$|Supported by a {{residency}} at the South London Gallery (SLG), {{the research}} project questions how {{the focus on}} the mechanical quality and materiality of procedure of the indexical mark sits in relation to the domestic space of the SLG’s new extension. Previous research questioned how the use of a semi-automatic process – contingent mark-making {{through the use of a}} hand crafted squeegee – could set up a distance between artist and outcome. This process explored repetition and difference which – when ordered by the grid – set up relation and dialogue between abstract painting, pattern and decoration, disseminated through exhibitions at Laure Genillard, London, One in the Other, London, De Mach and Solbiati, Milan (1999 - 2004). The results from the enquiry of Nothing is Forever employed an iterative process derived from using the more ephemeral mark offered by the fluidity of watercolour and the parameters of a printed <b>brush</b> <b>mark.</b> With reference to mathematical structures of nature, the work explores how the fluid and ephemeral nature of a printed watercolour mark interprets and challenges the rigidity of geometry and its heroicised narrative in abstract painting’s recent history. The work presents a series of interventions that continue to resist making a representation of something in the world, so that the matter and nature of production is a mode of address and site of critical thinking...|$|R

50|$|Older {{automatic}} washes - {{a majority}} of which were built prior to 1980 - used to use brushes with soft nylon bristles, which tended to leave a nylon deposit {{in the shape of}} a bristle, called <b>brush</b> <b>marks,</b> on the vehicle's paint. Many newer washes use either cloth (which is not harmful to a car's finish, as long as it is flushed with plenty of water to remove the grit from previous washes) or a closed cell foam brush, which does not hold dirt or water, thus is far less likely to harm any painted finish. Closed cell foam brushes can, in fact, provide a gentle polishing effect that will shine the vehicle's surface during a wash.|$|E

5000|$|Paints in tubes {{could be}} easily loaded up and carried out into the real world, to {{directly}} observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment. Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments - chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of [...] "impressionists" [...] - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible <b>brush</b> <b>marks</b> at all, seamless under layers of varnish.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are fewer}} sculptures than {{paintings}} in Brown‘s oeuvre, but they nevertheless form a central {{point of his}} practice. Brown‘s sculptures stand {{in stark contrast to}} his flat paintings as they bare all the technical features that the paintings deny. The sculptures are created by accumulating thick layers of oil paint on acrylic and wire, stainless steel or fibreglass structures with large brushstrokes. In contrast to the flat surfaces of his paintings, the sculptures deliberately emphasize the three-dimensional quality of oil brushstrokes. They are piled up to amorphous heaps of paint with sharp-cutting edges. Brown comments on his three-dimensional use of brushstrokes as follows: [...] "I see the sculptural <b>brush</b> <b>marks</b> as challenging the logic of paint in that they appear to defy gravity by actually staying upright. For me, they exist within a surreal world that is based on getting paint to do something it shouldn‘t do, and to sit in a three-dimensional world that it shouldn‘t be in.". Furthermore, Brown modulates the sculptures by suggestively painting 'shadows' on them. His sculpture [...] "Three Wise Virgins" [...] has additional attributes attached to it, such as red clown noses thus ironically rendering them somewhat ridiculous.|$|E
5000|$|This oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} is 32 x 23 1/2 inches (81.3 x 59.7 cm). The painting shows a woman sitting on a large red chair in the balconies of the Paris Opéra House. The figure is seated {{in front of a}} massive mirror that is reflecting the theater scene that the woman is experiencing; it is also giving us the view point that the woman is having. As with Degas, Cassatt paid close attention to the [...] "effects of artificial lighting on flesh tones". The woman is sitting enjoying the sights, the city nightlife that most Impressionists were fascinated with, as she people watches. She is dressed up, as with what was expected of going to a theater, with a peach colored dress, makeup, pearls, gloves and hair pinned back. She is holding a fan and a flower is attached to the bodice of the dress. She looks bemused with what she is seeing. The quick painterly style of Impressionist paintings can be seen here as Cassatt was heavily inspired by it. The background is very gestural and loose as people are carved out in simple <b>brush</b> <b>marks</b> of color. An elaborate chandelier is also shown in the reflection of the mirror. The rich colors of the painting draw the viewer in, deep shadows create contrast against the brightness of the light source. The brush strokes within the dress itself give a texture to it and a liveliness to the piece. The view in which the viewer is given brings an intimacy to the painting, making as though the viewer is there with the woman as she enjoys her evening.|$|E

The task of crushing two or three passengers together, in order to reach over them and stick a ticket into the chinks of a silk skull cap is embarrassing for a conductor of refined feelings.

In the hands of a man of taste, much might be effected by a little grouping of painted passengers and the leisure time of the conductor agreeably occupied.|$|R
