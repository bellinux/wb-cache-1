5|$|On April 15, 1967, King {{participated in}} and spoke at an anti-war march from New York's Central Park to the United Nations {{organized}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spring</b> Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam and initiated by its chairman, James Bevel. At the U.N. King also brought up issues {{of civil rights}} and the draft.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1851, {{women in}} several states were wearing the dress in public. In March, Amelia Bloomer, editor of the temperance {{newspaper}} The Lily, announced that she was wearing it and printed a description of her dress along with {{instructions on how to}} make it. Soon, newspapers had dubbed it the “Bloomer dress”, and the name stuck.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1917, the War was {{dragging}} on towards its fourth year, and Zita's brother Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, a serving {{officer in the}} Belgian Army, was a main mover behind a plan for Austria-Hungary to make a separate peace with France. Charles initiated contact with Sixtus through contacts in neutral Switzerland, and Zita wrote a letter inviting him to Vienna. Zita's mother Maria Antonia delivered the letter in person.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>springs</b> {{were used}} for {{thousands}} of years by nomadic Native Americans. The Chemehuevi, Desert Cahuilla and Yuma bands frequented <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> and carved elaborate petroglyphs in the nearby rocks. Some of the oldest rock art is over 10,000 years old. At times, there was enough surface water for gardening <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> <b>The</b> Indians also utilized the fruit of the palms.|$|R
25|$|The {{flag of the}} Azad Hind Fauj and the Indian Legion both carried <b>the</b> <b>Springing</b> Tiger on <b>the</b> Indian Tricolour. The Azad Hind Fauj also {{released}} {{postage stamps}} where the Tricolour's charkha was replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Springing</b> Tiger.|$|R
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1917, the {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare campaign—which Germany {{had launched}} {{at the beginning}} of February—had so succeeded that the entire Allied war effort was endangered. Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once. In response to a request from the Royal Navy for the service of American antisubmarine warfare ships in European waters, the United States Navy began sending destroyers eastward across the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|During a {{televised}} address on 20 April, Nixon announced {{the withdrawal of}} 150,000 U.S. troops from South Vietnam during the year. This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, {{most of whom were}} concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions. Many of them, however, were preparing to leave the country or expected to leave in the near future and would not be available for immediate combat operations.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} four years, Lassie {{received}} very decent ratings. However, {{at the end}} of the 1958–1959 season, the ratings had fallen out of the top 30 due to the constant turnover in the cast. Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, Lassies ratings greatly improved and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.|$|E
50|$|If not tapped, and {{hydrostatic}} pressure is sufficient, <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> emerge from low mounds deposited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> They were a favorite resort of American Indians who valued {{the hot water}} and mud for the healing of wounds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flag of the}} Azad Hind Fauj and the Indian Legion both carried <b>the</b> <b>Springing</b> Tiger on <b>the</b> Indian Tricolour. The Azad Hind Fauj also {{released}} {{postage stamps}} where the Tricolour's charkha was replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Springing</b> Tiger.|$|R
50|$|The lake in MacArthur Park is fed {{by natural}} springs (although an {{artificial}} bottom {{to the lake}} was laid during {{the construction of the}} Metro Red Line, opened in 1993). In the past, a fountain with a reflecting pool on the northern end was also fed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> <b>The</b> Westlake/MacArthur Park Red Line station sits across the street.|$|R
5|$|Five {{of these}} had been {{completed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1956 and were undergoing preflight tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped. A week later, the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter-Bomber branch and {{the doctrine of the}} VVS was drastically modified. No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but rather it would use tactical nuclear weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1992, Armenian forces {{captured}} the mountain stronghold of Shusha but {{remained on the}} defensive until the next year. Fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued {{in other parts of}} the enclave, including Lachin, Khojavend, and Aghdara. However, nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or could not hold on to captured territory. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1993 the Azerbaijani military, which had the upper hand in the initial stages of the war, had been largely reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups. By March 1993 the fighting had shifted to west and south of Karabakh.|$|E
5|$|Once a {{candidate}} {{was selected as}} an officer, promotion could be rapid. A. S. Smeltzer was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in 1915, after serving in the Regular Army for 15 years. He rose in rank, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spring</b> of 1917 had been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was commanding officer of the 6th Battalion, The Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment).|$|E
50|$|In {{more recent}} times {{the site has}} been used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> local {{population}} for recreational purposes, the commemoration of festivals, and for interaction with nature. As well <b>the</b> pools created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> are used for bathing.|$|R
6000|$|I forgot how I {{had been}} sweltering about, and said: [...] "Yes; it is a Saratoga day. It's {{supposed}} that the sparkle {{of the air}} comes from the healthful gases thrown off <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> Some people say <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> are doctored; that's what makes their gases so healthful." ...|$|R
50|$|The main {{element of}} the weapon is the frame to which a revolver-style {{magazine}} is attached. While shooting the drum is rotated 60 degrees <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> wounded back up when loading the cartridges into weapon.|$|R
5|$|Pit is {{restored}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spring,</b> while {{the loss of}} Pandora's powers leaves Dark Pit unable to fly on his own. Now restored, Pit attempts to destroy Hades with the Three Sacred Treasures, but Hades easily destroys them and attempts to eat Pit. After escaping from Hades' insides with assistance from Dark Pit, Pit is guided by Palutena {{to the home of}} the God of the Forge Dyntos, who crafts the Great Sacred Treasure after Pit proves himself in multiple trials.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in Europe was shaky {{during this time}} and Sweden was going through financial problems. Charles XI's guardians decided to negotiate an alliance with France in 1671. This would ensure that Sweden would not be isolated {{if there was a}} war, and that the national finances would improve thanks to French subsidies. France directed its aggression against the Dutch in 1672, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1674, Sweden was forced to take part by directing forces towards Brandenburg, under the lead of Karl Gustav Wrangel.|$|E
5|$|While it {{achieved}} {{successes and}} proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division {{earned a reputation}} for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> and summer of 1944.|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "Held In His Love" [...] <b>by</b> <b>The</b> <b>Springs</b> (band) {{was written}} by Stewart Halcomb, a student inside Enterprise High School (Alabama) on March 1, 2007 and {{dedicated}} to the 8 friends he lost that day.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fabric that}} users bounce on (commonly {{known as the}} [...] "bounce mat" [...] or [...] "trampoline bed") is not elastic itself; the {{elasticity}} is provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> that connect it to the frame, which store potential energy.|$|R
5000|$|Owlpen (pronounced locally [...] "Ole-pen") derives its name, it is thought, {{from the}} Saxon thegn, Olla, who first {{set up his}} pen, or enclosure, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> that rise under the {{foundations}} of the manor, about the 9th century.|$|R
5|$|Aircraft {{suitability}} {{once again}} {{came in for}} discussion during the war. Ansons and Boulton Paul Defiants were not suitable for ASR operations. The Vickers Warwick was earmarked for the main ASR aircraft. Four 20-aircraft squadrons with specialised ASR conversion were to be made available <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring,</b> 1943. While development was slow. Nevertheless, the effort paid off. In May 1943, 156 men of Bomber Command were rescued from the sea by No. 279 Squadron alone. By the end of 1943 Coastal Command had rescued 1,684 aircrew out of 5,466 presumed to have ditched in the sea. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, 163 aircrew and 60 other personnel were rescued. During the month, June 1944, 355 were saved by ASR units of Coastal Command. In all, 10,663 persons were rescued by Coastal Command in ASR operations. Of this total, 5,721 were Allied aircrew, 277 enemy aircrew, and 4,665 non-aircrew.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{told the}} men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British {{companies}} guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton {{and a handful of}} Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson, then Capt. Davis, on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> floodwaters of the Concord River.|$|E
5|$|By February 1943, Himmler's {{ideals of}} Waffen-SS racial purity had been {{significantly}} diluted. The first division {{to be raised}} by Berger's recruiters that was clearly outside the Waffen-SS racial and ethnic strictures used manpower from the Muslim community of Bosnia. The 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) first went into action in February 1944, and was of limited value, especially outside of its area of operations in eastern Bosnia. While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> and summer of 1944.|$|E
50|$|Intending to {{sacrifice}} the cow to Athena, Cadmus sent {{some of his}} companions to <b>the</b> nearby Ismenian <b>spring</b> for water. They were slain <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring's</b> guardian water-dragon (compare the Lernaean Hydra), which was in turn destroyed <b>by</b> Cadmus, <b>the</b> duty of a culture hero of the new order.|$|R
25|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>Springs</b> of 2010, Sherdils {{increased}} from 4-ship to 7-ship and perform at closing ceremony of Exercise High-Mark 2010 {{under the leadership}} of Wing Commander Syed Ali Zaidi. Soon it transformed into 9-ship team and performed at Graduation ceremony in May, 2010.|$|R
60|$|Their {{conversation}} {{was at that}} time, however, cut short <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springing</b> up of a breeze, which rendered it necessary that the closest attention should {{be paid to the}} management of the vessel among the numerous shoals which rendered the navigation there somewhat difficult.|$|R
5|$|By late 1830, and {{certainly}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew {{between the different}} political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, {{one of the largest}} industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively lost any control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1794, France was {{in turmoil}} {{following}} {{the failure of}} the harvest, which threatened the country with starvation. In order to secure food supplies, France turned to its American colonies and the United States, which assembled a large grain convoy in Hampton Roads. To ensure the security of this convoy, the French Navy dispatched most of its Atlantic Fleet to sea during May 1794, operating in a series of large squadrons, independent cruisers and one major fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse. On 5 May, two French ships operating independently, the 36-gun frigate Atalante under Captain Charles Linois and the corvette Levrette, spied a British convoy sailing south-west, three days out from Cork, and closed to investigate.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> of 1936, the {{management}} of the New York Philharmonic was confronted with a problem. Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the Nazi government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame {{the management}} of the orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.|$|E
50|$|The Springsabouts Walking Tours, {{a tour of}} nine of <b>the</b> Manitou Mineral <b>Springs</b> sites offered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mineral <b>Springs</b> Foundation. People {{can also}} take their own tour of <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> <b>by</b> visiting <b>The</b> Manitou <b>Springs</b> Chamber of Commerce & Visitors Bureau {{to pick up a}} free mineral springs brochure, content chart and a {{sampling}} cup.|$|R
50|$|The Tropical (Sudanese) Microclimate <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> of <b>the</b> Judean Desert. Refers {{mostly to}} Ein Gedi spring and Arugot creek. Due {{to the high}} aquifer in the region, and the steady, hot climate of the Judean desert, a {{tropical}} savanna-related flora (not rainforest, as many think) of East-African origin has established {{in the area of}} <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> <b>The</b> fauna is that of the Desert zone.|$|R
5000|$|... with around 110 steel <b>springs</b> (<b>the</b> {{actual number}} may vary <b>by</b> manufacturer). <b>The</b> bed {{is made of}} a strong fabric, {{although}} this is not itself elastic; the elasticity is provided only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> <b>The</b> fabric can be woven from webbing, {{which is the most}} commonly used material. However, in the 2007 World Championships held in Quebec City, a Ross bed (or two-string bed), woven from individual thin strings, was used. This type of bed gives a little extra height to the rebound.|$|R
