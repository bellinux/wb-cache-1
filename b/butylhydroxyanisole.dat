40|$|Thermogravimetry (TG) and {{differential}} scanning calorimetry (DSC) {{are used}} in pharmaceutical studies for drugs characterization, purity, formulations compatibility, polymorphism identification, stability evaluation, and thermal decomposition of drugs and pharmaceutical formulations. Simvastatin showed fusion at 138. 5 ºC and thermal stability up to 248 ºC. Simvastatin was incompatible with preservative excipient <b>butylhydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) performing a process of crystal amorphization. The drug showed morphological polymorphism, where {{it has the same}} unit cell but with different crystal habits according to the recrystallization solvent...|$|E
40|$|Antioxidants are an {{important}} group of food additives that {{have the ability to}} protect against detrimental change of oxidizable nutrients and consequently they extend shelf-life of foods. The present paper is an updated review on the analysis of ten antioxidants (both synthetic and natural). Three types of gallates, propyl (PG), octyl (OG) and dodecyl (DG), tert-Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT), tert- <b>Butylhydroxyanisole</b> (BHA), a-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid and sodium D-isoascorbate were the antioxidants selected. The physico-chemical properties, sample preparation procedures and analytical methods for their determination are compared and discussed...|$|E
30|$|The metal (Fe 2 +) {{chelating}} and DPPH radical-scavenging {{activities of}} essential oils were measured as previously described (Dinis et al. [1994]; Kirby and Schmidt [1997]). Metal (Fe 2 +) chelating activity was presented by IC 50 values, {{defined as the}} concentration of the extract needed to chelate 50 % of Fe 2 + present in the test solution. Therefore, IC 50 values were calculated from the graph of chelating percentages against extract concentration. Lower IC 50 values reflected better chelating activity. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and <b>butylhydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) were used as positive controls for metal (Fe 2 +) chelating and DPPH radical-scavenging activities, respectively.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{antioxidants}} {{either to}} prevent or retard food's lipids oxidation was approved after inquires that verified their security within a daily intake limit. In this study, the methodology was developed and validated {{for the analysis of}} synthetic antioxidants: propylgallate (PG), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), <b>butylhydroxyanisole</b> (BHA), octylgallate (OG) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) in vegetables oils, margarine and hydrogenated fats by high performance liquid chromatographic. The methodology revealed itself efficient, with recovery rates above 90 % for all antioxidant substances, besides good linearity in concentration range of 40 - 240 mg kg- 1 (r = 0, 999), repeatability with CV < 3, 7 % and limit of quantification 16. 55, 10. 32, 1. 40, 3. 76 and 9. 30 mg/kg for BHT, BHA, PG, OG and TBHQ, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{free radical}} {{scavenging}} activity (FRS) using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), the reducer {{power and the}} total phenolic concentration of extracts and compounds isolated from leaves, branches and roots of Maytenus imbricata Mart. (Celastraceae) were evaluated. Some extracts, a mixture of phenolic compounds (MPC) and epicatechin showed higher RP and FRS (DPPH) activities {{in comparison with the}} standard <b>butylhydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) and galic acid (GA) used in assays. The ethyl acetate extract from leaves showed higher total phenolic content and also higher RP and FRS (DPPH) than the other extracts. These facts indicate that there are some relations between phenolic concentration in the extract and the antioxidant activity and the reducer power. The solvent used in the extraction process influences the chemical composition of the extracts and consequently its antioxidant and reducer power activities...|$|E
30|$|Among {{the three}} {{antioxidants}} investigated in this study, Pyrogallol {{was the most}} effective in improving the oxidation stability of the biodiesel and blends since it resulted in the highest increase in oxidation stability followed by Propyl gallate and <b>Butylhydroxyanisole</b> respectively. However, the oxidation stability of the biodiesel and blends with Pyrogallol depreciated slightly much faster than those with Propyl gallate during the 8 -week storage period, suggesting that Propyl gallate provided the best storage stability {{as shown by the}} lowest percentage decrease in induction periods during the 8 -week storage period. The B 10 blend could however, be effectively protected by either 100  ppm PYG or PRG since the Rancimat IPs of the blend with either antioxidant {{at the end of the}} 8 -week storage period were both higher than that of the petro-diesel used for blending.|$|E
40|$|VALIDATION OF METHODOLOGY FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS DETERMINATION OF SYNTHETIC ANTIOXIDANTS IN VEGETABLES OILS, MARGARINE AND VEGETABLES HYDROGENATED FATS BY HPLC/UV. The use of {{antioxidants}} {{either to}} prevent or retard food's lipids oxidation was approved after inquires that verified their security within a daily intake limit. In this study, the methodology was developed and validated {{for the analysis of}} synthetic antioxidants: propylgallate (PG), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), <b>butylhydroxyanisole</b> (BHA), octylgallate (OG) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) in vegetables oils, margarine and hydrogenated fats by high performance liquid chromatographic.

40|$|Improvement of the {{nutritional}} {{quality of the}} lipid fraction of dry-fermented sausages was achieved by a substitution of {{one quarter of the}} amount of pork backfat present in traditional formulations by an emulsion in which linseed oil was included. This improvement was particularly noticeable when 100 mg/kg of butylhydroxytoluene and 100 mg/kg of <b>butylhydroxyanisole</b> were added. P/S ratio increased from 0. 4 in the control sausages to 0. 6 in the batch with 3. 3 % linseed oil and to 0. 7 in the batch with linseed (3. 3 %) and antioxidants. The n− 6 /n− 3 ratio decreased from 14. 1 in control products to 1. 7 – 2. 1 in modified products {{as a consequence of the}} α-linolenic acid increment. No oxidation problems were detected during the ripening process, with TBA values always lower than 0. 23 ppm. Hexanal and nonanal showed the highest values in linseed oil-containing products. Addition of antioxidants avoided the formation of decadienals and other aldehydes from lipid oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Using {{chloramphenicol}} acetyltransferase assays {{we showed}} that epidermal growth factor (EGF), {{transforming growth factor alpha}} (TGF alpha), and 3, 3 ', 4, 4 ', 5 -pentachlorobiphenyl (PenCB) induce class Pi glutathione S-transferase (GSTP 1) in primary cultured rat liver parenchymal cells. GSTP 1 enhancer I (GPEI), which is required for the stimulation of GSTP 1 expression by PenCB, also mediates EGF and TGF alpha stimulation of GSTP 1 gene expression. However, hepatocyte growth factor and insulin did not stimulate GPEI-mediated gene expression. On the other hand, the antioxidant reagents <b>butylhydroxyanisole</b> and t-butylhydroquinone, stimulated GPEI-mediated gene expression, but the level of GSTP 1 mRNA was not elevated. Our observations suggest that EGF and TGF alpha induce GSTP 1 by the same signal transduction pathway as PenCB. Since the sequence of GPEI {{is similar to that of}} the antioxidant responsive element (ARE), some factors which bind to ARE might play a role in GPEI-mediated gene expression...|$|E
