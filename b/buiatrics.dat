40|$|Abstract The {{decline in}} dairy herd {{fertility}} internationally has highlighted the limited impact of traditional veterinary approaches to bovine fertility management. Three questionnaire surveys were conducted at <b>buiatrics</b> conferences attended by veterinary practitioners on veterinary dairy herd fertility services (HFS) {{in countries with}} a seasonal (Ireland, 47 respondents) and non-seasonal breeding model (The Netherlands, 44 respondents and Portugal, 31 respondents). Of the 122 respondents, 73 (60 %) provided a HFS and 49 (40 %) did not. The majority (76 %) of all practitioners who responded stated that bovine fertility had declined in their practice clients' herds with inadequate cow management, inadequate nutrition and increased milk yield {{as the most important}} putative causes. The type of clients who adopted a herd fertility service were deemed more educated than average (70 % of respondents), and/or had fertility problems (58 %) and/or large herds (53 %). The main components of this service were routine postpartum examinations (95 % of respondents), fertility records analysis (75 %) and ultrasound pregnancy examinations (69 %). The number of planned visits per annum varied between an average of four in Ireland, where breeding is seasonal, and 23 in Portugal, where breeding is year-round. The benefits to both the practitioner and their clients from running a HFS were cited as better fertility, financial rewards and job satisfaction. For practitioners who did not run a HFS the main reasons given were no client demand (55 %) and lack of fertility records (33 %). Better economic evidence to convince clients of the cost-benefit of such a service was seen as a major constraint to adoption of this service by 67 % of practitioners. </p...|$|E
