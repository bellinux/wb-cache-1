40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{current study was}} to {{estimate}} variance components, especially dominance genetic variation, for overall leg action, length of productive life, and sow stayability until third and fifth parity. This project evaluated the data from Finnish litter recording scheme. The variance components were estimated in two purebred (Landrace, n= 23, 602 and Large White, n= 22, 984) and crossbred (Landrace x Large White, n= 17, 440) datasets. The fixed effect of herd-year, and random effects of additive sire, parental dominance, and litter {{were included in the}} statistical model of all the traits. Moreover, the fixed effect of <b>breeding</b> <b>consultant,</b> and linear regression of test weight were also included in the statistical model for overall leg action. The estimated heritabilities of these traits ranged between 0. 04 and 0. 06, and were very similar between the different breeds. Similarly, the estimates for ratio of dominance variance to phenotypic variance (d 2) varied between 0. 01 and 0. 17, the highest from the crossbred dataset. Moreover, all the d 2 estimates in crossbred population were higher than the corresponding heritability estimates. However, in purebred populations, d 2 estimates were generally lower than the corresponding h 2 estimates. All the genetic correlations between same traits from purebred and crossbred were high. This indicates that the genetic gain in purebred populations will be passed on to the commercial crossbred sows. Based on current results, we suggest considering accounting for the effect of dominance in the breeding value estimation of sow longevity, especially when data from crossbred animals are included. Moreover, because dominance genetic variation for sow longevity exists, {{it should be possible to}} use that variation by planning the mating pairs to produce sows for commercial production...|$|E

50|$|The breed {{originated}} in Norrbotten, Sweden and Lappland/Kainuuland, Finland, {{and have been}} documented {{as early as the}} 17th century. Sweden and Finland argue about the true home of the Norrbottenspets, but clearly the dog has spent much time in both countries. The dogs were mainly used as hunting companions. By the end of World War I, the Norbottenspets came close to extinction. Due to the very small number of norrbottens, Sweden closed its studbook in 1948. Although some dogs were preserved, they were in a non-Swedish speaking area and in the far north as a farm dog and companion. Enthusiasts sought out the few remaining dogs and started a successful breeding program between the 1950s and early 1960s. FCI confirmed a new breed standard in 1966 and the official name was confirmed as Norrbottenspets. In 1967 the Swedish Kennel Club accepted the breed for registration and a new standard was written. Finland accepted the standard and began registering dogs in 1973. In Finland these dogs are called Pohjanpystykorva. Immigrant farmers have given the dog an even longer name, Norbottens-skollandehund. There is a great effort in Finland to ensure the health of these fox-like hunting dogs and breeding is highly controlled. Healthy animals, that are only distantly related, are being bred with careful consideration of <b>breeding</b> <b>consultants</b> to create a strong background. Sweden has also had a dramatic impact on the preservation of this breed through strict breeding practices.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{widespread}} use of individual sires for artificial insemination promotes the propagation of recessive conditions. Inadvertent matings between unnoticed carriers of deleterious alleles may result in the manifestation of fatal phenotypes in their progeny. <b>Breeding</b> <b>consultants</b> and farmers reported on Vorderwald calves with a congenital skin disease. The clinical findings in affected calves were compatible with epidermolysis bullosa. RESULTS: Pedigree analysis indicated autosomal recessive inheritance of epidermolysis bullosa in Vorderwald cattle. We genotyped two diseased and 41 healthy animals at 41, 436 single nucleotide polymorphisms and performed whole-genome haplotype-based association testing, which allowed us to map the locus responsible for the skin disease to the distal end of bovine chromosome 22 (P[*]=[*] 8. 0 [*]×[*] 10 - 14). The analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data of one diseased calf, three obligate mutation carriers and 1682 healthy animals from various bovine breeds revealed a nonsense mutation (rs 876174537, p. Arg 1588 X) in the COL 7 A 1 gene that segregates with the disease. The same mutation was previously detected in three calves with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa from the Rotes Höhenvieh cattle breed. We show that diseased animals from Vorderwald and Rotes Höhenvieh cattle are identical by descent for an 8. 72 Mb haplotype encompassing rs 876174537 indicating they inherited the deleterious allele from a recent common ancestor. CONCLUSIONS: Autosomal recessive epidermolysis bullosa in Vorderwald and Rotes Höhenvieh cattle {{is caused by a}} nonsense mutation in the COL 7 A 1 gene. Our findings demonstrate that deleterious alleles may segregate across cattle populations without apparent admixture. The identification of the causal mutation now enables the reliable detection of carrier animals. Genome-based mating strategies can avoid inadvertent matings of carrier animals thereby preventing the birth of homozygous calves that suffer from a painful skin disease...|$|R
