30|$|Aluminium <b>baking</b> <b>trays,</b> like {{aluminium}} {{cans and}} trays, also {{belong to the}} class of materials referred to as articles intended to {{come into contact with}} foodstuffs. According to section 31 of the German Food and Feedstuffs Law (2005) it is prohibited to use such objects as intended to come into contact with foodstuffs that do not meet the requirements of Regulation (EC) No. 1935 / 2004. The use of aluminium <b>baking</b> <b>trays</b> would therefore be inadmissible if aluminium can migrate to brined dough and/or salted pretzels and similar savoury biscuits.|$|R

50|$|A sheet pan, <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> or {{baking sheet}} is a flat, {{rectangular}} metal pan {{used in an}} oven. It is often used for baking bread rolls, pastries and flat products such as cookies, sheet cakes, swiss rolls and pizzas.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> {{is used to}} cook {{a variety}} of foods in an oven, {{including}} vegetables and meats such as whole chickens. It allows food to be very exposed to the hot air inside the oven whilst preventing any fats of liquids from falling onto the oven floor.|$|E
3000|$|The {{aluminium}} {{contents of}} [...] "pastries in aluminium trays" [...] and [...] "salted pretzels and similar savoury biscuits" [...] are described under [...] "Articles intended {{to come into}} contact with foodstuffs" [...] subsection due to a possible migration of aluminium from the <b>trays</b> or the <b>baking</b> <b>trays</b> into these foods.|$|R

50|$|The {{mixture is}} now put into an {{automatic}} patty making machine, or press. The press then punches out the patties into a circular shape onto {{a conveyor belt}} underneath. A constant spray of water {{is also used to}} prevent any of the mixture from sticking to machinery parts. Once on the conveyor tray, the patties move along to be put onto <b>baking</b> <b>trays.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... : {{cooked with}} plain flour (particularly wholemeal flour) - {{rather than the}} {{standard}} self-raising flour, and baking powder, resulting in a much flatter and crisper cake. Typically, this variant is made as a slab on a bakestone, or nowadays on a <b>baking</b> <b>tray,</b> hence the name [...] (literally, [...] "Welsh slab").|$|E
5000|$|Wajik is {{made with}} steamed glutinous (sticky) rice and further cooked in palm sugar, coconut milk, and pandan leaves. The cooked rice is then spread and flatted in a <b>baking</b> <b>tray.</b> Once it cools to room temperature, the sticky rice cake is {{cut into small pieces}} {{in the shape of a}} diamond or rhombus.|$|E
50|$|German Streuselkuchen {{is usually}} a flat cake made on a <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> and cut into oblong pieces. It should be very flat - about one inch - so crumbs make about 50% of its height. Yeast dough is the original; a short crust is possible, too, and a puff pastry at the bottom turns it into a Prasselkuchen.|$|E
50|$|The second room houses genuine {{traditional}} womens costumes of {{the late}} 19th century (everyday wear and bridal outfits), woven textiles, embroidery, a number of objects for everyday domestic use (cauldrons, <b>baking</b> <b>trays,</b> cooking-pots, and plates), agricultural implements (most notably a hand plough), millstones, a wooden barrel for collecting grain at the mill, and jars for the pickles and cereals that were stored in the cellars in winter.|$|R
50|$|The Wagner Manufacturing Company was a family-owned {{manufacturer}} {{of cast iron}} and aluminum products based in Sidney, Ohio, US. It made products for domestic use such as frying pans, casseroles, kettles and <b>baking</b> <b>trays,</b> and also made metal products other than cookware. Wagner was active between 1891 and 1952, and at one time dominated the cookware market, selling in Europe and the US. The purchasers of the company in 1952 continued the brand, and Wagner products are still manufactured today. The original items are prized by collectors.|$|R
50|$|The {{generic term}} sledding refers to {{traveling}} down a snowy hill using a sled {{such as a}} flexible flyer with wooden slats and metal runners.It is usually done during the winter when there is snow. Flat plastic or aluminum discs and improvised sleds (carrier bags, <b>baking</b> <b>trays,</b> cafeteria trays, sheets of cardboard, etc.) may also be used. The activity {{has been known to}} exist as a fringe recreational activity far into the distant murky past in toboggan-type sleds which seasonally supplant the ubiquitous cart.|$|R
50|$|For baked štrukli, {{the pieces}} are then placed into a <b>baking</b> <b>tray,</b> generously covered in clotted cream, and baked for roughly 45 minutes, until {{slightly}} brown on top. For cooked štrukli, {{the pieces are}} placed into a pot of boiling water. Onion and parsley are fried separately until slightly brown, and then added into the pot. The štrukli is then cooked for roughly 20 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|A macaroon ( [...] ) {{is a type}} {{of small}} {{circular}} cake, typically made from ground almonds (the original main ingredient), coconut, and/or other nuts or even potato, with sugar, egg white, and sometimes flavorings (e.g. honey, vanilla, spices), food coloring, glace cherries, jam and/or a chocolate coating. Some recipes call for sweetened condensed milk. Macaroons are often baked on edible rice paper placed on a <b>baking</b> <b>tray.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{layer is}} rolled {{out from the}} pastry with {{thickness}} of not less than 2 mm, put into <b>baking</b> <b>tray,</b> oiled and lavishly filled with stuffing. This process is continued, until 9-10 layers are made. The last layer is greased with yolk, mixed up with saffron. Then pakhlava is cut into two rhombs, then either hazelnut or half of the kernel of Circassian walnut is placed on each piece. Then it is baked with 180°-200°C temperature pending 30-40 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{exhibits}} {{have all}} been donated by residents and citizens of Polygyros. Those {{on the first floor}} are so arranged as to recreate the interior of an urban house of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, with reception rooms (a salon with sofas and a low round table, a dining room, {{and the rest of the}} furniture that an urban house in Macedonia was expected to have), bedrooms (with metal bedsteads, wardrobes, and bedding), the everyday sitting-room, the kitchen (complete with cooking utensils, cauldrons, <b>baking</b> <b>trays,</b> a fireplace), and another room containing the traditional loom. Authentic costumes from the wider area of Poliyiros are displayed in various corners of the house.|$|R
5000|$|Wanting {{to deliver}} a unique {{customer}} experience, Earle designed his stores with a classic bakery motif. The interior decor at Johnny Cupcakes boutiques features antique refrigerators, baking racks, a 1930s dough mixer, (Boston location) a cast-iron wood-burning oven from the 1890s, (also at the Boston location) and even hidden vanilla-scented air fresheners; items are usually displayed on <b>baking</b> <b>trays</b> and inside glass pastry cases. [...] The stores' prominent baking theme often confuses unfamiliar patrons who walk in thinking that they sell baked goods, not clothing. [...] Earle says this tends to disappoint and even anger some passersby, though the shops do give out free cupcakes with purchases on occasion.|$|R
50|$|The pottery {{consisted}} {{of hundreds of}} ceramic pieces including cups, kitchenware, and urns. Over 500 clay vases were uncovered, dating around the Early Helladic period. There were a variety of sauceboats, in multiple shapes and sizes. The bowls and sauce boats of the Early Helladic period were the commonest types found in southern and central Greece. After further inspection of the sauceboats, {{it is suggested that}} these types resemble those from Askitario in Attica, also comparable to ones in Lerna and from the Cyclades. This evidence shows that the shipwreck may lie on the maritime trade route from South Euboea to the Saronic and Argolid gulfs. There were many amphoras found, as well as basins, wide-mouthed jars, braziers, <b>baking</b> <b>trays,</b> askoi, pithoi, and common household utensils.|$|R
5000|$|In Los Angeles {{the danger}} dog {{is known as}} the bacon-wrapped hot dog. Vendors can be found cooking them on a {{stainless}} steel <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> over Sterno heat sources outside of bars, concerts, sporting events, and other late night establishments. The bacon-wrapped usually consists of a bacon-wrapped hot dog, grilled onions and bell peppers, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and grilled jalapeño peppers. [...] After a public campaign in 2010, the L.A. City Council proclaimed the bacon-wrapped to be the official hot dog of Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|Green {{coffee beans}} can be roasted in a {{convection}} oven {{provided that the}} beans are spread out in only one layer on a perforated <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> with raised sides. Because they are not stirred, the beans at {{the perimeter of the}} tray get dark first. The oven area should be well ventilated because a lot of smoke will be generated. This method produces coffee beans with a variety of roast levels as {{it is almost impossible to}} achieve a consistent roast, however, some people like the resultant melange roast.|$|E
50|$|A {{convection}} oven allows {{a reduction in}} cooking temperature compared to a conventional oven. This comparison will vary, depending on factors including, for example, how much food is being cooked at once or if airflow is being restricted by using an oversized <b>baking</b> <b>tray.</b> This difference in cooking temperature is offset as the circulating air transfers heat more quickly than still air of the same temperature; in order to transfer {{the same amount of}} heat in the same time, then, one must lower the temperature to reduce the rate of heat transfer in order to compensate.|$|E
5000|$|Larks' Tongues in Aspic showed several {{significant}} changes in King Crimson's sound. Having previously relied on saxophone and flute as significant melodic and textural instruments, the band had replaced them with a single violin. Muir's percussion rig featured exotic, eccentric instrumentation including chimes, bells, thumb piano/mbiras, a musical saw, shakers, rattles, found objects (such as sheet metal, toys and <b>baking</b> <b>trays),</b> plus miscellaneous drums and chains. The Mellotron (a staple part of King Crimson's instrumentation since their debut album) was retained for this new phase and was played either by Fripp or Cross, both of whom also played electric piano. The band's multi-instrumentalism initially extended to Wetton and Muir playing (respectively) violin and trombone on occasion at early gigs, but this was quickly dropped (Wetton and Cross did, however, contribute additional piano and flute respectively to the LTiA album sessions). The album opens with a long experimental instrumental piece titled [...] "Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One". After {{that there are three}} vocal pieces, [...] "Book of Saturday", [...] "Exiles" [...] and [...] "Easy Money", with lyrics written by Richard Palmer-James. These are followed by two more instrumentals, [...] "The Talking Drum" [...] and [...] "Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two". The instrumental pieces on this album have strong jazz fusion and European free-improvisation influences, and portions also have an almost heavy metal feel.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of wrestlers {{in the main}} event came to the ring with some form weapons, including the last-minute replacement for Shawn Michaels: Savio Vega. Although Austin began the match with a Lou Thesz press on Billy Gunn, soon everybody was in the ring attacking each other with <b>baking</b> <b>trays</b> and trash can lids. Austin soon set to work on Triple H, strangling him with a broomhandle by the announce table while Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie took it in turns to avenge themselves on Road Dogg, and then helping Owen Hart powerslam Gunn through a table and locking him with a sharpshooter. Helmsley began to brawl with Hart, the two exchanging weapon shots and ending up {{on the side of}} the ring. Soon after, Road Dogg powerbombed Charlie through two chairs, the shock of which helped the referee shape the match into a traditional tag match, in place of the bedlam style that it had previously been, although the D-Generation X contingent frequently flouted the rules with the referee distracted to isolate Charlie who took lots of shots to the head. Cactus Jack managed to break the hold on Charlie, taking the attack to the other team with a series of double-arm DDT, smashing Billy Gunn through a table and delivering a double Mandible Claw to both Outlaws. A Cactus clothesline, however, allowed his adversaries to take the advantage, smashing him with steel steps, with Vega wrapping Jack's hands and then face in barbed wire, before taking chair shots from every team member until he ducked, leading Gunn to strike Road Dogg. This allowed Cactus to slowly crawl over and tag in the as yet untagged Austin who came into the ring clotheslining every enemy, knocking the heads of the Outlaws together and delivering a stunner to Road Dogg, allowing him to claim a pin count and win the match, stunning Billy Gunn immediately afterwards. After Stone Cold celebrated, Chyna confronted him and prevented Austin from leaving the ring, after giving him the finger Austin gave her the stunner.|$|R
50|$|Mix {{water and}} sugar {{and let them}} boil while mixing continuously. Next, add saffron and stop heating the syrup. Mix the syrup {{in a way that}} it loses the glass-like appearance. Add almond powder little by little to the syrup while mixing it. Stop adding the powder once the mixture forms a paste similar to a viscous pulp that doesn't stick. Unfold waxed paper into <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> and evenly pour the pulp, then {{sprinkle}} nuts on the surface of the Lovz and push them down. Refrigerate for about three to four hours. Then, cut the Lovz cookies in diamond shapes.|$|E
50|$|A typical modern {{recipe for}} 12 cakes {{requires}} about 200 g of flour, 100 g of butter or margarine, 50 g of sugar, 1 beaten egg, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, 2 tablespoons of milk, 150 g of dried fruit such as currants, raisins, candied orange peel, etc., and {{a pinch of}} nutmeg and mixed spices. Usually, flour and butter are first mixed until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs; then the other ingredients are added to create a stiff dough, which is dropped from a spoon to a <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> or roughly formed with two forks. The cakes (optionally sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon) are baked for about 15 minutes at 200 °C, retaining an uneven form and contour.|$|E
50|$|Per Thomas Keller's recipe, a pipérade {{is made of}} peeled, finely chopped, {{and reduced}} peppers, yellow onions, tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. The piperade is spread thinly in a <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> or {{casserole}} dish, then layered on top with evenly sized, thinly sliced rounds of zucchini, yellow squash, Japanese eggplant, and roma tomatoes, covered in parchment paper, then baked slowly for several hours to steam the vegetables. The parchment is removed so that the vegetables may then roast, acquiring additional flavor through caramelization. To serve, the piperade is formed into a small mound, and the rounds arranged in a fanned-out pattern to cover the piperade base. A balsamic vinaigrette is drizzled on the plate, which may be garnished.|$|E
50|$|Combi steamers {{typically}} contain food racks with dimensions {{corresponding to}} Gastronorm specifications (GN racks); these racks may vary in width, {{so they are}} only suitable for certain sizes of containers (GN1/1 or GN2/3). Different models can hold different numbers of racks; typical sizes include 6, 10, 20, 24, and 40 racks. Units with six or ten racks are usually tabletop devices, while those with 20, 24 and 40 are free-standing. The number of racks may also vary from unit to unit, as they are typically removable and can also be replaced with racks corresponding to gastronorm (GR) roasting pan or <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> dimensions. These racks provide space for additional roasts or baking trays, since these methods do not require deep containers.|$|E
5000|$|Morels can be {{preserved}} in several ways: They can be 'flash frozen' by simply running {{under cold water}} or putting them in a bucket to soak for a few minutes, then spread on a <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> and placed into a freezer. After freezing, they keep very well with the frozen glaze {{for a long time}} in airtight plastic containers. However, when thawed they can sometimes turn slightly mushy, so they are best frozen after steaming or frying. Due to their natural porosity, morels may contain trace amounts of soil which cannot be easily washed out. Any visible soil should be removed with a brush, after cutting the body in half lengthwise, if needed. Mushroom hunters sometimes recommend soaking morels in a bowl of salt water briefly prior to cooking, although many chefs would disagree.|$|E
5000|$|Kang and Kodos star in {{a fictional}} sitcom, {{entitled}} Keepin' it Kodos. In it, Kodos is preparing their boss' visit by cooking dinner: Homer on a <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> (continually eating himself), Bart on a skillet, Marge and Maggie in pies and Lisa in a soup. The boss gives the meal a delicious rating, but his stomach bursts ends up liberating Bart. Kang and Kodos are given a hyper-galactic promotion, much to the aliens' delight. Bart is sad {{about the loss of}} his parents, but Kang and Kodos decide to adopt him, which comforts Bart. The theme song from Perfect Strangers plays as the Treehouse of Horror logo appears on the screen; an alien tentacle stamps the [...] "XV" [...] underneath which makes it say, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XV" [...] in the fashion of the Mark VII Productions company logo.|$|E
50|$|The {{next chapter}} of the medical book urges Jerry to apply chills to Tom's high fever. Soon Tom is in the freezer, teeth chattering. Jerry unloads a spoonful of ice cubes onto Tom's body and puts a spoonful of ice cubes into his mouth, and then closes the freezer door for a few seconds. As he opens the door, a frozen-solid Tom slides out of the freezer. Jerry panics {{and looks at the}} {{following}} book's advice on extreme chills, then shoves Tom into the oven, turning it onto a low temperature. Opening the oven door, Tom is now conscious, but still very cold, and baking in his own juices and grease. Jerry pours some juice and grease over Tom and then closes the door, adjusting the oven's temperature. When he opens the door again, Tom is bright red and burning. Jerry quickly touches the hot cat and burns himself. Thinking quickly, he places Tom onto a <b>baking</b> <b>tray</b> and heads for the bathroom, giving him a cold shower.|$|E
