5|$|A lull ensued, {{during which}} November talks {{sponsored}} by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions.

France reacted to this <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new troops into Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the 16th parallel.|$|E

5|$|Chad {{participated in}} 12 Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott {{was because of the}} inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior.

5|$|During 10–11 June 1916, the {{division}} was relieved by the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division {{and moved into}} reserve. It then moved south and joined XVII Corps of the Third Army to train for the Battle of the Somme. New trenches were dug and {{the division}} made practice attacks on them using novel tactics: attacking in waves in conjunction with artillery and machine gun fire. Towards {{the end of the}} month, the division moved further south to the Somme valley. They then joined II Corps and were placed in reserve. The role of the division was as a second wave to exploit the expected success. After the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German lines, the Reserve Army cavalry divisions would capture Bapaume. The 38th (Welsh) Division would then move forward to relieve the cavalry and secure the town, to allow the cavalry to advance north towards Arras.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{little was}} agreed upon and the {{agreement}} was later interpreted differently by its signatories, the Brioni Agreement established the EC's interest {{in the region and}} the first EC Ministerial Conference on Yugoslavia was held in The Hague on 10 July. The ECMM helped calm several standoffs around military barracks in Slovenia and facilitated negotiations between Slovene authorities and the JNA regarding the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia. In Croatia, armed combat continued and the JNA shelled the city of Osijek the same evening {{the agreement was}} signed. The federal presidency ordered the complete withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia on 18 July in response to Slovene actions in <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brioni Agreement. The ECMM's scope of work was expanded to include Croatia on 1 September.

40|$|ObjectiveTo analyze {{outcomes}} after <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> mild (1 mm and < 5 mm) <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{frontal sinus}} {{with a goal}} of maintaining or restoring <b>the</b> functional status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sinus. MethodsA retrospective analysis of prospectively accrued data was performed on patients with mild and moderately severe <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior wall <b>of</b> their frontal sinus who were managed {{with the intent to}} preserve the frontal sinus. Data on presenting features, pathology, details on <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior wall, management, outcome, and complications were collected from medical records and neuroimages. ResultsForty-two cases met inclusion criteria. Diagnostic categories included trauma in 34 cases, infection in 3, and other categories in another 5 cases. Five presented with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, and 26 had radiographic evidence of obstruction of a nasofrontal duct at time of presentation. Fifteen patients were managed without surgical intervention, and 27 underwent surgery. No complications occurred in the patients managed without surgery and 4 postoperative cerebrospinal leaks that were managed successfully with a period of drainage occurred in the surgical group. No patient developed meningitis or mucocele. ConclusionsMany patients with mild to moderately severe <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frontal sinus can be managed safely and effectively by techniques that preserve the anatomy and function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frontal sinus...|$|R
