40|$|Anatomical {{science has}} used <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{executed}} for dissection over many centuries. As anatomy has {{developed into a}} vehicle of not only scientific but also moral and ethical education, {{it is important to}} consider <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> human <b>bodies</b> for dissection and <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> their acquisition. From the thirteenth to the early seventeenth century, <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed were the only legal source <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> for dissection. Starting in the late seventeenth century, <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> unclaimed persons were also made legally available. With the developing movement to abolish the death penalty in many countries around the world and with <b>the</b> renunciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed by the British legal system in the nineteenth century, two different practices have developed in that there are Anatomy Departments who use <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed for dissection or research and those who do not. <b>The</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed in German Anatomy Departments during the National Socialist regime is an example for the insidious slide from an ethical use <b>of</b> human <b>bodies</b> in dissection to an unethical one. There are cases of contemporary use of unclaimed or donated <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed, but they are rarely well documented. <b>The</b> intention <b>of</b> this review is to initiate an ethical discourse about <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executed in contemporary anatomy.

5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E

5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace {{and the ability to}} deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed as close to the bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E
