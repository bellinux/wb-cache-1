5|$|As the {{simulation}} begins to weaken under the Saints' influence, Zinyak floods virtual Steelport with copies of gang members the Boss has faced in the past. Kinzie determines that the copies {{are being made}} from someone's memory, leading the <b>Boss</b> <b>to</b> conclude Johnny Gat, who was seemingly killed during the events of Saints Row: The Third, is still alive and trapped within {{the simulation}}. Despite protests from Kinzie and Matt that rescuing Johnny will reveal their location to Zinyak, the Boss rescues Johnny from his nightmare of Aisha's death and gets {{him back to the}} ship. Johnny explains that during the fight in which he was presumed killed, he was actually abducted by Zinyak years in advance of their invasion, as Zinyak had concluded that Johnny could have single-handedly stopped him if left on Earth.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, players are given an introductory level and <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> overcome. Afterward, they are given access to eight different stages, each representing one of the above-mentioned Robot Masters. At the end of each stage, players must battle a Robot Master. When a Robot Master is destroyed, it will give Mega Man its respective weapon, which can be used against other Robot Masters or enemies but has limited ammunition. If Mega Man defeats the Robot Master using his primary weapon, the Robot Master will be captured and reprogrammed. This allows players to play through stages as one of the Robot Masters.|$|E
5|$|Completing stages {{allow the}} player to {{progress}} through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> defeat; the first seven worlds feature an airship controlled {{by one of the}} Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world. Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths, and mini-games and bonus screens that provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a reserve until activated by the player from the map screen.|$|E

They give Bart the choice of two prizes: $10,000 in cash or a full-grown African elephant. Bart chooses the elephant. This surprises Bill and Marty, who believed that nobody would ever choose an elephant, and thus have no elephant to give away. They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, prompting their <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> give them a choice: either arrange for delivery of the elephant, or lose their jobs. They decide on the former option.|$|E

5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball {{uses the}} basic {{mechanics}} of pinball, complete {{with an assortment}} of typical pinball items including flippers, spinners, bumpers, and ramps. In addition, new mechanics are introduced, such as enemies that wander around the table, wall jumping, and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used to nudge the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired by a different area of Metroid Prime. Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two tables are initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> complete it.|$|E

Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for the ability to be turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E
5|$|Using {{his various}} natural {{abilities}} and occasionally items or power-ups, Kirby must overcome obstacles while heading towards a goal door {{at end of}} the level, where he must fight a <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> obtain one of the Sparkling Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up the projectiles they create and spitting them back at the boss, however, the boss of the third level briefly turns the game into a Shoot 'em up. The last level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where the player must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on the boss's home level.|$|E

It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms.

5|$|Pei {{finally saw}} his {{architecture}} {{come to life}} in 1949, when he designed a two-story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained {{as part of an}} apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior curtain wall brought praise from the journal Architectural Forum. Pei's designs echoed the work of Mies van der Rohe in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including Henry N. Cobb and Ulrich Franzen. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 VFL season {{went ahead}} despite {{the loss of}} many players to {{military}} service. Miller alternated between playing in the backline and in attack depending on match conditions. When St Kilda were kicking downwind, Miller would play in attack, and when they kicked against the wind, {{he would return to}} a defensive position. In the forward line, he alternated with Sam Loxton, a future Invincibles teammate. He booted 28 goals in 16 games, including eight in one match against North Melbourne. Miller also gained a reputation among opponents for kicking them in the ankles. He again showed his disrespect for authority and reputation. In one match against Melbourne, for whom his boss and state cricket teammate Percy Beames played, Miller charged towards Beames with a raised elbow {{at the start of the}} match, forcing his <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> be taken from the field. Miller came second in St Kilda's best and fairest for 1941 as his team again came second to last.|$|E

He was {{speaking on the}} phone with a friend and told her he was driving a vehicle for his <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> exchange for another. He has been missing ever since. Tobares had moved from Argentina to Mexico in 2009 to pursue a career as a chef specialized in Mexican cuisine. He worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki, a hotel and restaurant in Jalisco. According to investigators, these two businesses were owned by Gerardo González Valencia, a suspected drug lord of Los Cuinis, a branch of the Jalisco-based criminal group Jalisco New Generation Cartel.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in the trial was the testimony of Tommaso Buscetta, the first ever Sicilian Mafiosi <b>boss</b> <b>to</b> become an informant (pentito). His assertion that the Mafia was not a collection of separate gangs but a single organisation led some magistrates and detectives to question his credibility. After an interview, Falcone became convinced that Buscetta was genuine and treated him with respect. Buscetta's key revelation was that a governing council, known as the Commission or Cupula headed a collective structure, thereby establishing that the top tier of Mafia members were complicit in all the organisation's crimes. This premise became known as the Buscetta theorem.|$|E
