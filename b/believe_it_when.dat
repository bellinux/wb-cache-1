500|$|The {{culmination}} of the plot saw Lydia lure Zoe to a church and stab her at Sarah's grave. The stabbing storyline {{was described as a}} [...] "brutal attack" [...] and at the time producers refused to reveal if Zoe would die. Describing the terror Lydia causes a spokesperson for the serial stated: [...] "Zoe can’t <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> Lydia admits the parachute was meant for her. As soon as she realises Lydia wanted her dead she tries to run. That’s when Lydia pulls out a knife and stabs her." [...] This led to a fight between Lydia and Charlotte who arrives with Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge). They both fight to grab the knife while an unconscious Zoe bleeds, ultimately leading to the arrest of Lydia when the police arrive. She is later charged with the murder of Sarah and the attempted murder of Zoe.|$|E

500|$|On 31 December 1985, de Freitas went to New Orleans {{with the}} road crew on a drug binge and there {{announced}} his resignation from the band. Hence, the band faced 1986 with a commitment to record an album, but without their drummer—a musician who was considered fundamental to the band's creative success. They hired former Haircut One Hundred drummer Blair Cunningham for the spring 1986 tour of the United States; however, he didn't fit in, and after the tour left to join The Pretenders. The band then hired former ABC drummer David Palmer, and recorded a few sessions with producer Gil Norton for the new album. However, Palmer decided by July 1986 {{that he did not}} want to remain with the band. As he left the band, de Freitas returned to the United Kingdom and expressed a wish to rejoin. Uncertain of de Freitas's commitment to the band, and his fragile mental state, they took him back as a hired hand rather than a full member. Now with the line-up that would record Echo & the Bunnymen, the band gave a live television appearance for the BBC in September 1986 when they played two new songs, [...] "The Game" [...] and [...] "Lips Like Sugar". According to Will Sergeant, the band were under pressure from Warner Music chairman Rob Dickins to produce an album that would replicate the success of Peter Gabriel's recent number one album So: [...] "I couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> Rob Dickins brought us into his office and played us Peter Gabriel's album: 'I want you to sound like this!'

When Puyi was 13, he met his parents and siblings, all of whom had to kowtow before him as he sat upon the Dragon Throne. By this time, Puyi had forgotten what his mother looked like. Such was the awe that the Emperor was held that his younger brothr Pujie never heard his parents refer Puyi as [...] "your elder brother", who was always just the Emperor. Pujie told Behr his image of Puyi prior to meeting him was that of [...] "...a venerable old man with a beard.

2500|$|While he {{may have}} been the de jure leader of Afghanistan, Soviet {{advisers}} still did the majority of work when Najibullah took power. As Gorbachev remarked [...] "We're still doing everything ourselves [...] That's all our people know how to do. They've tied Najibullah hand and foot." [...] Fikryat Tabeev, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, was accused of acting like a governor general by Gorbachev. Tabeev was recalled from Afghanistan in July 1986, but while Gorbachev called for the end of Soviet management of Afghanistan, he could not help but to do some managing himself. At a Soviet Politburo meeting, Gorbachev said [...] "It's difficult to build a new building out of old material [...] I hope to God that we haven't made a mistake with Najibullah." [...] As time would prove, the problem was that Najibullah's aim were the opposite of the Soviet Union's; Najibullah was opposed to a Soviet withdrawal, the Soviet Union wanted a Soviet withdrawal. This was logical, considering the fact that the Afghan military was on the brink of dissolution. The only means of survival seemed to Najibullah was to retain the Soviet presence. In July 1986 six regiments, which consisted up to 15,000 troops, were withdrawn from Afghanistan. The aim of this early withdrawal was, according to Gorbachev, to show the world that the Soviet leadership was serious about leaving Afghanistan. The Soviets told the United States Government that they were planning to withdraw, but the United States Government didn't <b>believe</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> Gorbachev met with Ronald Reagan during his visit the United States, Reagan called, bizarrely, for the dissolution of the Afghan army.|$|E
2500|$|At 10:25am, Bravo Company de-bussed as the Iraqis were {{swarming}} {{around them}} and the ringleaders in the crowd were encouraging the locals to attack Bravo Company. As they de-bussed to throw back the crowd, the rear vehicle noticed that the Iraqi Militia contingent were {{no longer in the}} convoy. Such was the intensity of the rock throwing and the sheer numbers of locals in the crowd, Bravo took the decision to fire rubber bullets at the ringleaders. Whilst the soldiers were well aware that using rubber bullets could either calm or inflame a situation, they felt that they had no choice given the intensity of the crowd, who were being told via the loudspeakers on the minarets that the British were here to [...] "rape the women [...] attack them!" [...] One of the ringleaders was identified, and a Corporal using the baton gun fired and felled the ringleader from [...] away. After two more baton rounds were fired, the crowd surged forward and the Non-commissioned officer (NCO) of Bravo Company (Sgt Gordon Robertson) fired warning shots into the air from his rifle and other troops followed suit. At this the crowd moved back and allowed them space to move, but it was later realized that the local Iraqis had gone to get their weapons. In their minds, the British had fired first, so {{it was a matter of}} pride that they returned fire. At 10:30am, Iraqi gunmen would return fire and Bravo would defend themselves with the result of the first Iraqi's dying. One witness in the crowd claimed that children were throwing stones at the Paratroopers and when one of the paratroopers went into a firing position, a local man called Tassir thought a child would be shot, so he levelled his weapon at the paratroopers. The British troops fired on him first as they thought he was going to shoot, and after that, the crowd became completely hostile. At this point, the RMPs were only [...] away from the Paratroopers. Ahmed Younis, a member of the crowd on the morning, said The market was very crowded. I threw myself on the ground and shouted to everyone to run away or get down. The shooting lasted about five minutes but there were bullets going everywhere. They were firing on automatic. I couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> they started shooting. Sheikh Shejar said [...] The Iraqi side fired first. Later they went to the police station and attacked there. The mob wanted to shelter at the police station and use it as a base to attack the British.|$|E
