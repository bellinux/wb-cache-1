40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{study the effects of}} blade {{thickness}} on the performances of an axial-flow fan. Two fans that differ only in the thickness of their blades were studied. The first fan was designed {{to be part of the}} cooling system of an automotive vehicle power unit and has very thin <b>blades.</b> The second <b>fan</b> has much thicker blades compatible with the rotomoulding conception process. The global performances of the fans were measured in a test bench designed according to the ISO- 5801 standard. The curve of aerodynamics characteristics (pressure head versus ow-rate) is slightly steeper for the <b>fan</b> with thick <b>blades,</b> and the nominal point is shifted towards lower flow-rates. The efficiency of the thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan</b> is lower than the efficiency of the <b>fan</b> with thin <b>blades</b> but remains high on a wider flow-rate range. The mean velocity field downstream of the rotors are very similar at nominal points with less centrifugation for the thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan.</b> The thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan</b> moreover maintains an axial exit-flow on a wider range of flow-rates. The main dierences concern local properties of the flow: Phase-averaged velocities and wall pressure fluctuations strongly differ at the nominal flow-rates. The total level of fluctuations is lower for the thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan</b> that for the thin <b>blades</b> <b>fan</b> and the spectral decomposition of the wall fluctuations and velocity signals reveal more harmonics for the thick <b>blades</b> <b>fan,</b> with less correlation between the different signals. For this kind of turbomachinery, the use of thick blades could lead to a good compromise between aerodynamic and acoustic performances, on a wider operating range...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{no visible}} moving blades in this fan. The blade is hidden inside the {{pedestal}} of the fan. In 2009 James Dyson first introduces a new {{innovation in the}} bladeless fan by adding air-multiplier technology. This Dyson air-multiplier fan generates airflow up to 55mph. [...] The fan contains a brushless electric motor and this motor rotates nine asymmetrical aligned blades that attach with a rotor. Usually, the upper frame of this fan is ring shaped. The frame is not flat; rather it is manufactured such that the edge can create a curve of a 16-degree angle slope.The air flows through the channel in the pedestal of the fan when the motor is turned on. After that, the air flows through the hollow tube. Then the air is shot out through 16-mm slits. This air flows smoothly, rather than turbulently as with a <b>blade</b> <b>fan.</b> The curvature of the inner wall of the fan creates an area of negative pressure - like an airplane wing - to draw more air into the flow, hence [...] "multiplying" [...] it. This property of the air is called inducement. Further, the air surrounding {{the edges of the}} fan also begins to flow with the direction of the breeze, or is [...] "entrained" [...] to it. Dyson claims that the air-multiplier technology increases the output of the air flowing through the tube by at least 15 times compared to the airflow put out by a traditional bladed fan.|$|E

The wake width of grooved <b>blade</b> <b>fan</b> became narrower than that of the ordinary <b>blade</b> <b>fan.</b> Therefore, the grooved <b>blade</b> <b>fan</b> was superior in noise characteristics to the ordinary <b>blade</b> <b>fan.</b> Using the method of predicting width of wake and the formulae to estimate the turbulent noise level which we proposed in this paper, the sound pressure level can be predicted with the accuracy of about Â± 3 dB within these experiments...|$|E

40|$|As part of {{a program}} to {{evaluate}} an inlet suppressor design method based on mode cutoff ratio, three single degree of freedom liners with different open area ratio face sheets were designed for a single spinning mode. This mode was generated by placing 41 rods {{in front of the}} 28 <b>blade</b> <b>fan</b> of a JT 15 D turbofan engine. At the liner design this near cutoff mode has a theoretical maximum attenuation of nearly 200 dB per L/D. The data show even higher attenuations at the design condition than predicted by the theory for dissipation of a single mode within the liner. This additional attenuation is large for high open area ratios and should be accounted for in the theory. The data shows the additional attenuation to be inversely proportional to acoustic resistance. It was thought that the additional attenuation could be caused by reflection and modal scattering at the hard to soft wall interface. A reflection model was developed, and then modified to fit the data. This model was checked against independent (multiple pure tone) data with good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{analysis}} {{is the main}} conditions monitoring techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis. This technique has its unique advantages and disadvantages associated with the monitoring and fault diagnosis of machinery. When this technique is conducted independently, {{only a portion of}} machine faults are typically diagnosed. However, practical experience has shown that this technique in a machine condition monitoring program provides useful reliable information, bringing significant cost benefits to industry. The objective of this research is to investigate the correlation between vibration analysis and fault diagnosis. This was achieved by vibration analysis and investigating different operating conditions of an experimental electromotor. The electromotor was initially run under normal operating conditions as a comparative test. A series of tests were then conducted corresponding to different operating condition. Our varieties were speed of electromotor at three levels, respectively 500, 1000 and 1500 rpm. We did three faults in our electromotor; there were misalignment, looseness and bad bearing. We coupled our electromotor to the variable <b>blade</b> <b>fan</b> and applied several load on that by changing the number of blade of fan. We have chosen 2, 6 and 10 blades fan to apply three different loads on our electromotor. Vibration data was regularly collected. Numerical data produced by vibration analysis were compared with vibration spectra in normal condition of healthy machine, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the vibration condition monitoring technique. The results from this paper have given more understanding on the dependent roles of vibration analysis in predicting and diagnosing machine faults...|$|E

Following the model scale tests, a 118 in. diameter demonstrator was tested at the NASA Ames 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel. The 18 <b>blade</b> <b>fan</b> was driven by the low compressor shaft of a PW 2037 core through a reduction gear system fabricated by Fiat with approximately 1 : 3. 7 reduction ratio. ne variable pitch fan was hydraulically actuated with settings for take-off, cruise, feather, and reverse thrust.

The demonstrator was provided with 45 vanes located 2. 6 fan chords downstream of the rotor, and 10 case struts approximately 1 fan chord downstream of the vanes.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Aerodynamic shape {{optimization}} involves {{designing the}} most efficient shapes of bodies that move through fluids. An optimization algorithm perturbs {{the shape of an}} airfoil until it finds the shape which best exhibits a given design objective. For an inverse design technique, this objective is a prescribed aerodynamic distribution, usually the surface pressure distribution. Liebeck pressure distributions [1], for example, have been demonstrated to generate airfoils with high lift to drag ratios. When designing fans, consideration must be given not only to the shape of the <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> but also to the distance separating the <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b> This spacing is defined by the pitch/chord ratio t/l, where the pitch, t, is the distance between <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> and the chord, l, is the length of each <b>fan</b> <b>blade.</b> In this work, an inverse algorithm is developed, then used to design <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> shapes and to find the optimal blade spacing. <F 14. 3...|$|R
