5|$|In 1859, Greeley {{traveled}} {{across the}} continent to see the West for himself, {{to write about it}} for the Tribune, and to publicize the need for a transcontinental railroad. He also planned to give speeches to promote the Republican Party. He went to Chicago, then to Lawrence in Kansas Territory, and was unimpressed by the local people. Greeley took one of the first stagecoaches to Denver, seeing the town then in course of formation as a mining camp of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Sending dispatches back to be published in the Tribune, Greeley took the Overland Trail, reaching Salt Lake City, where he conducted a two-hour interview with the Mormon leader, Brigham Young, the first newspaper interview Young had given. Greeley encountered Native Americans, and was sympathetic, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> of his time, deemed Indian culture inferior. In California, he explored widely and gave many addresses.|$|E
5|$|Waptia fieldensis is {{the only}} species {{accepted}} under the genus Waptia. It is classified under the family Waptiidae (established by Walcott in 1912), the order Waptiida (established by Leif Størmer in 1944), and (tentatively) the clade Crustaceomorpha. Early restorations of Waptia fieldensis by Charles R. Knight in 1940 erroneously depicted it as a primitive shrimp, but modern paleontologists now consider it among the Burgess Shale arthropods that are of unknown and uncertain taxonomic placement. Some authors have suggested {{that it may be}} allied to crustaceans, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> Cambrian crustaceomorphs, the mouthparts were not preserved, making it impossible to reliably classify them within the crustacean crown group. Others propose that it may be only distantly related to crustaceans, being at least a member of a stem group of crustaceans, or even of all arthropods. Despite being one of the first species recovered and being the third most abundant fossils of the Burgess Shale, there is still no in-depth work on the morphology of Waptia fieldensis.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 he and O.G.S. Crawford {{resigned}} as Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries in protest at {{the election of}} James Mann to the Presidency following the retirement of Cyril Fox. They believed that Mann, Keeper of the Tower's Armouries at the Tower of London, was a poor choice and that Wheeler, an actual prehistorian, should have won the election. In 1952 a group of British Marxist historians began publishing the periodical Past & Present, with Childe joining the editorial board. He also became a board member for The Modern Quarterly (later The Marxist Quarterly) during the early 1950s, working alongside old friend, the Communist leader, Rajani Palme Dutt, chairman of the board. He authored occasional articles for Palme Dutt's socialist journal, the Labour Monthly, but disagreed with him over the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; Palme Dutt defended the Soviet Union's decision to quash the revolution using military force, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> western socialists, Childe strongly disagreed. The event made Childe abandon faith in the Soviet leadership, but not in socialism and Marxism. Childe retained a love of the Soviet Union, having visiting on multiple occasions and having been involved with CPBG satellite body the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR, and serving as President of their National History and Archaeology Section from the early 1950s until his death.|$|E

25|$|Tlaxcala, {{the major}} {{ally of the}} Spanish against the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan, also became {{something}} of a backwater, but like Puebla it did not come {{under the control of}} Spanish encomenderos.

Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented Richard Perry-produced album Stoney End in 1971.

25|$|At {{the time}} of its building, the design of Basildon was already old-fashioned. From 1750s onwards large houses were being built without a rustic, and having the {{principal}} floor on the ground was becoming commonplace. Basildon, with its piano nobile, large portico denoting status, and main facade falsely elongated by fenestrated walls, was never innovative architecture, <b>but,</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> other houses, was built to bolster the status of its owner, the newly rich Sir Francis Sykes, keen for a political career.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} other U.S. {{states and the federal}} {{government}}, Mississippi's government is based on the separation of legislative, executive and judicial power. Executive authority in the state rests with the Governor, currently Phil Bryant (R). The Lieutenant Governor, currently Tate Reeves (R), is elected on a separate ballot. Both the governor and lieutenant governor are elected to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> other U.S. States, most of the heads of major executive departments are elected by the citizens of Mississippi rather than appointed by the governor.|$|E

25|$|The AM {{operated}} profitably in {{the early}} 1870s <b>but</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> railroads encountered financial problems during the Panic of 1873. A fourth road of the AM family was planned to extend west through the Cumberland Gap to Kentucky, but was never built. Mahone retained control of AM for several more years before his relationship with English and Scottish bondholders deteriorated in 1876 and receivers were appointed to oversee his work. After several years of operating under receiverships, Mahone's role as a railroad builder ended in 1881 when northern financial interests took control.|$|E
25|$|Idaho {{is among}} the few states in the nation without a major freeway linking its two largest {{metropolitan}} areas, Boise {{in the south and}} Coeur d'Alene in the north.

In 2007, the Idaho Transportation Department stated the state's highway infrastructure faces a $200million per year shortfall in maintenance and upgrades. I-84 is the main highway linking the southeast and southwest portions of the state, along with I-86 and I-15.|$|E
