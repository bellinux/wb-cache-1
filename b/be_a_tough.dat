She met Nadia Hokmi in a rematch of their contest six months earlier. The French boxer again proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> opponent and the fight developed very similarly to their first encounter. Once more, Kentikian had the better start, but Hokmi scored {{during the second half of}} the fight, again making it a close bout. This time however, Kentikian was ahead on all three of the judges' scorecards, winning by unanimous decision.|$|E

25|$|The {{visit from}} league leaders Arsenal {{was likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> game, but Boro were awarded a penalty after four minutes (the first penalty in a Middlesbrough game this season), which Downing {{converted}} for his fourth goal of the season. Tuncay scored his second in two games to increase the lead, before Tomáš Rosický scored {{in the final seconds}} of the game. The 2–1 win subjected Arsenal to their first defeat of the season, while Middlesbrough ended their run of eleven games without a win.|$|E
25|$|Downey Jr. was on {{probation}} {{during the winter}} of 1999 when Hanson considered him for a role in Wonder Boys. Hanson was cautious because of the actor's drug history and concerned because it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> film shot in sequence in Pittsburgh in the winter. Downey flew to Pittsburgh and had a long dinner conversation with Hanson where they addressed his problems. The actor demonstrated a commitment to the project and Hanson hired him. Reportedly, Downey acted in a professional manner for the entire four-and-a-half month shoot but after it ended, he returned to Los Angeles and violated his parole.|$|E
25|$|The 2009–10 would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> {{season on}} Demitra, as he missed {{most of the}} regular season with the {{shoulder}} injury that occurred in the 2009 playoffs. In 28 games, Demitra had three goals and 16 points, his lowest totals since 1996–97. In the playoffs, Demitra had a three-point game against the Los Angeles Kings on 23 April 2010, helping Vancouver to a 7–2 win. Overall, Demitra appeared in 11 playoff games, scoring two goals and six points. After the season, he became an unrestricted free agent. This would mark the end of Demitra's NHL career. He'd played in 847 career games, and scored 304 goals with 464 assists for 768 points.|$|E

He has a soft side, is rarely angry, and while acknowledging the life under Number One as unfair, he is happy with what he gets.

25|$|The 2016-17 Colts roster {{would look}} much {{different}} from the one the previous year. One hundred point scorers Kevin Labanc and Andrew Magiapane had moved on to their respective AHL and NHL clubs. Mackenzie Blackwood would not return in goal. Also not returning was defensemen Michael Webster, Rasmus Andersson and Greg DiTomasso, and forwards Justin Scott, Keigan Goetz, Dylan Sadoway, and Julius Nattinen. The youth movement was on, as signaled by the blockbuster trade made preseason where the Colts sent a package including 10 draft picks to the Mississauga Steelheads in exchange for 16-year old Russian Kirill Niznikov. The Colts season would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> one, having them spend the majority {{of the year in the}} basement of the league. Come trade deadline the Colts were active, trading captain Cordell James to the Owen Sound Attack, Cameron Lizotte to the Erie Otters, and Barrie native Matt Brassard to the Oshawa Generals while acquiring Robert Proner and Jason Smith from the Saginaw Spirit and Mississauga Steelheads. The Colts would finish off the year with the youngest roster in the OHL and finishing last place overall in the league. A number one overall draft pick was in their future.|$|E
25|$|September: Aldershot {{continued}} their early unbeaten {{run with a}} third consecutive 1–1 draw at home to Northampton, though the Shots needed a Ben Harding volley in the 5th minute of injury time to salvage a point. The next game - away to promotion-chasing Port Vale - promised to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> test, and this was proved right as the club suffered its first loss of the season, Gary Roberts scoring the only goal of the game. On 16 September the management brought in winger Marlon Jackson on loan from Bristol City, a player who assistant manager Gary Owers believed would help the team in the attacking third. Wycombe were the next visitors to the Recreation Ground, which meant a return for former Shots' boss Gary Waddock, who led the club to the Football Conference championship in the 2007–08 season. The match {{failed to live up}} to expectations, ending in a dull goalless draw. This fifth low-scoring draw of the season encouraged fears that the side were not good enough up front, and were not converting the few chances being presented to them. The squad responded by taking a 2–0 lead away to Stockport in their next game, only to throw it away in the final minutes to draw yet again. A win did come before the end of the month, however, Morgan again netting in the final ten minutes to snatch all three points away to Torquay.|$|E

25|$|United {{made their}} {{debut in the}} 2015 U.S. Open Cup three nights after the loss in Orlando, with the team's first ever trip to the Steel City to face the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. Pittsburgh proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> opponent, taking their MLS {{opposition}} into extra time, but D.C. United prevailed with two goals in the overtime period, to win 3–1, on goals by Coria, Opare and Deleon. United returned to RFK four nights later, where they rediscovered their home field winning ways, with yet another striking comeback, to defeat the New England Revolution, by a now very familiar 2–1 score. United fell behind in the first half, when one-time D.C. United striker, Charlie Davies put the visitors in front in the 10th minute. The home team struggled {{for much of the}} game, but salvaged a win on 2 second-half goals by Chris Rolfe. Espindola had the assist on the first goal, and Rolfe's game-winner came on a penalty kick. Fixture congestion forced Coach Ben Olsen to use a decidedly second-choice lineup on a midweek trip to Chicago, but the visiting team came away with a surprising 1–0 victory. The game-winner was scored in the 73rd minute, when Conor Doyle struck an absolute cannon of a shot that was probably the team's most impressive goal of the year to that point. United remained on the road with a trip to Toronto {{at the end of that}} week. The teams played to a 0-0 scoreless draw in very adverse weather conditions, with rain and very heavy winds. Despite being outplayed, United nearly won the game in the last minute, but Jairo Arrieta's bid for Goal of the Year, a bicycle attempt, was frantically tipped over the bar by Toronto FC goalie, Chris Konopka.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} several years, rugby league lay dormant in South Africa {{and it was not}} until the 1960s when talks of {{creating}} a national side began. After much discussion within South Africa, it was eventually agreed that a national side would play a touring Great Britain and then undertake a tour of Australasia. The first South African national side played their first competitive fixture on 23 August 1962 and put on a good showing against the much stronger British but eventually lost by nineteen points 49–30. The following two fixtures turned out to be much the same with the South Africans being defeated on another two occasions but putting in good performances whilst never being comprehensively beaten. The South Africans embarked on their first tour eleven months later with a twenty-four-man squad that included several former Springboks. The tour started with several friendly fixtures against various minor representative sides where they gained two comfortable victories; the first international fixture of the tour took place in Brisbane against the world champion Australians and the South Africans performed with courage but eventually lost the match 34–6. The following test was played a week later in Sydney that again saw the team put in a tough effort but would lose again 54–21. South Africa would leave Australia without an international win and be low on confidence heading to New Zealand to play a sole fixture against the New Zealand national side whom were expected to win comfortably. However, the match turned out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> encounter and surprisingly saw the team gain its first international victory 4–3 The South Africans featured several Australian players bought in to cover injuries and improve the quality of the side and so the match against New Zealand is not counted as a test match.|$|E
25|$|De la Union's {{attempt to}} relieve Bellegarde failed at the Battle of San-Lorenzo de la Muga on 13 August. The French {{sustained}} 800 casualties including General of Brigade Guillaume Mirabel killed. Augereau led 9,000 {{men on the}} right, Pérignon had 16,000 troops in the center while Sauret commanded 9,000 on the left. The Spanish attacked with 45,000 troops including 4,000 cavalry. De la Union tried to overwhelm Augereau with 22,000 men but made the same mistake as in the May attack by attacking in six columns. This time the struggle lasted 16 hours in which Augereau was nearly driven from the field but held it at the end. The French took only 140 prisoners and killed 1,336 of their enemies. Sauret had repelled an attack on his wing while Victor's brigade had repulsed a seaborne assault on the coast. At last, Dugommier ordered Augereau to abandon the cannon foundry and move toward the center. Bellegarde proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> nut to crack and its 1,000 surviving defenders only capitulated on 17 September. The French won a decisive victory at the Battle of the Black Mountain fought from 17 to 20 November. Uniquely, both army commanders Dugommier and de la Union were killed in action. The French had 36,700 troops to oppose 46,000 entrenched Spanish. Augereau began the attack at dawn on the 17th and began rolling up the Spanish left. After Dugommier {{was killed by a}} Spanish shell that morning, Pérignon took command of the army and called off the attack for two days. General of Division Jean Baptiste Beaufort de Thorigny took command of the center. On the 20th, Augereau's assault recommenced and captured the key Roure redoubt. De la Union led his cavalry in a countercharge and was later found dead with two bullet wounds. Taking few prisoners, the French massacred 8,000 of their foes as they overran all the defensive works on the left and center. The undefeated Spanish right wing under Lieutenant General Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu was also compelled to retreat. The French lost about 3,000 killed and wounded. Pérignon quickly seized Figueres and bluffed the powerful Sant Ferran fortress into surrendering on 28 November with 9,000 Spanish prisoners and 171 guns.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{both the}} film's {{explicit}} nature and award contender status, 12 Years a Slaves financial success was being watched closely. Many analysts compared the film's content to other drama films of a similar vein such as Schindler's List (1993) and The Passion of the Christ (2004), which became box office successes despite their respective subject matters. [...] "It may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> subject matter, but when handled well... films that are tough to sit through can still be commercially successful," [...] said Phil Contrino of Boxoffice Magazine. Despite its content, the film's critical success has assisted its domestic distribution by Fox Searchlight that began with a limited released aimed primarily towards art house and African-American patrons. The film's release was gradually widened in subsequent weeks, similarly to how the studio had successfully done in years prior with films such as Black Swan and The Descendants. International release dates for 12 Years a Slave were largely delayed to early 2014 {{in order to take}} advantage of the attention created by awards seasons.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, Gardner {{began his}} novelist career with The Liquidator, {{in which he}} created the {{character}} Boysie Oakes who inadvertently is mistaken to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough,</b> pitiless man of action and is thereupon recruited into a British spy agency. In fact, Oakes was a devout coward who was terrified of violence, suffered from airsickness and was afraid of heights and Gardner admitted of him that, [...] "though I have denied it many times—he was of course a complete piss-take of J. Bond". The book appeared {{at the height of}} the fictional spy mania and, as a send-up of the whole business, was an immediate success. Upon reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher wrote, [...] "Mr. Gardner succeeds in having it both ways: He has written a clever parody which is also a genuinely satisfactory thriller." [...] The book was made into a film of the same name by MGM and another seven light-hearted novels and two short stories about the cowardly Oakes appeared over the next eleven years.|$|E
500|$|Singapore was a {{critical}} race in the championship as all five drivers {{had a chance to}} take the lead with a victory. The situation was made difficult for Alonso as he had used his allocation of eight engines following the Italian Grand Prix, and to replace one would incur a ten-place grid penalty. His rivals each had at least one untouched engine in reserve; Webber had two. Nevertheless, Alonso set himself the target to score points in Singapore. He also acknowledged that his car was not the fastest in the field and felt he needed five podiums in the season's five remaining races. Webber stated that he was expecting Singapore to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> weekend for him after he had retired from the event in 2008 and 2009, but felt there was still some time before a driver clinched the championship. [...] After crashing out of the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton said he would push hard to stay in the running for the championship: [...] "I'll take each race as it comes, but I'll also be making sure I get to the finish of the next five races, that's more important than anything. I go to Singapore to win." [...] Hamilton felt Alonso was the favourite to win the Singapore Grand Prix and viewed the Spanish driver as his main rival for the Drivers' Championship which was shared by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Button himself believed Alonso would have an extra advantage as the Spaniard's teammate Massa was out of contention for the title.|$|E
