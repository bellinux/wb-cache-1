5|$|At this point, {{there is}} a {{divergence}} in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that are unique to that account.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian's {{candidacy}} {{for the head}} coaching job at Notre Dame was unusual {{because he was not}} a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since Knute Rockne had been. Parseghian was also an Armenian Presbyterian, making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who converted in 1925. Joyce made it clear before his hiring that he did not care about Parseghian's religion, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> wanted someone who could lead the football team to success.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{contemplated}} recording more {{tracks to}} make up a double album in a similar manner, but following an earthquake, he decided to relocate to New York City and hold a live recording session at the Record Plant with session players. The basic idea was to create songs with sing-along choruses. Rundgren did not pre-plan who would play on the sessions, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> wanted anyone who happened to be in or near the studio to turn up and learn the material.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's view point. Foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> because they are omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E
5|$|William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who was prime {{minister}} when Victoria {{came to the}} throne and a political mentor to the young queen, was forty years her senior, but is portrayed as a much younger man in the film. As for King Leopold, he was her favourite uncle whose advice she constantly sought; her interest in Albert was due not to the latter's success in wooing her, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> to please Leopold.|$|E

5|$|After Vali's death, Sugriva acquires Vali's kingdom {{as well as}} Tara. The Ramayana {{does not}} record any formal {{marriage}} or any ritual purification—like the trial by fire Sita had to undergo when she is reacquired by Rama from Ravana—that Tara must undertake to marry Sugriva or return to Vali following his return from the dead. The lack of the description of formal marriage suggests, according to some critics, that Tara's relationship to Sugriva is neither widow re-marriage nor polyandry, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> appropriation by Sugriva. In the references of the coronation of Sugriva as king, Angada is also described as the heir-apparent crown prince, while Tara is mentioned as Sugriva's wife. The Adhyatma Ramayana declares that Sugriva acquires Tara.|$|E
5|$|Calloway {{enters the}} church {{wielding}} explosives, taking the congregation hostage. The building is quickly surrounded by police and reporters as Calloway gives a sermon to his hostages {{about the loss}} of faith. Black believes he can connect with Calloway, and is allowed to enter the church. Calloway is initially hostile, but Black is able to talk him down, convincing Calloway that his faith has not been lost, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> tested—despite all that has happened, Calloway has never lost his belief in God. Realizing the truth of this, Calloway surrenders.|$|E
5|$|In 1548 Charles {{declared}} an interreligio imperialis (also {{known as the}} Augsburg Interim) through which he sought to find some common ground for religious peace. This effort alienated both Protestant and Catholic princes and the papacy; even Charles, whose decree it was, was unhappy with the political and diplomatic dimensions of what amounted to half of a religious settlement. The 1551–52 sessions convened by Pope Julius III at the supposedly ecumenical Council of Trent solved none of the larger religious issues <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> restated Catholic teaching and condemned Protestant teaching as heresies.|$|E

The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test to determine if a differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E
5|$|López de Zúñiga, {{known as}} Stunica, {{one of the}} editors of Ximenes Complutensian Polyglot, reproached Erasmus that his text lacked part of the 1 John 5:7-8 (Comma Johanneum). Erasmus replied {{that he had not}} found it in any Greek manuscript. Stunica {{answered}} that Latin manuscripts are more reliable than Greek. In 1520 Edward Lee accused Erasmus of encouraging Arianism. Erasmus replied that he had not found any Greek manuscript that contained these words, he answered that this was a case not of omission, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> of non-addition. He showed that even some Latin manuscripts did not contain these words.|$|E

For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.|$|E

5|$|Roger Sale {{believes}} Andersen {{expressed his}} feelings {{of social and}} sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> different. He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.|$|E
5|$|T.F. Tout, in 1914 one of {{the first}} historians to make a {{thorough}} academic study of the period, considered Pembroke the one favourable exception in an age of small-minded and incompetent leaders. Tout wrote of a 'middle party', led by Pembroke, representing a moderate position between the extremes of Edward and Lancaster. This 'middle party' supposedly took control of royal government through the Treaty of Leake in 1318. In his authoritative study of 1972, J.R.S. Phillips rejects this view. In spite of misgivings with the King’s favourites, Pembroke was consistently loyal to Edward. What was accomplished in 1318 was not the takeover by a 'middle party', <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> a restoration of royal power.|$|E
5|$|The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was {{not created}} until 1956; however, between 1947 and 1955, the Academy {{presented}} Honorary Awards {{to the best}} foreign language films released in the United States. These awards were not competitive, as there were no nominees <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> a winner every year that was voted on by the Board of Governors of the Academy. Three Japanese films were recipients of Honorary Awards during this period. For the 1956 Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.|$|E

5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} Academy Awards {{ceremony}} {{was held on}} May 16, 1929 to honor films released in 1927–28, there was no separate category for foreign language films. Between 1947 and 1955, the Academy presented Special/Honorary Awards to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These awards, however, were not handed out {{on a regular basis}} (no award was given in 1953), and were not competitive since there were no nominees <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> one winning film per year. For the 1956 Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since then.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) asks to {{be a part}} of the {{investigation}} looking for a little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre, who disappeared from her home in Sacramento, California. Mulder's superior, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), initially denies his request, noting that {{the investigation}} is not an X-file, <b>but</b> <b>simply</b> a missing persons case. Mulder, however, convinces Skinner to allow him to investigate. The parents of Amber, Billie and Bud, tell Mulder that they found a note in the girl's bedroom, but the teaser for the episode revealed that the note was written by Billie herself. The note contains a mention of Santa Claus, which everyone finds out of place. Although the family is held for questioning, Mulder does not believe they did it. Looking through previous cases, Mulder finds a similar note, with a reference to Santa Claus, from a missing person case in Idaho from 1987. In the case, the mother was convicted and sentenced to twelve years. The file notes that she had a vision of her son dead before he disappeared, as did Bud on the night his daughter disappeared.|$|E
