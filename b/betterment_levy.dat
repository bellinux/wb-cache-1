5000|$|In 1952, {{before the}} {{completion}} of Bhakra canal system, the Punjab Government armed itself with a legislation to impose <b>betterment</b> <b>levy,</b> {{with the aim of}} meeting all the expenditure on canal system through this tax. According to this legislation, the basis of this tax was to be fifty per cent of the increase in price of land due to the Bhakra canal irrigation system. [...] There were protests throughout the state and hundreds of people were arrested in false cases of encounters with the police. On 10 March 1959, Pratab Singh Kairon, the Chief Minister of Punjab, made a statement in state assembly that the communists were trying to take over the state. The next day, on 11 March, police surrounded Narur, which was cited as one of epicenters of revolt, and started firing. Five people, including a woman, laid down their lives.|$|E
5000|$|The Nuclear Installations Act 1965 {{placed a}} [...] "strict" [...] {{statutory}} duty on the operators of nuclear facilities {{to ensure that}} any exposure to radiation resulting from operations did not cause injury or damage. Under the legislation, claimants {{did not have to}} prove fault to receive compensation under the Act, only causation. From 1966, a circular from several Whitehall ministries was sent to local authorities across the country urging them to provide permanent caravan sites for gypsies. This was followed by the Caravan Sites Act, introduced by the Liberal MP Eric Lubbock in 1968, which obliged local authorities to carry out the recommendations of the 1966 circular. Under the Act, gypsies became entitled to settle in many areas as well as to enjoy regular visiting rights for their caravans in others. The Civic Amenities Act 1967 was aimed at improving and safeguarding buildings of architectural or historical interest, together with the planting and preservation of trees. A Land Commission set up in 1967 with powers to acquire land and collect a <b>Betterment</b> <b>Levy</b> (which was initially 40% of development value). The Administration of Justice Act 1970 introduced (amongst other measures) a new Family Division of the High Court. In addition, the Medicines Act of 1968 “made medicines licensing and safety an active responsibility of the state.” ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} highways on land prices using {{the implementation of the}} west branch of a large beltway around Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area. This is a unique opportunity since the beltway is being implemented by branches. So, it is possible to use the zones surrounding the branches where construction has actually started as a treatment group to be compared with zones surrounding branches for which construction has not started yet. Since we have a proxy for land price data before and after construction, it is possible to estimate the impact by difference-in-difference. The evidence is that there are significant and asymmetrical effects caused by the highway construction. Parcels located close to ramps outbound of the track observed an increase in price faster than similar zones close to other (planned) branches. For parcels located inbound of the beltway, relatively far from the track (between 2. 5 km and 5 km), the effects of construction and delivery/operation faced a (relative) decline in land prices. These results have consequences for transportation finance; <b>betterment</b> <b>levies</b> and value capture taxes; and welfare...|$|R
40|$|Contribucion por Valorizacion {{is a form}} {{of value}} capture similar to Special Assessment, used in Colombia to {{complement}} Local revenues for major public infrastructure programs. SA's continued use countrywide and its resulting technical evolution has, despite some shortcomings, made it a value capture practice that is internationally recognized as a noteworthy experience. Participacion en Plusvalias is an instrument recently implemented to capture up to 50 % of the increments on land values created by public actions, similar to <b>betterment</b> <b>levies</b> and unearned increment taxes. This newer, more complex form of value capture faces important implementation challenges, which need to be addressed. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate both Special Assessment (SA) and Participation in Land Value Increments (PLVI), in order to understand what elements of the process of implementation and consolidation of SA, can inform a strategy to make PLVI a politically sustainable policy instrument. This study explores how local political economy has shaped and influenced the development of these two instruments, highlighting that despite their common conceptual origins, SA and PLVI are significantly different. Acknowledging these differences, the research unpacks the experience in Bogota with SA and sheds light on alternate approaches for PLVI's current managers to address the new instrument's challenging implementation arena. The findings of the study suggest that for PLVI to evolve and consolidate as a policy instrument in Bogota, strategic choices that reframe its management as a long term policy rather than a procedure, must be made. Complementary organizational strategies to enhance efficiency and to influence broader public support are amongst the valuable lessons from the experience with SA that underline the importance of a policy's responsiveness to its implementation arena for its political sustainability. The evolution of PLVI in Bogota is important, because it will strongly influence its debate in the rest of the country. For international scholars and decision makers, the comparative approach to understand the challenges this new chapter of the Colombian experience with value capture faces, can be useful to assess other policy environments; while the analysis of each instrument and its relation to the local political and legislative specificities, can be useful to temper these instrument's understanding. by Patricia Acosta.

40|$|An {{attempt to}} compare two public levies {{calculated}} by units of territorial government {{in order to}} collect resources for infrastructure investments – a <b>betterment</b> <b>levy</b> in Poland and “a fee payable to development” (in Slovak: poplatek za rozvoj) in the Slovak Republic {{was made in the}} paper. It was assumed that the pursued research objective will be realized by means of the desk research analysis as well as the descriptive and logical one. Legal acts that govern issues of calculating a <b>betterment</b> <b>levy</b> in Poland and also selected legal acts which are obligatory in the Slovak Republic were subject to the detailed analysis. In conclusion, it was revealed that {{in spite of the fact}} that both fees are single levies collected for infrastructure investments, their calculating way as well as legal construction are radically different...|$|E
40|$|To develop land it {{is usually}} {{necessary}} to obtain the permission of government. When government grants permission, the land's market value usually rises. Government can then levy a one-time development value tax (DVT). It is {{a percentage of the}} value increment attributable to rezoning. There are two variants of DVT. One is levied at development, and the other prior to development at rezoning or post-rezoning sale. In recent years, governments around the world have shown interest in DVTs. Great Britain; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Sydney, Australia enacted them. Britain subsequently repealed its <b>betterment</b> <b>levy.</b> Now Hawaii, U. S. A., is considering a DVT. 1 There is a controversy among economists about the effects of a DVT. Some argue that the tax causes a higher price of land, a reallocation of resources among alternative uses, and a redistribution of wealth. Others hold that the DVT is like a lump sum tax, having no effect on price or the allocation of resources. F. G. Pennance (1967, pp. 42 - 43), for example, states, ` [...] . A tax on development value in land will reduce the quantity forthcoming at any given price', drive ` [...] . a wedge between the demand-price and the supply-price of de-velopment land [...] . ', and cause an increase in land price to buyers. M. Neutze (1970, pp. 324, 326) argues that because of a price inelastic demand for urban land, ` [...] . most of (a betterment charge) will be passed on to the buyers of developed land '. On the other hand, E. J. Mishan (1970, p. 65) holds that ` [...] . a tax on this capital gain of development land has no effect whatever on its market price '. This paper explains the effects of a DVT on land price [Received September 1972] and resource allocation. A DVT causes higher, un-changed, or lower price depending upon specified con-ditions. The apparently contradictory effects predicted by different economists are simply special cases con-sistent with general economic theory.

40|$|Infrastructure Australia has {{scheduled}} {{the preparation of}} a value capture policy paper and has commissioned SGS Economics and Planning to provide a technical advice paper to inform the policy work. IA’s brief requested a technical paper that will: - Define the value capture mechanisms relevant to transport or other relevant projects; - Provide detailed analysis of each mechanism, including how and at which stage of the project cycle each contributes funding and/or financing to projects, {{as well as from}} which source funds are drawn; - Critically assess the applicability (including positives and negatives) of each approach in the Australian context; - Note barriers to implementation of various mechanisms for capturing value; and - Discuss in which circumstances each mechanism is most appropriate, with specific attention to the Australian context. The technical paper has the following content: - A discussion of the theoretical underpinnings of value capture, including the drivers of property value and value capture implications - Summary descriptions of various value capture mechanisms, including their application to infrastructure projects, their usual source, and their relationship to the drivers of value - A discussion of limitations to value capture as presented by some advocates, and a need for caution in any system design or reforms - An evaluation of value capture mechanisms including a discussion of barriers to the implementation of a more coherent system of value capture in Australia and the identification of six ‘preferred’ possible mechanisms for major infrastructure funding in the Australian context - More detail on reform ideas with a focus on a <b>betterment</b> <b>levy</b> system where development rights are increased, stamp duty re-engineering to make the system a charge on uplift only where it exists, land tax reform to capture value from investments in state infrastructure and background increases in value from amenity upgrades and population growth and more targeted use of government land ownership to capture value generated through the development and infrastructure provision process - A conclusion which highlights the promise of value capture mechanisms for major infrastructure funding in Australia, reiterating the ‘preferred’ mechanisms from the evaluation, while pointing out limitations and barriers to their wider us...|$|E
