40|$|A {{series of}} oligonucleotides {{containing}} biotin- 11 -dUMP at various positions were synthesized and compared in quantitative, colorimetric hybridization-detection studies. A deoxyuridine phosphoramidite containing a protected allylamino sidearm was synthesized {{and used in}} standard, automated synthesis cycles to prepare oligonucleotides with allylamino residues at various positions within a standard 17 -base sequence. Biotin substituents were subsequently attached to the allylamino sidearms by reaction with N-biotinyl- 6 -aminocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. These oligomers were hybridized to target DNA immobilized on microtiter wells (ELISA plates), and were detected with a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex using hydrogen peroxide as substrate and o-phenylenediamine as chromogen. We found that the sensitivity of detection of target DNA by biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probes was strongly dependent upon {{the position of the}} <b>biotin</b> <b>label.</b> Oligonucleotides containing <b>biotin</b> <b>labels</b> near or off the ends of the hybridizing sequence were more effective probes than oligonucleotides containing internal <b>biotin</b> <b>labels.</b> An additive effect of increasing numbers of biotin-dUMP residues was found for some labeling configurations...|$|R

Probes were either labelled with digoxigenin by the random primer technique and detected with anti-digoxigenin antibody, or <b>labelled</b> with <b>biotin</b> by nick translation and detected with streptavidin, both methods having a common final visualisation procedure using alkaline phosphatase. Digoxigenin labelled probes proved two to 10 -fold more sensitive by quantitative dot blotting and four-fold more sensitive in detecting HPV 16 DNA in a series of 31 anal carcinomas, compared with biotinylated probes. The digoxigenin method also produced less non-specific background staining of tissue sections than <b>biotin</b> <b>labelled</b> probes. It is concluded that digoxigenin DNA labelling and detection provides a simple, reliable, and efficient alternative to the use of biotin or radioactive isotopes {{for the detection of}} HPV DNA by in situ hybridisation.

While isotopic DNA labeling {{has little or no}} effect on protein binding affinity, use of non-isotopic labels including flurophores or biotin can alter the affinity and/or stoichiometry of the protein interaction of interest. Competition between fluorophore- or biotin-labeled probe and unlabeled DNA of the same sequence can be used to determine whether the label alters binding affinity or stoichiometry.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Intraerythrocytic malaria parasites {{actively}} import obligate {{nutrients from}} serum and export proteins and lipids to erythrocyte cytoplasm and membrane. The import of macromolecules in the malaria parasite {{has been the}} subject of many debates. To understand the import of macromolecules by the parasite, we studied the uptake of proteins by Plasmodium falciparum infected human erythrocyte. Methods Proteins were <b>biotin</b> <b>labelled</b> individually, purified on a gel filtration column and added to uninfected and infected asynchronized culture. The uptake of these proteins by malaria parasites was determined by western blot analysis of parasite pellet and their different fractions using streptavidin-horseradish conjugate. To further confirm this import, we studied the uptake of 125 I-labelled proteins by western blot analysis as well as used direct immunofluorescence method. Results Here we show that <b>biotin</b> <b>labelled</b> and radio-iodinated polypeptides of molecular sizes in the range of 45 to 206 kDa, when added in the culture medium, get direct access to the parasite membrane through a membrane network by by-passing the erythrocyte cytosol. The import of these polypeptides is ATP-dependent as sodium azide treatment blocks this uptake. We also show that malaria parasites have the ability to take up and degrade <b>biotin</b> <b>labelled</b> human serum albumin, which has been shown to be essential for the parasite growth. Conclusions These results can be used, as a basis to explore the role of human serum albumin in the intraerythrocytic development of parasites, and this in turn can be an important adjunct to the development of novel antimalarial drugs. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} two biotinylating reagents, sulfosuccinimidobiotin and sulfosuccinimidyl 2 -(biotinamido) ethyl- 1, 3 ′-dithiopropionate, to label plasma {{membrane}} proteins was examined. These compounds form covalent bonds {{with the free}} amino groups of proteins and label the proteins with biotin. Biotinylated proteins can be detected with avidin-peroxidase staining. Protoplasts isolated from embryogenic Daucus carota suspension cells were <b>labeled</b> with <b>biotin</b> and the membranes were separated on linear sucrose gradients. The conditions used for labeling the protoplasts did not cause protoplast rupture or loss of viability. The distribution of the <b>biotin</b> <b>label</b> in these linear sucrose gradients was analyzed and compared to the distribution of vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity, a marker for the plasma membrane. Both the <b>biotin</b> <b>label</b> and the vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity were strongly localized in the gradient at peak density of 1. 16 gram per cubic centimeter. When the protoplast surface was labeled, biotinylated polypeptides were detected after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and polypeptides of 153, 94, 51, 30, 20, 17, and 14 kilodaltons were shown to be plasma membrane in origin. When a crude membrane pellet was labeled, numerous biotinylated polypeptides were distributed throughout the gradient. Because {{the position of the}} <b>biotin</b> <b>label</b> in the gradient is strongly correlated with the distribution of vanadate-sensitive ATPase, it is concluded that these biotinylating reagents are effective and reliable labels for proteins of the plant plasma membrane.

Several methods {{for the detection of}} labelled probes were also investigated. The optimal sensitivity of digoxigenin labelled probe was equivalent to that of biotin when alkaline phosphatase was used as the final detector. The median number of discrete viral signals discernible in each cell with the most sensitive detection system was seven to eight with both labelled probes. The average number of HPV 16 genomes in each CaSki cell, derived by dot blot hybridisation, was about 270. The calculated absolute sensitivity of NISH for viral detection in this system is complex because of variation of signal size and number. Nevertheless, one signal per nucleus equates to as little as 30 to 40 viral copies, and probably much less.

To begin to answer these questions, I have taken a biochemical approach. Here I have used an epitope-tagged CLAG 3 parasite to perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments using membrane fractions of infected erythrocytes.

Methods: βA 3 /A 1102 – 117 peptide was first derivatized with sulfo-succinimidyl- 2 -[6 -(biotinamido) - 2 -{pazidobenzamido}-hexanoamido] ethyl- 1 – 3 dithio propionate (sulfo-SBED), a photoactivable, heterotrifunctional biotincontaining cross-linker. The biotin-derivatized peptide was then incubated with αB-crystallin at 37 °C for 2 h to allow complex formation followed by photolysis to facilitate the transfer of the <b>biotin</b> <b>label</b> from the peptide to αB-crystallin. Label transfer was confirmed by western blot, and the labeled αB-crystallin was digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides from αB-crystallin carrying the <b>biotin</b> <b>label</b> were purified by avidin affinity chromatography, and βA 3 /A 1102 – 117 peptide interacting sites in αB-crystallin were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and nanospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QqTOF MS/MS). Results: We found that the βA 3 /A 1102 – 117 peptide interacted with αB-crystallin regions 70 LEKDR 74, 83 HFSPEELKVK 92...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an {{autoimmune disease}} of complex etiology. A characteristic feature of {{a subset of}} RA {{is the presence of}} anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), which correlate with a progressive disease course. In this study, we employed streptavidin capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to analyze ACPA reactivity. Using the pro-filaggrin peptide HQCHQEST-Cit-GRSRGRCGRSGS, as template, we analyzed the reactivity of RA sera and healthy donor sera to various peptides {{in order to determine the}} physical characteristics of the citrullinated pro-filaggrin epitope and to examine whether <b>biotin</b> <b>labelling</b> influence antibody recognition. The full-length cyclic pro-filaggrin peptide and a linear form with a N-terminal biotin, was recognized to the same level, whereas, a notable difference in ACPA reactivity to the linear peptides with a C-terminal biotin was found, probably due to steric hindrance. Screening of linear and cyclic truncated peptides, revealed that small cyclic peptides containing 10 - 12 amino acids are favored over the linear. Moreover, the charged amino acids C-terminal to citrulline were found to be essential for antibody reactivity, most important was the charged amino acid in position 4 C-terminal to citrulline. Collectively, peptide structure, length, the presence of charged amino acids and <b>biotin</b> <b>labelling</b> markedly influence antibody reactivity. In relation to the clinical diagnostics of ACPA, these findings may reflect the differences in diagnostic assays used for detection of ACPA, which relates to differences in sensitivity and specificity dependent on the assay applied...|$|R
40|$|An {{approach}} to selectively and efficiently detect single strand DNA is developed by using streptavidin coated gold nanoparticles (StAuNPs) as efficient quenchers. The central concept {{for the successful}} detection is the combination the of streptavidin-biotin interaction with specific probe-target DNA hybridization. <b>Biotin</b> <b>labeled</b> probe DNAs act as "bridges" to bring Cy 5 labeled targets to the particle surface and the fluorophore dye can be rapidly and efficiently quenched by StAuPNs. By measuring the changes of photoluminescence intensity of Cy 5, an efficient, selective, and reversed detection of DNA hybridization is realized. The methodology may pave a new way for simple and rapid detections of biomolecules...|$|R
