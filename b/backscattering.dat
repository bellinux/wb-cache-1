5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse <b>backscattering</b> off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E

To enhance the throughput of <b>backscatter</b> communications, authors in [25] proposed a reader design with multi-antenna wireless energy beamforming for multiple <b>backscatter</b> users.

These works provide useful insight into the <b>backscatter</b> communications and, however, require special infrastructure to generate the excitation RF signals that <b>backscatter</b> users can reflect. Therefore, ambient <b>backscatter</b> communications should be given more attention to exploring cost-effective possibilities for low-power devices.|$|R

After removing the mean angular <b>backscatter</b> decrease from the data, shape invariant <b>backscatter</b> is derived and used to generate <b>backscatter</b> grey scale maps.

The <b>backscattering</b> intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (e.g.Creaming and Sedimentation) and global changes in size (e.g. flocculation, coalescence) are detected and monitored.|$|E
25|$|In {{electron}} beam lithography (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist is exposed to a beam of high-energy electrons. There is {{the choice of a}} positive or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists. Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to follow along the surface of the material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as electron scattering in the resist and <b>backscattering</b> from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, {{as is the case in}} tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation. To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patters in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and solvent casting. In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2µm wide and 400 and 800nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.|$|E

Background. Myocardial integrated ultrasound <b>backscatter</b> changes in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; however, it is unknown whether ultrasound myocardial tissue characterization may be useful in differentiating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from hypertensive hypertrophy. Methods. Calibrated myocardial integrated <b>backscatter</b> and its transmural gradient were measured in the septum and posterior wall in 31 normal subjects, 13 patients with hypertensive hypertrophy and 22 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Processing of the angular <b>backscatter</b> data using the 'NRGCOR' software was made for 29 locations comprising different geological provinces like: carbonate mounds, buried mounds, seafloor channels, and inter-channel areas. A detailed methodology is developed to produce a map of angle-invariant (normalized) <b>backscatter</b> data by correcting the local angular <b>backscatter</b> values. The present paper involves detailed processing steps and related technical aspects of the normalization approach. The presented angle-invariant <b>backscatter</b> map possesses 12 dB dynamic range in terms of grey scale.

Qualitative analyses of the calculated mean <b>backscatter</b> values i. e., grey scale levels, utilizing angle-invariant <b>backscatter</b> data generally indicate <b>backscatter</b> values are highest (lighter grey scale) in the mound areas followed by buried mounds. The <b>backscatter</b> values are lowest in the inter-channel areas (lowest grey scale level). Moderate <b>backscatter</b> values (medium grey level) are observed from the Gollum and Kings channel data, and significant variability within the channel seafloor provinces. The segmentation of the channel seafloor provinces are made based on the computed grey scale levels for further analyses based on the angular <b>backscatter</b> strength. Three major parameters are utilized to classify four different seafloor provinces of the Porcupine Seabight by employing a semi-empirical method to analyse multibeam angular <b>backscatter</b> data. The predicted <b>backscatter</b> response which has been computed at 20 ° is the highest for the mound areas.

40|$|Measurements of {{acoustic}} <b>backscatter</b> strength can {{be applied}} to analyse sea floor coverage on a spatial extent. They provide consistent coverage compared to analyses based on only a few surface samples. In particular the spatial validity of surface samples can be determined by analyses based on acoustic <b>backscatter</b> strength and sampling locations representative for the surrounding area can be determined. During the cruise ANTXVII/ 4 of the German RV "Polarstern", a high precision swath bathymetry survey was performed along the European continental margin in the Porcupine Seabight off southwest Ireland. Within the Porcupine Seabight a number of mound structures have been discovered earlier, most of them being carbonate mounds. The structure and genesis of these mounds are the main objective of recent investigations. The cruise and the subsequent investigations are part of the EU project GEOMOUND. They focus on the Belgica mound province. Besides the depth measurements, the acoustic intensities of the received echos have been recorded. Taking into account the transmitted and received sound level, acoustic beam patterns, and acoustic attenuation in the water column, the <b>backscatter</b> strength of the ensonified area was calculated. This <b>backscatter</b> information is used to analyse the sea floor coverage. Based on the data of the systematic survey the spatial variation of the <b>backscatter</b> strength was derived. Regions of equal <b>backscatter</b> characteristic can be combined and functions showing the dependency between <b>backscatter</b> strength and incidence angle of the acoustic wave can be determined. These functions help interpreting sea floor coverage. The mapping of the <b>backscatter</b> strength of the mound area indicates clear changes in <b>backscatter</b> strength. Small and shallow channels show a lower <b>backscatter</b> strength than their surroundings. That means the surface coverage of the channels is smooth with respect to the surroundings. One interpretation of this surface pattern points to currents that have built these structures by depositing sediments. In contrast, most of the mounds indicate a strong <b>backscatter</b> strength. Since other investigations showed that some of the mounds are populated by corals, these corals could cause higher <b>backscatter</b> strength. A detailed investigation of the mounds indicates differences of <b>backscatter</b> characteristics between them. There are mounds that show strong <b>backscatter</b> on their slopes but low <b>backscatter</b> on their top. Other mounds show stronger <b>backscatter</b> on their top but lower <b>backscatter</b> on their slopes. These differences could indicate varying surface coverage of those mounds. Based on this information, the mounds are separated and classified...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and examine the use of <b>backscatter</b> data {{collected}} with multibeam sonar (MBS) systems for benthic habitat mapping. <b>Backscatter</b> data were collected from six sites around the Australian coastal zone using the Reson SeaBat 8125 MBS system operating at 455 kHz. Benthic habitats surveyed in this study included: seagrass meadows, rhodolith beds, coral reef, rock, gravel, sand, muddy sand, and mixtures of those habitats. Methods for processing MBS <b>backscatter</b> data were developed for the Coastal Water Habitat Mapping (CWHM) project by a team from the Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST). The CMST algorithm calculates the seafloor <b>backscatter</b> strength derived from the peak and integral (or average) intensity of <b>backscattered</b> signals for each beam. The seafloor <b>backscatter</b> strength estimated from the mean value of the integral <b>backscatter</b> intensity was shown in this study to provide an accurate measurement of the actual <b>backscatter</b> strength of the seafloor and its angular dependence. However, the seafloor <b>backscatter</b> strength derived from the peak intensity was found to be overestimated when the sonar insonification area is significantly smaller than the footprint of receive beams, which occurs primarily at oblique angles. The angular dependence of the mean <b>backscatter</b> strength showed distinct differences between hard rough substrates (such as rock and coral reef), seagrass, coarse sediments and fine sediments. The highest <b>backscatter</b> strength was observed not only for the hard and rough substrate, but also for marine vegetation, such as rhodolith and seagrass. The main difference in acoustic <b>backscatter</b> from the different habitats was the mean level, or angle-average <b>backscatter</b> strength. However, additional information can also be obtained from the slope of the angular dependence of <b>backscatter</b> strength. It was shown that the distribution of the <b>backscatter.</b> The shape parameter was shown to relate to the ratio of the insonification area (which can be interpreted as an elementary scattering cell) to the footprint size rather than to the angular dependence of <b>backscatter</b> strength. When this ratio is less than 5, the gamma shape parameter is very similar for different habitats and is nearly linearly proportional to the ratio. Above a ratio of 5, the gamma shape parameter is not significantly dependent on the ratio and there is a noticeable difference in this parameter between different seafloor types. A new approach to producing images of <b>backscatter</b> properties, introduced and referred to as the angle cube method, was developed. The angle cube method uses spatial interpolation to construct a three-dimensional array of <b>backscatter</b> data that is a function of X-Y coordinates and the incidence angle. This allows the spatial visualisation of <b>backscatter</b> properties to be free from artefacts of the angular dependence and provides satisfactory estimates of the <b>backscatter</b> characteristics. Using the angle-average <b>backscatter</b> strength and slope of the angular dependence, derived by the angle cube method, in addition to seafloor terrain parameters, habitat probability and classification maps were produced to show distributions of sand, marine vegetation (e. g. seagrass and rhodolith) and hard substrate (e. g. coral and bedrock) for five different survey areas. Ultimately, this study demonstrated that the combination of high-resolution bathymetry and <b>backscatter</b> strength data, as collected by MBS, is an efficient and cost-effective tool for benthic habitat mapping in costal zones...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} method for {{removing}} the support arm <b>backscatter</b> from images acquired using current Varian electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs). Methods: The effect of arm <b>backscatter</b> on EPID images was modeled using a kernel convolution method. The parameters of the model were optimized by comparing on-arm images to off-arm images. The model was used to develop a method to remove the effect of <b>backscatter</b> from measured EPID images. The performance of the <b>backscatter</b> removal method was tested by comparing <b>backscatter</b> corrected on-arm images to measured off-arm images for 17 rectangular fields of different sizes and locations on the imager.

Results: Images generated by the <b>backscatter</b> removal method gave consistently better agreement with off-arm images than images without <b>backscatter</b> correction. For the 17 rectangular fields studied, the root mean square difference of in-plane profiles compared to off-arm profiles was reduced from 1. 19 % (standard deviation 0. 59 %) on average without <b>backscatter</b> removal to 0. 38 % (standard deviation 0. 18 %) when using the <b>backscatter</b> removal method.
