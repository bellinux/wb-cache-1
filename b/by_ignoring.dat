5|$|Computer {{models have}} been very {{successful}} at calculating the behavior of TypeII supernovae when the shock has been formed. <b>By</b> <b>ignoring</b> the first second of the explosion, and assuming that an explosion is started, astrophysicists {{have been able to}} make detailed predictions about the elements produced by the supernova and of the expected light curve from the supernova.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II, the {{advancing}} Soviet Red Army pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned {{the formation of a}} provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled Provisional Government of National Unity was formed in Warsaw <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.|$|E

5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. <b>By</b> <b>ignoring</b> the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in the summer and fall of 1919.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to offend the older members of the firm <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E
50|$|Naturally, some gaps in knowledge, {{and even}} falsifying {{observations}} must be temporarily tolerated while research continues. To temper ad hoc hypothesizing in science, common practice includes falsificationism (somewhat {{in the philosophy}} of Occam's razor). Falsificationism means scientists become more likely to reject a theory as it becomes increasingly burdened <b>by</b> <b>ignored</b> falsifying observations and ad hoc hypotheses.|$|R

25|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} persuade Britain to grant independence, {{the government announced}} the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) on 11 November 1965. Smith had sought to make Rhodesia a Commonwealth realm, with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, but she {{refused to accept the}} title of Queen of Rhodesia, and Sir Humphrey Gibbs, still internationally recognised as the only legal authority in Rhodesia, refused to recognise Smith's authority. Smith responded <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> Sir Humphrey and appointing the Deputy Prime Minister Dupont, as the Officer Administrating the Government (best described as an interim Governor).|$|E
25|$|Between {{the truce}} in the Irish War of Independence and the treaty being signed, he was Irish consul in Berlin with {{responsibility}} for trade. He was appointed Irish ambassador to the Vatican (resident minister to the Holy See) in 1929. At that time, Irish diplomatic appointments {{were meant to be}} made by the British King. Bewley frequently flouted the diplomatic niceties <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> the implications of that. The complaints of H.J. Chilton, the British representative, and of Sir R. Clive, his successor, if anything improved Bewley's reputation in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|On {{numerous}} occasions the European Court of Human Rights {{has found that}} Croatian police authorities have failed to fulfil their obligations under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by failing to carry out effective investigations to protect its citizens, and tourists, from violent attacks. In 2009, the European Court of Human Rights delivered a judgement condemning Croatian police authorities for failing to take any steps to bring perpetrators of a violent attack on a Croatian citizen to justice <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> requests to conduct an investigation.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which an {{irrelevant}} distractor is processed during selective attention depends critically {{on the level of}} perceptual load on the relevant task. Here we show that perceptual load also affects the tendency of graspable objects to afford associated actions. Participants carried out a letter-search task and identified a target letter with the right or left hand while ignoring a graspable object with a handle oriented on the left or {{the right side of the}} object. The target letter was presented either on its own (low perceptual load) or alongside five nontarget letters (high load). Responses were faster when the action afforded <b>by</b> the <b>ignored</b> object was compatible (vs. incompatible) with the current target response, but only when the perceptual load of the letter search task was low. This finding is the first to demonstrate the role of perceptual load in action affordances <b>by</b> <b>ignored</b> objects...|$|R
25|$|Rangakrishna Muthu Virappa Nayak, {{who succeeded}} Chokkanatha was a {{spirited}} boy of fifteen. He tried {{to revive the}} diminished fortunes of the kingdom. He {{made a name for}} himself <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> Aurangazeb with courage, but little enough of his territories remained to him to rule. The greater part of them was held by Mysore, some by the Maravans, some by the Marathas of Gingee, and some by the Marathas of Tanjore. At first, the country was subject to anarchy and pillage, foreign enemies occupied all the forts, and robber chiefs were masters of the rural areas and carried on their brigandage there with impunity.|$|E
25|$|When the war ended, U.S. President McKinley {{appointed}} Charles Herbert Allen as {{the first}} civilian governor of Puerto Rico. Though Allen had a business background, his financial administration of Puerto Rico was strikingly unsound. <b>By</b> <b>ignoring</b> the appropriation requests of the Puerto Rican House of Delegates, refusing to make any municipal, agricultural or small business loans, building roads at double the old costs, and leaving 85% of the school-age population without schools. Instead of making these infrastructure and education investments, Allen raided the Puerto Rican treasury and his administration re-directed the insular budget to no-bid contracts for U.S. businessmen, railroad subsidies for U.S.-owned sugar plantations, and high salaries for U.S. bureaucrats in the island government.|$|E
25|$|These earlier methods had flaws {{that were}} easily exploitable. The average run-rate method took no {{account of how}} many wickets were lost by the team batting second, but simply {{reflected}} how quickly they were scoring when the match was interrupted. So if a team felt a rain stoppage was likely, they could attempt to force the scoring rate without regard for the corresponding highly likely loss of wickets, skewing the comparison with the first team. The most productive overs method also took no account of wickets lost by the team batting second, and effectively penalized the team batting second for good bowling, <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> their best overs in setting the revised target.|$|E

25|$|After passage by both houses, a bill is {{enrolled}} {{and sent}} to the president for approval. The president may sign it making it law or veto it, perhaps returning it to Congress with their objections. A vetoed bill can still become law if each house of Congress votes to override the veto with a two-thirds majority. Finally, the president may do nothing—neither signing nor vetoing the bill—and then the bill becomes law automatically after ten days (not counting Sundays) according to the Constitution. But if Congress is adjourned during this period, presidents may veto legislation passed {{at the end of a}} congressional session simply <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> it; the maneuver is known as a pocket veto, and cannot be overridden by the adjourned Congress.|$|E
25|$|Frank Horstmann, in Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe, {{has criticized}} Shapin and Schaffer's {{use of the}} {{historical}} evidence. He argues that Shapin and Schaffer {{have a lot of}} important facts wrong. Before May 1648, for example, Hobbes preferred vacuist interpretations of experimental pneumatics and strictly rejected plenist interpretations as not imaginable; but Shapin and Schaffer turn the vacuist into a plenist <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> all the vacuist interpretations and by producing a very faulty translation as a putative proof for a plenist interpretation. Horstmann argues that there are many similar errors and wrong quotations in Leviathan and the Air-Pump and suggests that the chapters dealing with Hobbes are constructed on heavy and sometimes systematic misrepresentations of the historical record.|$|E
25|$|This {{allowed for}} {{representative}} suits {{in situations where}} {{there were too many}} individual parties (which now forms the first requirement for class action litigation, numerosity). However, this rule did not allow such suits to bind similarly situated absent parties, which rendered the rule ineffective. Within ten years, the Supreme Court interpreted Rule 48 in such a way so that it could apply to absent parties under certain circumstances, but only <b>by</b> <b>ignoring</b> the plain meaning of the rule. In the rules published in 1912, Equity Rule 48 was replaced with Equity Rule 38 as part of a major restructuring of the Equity Rules, and when federal courts merged their legal and equitable procedural systems in 1938, Equity Rule 38 became Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E
