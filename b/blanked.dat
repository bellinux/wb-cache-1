40|$|Abstract. Fine-blanking with {{negative}} clearance {{is a kind}} of fine <b>blanking</b> processes. The punch size of fine-blanking {{with negative}} clearance is larger than the die size. The paper does lots of simulations for the changes of <b>blanking</b> force in fine-blanking with negative clearance and common <b>blanking</b> by DEFORM software, and the <b>blanking</b> force curves are gained by these experiments. The changing principle of <b>blanking</b> force and internal material is obtained through the simulation and experiments. The result shows that simulation <b>blanking</b> force of AISI- 1045 is lager than the actual <b>blanking</b> force. According to the curves derived from experiments, we can see that the maximum <b>blanking</b> force of fine-blanking with negative clearance is higher than common <b>blanking</b> force. Compared with fine-blanking with negative clearance, the common <b>blanking</b> force reduces faster after the <b>blanking</b> force reaches maximum value. The experiment result shows that the force of fine-blanking with negative clearance under a smaller <b>blanking</b> clearance is a bit bigger than the force of common <b>blanking</b> force, and the <b>blanking</b> quality of fine-blanking with negative clearance is much better than that of common <b>blanking.</b> Cracks can be closed effectively by the special squeeze forming in fine <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance. Then, the crack can not expand continuously, and the bonding force is enhanced. The squeeze forming can restrain intergranular deformation and reduce the damage. However, the stretch forming easily leads to the inner crack and defect of materials. By means of the analysis on experimental curves, the paper further studies the changing law of fine-blanking with negative clearance <b>blanking</b> force...|$|R
40|$|<b>Blank</b> {{design is}} an {{important}} task in sheet metal forming process optimization. The initial <b>blank</b> shape has direct effect on the part quality. This paper presents a deformation based <b>blank</b> design approach to determine the initial <b>blank</b> shape for a formed part. The <b>blank</b> design approach is integrated separately into ABAQUS, and DD 3 IMP, a research purpose in-house FEA code, to demonstrate its compatibility with any FEA code. The algorithm uses FE results to optimize the <b>blank</b> shape for a part. Deep drawing simulation of a rectangular cup geometry was carried out with an initial <b>blank</b> shape determined empirically. The <b>blank</b> shape was iteratively modified, based on the deformation history, until an optimal <b>blank</b> shape for the part is achieved.

25|$|The Dodgers next {{went back}} on the road to face the first place Milwaukee Brewers. Ted Lilly was again sharp, {{allowing}} just two hits in seven innings of work, but one of the hits was a solo home run by Ryan Braun. The Brewers added two more solo shots off Dodger relievers in the eighth and won 3-0 as the Dodgers hit into 4 double plays and a triple play and were unable to score against Randy Wolf. The Dodgers had another strong pitching performance from their starter the next day, as Chad Billingsley allowed only one run in seven innings of work, but the Dodgers were unable to solve Yovani Gallardo and the game was tied at 1-1 entering the bottom of the ninth. However, relief pitchers Hong-Chih Kuo and Mike MacDougal were unable to record an out in the inning and the Brewers recorded the 2-1 walk-off win on Mark Kotsay's bases loaded pinch-hit single. The Brewers won another pitching duel from the Dodgers the following day 3-1 despite another strong start by rookie Nathan Eovaldi. Tony Gwynn, Jr. hit his first home run since July 17, 2010 for the Dodgers lone run of the game. Clayton Kershaw helped the Dodgers avoid a sweep by pitching eight shutout innings to pick up his 15th win as the Dodgers won 5-1 on August 18. Kershaw became the first Dodger pitcher to pick up his 15th win before September since Hideo Nomo in 2003. Hiroki Kuroda finally got some run support, picking up the win in the Dodgers 8-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies on August 19. Rod Barajas hit a three-run homer in the third inning as Kuroda allowed two runs in six innings for his seventh consecutive quality start since the all-star break. The Dodgers blew an extra inning lead and lost to the Rockies 7-6 in 13 innings the next day. They had taken the lead {{in the top of the}} 12th on a solo homer by Aaron Miles and an inside the park homer by Trent Oeltjen, but rookie closer Javy Guerra blew his first save of the season. A walk-off single by Dexter Fowler in the 13th ended the game. Oeltjen's inside the park homer was the 1st by a Dodger since Blake DeWitt on May 6, 2008. James Loney had 4 hits in 4 at-bats on the 21st, including his 6th homer of the season. Chad Billingsley struck out 7 and only allowed 3 hits in 7 2/3 innings, but was victimized by two 2-run homers by Carlos González and Seth Smith and the Dodgers dropped the finale against the Rockies 5-3. With the win, the Rockies broke a 17-game losing streak in Sunday games, a Major League record. The Dodgers next started a three-game series on the road against the St. Louis Cardinals. Chris Carpenter <b>blanked</b> the Dodgers through eight innings, but the Dodgers rallied in the ninth as Aaron Miles hit an RBI triple off Fernando Salas to tie the score at one and then Rod Barajas hit a grounder to short that former Dodger Rafael Furcal bobbled to allow Miles to score with the winning run. Kershaw picked up his 16th win the next night, pitching six scoreless innings in the Dodgers 13-2 win over the Cardinals. Matt Kemp and Aaron Miles hit solo homers and Rod Barajas hit two homers as the Dodger offense had a rare outburst of power. The Dodgers won the final game of the series 9-4 thanks to a six run third inning and another effective performance by Hiroki Kuroda. The offensive outburst included the first career home run by A. J. Ellis as the Dodgers picked up their first series sweep of the Cardinals on the road since 1993. The Dodgers also moved ahead in the lifetime series with the Cardinals 1,002 wins to 1,001 for the Cards.|$|E

The analysis result shows that the simulation <b>blanking</b> force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but the <b>blanking</b> force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, the <b>blanking</b> force changes quickly.
