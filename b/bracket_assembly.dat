30|$|The {{ligation}} between bracket {{and wire}} is another variable that influences the frictional force [24]. In the present study, the ligation method between the bracket and wire was standardized to eliminate this variable. However, large {{variation in the}} obtained data that was observed in this study {{could be due to}} the small sample size and employed test methodology. In addition, the minimal impact of chlorhexidine mouthrinse on the surface roughness or frictional resistance observed in this study might be due to the short-period immersion (1.5  h) of the stainless steel <b>brackets</b> and archwire <b>assemblies</b> in each test environment. The immersion period was chosen because chlorhexidine mouthrinses are usually prescribed for a short-term only between 4 to 12  weeks twice a day due to their adverse effects on tooth color and normal flora in the mouth. Chlorhexidine molecules would attach to the oral tissues and release gradually. Defining chlorhexidine concentration in the mouth after 30  s after expectoration is difficult. Thus, the 1.5 -hchlorhexidine exposure in this study attempted to simulate 3 -month accumulation of 1 -min daily chlorhexidine mouthrinse applications. As with any in vitro study, the protocol cannot exactly simulate the real clinical situation.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relationship}} between the critical contact angle and the torque angle in an orthodontic <b>bracket</b> and archwire <b>assembly</b> in 3 dimensions. Three-dimensional mathematical models were created with geometric bracket-archwire parameters that included 2 slot sizes, 3 bracket widths, and 3 to 4 wire sizes. From this, 3 -dimensional mathematical equations (3 DMEs) for the critical contact angle and the maximum torque that result in critical contact angles of 0 were derived and calculated. To evaluate the effects of archwire-bracket parameters on critical contact angles, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed at the significance level of P. 05. For all bracket-archwire combinations, the critical contact angle decreased as bracket width, torque angle, and wire size increased. Therefore, all bracket-archwire parameters except slot height had an effect on the critical contact angle. Results of the critical contact angle produced from our 3 DMEs were the same as those produced by 3 D computer-aided design (SolidWorks Corp, Concord, Mass), thus confirming the validity of our derived equations. In addition, the effect of a beveled edge was investigated in some archwires. Furthermore, torsional play angles were calculated and found to be similar to those in previous reports. The results of this study provide theoretic and experimental bases for clinical orthodontic practice and indicate that torque angles should be included in the evaluation of the critical contact angle.

40|$|In modern {{spacecraft}} {{with the}} requirement of increased accuracy of payloads, the on-orbit structural dynamic behavior of spacecraft is increasingly influencing the design and performance of spacecraft. During the integrated spacecraft testing {{of one of the}} satellites, a strong coupling between rotating momentum wheels and an earth sensor was detected. This resulted in corruption of the earth sensor data at certain wheel speeds. This paper deals with the dynamic coupling problem of a rotating momentum wheel with its support brackets affecting other subsystems of spacecraft. As part of this investigation, extensive modal tests and vibration tests were carried out on the momentum wheel <b>bracket</b> <b>assembly</b> with wheels in stationary and rotating conditions. It was found that the effects of gyroscopic forces arising out of rotating wheels are significant and this aspect needs {{to be taken into account}} while designing the mounting brackets. Results of analysis and tests were used to redesign the bracket leading to a significant reduction in the interaction and associated problems. A procedure for design of a support structure using a low-order mathematical model is also shown...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] A fixture is {{designed}} and built to hold, support and locate every component to ensure that each is drilled or machined with accuracy and manufactured individually. A fixture can be designed for a particular job. A brake spider includes a spider body with a central opening and a slot for receiving a camshaft and <b>bracket</b> <b>assembly.</b> The brake spider is attached to axle housing via the central opening. The form to be used depends on the shape and requirement of the work piece to be machined. In the existing fixture, used for modeling brake spider component, only five components were machined per hour. In the present work, detailed study of brake spider component is carried out and design is modified to increase the productivity. The new fixture design is carried out by using CATIA V 5 modeling software and it is critically evaluated {{for the failure of}} piston rod component, by finite element method (FEM) using ANSYS software. This modified design is adapted in the fabrication of fixture and is tested for its productivity. It is found that there is a considerable enhancement in the productivity to seven components per hour with required accuracy.

40|$|In February 2011 the US Department of Energy {{announced}} their new Sunshot Initiative. The Sunshot {{goal is to}} reduce the total cost of solar energy systems by about 75 percent {{before the end of the}} decade. The DOE estimated that a total installed cost of $ 1 per watt for photovoltaic systems would be equivalent to 6 ÃÂÃÂ¢/kilowatt hour (kWh) for energy available from the grid. The DOE also estimated that to meet the $ 1 per watt goal, PV module costs would need to be reduced to $. 50 per watt, balance of systems costs would need to be reduced to $. 40 per watt, and power electronic costs would need to reach $. 10 per watt. To address the BOS balance of systems cost component of the $ 1 per watt goal, the DOE announced a funding opportunity called (BOS-X) Extreme Balance of System Hardware Cost Reductions. The DOE identified eight areas within the total BOS costs: 1) installation labor, 2) installation materials, 3) installation overhead and profit, 4) tracker, 5) permitting and commissioning, 6) site preparation, 7) land acquisition, 8) sales tax. The BOS-X funding announcement requested applications in four specific topics: Topic 1 : Transformational Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) Modules Topic 2 : Roof and Ground Mount Innovations Topic 3 : Transformational Photovoltaic System Designs Topic 4 : Development of New Wind Load Codes for PV Systems The application submitted by ARaymond Tinnerman reflected the requirements listed in Topic # 2, Roof and Ground Mount Innovations. The goal of topic # 2 was to develop technologies that would result in the extreme reduction of material and labor costs associated with applications that require physical connections and attachments to roof and ground mount structures. The topics researched in this project included component cost reduction, labor reduction, weight reduction, wiring innovations, and alternative material utilization. The project objectives included: 1) The development of an innovative quick snap <b>bracket</b> <b>assembly</b> that would be bonded to frameless PV modules for commercial rooftop installations. 2) The development of a composite pultruded rail to replace traditional racking materials. 3) In partnership with a roofing company, pilot the certification of a commercial roof to be solar panel compliant, eliminating the need for structural analysis and government oversight resulting in significantly decreased permitting costs. 4) Reduce the sum of all cost impacts in topic # 2 from a baseline total of $ 2. 05 /watt to $. 34 /watt...|$|E
