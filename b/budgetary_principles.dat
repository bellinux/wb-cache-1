40|$|Budgetary {{risks of}} the Russian regions have been {{characterized}} by a sustained upward trend {{since the beginning of}} the 200 – 2009 crisis. This hinders the achievement of target indicators and fails to provide financial stability and sustainable socio-economic development of territories, which makes it important to search for solutions to the scientific issue of improving the system of management of risks affecting the income base of regions’ consolidated budgets. It is necessary that the authorities made timely management decisions aimed at minimizing the impact of negative risk-contributing factors on public finances of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. Informational and analytical basis of such operational decisions may include methodological tools of assessment of the impact of budgetary risks on the sustainability of the regional budgets’ income base. However, such tool is currently missing. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that the authors have proven that when assessing <b>budgetary</b> risks, <b>principles</b> of comprehensiveness and objectivity need to be complied with, these principles imply the consideration of the risk of failure to perform the budget, the risk of imbalance and the risk expenditure non-implementation in connection with the repayment of the region’s debt. Moreover, the authors suggest a gradation of the level of budgetary risks based on a hierarchy of groups of budget expenditures which can be reduced with minimal impact on the socio-economic development of territories. The results of testing the proposed methodological tools conducted in the constituent entities of the Northwestern Federal district have demonstrated an increase in the integral quantity of budgetary risks destabilizing the income base of regional budgets. The greatest risk is currently generated in the management of regions’ public (municipal) debt. In order to improve the management and mitigate budgetary risks, the authors have proposed an algorithm for determining the feasibility of establishing a reserve fund of a constituent entity of the Federation and establishment of its optimal amount. It has been revealed that reserves funds in all regions of the Northwestern Federal district in 2015 were many times less than the optimal amount; this made it impossible to perform the basic function of this tool of budgetary risk management. The proposed algorithm and tools for assessing the impact of budgetary risks on the sustainability of the income base of the regions’ consolidated budgets can be used by the regions’ financial bodies of executive power for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of budget management as a part of its informational and analytical support...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe five Universal Exhibitions held in Paris between 1855 and 1900 {{share the}} particularity of having been, unlike their British counterparts, financed first wholly, then in part, by the Government. Public {{financing}} led to public finance <b>principles</b> (<b>budgetary</b> and public accounting) being {{applied to the}} organisation of the Exhibitions. Along with these, the organisation in charge of running these events imported a set of well-formatted techniques. However, these techniques (budgeting and accounting technique) {{were part of a}} highly specific type of organisation that bore all the hallmarks of a project:  an Exhibition is characterised by strong notions of vision, intentionality and voluntarist action: it seeks to achieve objectives (of presentation/democratisation and dissemination) which require a certain number of specific activities to be set up, the results of which, subject to uncertainty or exogenous variables, must be measured both as preparations advance, and then again retrospectively, after the event.  an Exhibition is an event limited in time and space (it opens on a given date and for a length of time decided by the law (or decree) and its organisation is traditionally divided into four well-defined phases: preparation, realisation, exploitation and liquidation. The principles of public finance must therefore be adapted to a specific organisational environment and in particular, to the managerial constraints of the event. The system of accounting information is very much part of a process of organisational perception, governance and strategic mobilisation. The Universal Exhibitions provide an original field of investigation for examining the roles attributed to accounting {{within the framework of the}} organisation of such events. The originality here derives as much from the context (a project to be managed over a period of time and where no tool or project management model existed (Michaïlesco, 2007)) as from the public nature of the accounting technique used. Indeed, since knowledge of public accounting practice is incomplete, the study of organisation by the state would seem extremely interesting for the history of public finance (Thuillier, 1999). From this point of view, the Universal Exhibitions organised in Paris during the second half of the 19 th century were organised under two different political regimes and within two distinct public finance frameworks. Changes in the regulations governing public finances had an impact on the powers bestowed on the organisations in charge putting on the Exhibitions. The accounting systems which were set up therefore had to be adapted to fit within the time limit. Moreover, public accounting was designed with the aim of controlling the collection of taxes and their use (Lemarchand, 1999), which is different from running an Exhibition, in particular if the event is seen in terms of project management. This change of objective modified the use of accounting systems and led to the emergence of specific roles that had to evolve as a result of both the accumulation of knowledge and the political context. The aim of this article is therefore to analyse the role of public accounting within the framework of the five Universal Exhibitions organised in Paris during the second half of the 19 th century. The analysis was carried out using Burchell & al. 's classification system (1980). The latter distinguishes between four types of role assumed by accounting systems with reference to the characteristics of decision-making within an organisation. Indeed, decision-making is affected by adhesion to an objective and the uncertainty surrounding the consequences of the action taken. Depending on the degree of adhesion and uncertainty, decision-taking is described as ‘decision by computation', ‘decision by judgement', ‘decision by compromise', or ‘decision by inspiration'. The roles of accounting ascribed to these are as follows: ‘answer machines', ‘learning machines', ‘ammunition machines' and ‘rationalization machines'. Two groups of Universal Exhibitions have been identified: those held under the Second Empire (the 1855 and 1867 Exhibitions) and those held under the 3 rd Republic (the 1878, 1889 and 1900 Exhibitions). This division into two main periods allows us to take two important factors into account: on the one hand, the change of political regime that influenced the rules of public finance and on the other, the constitution of fairly general principles for the running of these events. The comparative study of these two groups of Exhibitions reveals that two distinct roles can be allotted to the accounting systems: a learning role during the Exhibitions of the first period, then a rationalization role in the case of the Exhibitions held during the second period. Under the Second Empire, the Universal Exhibitions financed exclusively by the Government were supported by strong political, economic and social aims. The importance given to holding such an event dispensed these projects from control by Parliament, whose influence had already been weakened considerably under Napoleon III. Although the decision to organise an Exhibition was unanimous, lack of knowledge on how to run such a project meant there was great uncertainty as to the consequences of decisions since the concept was new. Experience of running such a wide-ranging project therefore had to be acquired. An accounting system based on the rules and principles of public accounting and adapted to the events in question therefore met these needs. Within the framework of the Universal Exhibitions organised under the Second Empire, accounting may therefore be analysed as a learning instrument and aid to decision-making (learning machine). The arrival of the 3 rd Republic and with it the return of strict parliamentary control, saw great controversy emerge as to the economic usefulness of Universal Exhibitions and the financial implication of the Government in their organisation. The difficulty in obtaining a consensus on how they should be run led to a process of retrospective justification in which accounting acquired considerable importance. Despite the financial disengagement of the Government, the principles of public finance were still applicable but had evolved as a result of changes in the political and economic environment. Experience acquired in the organisation of the preceding Exhibitions reduced the uncertainty inherent in evaluating the consequences of decisions taken. However, the need then arose to rationalize the existence of these events and the use of the private finances obtained. Budgetary procedures were strengthened and there was an overproduction of information in the shape of financial reporting and statistics. In this context, the accounting system, which had been adapted many times after the first Exhibitions as a result of changes in the environment, was then used to rationalize the action taken (rationalization machine). The documents used to carry out this study are of two different kinds. On the one hand, there are the various documents generated by the organization of the Exhibitions (correspondence, plans of the exhibition palaces, photographs, administrative and accounting documents etc.) that were presented to the national archives by the Ministry for Commerce between 1877 and 1910 (de Maurepas, 1998).

Although, strictly speaking, there was no 'budget' under the Ancien Régime, there did exist techniques that can only be called 'budgetary'. And these, in fact became the leading <b>budgetary</b> <b>principles</b> that were given definite legal status beginning with the Revolution. With this approach, it is possible to display the major tendencies and chief problems of the finances of the French monarchy : a growing deficit and violent crises; the permanent use of expedients rather than regular taxes, despite a constant effort to increase the latter; and the role of war in this regard. The investigation of the monarchy's finances from a budgetary angle is the first step in quantitative {{study of the}} State in the Ancien Régime, a State whose role in the development of European civilization is less well known than one might thinkGuery Alain.

40|$|It is my {{intention}} {{in this paper}} {{to comment on the}} structure of the budget and on Rhodesian fiscal policy in the light of this budgetary structure. I have two basic observations to make. The first is that the 1972 budget is, in structural terms, entirely as was to be expected and it may, in fact, be interpreted as one further budget which has the effect of maintaining a gradual but consistent regressive shift in the fiscal structure. The second is that the structure is not only regressive, but also fairly rigid, and the <b>budgetary</b> <b>principles</b> that have formed the basis of not only this, but also a succession of budgets prior to this, have had the net effect of reducing the impact of fiscal policy on the general level of economic activity. This second observation should not be interpreted as implying a reduction in the influence of the state in the economy but rather as an implication that other, non-fiscal methods, have been increasingly employed in an effort to achieve desired objectives. Generalisations, by definition, seek to simplify complex situations by reference to dominant characteristics. The test of validity, when applied to generalisations, is not whether simplification obscures detail, but whether this suppression of detail is in fact misleading. My basic thesis is that discussion and analysis of the Rhodesian budget is very often concerned with detail, to the extent that general principles are often overlooked. Further, the details themselves are carefully woven into the general fabric of this structure, and thus an overview is the most efficient way of gaining an insight into the detail...|$|E

40|$|For over {{a century}} and a half, public {{budgeting}} in Western industrialized countries has been predicted on a model that assumed a high level of resource mobilization for public purposes, strong public accountability, and bureaucratic control. This classical budget model, with its stress on annuality, unity, balance, and a regular budget cycle, replaced a pre-budgetary system based on continuity, decentralization, privatization, and flexibility. Although the pre-budgetary model had persisted for many hundreds of years, the introduction of budgeting was an enormous improvement. It emphasized public accountability against secrecy, democratic decision making against autocracy, regularity and control against opportunism and improvisation, and public norms against institutionalized corruption. Introduced as a tool for the financing and control of public agencies, the potential of the budget process was gradually recognized for other purposes, including planning, policy-making, and management. Yet even as the success of budgeting made it an unquestioned assumption of modern government, its own assumptions were under stress (Caiden, N. 1982). Whereas once it might have been imagined that public needs were finite and public resources infinite, the opposite now seemed more plausible: public demands were a bottomless pit and the revenues available to meet them were severely limited (Caiden, N. 1981). Moreover, while the budget cycle and its bureaucratic appendages were the accepted means for controlling government finances and maintaining public accountability, this linkage no longer appeared to be effective. By the 1980 s, not only did it seem that the promises of public budgeting remained unfulfilled, but it appeared that it was no longer even performing its basic functions effectively. In some respects, it almost seemed that things were going backward, to the bad old days of pre-budgeting. Was the problem that the accepted <b>budgetary</b> <b>principles,</b> based on notions of tight bureaucratic control, no longer fit the changed circumstances of government...|$|E
40|$|Fiscal Responsibility Laws (FRLs) {{appear to}} be more popular in middle-income {{countries}} than advanced countries, even though their success is limited. The reasons why few advanced countries have a FRL include: the existing legal framework for the budget system is adequate; supranational rules and political agreements in EU countries; failed attempts to include quantitative fiscal rules in laws; lack of consensus or interest in attaining the goals of FRL-type legislation; and lack of need for a law to regulate fiscal transparency, accountability and macro-fiscal stabilization. Without commitment to fiscal discipline, adoption of a FRL may not contribute to attaining fiscal consolidation goals.
