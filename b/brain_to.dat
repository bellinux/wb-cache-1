5|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} the <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in {{the fifth century}} BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed the <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum. Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E

5|$|Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Herman Gottlieb. Hermann {{claims that}} the Breach will {{stabilize}} and the Kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed, while Newton suggests drifting with a Kaiju’s <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> learn more about them. Newton goes ahead with his plan despite Herman's protests and discovers that the Kaiju are actually bioweapons grown by alien colonists, that live on the dimension {{on the other side}} of the breach called the Anteverse, who plan on wiping out humanity. With Pentecost's permission, Newton searches for black market dealer Hannibal Chau who sells body parts of dead Kaiju to obtain a fresh Kaiju <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> drift with. However, he soon figures out that since drifting is a two-way link, the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his knowledge just as he did theirs. Soon after, two new Kaijus, Leatherback and Otachi, emerge simultaneously to find Newton.|$|E

5|$|Working {{memory is}} the ability of the <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> {{maintain}} a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in.

5|$|After the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a {{military}} hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to begin operating after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had been damaged by the bullet when it passed through her head. After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room for the <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> swell.|$|E
5|$|Buoyancy: The actual mass of {{the human}} brain is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net weight of the brain {{suspended}} in the CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams. The brain therefore exists in neutral buoyancy, which allows the <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> maintain its density without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill neurons in the lower sections without CSF.|$|E

5|$|Gould was a {{champion}} of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, {{as well as other}} non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be the unintended side consequence of natural selection. To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba. Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
5|$|Head {{injury is}} present in ancient myths that may date back before {{recorded}} history. Skulls found in battleground graves with holes drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation {{may have been used}} to treat TBI in ancient times. Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the <b>brain</b> <b>to</b> be the center of thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, neuroimaging {{studies of}} {{acupuncture}} have explored extensive aspects of <b>brain</b> responses <b>to</b> acupuncture in finding its underlying mechanisms. Most {{of these studies}} have been performed on healthy adults. Only {{a few studies have}} been performed on patients with diseases. <b>Brain</b> responses <b>to</b> acupuncture in patients with the same disease at different pathological stages have not been explored, although it may be more important and helpful in uncovering its underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we used fMRI <b>to</b> compare <b>brain</b> responses <b>to</b> acupuncture in patients with Bell’s palsy at different pathological stages with normal controls and found that the <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> acupuncture varied at different pathological stages of Bell’s palsy. The <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> acupuncture decreased in the early stages, increased in the later stages, and nearly returned to normal in the recovered group. All of the changes in the <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> acupuncture could be explained as resulting from the changes in the brain functional status. Therefore, we proposed that the <b>brain</b> response <b>to</b> acupuncture is dependent on the brain functional status, while further investigation is needed to provide more evidence in support of this proposition...|$|R
