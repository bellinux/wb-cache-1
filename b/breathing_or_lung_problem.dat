40|$|Objective. The {{epidemiological}} paradox {{posits that}} immigrants in USA experience better health outcomes than nonimmigrants with similar socioeconomic status. However, {{little is known}} about the development of health problems over the life course for immigrants who return to their country of origin. Methods. The Mexican Migration Project provides detailed information on immigration, health, and socioeconomic status for 671 unauthorized migrants, 101 legal migrants, and 3, 748 nonmigrants. Cox regression estimated the adjusted hazard of developing hypertension, diabetes/prediabetes, poor mental health, and heart and <b>lung</b> <b>problems.</b> Results. Legal immigrants to USA did not have a significantly higher risk of having a self-reported diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, heart <b>or</b> <b>lung</b> <b>problems,</b> <b>or</b> poor mental health compared to nonmigrants. However, the hazard ratio for unauthorized deported immigrants ranged from 2. 25 (CI: 1. 29 – 3. 93) for diabetes to 4. 43 (CI: 2. 33 – 8. 40) for poor mental health compared to nonmigrants. Conclusions. Health problems occur several years earlier among unauthorized immigrants compared to individuals who never migrated. Poor access to healthcare services combined with USA lifestyle and working conditions after migration to the USA may contribute to an increased risk for the development of chronic health conditions later in life...|$|R

40|$|In {{one family}} three {{brothers}} {{were found to}} have a moderate deficiency of alpha 1 -antitrypsin associated with the unusual Pi (protease inhibitor) phenotype FZ. The Pi phenotypes of their six living siblings were found to be FM (in three), M (in two) and MZ (in one). The three FZ brothers all had moderate to severe obstructive airways disease, and two had at least moderately severe pulmonary emphysema. Additional risk factors included moderate cigarette smoking in two and prolonged exposure to grain dust in all three. The same risk factors applied to the six non-FZ siblings, but they had only mild symptoms and pulmonary dysfunction <b>or</b> no <b>lung</b> <b>problems</b> at all; one, a female smoker with the MZ phenotype, had probable early emphysema demonstrated radiologically. The three FZ men may have had reduced fertility, as they produced only 1 child among them, as compared with 39 among the other eight siblings. This family study thus suggests that individuals with the FZ phenotype are at risk for pulmonary emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease, particularly in the presence of other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking and grain dust exposure...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} the community incidence and risk factors for all-cause pneumonia in children in Western Sydney, Australia. A cross-sectional randomized computer-assisted telephone interview was conducted in July 2000, in Western Sydney. Parents of 2020 children aged between 5 and 14 years were interviewed about their child's respiratory health since birth. No verification of reported diagnosis was available. Logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} determine risk factors for pneumonia. A lifetime diagnosis of pneumonia was reported in 137 / 2020 (68 %) children, giving an estimated incidence in the study sample of 7. 6 / 1000 person-years. Radiological confirmation was reported in 85 % (117 / 137). Hospitalization was reported in 41 % (56 / 137) and antibiotic therapy in 93 % (127 / 137) of cases. Using logistic regression modelling, statistically significant associations with pneumonia were a reported history of either asthma, bronchitis <b>or</b> other <b>lung</b> <b>problems</b> and health problems affecting other systems. In most cases, the diagnosis of asthma preceded the diagnosis of pneumonia. The community incidence of all causes of pneumonia is not well enumerated, either in adults or in children.

40|$|Approximately 12 million {{adults in}} the U.

Two-thirds of adults with cancer are now expected to live {{at least five years}} after being diagnosed. 1 Even among women with breast cancer, the five-year survival rates have improved dramatically. In 1975, 75. 0 percent of women were still alive five years after a diagnosis of breast cancer; in 2002, the fiveyear survival rate for breast cancer was 90. 6 percent. 3 However, a potential downside to increased longevity among cancer survivors are potential side effects of cancer treatment, resulting from chemotherapy, radiation or surgery.

40|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} (VT) is {{the third}} most common cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke. The most frequent clinical manifestation is thrombosis of the leg (deep venous thrombosis), which may embolize to the lungs (pulmonary embolism). The thrombus may disappear spontaneously or give raise to chronic leg <b>or</b> <b>lung</b> <b>problems,</b> which may have major impact on quality of life, and may even cause death. Numerous risk factors are known to {{increase the risk of}} venous thrombosis. Among these are hereditary defects in the coagulation system, hormonal changes (e. g., pregnancy, use of oestrogens), other diseases (e. g., malignancy), and physical factors (e. g., inactivity). The primary aim of this thesis was to study incidence, mortality, and risk factors for venous thrombosis. The studies are based on an endpoint register on venous thrombosis in Nord-Trøndelag County from 1995 to 2001 linked to the second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT 2) performed in 1995 - 1997. We identified 740 cases with a first venous thrombosis after six years of follow-up among all the residents in the county, and 515 of the cases were among those who participated in the HUNT 2 study. We found an overall incidence of venous thrombosis of 1. 43 per 1000 person-years in Nord-Trøndelag County. The incidence rate increased exponentially with increasing age, and was similar in men and women. The 30 -days case-fatality rate was two times higher after pulmonary embolism than after deep venous thrombosis. The risk of dying was highest in the first months after the thrombotic event, after which it gradually approached the mortality rate in the general population. Elevated anticardiolipin antibodies have been associated with a two-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis in presence of autoimmune disease, whereas in patients without autoimmune disease the results have been inconsistent. We found no association between venous thrombosis and elevated anticardiolipin antibody levels measured in blood samples drawn before the thrombotic event. Our results indicate that elevated anticardiolipin antibody levels are a result rather than a cause of venous thrombosis. Previous case-control studies in which blood samples were drawn after the thrombotic event have found that elevated levels of interleukin 6 and 8 may be associated with venous thrombosis. We studied the association between elevated levels of six inflammatory markers prior to the thrombotic event and found no association. The results indicated that elevated levels of cytokines are secondary to venous thrombosis and not a primary cause. Homocysteine has been considered as one of the risk factors for venous thrombosis. Most of the studies which have been performed, have measured homocysteine in blood sampled after the event, and thus could not rule out whether homocysteine was a cause or a result of the thrombosis. In this prospective study where blood was sampled before the thrombotic event, we found no clear association between elevated levels of homocysteine and VT, but high levels of homocysteine was associated with a two-fold increased risk of a first venous thrombosis in men. The MTHFR C 677 T genotype, which increases homocysteine levels, was not associated with VT.   dr. med. dr. med...|$|R
