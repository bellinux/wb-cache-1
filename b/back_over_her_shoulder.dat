60|$|She {{stopped as}} the word passed her lips, looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and started violently.|$|E
60|$|The girl threw a {{laughing}} look <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and vanished {{through the door}} into the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Miss Landini!" [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Erwin, looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "Is that you? Where in {{the world}} are you going?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Scatcherd, {{holding a}} vast counterpane in <b>her</b> arms, looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> and {{perceived}} that Frank {{was in the}} room. Down went the counterpane on the ground, and Frank soon {{found himself in the}} very position which that useful article had so lately filled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will save}} your Grace that unworthy trouble," [...] said the lady haughtily; and rising up, she flung <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> the veil which {{shrouded}} her, saying, {{at the same}} time, [...] "Look on me, my Lord Duke, and see if these be indeed the charms which have made on your Grace an impression so powerful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, so I've been told." [...] She had flung <b>her</b> wet veil <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and {{he thought}} she had never looked so adorably plain before; {{if she could have}} seen herself in a glass she would have found her whole face out of drawing. It seemed as if his {{thinking}} had put her in mind of them, and she said, [...] "Those immoral mirrors are shameful." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} her lead, and I saw her glance <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{at the young}} man, who seemed unaware, even, of her departure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, and Yarmouth," [...] Mrs. Flushing called <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "Put {{those things}} away and hang 'em {{in their right}} places, there's a good girl, or it fusses Mr. Flushin'." ...|$|E
60|$|Sally had as fast a horse {{as there}} was on the range; she made no weight in the saddle, and she could ride. From time to time she looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
60|$|But Roland's eyes found better {{employment}} {{than to make}} {{observations on}} the accommodations of the chamber; for this second female inhabitant of the mansion seemed something very different from any thing he had yet seen there. At his first entry, she had greeted with a silent and low obeisance the two aged matrons, then glancing her eyes towards Roland, she adjusted a veil which hung <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> so as to bring it <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face; an operation which she performed with much modesty, but without either affected haste or embarrassed timidity.|$|R
60|$|Limping Lucy steadied {{herself on}} her crutch and looked <b>back</b> at me <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And is {{this the}} way we meet!" [...] she exclaimed, turning {{suddenly}} upon him, and throwing her long black hair <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> There certainly was some beauty about her. Her eyes were large and bright, and <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> were well turned. She might have done as an artist's model for a Judith, but I doubt whether any man, looking well into her face, could think that she would do well as a wife. [...] "Oh, John, is it to be thus, after love such as ours?" [...] And she clasped her hands together, and stood before him.|$|R
6000|$|... "We want more, Brown," [...] {{said one}} of the ladies, glancing <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> as she poured out the last drop from her large jug; [...] "and more buns and bread, please." ...|$|E
60|$|He spoke {{sharply to}} the children, {{and told them}} to go in to their tea. Greatly surprised, for they had never heard their father speak sharply before, they went off, hand in hand, little Holly looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Drop in again," [...] he said, as he {{took her}} {{trembling}} hand.... When she had walked a little way she looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> to see him leaning idly against the post, gazing after her, and waving his hammer in friendly fashion.|$|E
60|$|The noise {{had brought}} Dejah Thoris {{to the door}} of her apartment, and there she stood {{throughout}} the conflict with Sola at <b>her</b> <b>back</b> peering <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> <b>Her</b> face was set and emotionless and I knew that she did not recognize me, nor did Sola.|$|R

40|$|A woman {{carrying}} {{a child on}} <b>her</b> <b>back</b> looks <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Behind <b>her,</b> a young man looks at the camera.; The back of the card has no handwriting.

6000|$|... "How {{lucky that}} {{we happen to}} have one with us!" [...] said Mrs Drew, looking <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> where her {{daughter}} stood, concealed from view by her ample person. [...] "Marion, dear, will you part with your rose-bud to a wounded soldier?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like Mr. Bridge, anyhow," [...] {{she called}} <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> [...] "for {{whatever}} {{he may not}} be he is certainly a well-bred gentleman," [...] which speech did not tend to raise Mr. Bridge in the estimation of the hard-fisted ranch foreman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{a little}} thing, Marius." [...] Her glance {{travelled}} <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> to the tall, limber fellow in leather jerkin and with cross-gartered legs who lounged a dozen steps behind them. [...] "Rid {{me of that}} ruffian's company," [...] said she.|$|E
60|$|With {{a strong}} effort he {{mastered}} himself. Peggy had mounted a few steps, {{and was looking}} <b>back</b> at him <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> He could read the meaning now in the grey eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Woods {{was asked}} to {{replicate}} the position she took to cause that accident. Seated at a desk, she reached far <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> left <b>shoulder</b> for a telephone as her foot applied pressure to the pedal controlling the transcription machine. Her posture during the demonstration, dubbed the [...] "Rose Mary Stretch", resulted in many political commentators questioning {{the validity of the}} explanation.|$|R
60|$|A {{young woman}} of rather low stature, and whose countenance might be termed very modest and {{pleasing}} in expression, though sun-burnt, somewhat freckled, and not possessing regular features, was ushered into the splendid library. She wore the tartan plaid of her country, adjusted so as partly {{to cover her}} head, and partly to fall <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> A quantity of fair hair, disposed with great simplicity and neatness, appeared {{in front of her}} round and good-humoured face, to which the solemnity of her errand, and her sense of the Duke's rank and importance, gave an appearance of deep awe, but not of slavish fear, or fluttered bashfulness. The rest of Jeanie's dress was in the style of Scottish maidens of her own class; but arranged with that scrupulous attention to neatness and cleanliness, which we often find united with that purity of mind, of which it is a natural emblem.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I {{shall not}} forbid you." [...] Mrs. Bowen rose {{and went to}} her writing-desk. [...] "But if you have fully made up your mind to this step, and {{are ready for the}} consequences, {{whatever}} they are----" [...] She stopped, before sitting down, and looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> at Imogene.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of the {{whirring}} thing behind him the animal cast an affrighted glance in its direction, and with a little squeal of terror redoubled its frantic efforts to escape. The girl, too, looked <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Her face was very white, but her eyes were steady and brave.|$|E
6000|$|But when I got amongst that bunch, there sat Ida in her buggy {{and nobody}} hurt, {{not even the}} horse or the vehicle. Ida was pale but serene. As I came tearing down, she smiled <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> at me and said, [...] "Well, we're alive yet, aren't we?" [...] A miracle had been performed--nothing else.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{stronger}} will conquered him at {{that last}} moment, as it had conquered him throughout. He took the candle and waited, following her eagerly with his eyes as she descended the stairs. The cold of the December night seemed to have {{found its way to}} her through the warmth of the house. She had put on a long, heavy black shawl, and had fastened it close <b>over</b> <b>her</b> breast. The plaited coronet in which she wore her hair seemed to have weighed too heavily on her head. She had untwisted it, and thrown it <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The old man looked at her flowing hair, as it lay red over the black shawl--at her supple, long-fingered hand, as it slid down the banisters--at the smooth, seductive grace of every movement that took her further and further away from him. [...] "The night will go quickly," [...] he said to himself, as she passed from his view; [...] "I shall dream of her till the morning comes!" ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{not sure}} whether--so brief was the moment!--he had held and kissed her cheek. His arms were empty now, and he {{caught a glimpse of}} her poised on the road above him amidst the quivering, sunlit leaves, looking <b>back</b> at him <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Lucretia Del Valle de Grady (or Lucretia de Grady Del Valle), ca. 1910 - 1940. She {{can be seen}} from the chest up. She has short dark curled hair and is wearing a fur around <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> She grins with her teeth showing as she looks <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> right <b>shoulder.</b> She is the wife of San Francisco politician Henry Francis Grady (1882 - 1957) who served as a U. S. Ambassador (1947 - 1951). Portrait by A. A. (?) Curtis...|$|R
6000|$|... "To add to my vexation, {{the door}} {{communicating}} with the other cellar, where the printing-presses were, flew open, and our young lady revolutionist appeared, a black silhouette in a close-fitting dress and a large hat, with the blaze of gas flaring in there at her <b>back.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> I perceived the arched eyebrows and the red necktie of her brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a curious}} {{experience}} the circus {{will be for}} you, Midgetina," [...] Fanny was murmuring softly, glancing <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> towards the tea-table. [...] "Personally, I believe the Signorina Angélique {{and the rest of}} it is only one of those horrible twisted up prodigies with all the bones out of place. Mightn't it, Mrs Monnerie, be a sort of shock, you know, for Miss M.? She's still a little pale and peaky." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, she's more {{sensible}} by half. When {{he used to}} write to her she'd creep up the lane and look <b>back</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and slide out the letter, and read a word and stand in thought looking at the hills and seeing none. Then the cuckoo would cry--away the letter would slip, and she'd start wi' fright at the mere bird, and have a red skin before the quickest man among ye could say, [...] "Blood rush up."' ...|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The Venus Kallipygos. Aphrodite Kallipygos ("Aphrodite of the Beautiful Buttocks"), {{is a type}} of nude female {{statue of}} the Hellenistic era. It depicts a {{partially}} draped woman raising her light peplos to uncover her hips and buttocks, and looking <b>back</b> and down <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> perhaps to evaluate them.|$|R
60|$|These {{last words}} were shot out not at her {{but at some}} target behind <b>her</b> <b>back.</b> Looking <b>over</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> she saw the bald head with black bunches of hair of the {{congested}} and devoted Franklin (he had his cap in his hand) gazing sentimentally from the saloon doorway with his lobster eyes. He was heard from the distance {{in a tone of}} injured innocence reporting that the berthing master was alongside and that he wanted to move the ship into the basin before the crew came on board.|$|R
