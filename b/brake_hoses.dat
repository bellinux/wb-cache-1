25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{safeguards}} that are usually taken to prevent this sort of accident happening. Railroads have strict government-approved procedures for testing the air brake systems when making up trains in a yard or picking up cars en route. These generally involve connecting the air <b>brake</b> <b>hoses,</b> charging up the brake system, setting the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are applied, and then releasing the brakes and manually inspecting the cars to ensure the brakes are released. Particular attention is usually paid to the rearmost car of the train, either by manual inspection or via an automated end-of-train device, to ensure that brake pipe continuity exists throughout the entire train. When brake pipe continuity exists throughout the train, failure of the brakes to apply or release on one or more cars is an indication that the cars' triple valves are malfunctioning. Depending on the location of the air test, the repair facilities available, and regulations governing the number of inoperative brakes permitted in a train, the car may be set out for repair or taken to the next terminal where it can be repaired.|$|E

50|$|The ER5 has a {{twin piston}} front disk brake and a rear drum brake. Unlike many modern motorcycles, with fixed caliper and {{floating}} disk, the ER5 has a fixed disk and floating caliper.

40|$|Testing {{facilities}} {{such as the}} TU Delft Vehicle Test Lab (VTL) {{are needed}} to provide necessary experimental data to validate and to compare the performance of several ABS controllers like the Feed-Forward Braking controller. Before testing ABS controllers with the VTL measurement system, {{it needs to be}} improved first. Earlier measurements reported in [11] showed a lack of developed braking torque due to decreased bandwidth of the measurement setup. This problem could be within the hydraulic brake line of the VTL measurement setup. Pressure dynamics results of the original situation show a significant decrease when increasing the actuating frequency. Differences in pressure dynamics are examined by replacing the original <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> with a stainless steel braided <b>brake</b> <b>hose.</b> Sinus wave excitation measurements show a relative small increase of the maximal reaching brake pressure with the design improvements situation. Random noise excitation measurements show increased bandwidth, compared to the frequency results reported in [4] and [11].

50|$|The {{chain brake}} was soon {{superseded}} by air operated or vacuum operated brakes. These <b>brakes</b> used <b>hoses</b> connecting all the wagons of a train, so the driver could apply or release the brakes {{with a single}} valve in the locomotive.|$|R
50|$|From the {{pressure}} differential valve, brake tubing carries {{the pressure}} to the brake units at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> {{from the end of the}} steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel brake tubing to flex invites metal fatigue and, ultimately, brake failure. A common upgrade is to replace the standard rubber hoses with a set which are externally reinforced with braided stainless-steel wires; these have negligible expansion under pressure and can give a firmer feel to the brake pedal with less pedal travel for a given braking effort.|$|R
