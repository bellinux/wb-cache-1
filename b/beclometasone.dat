40|$|Background <b>Beclometasone</b> dipropionate is an inhaled {{corticosteroid}} (ICS) available in both extrafine and larger-particle hydrofluoroalkane formulations. Extrafine <b>beclometasone</b> has greater small airway distribution and inhalation technique tolerance than larger-particle beclometasone; therefore, its use {{may be associated}} with improved asthma outcomes at population levels. The study objective was to compare real-life effectiveness of extrafine and larger-particle <b>beclometasone.</b> Methods Retrospective matched cohort study including primary care patients with asthma (ages 12 – 60 and non-smokers 61 – 80 years) prescribed extrafine or larger-particle <b>beclometasone</b> by metered-dose inhaler. We studied patients receiving their first ICS (initiation population, n = 11, 289) or switched from another ICS without dose change (switch population, n = 19, 065). The extrafine and larger-particle <b>beclometasone</b> cohorts were matched in each population for demographic and database measures of asthma control during a baseline year; and endpoints assessed during 1 outcome year were adjusted for residual confounding factors. Results The odds of no loss of asthma control (no asthma-related hospital attendance, consultation for lower respiratory tract infection, or oral corticosteroids) were significantly higher in the extrafine <b>beclometasone</b> cohorts of both initiation population (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1. 12; 95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 23) and switch population (aOR 1. 10; 95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 19). The odds of better adherence to ICS therapy were also significantly higher in both extrafine <b>beclometasone</b> cohorts (initiation population, aOR 1. 64; 95 % CI 1. 52 – 1. 75 and switch population, aOR 1. 35; 95 % CI 1. 27 – 1. 43).

DESIGN: Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. SETTING: Paediatric departments of 19 Dutch clinical centres. PARTICIPANTS: 243 previously healthy infants (126 boys, 117 girls) aged less than 13 months and admitted to hospital with respiratory syncytial virus infection. INTERVENTIONS: 200 mug extra fine hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) <b>beclometasone</b> dipropionate twice daily or matched placebo administered by a pressurised metered dose inhaler and a spacer {{during the first three}} months after hospital admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the number of days with wheeze in the year after the three month intervention period. RESULTS: Of the 243 eligible infants, 119 were randomised to receive <b>beclometasone</b> and 124 to receive placebo. No significant difference was found in the number of days with wheeze between the two groups (total days, 1761 / 33 568 in the <b>beclometasone</b> group v 2301 / 36 556 in the placebo group, P= 0. 31) and the proportion of infants with wheeze did not differ between the groups (61 % in the <b>beclometasone</b> group v 62 % in the placebo group, P= 0. 90).

We previously reported that treatment with atorvastatin improved asthma symptoms in smokers with asthma {{in the absence of a}} change in the concentration of a selection of sputum inflammatory mediators. Objective To determine the effects of atorvastatin alone and in combination with inhaled corticosteroid on a range of sputum cytokines, chemokines and growth factors implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma, and their association with asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) and/or asthma quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ) scores. Methods Sputum samples were analysed from a sub-group of 39 smokers with mild to moderate asthma recruited to a randomised controlled trial comparing atorvastatin (40  mg/day) versus placebo for four weeks, followed by inhaled <b>beclometasone</b> (400  μg/day) for a further four weeks. Induced sputum supernatant fluid was analysed (Luminex or biochemical analyses) for concentrations of 35 mediators. Results Sputum mediator concentrations were not reduced by inhaled <b>beclometasone</b> alone. Atorvastatin significantly reduced sputum concentrations of CCL 7, IL- 12 p 70, sCD 40 L, FGF- 2, CCL 4, TGF-α and MMP- 8 compared with placebo and, when combined with inhaled <b>beclometasone,</b> reduced sputum concentrations of MMP- 8, IL- 1 β, IL- 10, MMP- 9, sCD 40 L, FGF- 2, IL- 7, G-CSF and CCL 7 compared to ICS alone. Improvements in ACQ and/or AQLQ scores with atorvastatin and ICS were associated with decreases in G-CSF, IL- 7, CCL 2 and CXCL 8. Conclusion Short-term treatment with atorvastatin alone or in combination with inhaled <b>beclometasone</b> reduces several sputum cytokines, chemokines and growth factors concentrations unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroids alone, in smokers with asthma. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The immune {{modulating}} {{properties of}} statins may benefit smokers with asthma. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} short-term treatment with atorvastatin improves lung function or indices of asthma control in smokers with asthma. Methods Seventy one smokers with mild to moderate asthma were recruited to a randomized double-blind parallel group trial comparing treatment with atorvastatin (40 mg per day) versus placebo for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks treatment inhaled <b>beclometasone</b> (400 μg per day) was added to both treatment arms for a further 4 weeks. The primary outcome was morning peak expiratory flow after 4 weeks treatment. Secondary outcome measures included indices of asthma control and airway inflammation. Results At 4 weeks, there was no improvement in the atorvastatin group compared to the placebo group in morning peak expiratory flow [- 10. 67 L/min, 95 % CI - 38. 70 to 17. 37, p = 0. 449], {{but there was an}} improvement with atorvastatin in asthma quality of life score [0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 87 p = 0. 005].

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cigarette smokers {{with asthma}} are {{insensitive}} to the therapeutic effects of corticosteroids. It is not known whether this insensitivity to corticosteroids in smokers affects tissue sites beyond the airways. A total of 75 asthmatic subjects (39 smokers) and 78 healthy controls (30 smokers) were recruited to an observational study. The cutaneous and peripheral blood lymphocyte responses to corticosteroids were measured. The cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to topical <b>beclometasone</b> was measured by applying different concentrations of <b>beclometasone</b> solutions to the skin in a random double-blind manner. The degree of blanching at each concentration was graded after 18 h. The sensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes to corticosteroids was assessed by measuring the suppressive effect of dexamethasone on lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Total mean¡SD cutaneous vasoconstrictor response score to <b>beclometasone</b> was reduced in smokers with asthma to 5. 39 ¡ 3. 58 versus 7. 26 ¡ 3. 05 in never-smokers with asthma; and in all smokers to 6. 47 ¡ 3. 33 versus 7. 86 ¡ 2. 81 in all never-smokers. The sensitivity to corticosteroids of lymphocytes stimulated by PHA was similar between groups. In conclusion, smokers with asthma have an impaired cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to topical corticosteroids compared with never-smokers with asthma.

40|$|Rationale: Active {{smoking in}} asthma is {{associated}} with worsening of symptoms, accelerated decline in lung function, and impaired response to corticosteroids. Objectives: To examine the short-term effects of smoking cessation on lung function, airway inflammation, and corticosteroid responsiveness in smokers with asthma. Methods and Measurements: Smokers with asthma were given the option to quit or continue smoking. Both groups underwent spirometry and induced sputum at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 wk. Cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to topical <b>beclometasone,</b> airway response to oral prednisolone, and sensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes to corticosteroids were measured before smoking cessation and at 6 wk. Main Results: Of 32 subjects recruited, 11 opted to continue smoking (smoking control group). Of 21 subjects who opted for smoking cessation, 10 quit smoking for 6 wk (quit group). In the comparison of quitters with smokers at 6 wk, the mean (confidence interval [CI]) difference in FEV 1 was 407 ml (21, 793), p = 0. 040, {{and the proportion of}} sputum neutrophils was reduced by 29 (51, 8), p = 0. 039.

There was no change in airway corticosteroid responses after smoking cessation. Conclusions: By 6 wk after smoking cessation, subjects who quit smoking had achieved considerable improvement in lung function and a fall in sputum neutrophil count compared with subjects who continued to smoke.

Subjects provided urine samples at 0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 24 hours post study dose. Urinary concentrations of BDP and its metabolites, 17 -beclometasone monopropionate (BMP) and <b>beclometasone</b> (BOH) were measured. No BDP, BMP, or BOH was detected in any samples post OralC dosing. Post oral dosing, no BDP was detected in any of the urine samples and no BMP or BOH was excreted in the first 30 minutes. Significantly more (p< 0. 001) BDP, BMP and BOH was excreted in the first 30 minutes and cumulative 24 urinary excretions post Qvar and Clenil compared to Oral. Using 30 minute urinary excretion the mean ratio (90 % confidence interval) for Qvar compared to Clenil was 231. 4 (209. 6, 255. 7). The results confirm that the relative lung and systemic bioavailability can be identified from urinary excretion of BDP and its metabolites over the first 30 minutes and 24 hours respectively. The 2 -fold difference between Qvar and Clenil is consistent with related clinical and pharmacokinetic studies. The low inter and intra-subject variability of the study confirms the reproducibility of this method. When compared to the in-vitro aerodynamics characteristics of the emitted dose, using standard compendial methods, the in-vivo indices showed a relationship to the fine particle dose (FPD) and the emitted dose (ED), respectively. The application of this urinary pharmacokinetic method was demonstrated in further studies to compare the effect of different spacers and different washing methods on the in-vivo drug delivery post inhalation from Clenil and Qvar inhalers in healthy volunteers. In addition, the in-vitro aerodynamic particle size distribution of the same inhalation methods has been investigated using the Andersen Cascade Impactor according to the standard compendial methodology. Urinary excretion, using 24 hour excretion, revealed that relative bioavailability to the body was reduced with spacers for both inhalers. There was no increase in the relative lung bioavailability when Qvar was used with spacers. When Clenil was attached to a spacer (either AeroChamber or Volumatic) the relative lung bioavailability was significantly greater only if the spacers were not rinsed after washing with detergents. Consistent with the above study there were correlations between the in-vivo urinary indices and the in-vitro characteristics of the emitted dose. The thesis highlights the extension of the urinary pharmacokinetic method to inhaled <b>beclometasone</b> dipropionate and provides further evidence of in-vitro in-vivo correlations between the urinary methodology and the aerodynamic characteristics of the emitted dose.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Combinations of a long-acting beta(2) -agonist (LABA) and an inhaled {{corticosteroid}} (ICS) are effective and safe options in asthma management. OBJECTIVE: To review available {{data on a}} recently developed combination of <b>beclometasone</b> dipropionate (BDP) and formoterol (F) given via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler. METHODS: Published data on preclinical and clinical studies were reviewed. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: In the treatment of asthma, BDP/F was shown {{to be at least}} as effective and well-tolerated as other available combinations of ICS and LABA with the advantage of a better cost effectiveness, and more effective in improving asthma control than BDP and formoterol given via separate inhalers. The extra-fine BDP/F combination appears to be a valuable therapeutic option in the management of asthma...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough popular, the {{pressurized}} {{metered dose inhaler}} generates coarse, {{fast moving}} clouds so that the fraction reaching the lung is small. These shortcomings can be redressed by Modulite® which permutes the following variables: the non-volatile components of a solution formula, the actuator orifice geometry, {{the volume of the}} metered solution and the vapour pressure of the propel lants. This permits the design of aerosols with chosen particle size and plume speed. This facilitates co-ordination of dose generation with inspiration, reduces oropharyngeal deposition and provides a mechanism for targeting drug delivery to different parts of the Iung. These principles are exemplified by designing an HFA-propelled <b>beclometasone</b> dipropionate product which closely matches existing products which use chlorofluorocarbons...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{particle}} size of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) may affect airway drug deposition and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To compare {{the effectiveness of}} extrafine ICSs (mass median aerodynamic diameter, < 2 μm) versus fine-particle ICSs administered as ICS monotherapy or ICS-long-acting β-agonist combination therapy by conducting a meta-analysis of observational real-life asthma studies to estimate the treatment effect of extrafine ICSs. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were reviewed for asthma observational comparative effectiveness studies from January 2004 to June 2016. Studies were included if they reported odds and relative risk ratios and met all inclusion criteria (Respiratory Effectiveness Group/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology quality standards, comparison of extrafine ICSs with same or different ICS molecule, ≥ 12 -month follow-up). End-point data (asthma control, exacerbations, prescribed ICS dose) were pooled. Random-effects meta-analysis modeling was used. The study protocol is published in the PROSPERO register CRD 42016039137. RESULTS: Seven studies with 33, 453 subjects aged 5 to 80 years met eligibility criteria for inclusion. Six studies used extrafine <b>beclometasone</b> propionate and 1 study used both extrafine <b>beclometasone</b> propionate and extrafine ciclesonide as comparators with fine-particle ICSs. The overall odds of achieving asthma control were significantly higher for extrafine ICSs compared with fine-particle ICSs (odds ratio, 1. 34; 95 % CI, 1. 22 - 1. 46). Overall exacerbation rate ratios (0. 84; 95 % CI, 0. 73 - 0. 97) and ICS dose (weighted mean difference, - 170 μg; 95 % CI, - 222 to - 118 μg) were significantly lower for extrafine ICSs compared with fine-particle ICSs. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that extrafine ICSs have significantly higher odds of achieving asthma control with lower exacerbation rates at significantly lower prescribed doses than fine-particle ICSs...|$|E
