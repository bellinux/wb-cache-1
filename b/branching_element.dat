The present study tries to determine the minimal epitope in GBSIIIPS, using both a panel of anti-Pn 14 PS mouse sera and sera of humans vaccinated with either Pn 14 PS or GBSIIIPS. Type-specific Pn 14 PS antibodies that recognize the branched structure of Pn 14 PS have a low affinity for the native GBSIIIPS. Desialylation of GBSIIIPS results in dramatically higher affinity of anti-Pn 14 PS antibodies. Epitope specific anti-Pn 14 PS mouse antibodies and human sera of PCV 7 vaccinees only recognized structures with the <b>branching</b> <b>element</b> -Glc-(Gal-) GlcNAc-, in particular -Gal-Glc-(Gal-) GlcNAc- in Pn 14 PS.

Then, based on this information, and along with organ surface curvature information extracted from the volume data, a 3 D scalar field is generated. This field allows a 3 D reconstruction of the organ: as an iso-surface model, using a marching cubes algorithm; or as a 3 D mesh, using a grid "immersion" technique, the field value being used as the outside/inside test.
