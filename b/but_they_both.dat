5|$|The country {{fell into}} chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack.

5|$|In the {{unstable}} period during {{and following the}} 1889 coup in Brazil, which deposed Emperor Dom PedroII, and the 1893–94 navy revolt, the Brazilian Navy found itself unable to care for its own ships, let alone acquire new vessels.
