50|$|This {{area was}} {{originally}} a transition zone between pine forest, hardwood forest, and oak savanna. These habitats were disrupted by logging and farming. Today {{the park is}} a mix of second-growth forest and meadow. As the river tends to overflow its banks in spring, inundation-tolerant species like silver maple and basswood dominate the floodplain. Wetlands are scattered throughout the park. Berries are prevalent along the trails, as are wild roses. Each month throughout spring and summer brings different wildflowers in bloom. Some common spring flowers include wild columbine (Aquilegia canadensis), wild geranium (Geranium maculatum), and Carolina puccoon (Lithospermum caroliniense). During the summer, visitors can see black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta), <b>butterfly</b> <b>milkweed</b> (Asclepias tuberosa), and rough blazing star (Liatris aspera). Fall brings its own mix of wildflowers, including many asters and goldenrods. There is also a variety of native grasses, including big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans).|$|E
5000|$|Nectar {{availability}} {{is likely}} to influence Karner blue butterfly abundance. In a right-of-way in west-central Wisconsin, the frequency that Karner blue butterflies stayed in an area between recaptures was significantly (p<0.05) positively related to percent cover of nectar flowers such as Canadian horseweed (Conyza canadensis var. canadensis) and spotted beebalm (Monarda punctata). Preliminary results from a study in southeastern Minnesota suggest that openings where Karner blue butterflies were detected tended to have more flowering nectar species. In Michigan, more Karner blue butterflies were observed on sites with more nectaring plants, especially <b>butterfly</b> <b>milkweed</b> (Asclepias tuberosa). As discussed in Canopy cover, nectar species increase in open habitats. For instance, at Fort McCoy in west-central Wisconsin, all the nectar species listed for Karner blue butterflies require either full or partial sun. In addition, treatments such as cutting with or without herbicides, herbicide application alone, or mowing at varying intervals resulted in a significant (p<0.01) {{increase in the number}} and cover of nectar species. See section [...] "Food habits" [...] for species that Karner blue butterflies use as nectar sources.|$|E

40|$|Questions {{concerning}} wildflower usage on Indiana highway rights-of-way were investigated. Native prairie wildflower {{seed quality}} {{was found to}} be highly variable among supply companies, species, and years. Less variability was found among “garden” wildflower species and suppliers. 	Direct seeding {{was found to be}} successful with six species of native prairie forbs: <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Milkweed</b> Asclepiads tuberose, Wild Bergamot Monarda fistulosa, New England Aster Aster novae-angliae, Pale-purple Coneflower Echinacea pallida, Gray-headed Coneflower Ratibido pinnota, Ironweed Vernonia fasciculosa. 	Five species of “garden” wildflowers performed well: Common Cosmos Cosmos bipinnatus, Yellow Cosmos Cosmos sulphureus, Cornflower Centaurea cyanus, Goldenwave Coreopsis sincioria, Black-eyed Susan Rudbeckia hiria. Significant variation was found for species establishment success with respect to soil type. 	Seeding transplanting was found to be a successful method for establishment of forb species, especially those that are difficult to establish by direct seeding. Eight-inch deep seeding tubes increased plant survival compared to plants produced in five inch deep tubes. Use of water-holding polymers in the growing medium, or inoculation with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi did not improve forb transplant survival. YAM inoculation did result in larger plants after the first growing season. 	The cost of establishment and management of wildflowers varied with the type and management strategy. Wildflowers were found to be cost-effective when compared to the current grass monoculture vegetation strategy used by INDOT. “Garden” wildflowers were more costly initially, but became cost effective when low, long-term management costs were factored into the analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{population}} of monarch butterflies {{east of the}} Rocky Mountains has experienced a significant decline over the past 20 yr. In order to increase monarch numbers in the breeding range, habitat restoration that includes planting milkweed plants is essential. Milkweeds in the genus Asclepias and Cynanchum are the only host plants for larval monarch butterflies in North America, but larval performance and survival across nine milkweeds native to the Midwest is not well documented. We examined development and survival of monarchs from first-instar larval stages to adulthood on nine milkweed species native to Iowa. The milkweeds included Asclepias exaltata (poke milkweed) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae), Asclepias hirtella (tall green milkweed) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae), Asclepias incarnata (swamp milkweed) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae), Asclepias speciosa (showy milkweed) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae), Asclepias sullivantii (prairie milkweed) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae), Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae), Asclepias tuberosa (<b>butterfly</b> <b>milkweed)</b> (Gentianales: Apocynaceae), Asclepias verticillata (whorled milkweed) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae), and Cynanchum laeve (honey vine milkweed) (Gentianales: Apocynaceae). In greenhouse experiments, fewer larvae that fed on Asclepias hirtella and Asclepias sullivantii reached adulthood compared with larvae that fed on the other milkweed species. Monarch pupal width and adult dry mass differed among milkweeds, but larval duration (days), pupal duration (days), pupal mass, pupal length, and adult wet mass were not significantly different. Both the absolute and relative adult lipids were different among milkweed treatments; these differences are not fully explained by differences in adult dry mass. Monarch butterflies can survive on all nine milkweed species, but the expected survival probability varied from 30 to 75 % among the nine milkweed species...|$|E
40|$|Vincetoxicum rossicum (pale swallow-wort, PSW) and V. nigrum (black swallow-wort, BSW) are {{perennial}} herbaceous vines {{native to}} Europe {{that have become}} invasive throughout New York, neighboring regions of Canada, and the northeastern US. Introduced over a century ago, the two species have spread rapidly in recent decades. Established swallow-wort plants, with root-to-shoot biomass ratios of 6 : 1 {{and the ability to}} produce thousands of seedlings each season, are very difficult to control effectively using conventional chemical or cultural methods. Furthermore, swallow-worts are adept at modifying invaded habitats, favorably altering fungal mycorrhizal communities and displacing endemic flora and fauna. Compared with other serious invasive plant species, relatively {{little is known about the}} biological and ecological attributes that allow swallow-worts to be successful invaders. The research presented in this thesis seeks to address several important questions related to their invasiveness, namely their allelopathic potential, and the magnitude of genetic and morphological variation of populations found in several regions of New York differing in soil type and climate. There have been reports in the literature indicating that these two swallow-worts are allelopathic and subsequently better able to out-compete and displace native flora. In this study, competition assays in agar media using seedlings demonstrated that SW root exudates - and particularly those of PSW - can cause significant root length reductions (e. g. 40 % for <b>butterfly</b> <b>milkweed)</b> and germination rate decreases (e. g. 30 % for lettuce) of indicator species. Bioassays using dried, field-collected tissue debris in a soil:sand growing media demonstrated that leachates from SW leaf tissues caused a negative effect on the growth of indicator plants: 40 % and 50 % reductions from BSW and PSW tissues, respectively. There was a significant dose response, with 1 g of tissues resulting in significantly (P < 0. 05) greater negative effects than 0. 5 g of tissue. Furthermore, tissue leachates of the two species were self-inhibitory. BSW tissues decreased root growth (50 %) of PSW indicators, but PSW tissues stimulated both root growth (38 %) and germination (43 %) of BSW indicator plants. A stimulation rather than inhibition of seedling growth was also observed for one of seven indicators (lettuce) in the agar root exudates experiment. The allelopathic capacity of the swallow-wort species was not significantly greater than that of a related non-invasive native species (common milkweed). In addition to characterizing genetic diversity levels in introduced swallow-wort populations, we sought to identify whether genotype or environment (i. e. soil and climate) best explained the morphological variations observed in swallow-wort populations in New York. We found that the two species are monophyletic, but that intra-specific genetic similarity was high (mean = 0. 79; Nei & Li's coefficient of genetic similarity). Genetic diversity did not explain morphological patterns in swallow-wort populations. Rather, adaptive morphological traits of invasive swallow-worts were correlated with soil pH (plant height: B 1 = - 0. 67, r^ 2 = 0. 5, P < 0. 05) and precipitation levels (plant height: B 1 = 0. 51, r^ 2 = 0. 52, P < 0. 0037; leaf shape: B 1 = 0. 55, r^ 2 = 0. 52, P < 0. 05). Also, in comparison with sites invaded by BSW, sites with PSW infestations were characterized by significantly (P < 0. 05) higher soil pH (13 %), Ca (475 %), and Al (369 %) levels. The substantial inhibitory effects of swallow-wort tissue leachates are likely to have profound implications for management and restoration of invaded sites. However, our results suggest allelopathy is not a dominant factor explaining the invasiveness of the two species. Given that intra-specific genetic diversity of swallow-wort populations was lower than expected, the role of plant acclimation to environment in explaining swallow-wort invasion requires further study...|$|E
