5|$|Traditionally it is Jean-Baptiste Say who is {{credited}} for coining {{the word and}} advancing {{the concept of the}} entrepreneur, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was Cantillon who first introduced the term in Essai. Cantillon divided society into two principal classes—fixed income wage-earners and non-fixed income earners. Entrepreneurs, according to Cantillon, are non-fixed income earners who pay known costs of production but earn uncertain incomes, due to the speculative nature of pandering to an unknown demand for their product. Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty—the topic was not revisited until the 20th century, by Ludwig von Mises, Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes, among others. Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw the entrepreneur as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that the entrepreneur brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.|$|E
5|$|Amazing {{began as}} a bedsheet format {{magazine}} and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue Amazing became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a half-inch taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above {{appears to be in}} error for the period from 1979 to 1983, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> is given correctly in the table.

25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{conservation}} hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if {{the stakes are}} high enough.

Given the value and importance of the capacity for self-control, it would be dangerous for a person to lose that capacity completely, and so ego depletion effects may occur because people start conserving their remaining strength.

25|$|Heinkel, {{having had}} the He 112 {{rejected}} {{in the design}} competition of 1936, designed and built the He 100. On 6 June 1938, the He 100 V3, flown by Ernst Udet, captured the record with a speed of 634.7km/h (394.4mph). On 30 March 1939, test pilot Hans Dieterle surpassed that record, reaching 746.61km/h (463.92mph) with the He 100 V8. Messerschmitt, however, soon regained the lead when, on 26 April 1939, Flugkapitän Fritz Wendel, flying the Me 209 V1, set a new record of 755.14km/h (469.22mph). For propaganda purposes, the machine was called the Me 109R, suggesting {{it was just another}} variant of the standard fighter, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was a racing aircraft having little in common with the Bf 109.

25|$|The {{plan was}} for 137th Brigade {{to capture the}} {{crossings}} and advance {{as far as the}} ‘Brown Line’, after which 138th and 139th brigades would pass through and continue to the ‘Yellow’ and ‘Green Lines’. At 05.50 the Staffords set off, with almost a mile to go before they reached the canal, following a fast-moving rolling barrage of field guns and machine-guns firing overhead. The canal defences had mostly been destroyed by the heavy artillery, which maintained fire until the last possible moment. The Staffords quickly stormed the outposts and the western trench line, and reached the canal bank on time, with few casualties, and having already taken 120 prisoners. There were 1000 German dead in the trenches, mainly from MG bullets. German reports after the battle complained that their ‘SOS barrage’ was late, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> came down only five minutes after Zero – indiscriminately on British and Germans alike – yet the Staffords were advancing faster than anyone had predicted. The leading parties went over the canal with their improvised kit and by a single plank bridge left by the Germans. The mist protected the attackers from enfilade fire by MGs along the canal, and they seized the Bellenglise tunnel galleries, trapping hundreds of Germans inside.|$|E

Stein then invited Real Madrid for a {{friendly}} game in Edinburgh, which Hibernian won 2–0 {{in front of a}} crowd of 32,000, further boosting his prestige. Wolves asked Stein if he wanted to replace Stan Cullis as their manager. Stein then approached Celtic chairman Bob Kelly, ostensibly to ask his advice about the Wolves job, but in the hope that he would be offered the Celtic manager's post. Kelly first offered Stein the position of assistant manager (to Sean Fallon), which Stein rejected. Kelly then offered Stein the chance to be joint manager with Fallon, but this was also rejected by Stein, who insisted on full control and suggested he would take the Wolves job instead. Billy McNeill believed that Kelly's initial reluctance was due to Stein's religion. Kelly eventually agreed to offer Stein full powers over team selection. Hibs tried to convince Stein to stay, even attempting to persuade his wife Jean, but becoming Celtic manager had been his long-held ambition. While Stein was still Hibs manager, he arranged for Celtic to sign Bertie Auld from Birmingham City and allowed Hibs goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson to join Celtic. Some people claimed with hindsight that he had deliberately allowed Simpson to join Celtic before moving himself, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was due to a wage dispute.|$|E

The party had been the regime’s electoral vehicle, and many of those who participated in the demonstrations viewed it as an artificially created and thoroughly corrupt organisation that had helped the regime to maintain a pseudo-democratic façade. Now that Suharto had resigned, many activists hoped Golkar would also disappear from the political stage. But despite widespread public anger and demands for its disbandment, the party has proven remarkably resilient. ‘Golkar is like a zombie,’ says a former high-ranking party member who left the party in 1998. ‘You think <b>it’s</b> dead <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it’s</b> always there. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Araúz, {{determined}} {{to bring the}} monarchy back, was steering between the Carlists and the Alfonsists. In August 1943 along with Manuel Fal Conde {{and a number of}} other Carlist leaders he signed a letter to Franco, demanding that fascistoid features of the regime are replaced with Traditionalist solutions; the response was his detention and a month spent behind bars in the Dirección General de Seguridad prison. Later the same year he conferred with the Alfonsinos concerning their policy towards Francoism. He supported a manifesto to be issued by their claimant Don Juan, a document intended to dissociate the pretender from Franco; in minority, he fruitlessly advocated a bold action. In 1944 he supported vague plans for a joint monarchist coup against Franco. In 1946 together with conde Rodezno he visited Don Juan in Estoril, sounding him on a would-be dynastical agreement between himself and the Carlist regent-claimant Don Javier. Formally the mission did not breach the rules of Carlist regency, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was bordering disloyalty to Don Javier. In 1957 together with Arellano he sought Carlist adhesions to the Juanista project and emerged among leaders of the initiative; eventually, both Araúz de Robles brothers, José Maria and Carlos, joined a large fraction of Carlists who recognized Don Juan as the legitimate Carlist pretender. The Acto de Estoril declaration marked his formal break with mainstream Carlism. He was expulsed from Comunión and faced anger of the javierista crowd during the Carlist Montejurra amassment of the following year.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July the Germans {{began their}} last large 1918 offensive, attacking Rheims in the Second Battle of the Marne. Soon their advance faltered {{and they found}} {{themselves}} in a very vulnerable situation, with overextended supply lines and exhausted troops lacking well-entrenched positions. On 18 July French and American divisions, cooperating with a large number of tanks, started a major offensive, the Battle of Soissons, in which {{for the first time since}} 1914 Entente forces on the Western Front succeeded in making substantial progress, reducing the entire German salient created in the Third Battle of the Aisne. In the operation three Schneider Groupements (I, III and IV) participated with 123 vehicles, the second largest deployment of the type during the war. The battle was a strategic disaster for the Germans, leading to the disintegration of a large part of their forces and initiating a period of almost continuous retreats. Although now at last the conditions were favourable to fulfil the offensive role for which they had been created, the Schneider tanks could not be of much assistance to the itself also decimated French infantry. By 1 August 1918 the number of operational Schneider CA tanks had dropped to fifty. As production was halted that month, losses could not be replaced, whereas the intensified fighting resulted in a much-increased wear. As a consequence, effective levels remained low: forty vehicles on 1 September, sixty on 1 October, fifty-one on 1 November. Accordingly, in subsequent operations the Schneiders never again equalled the numbers reached in July. On 16 August three groups with thirty-two tanks attacked near Tilloloy; on 20 August one group of twelve participated in actions near Nampcel. On 12 September Groupement IV could muster twenty-four tanks to support the Americans in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. From 26 September during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive Groupement IV continued to support the Americans with about twenty-two tanks, and Groupements I and III supported the French Fourth Army with thirty-four vehicles. During October most Schneider units were recuperating and German intelligence assumed the type had now been completely phased out, replaced by the newer and more effective Renault FT tanks, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was planned to again deploy about fifty Schneiders in a large offensive in Lorraine to begin on 11 November. That day however, the First World War ended as the Armistice with Germany was concluded. During the 1918 battles, Schneider tanks engaged 473 enemy targets. In the war, in total 308 Schneider tanks had been lost, 86 in 1917 and 222 in 1918: 301 by enemy artillery fire, three by mines, three by antitank rifle fire and one by unknown causes.|$|E
