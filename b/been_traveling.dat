5|$|The first {{plans for}} an airport serving Notodden were {{launched}} in 1954 by Reidar Hedwig-Dahl, director of the tourist office. In late 1954 or early 1955, he held a meeting with Ludvig G. Braathen, owner of Braathens SAFE, and representatives for his airline. They saw Notodden as a possible gateway to Telemark and Braathen promised to start flying to an airport serving Notodden, should one be built. At the time, Braathen had started flying to several smaller airports in Norway using a fleet of de Havilland Heron aircraft. Braathen had <b>been</b> <b>traveling</b> around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted more but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Røros.|$|E

5|$|Governor Johnson {{was killed}} while {{participating}} in the Battle of Shiloh. Following the resolutions of the Russellville Convention, the provisional Confederate government's ten legislative councillors selected Hawes to succeed Johnson as governor. (Under these provisions, the councillors could not select one of their own.) He joined the leaderless and nomadic shadow government, which had <b>been</b> <b>traveling</b> with the Army of Tennessee, in Corinth, Mississippi, and took {{the oath of office}} on May 31. The army's leader, General Braxton Bragg, had been considering an invasion of Kentucky. On August 27, Hawes was dispatched to Richmond, Virginia to favorably recommend this action to President Jefferson Davis, but Davis was non-committal. Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith proceeded with the invasion nonetheless, while the leaders of Kentucky's Confederate government remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Hawes's return. They departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2.|$|E
5|$|The rains from Nangka caused rivers {{to exceed}} their banks. In Tokushima Prefecture, the Naka River flooded {{to the second}} story of nearby school buildings. Flooding {{stranded}} 1,600passengers on a train for four hours, which had <b>been</b> <b>traveling</b> from Tsuruga, Fukui to Himeji, Hyōgo. Across Japan, strong waves and high winds killed over 11,000bluefin tuna on a fish farm in Kushimoto, accounting for ¥1.29billion ($10.4million) in losses. About 15,000people lost power across the country. The storm damaged 30homes and flooded another 190, and also damaged farming equipment. There were 55injuries and two deaths related to the typhoon, including an elderly man who drowned after falling into a ditch.

25|$|A {{persistent}} {{strain of}} Gulf Coast cholera, 01, {{has been found}} in the brackish waters of marshes in Louisiana and Texas in the United States, leading to a situation of possible transmission by shipments of seafood from those areas {{to other parts of the}} country.

25|$|Todd filed a {{suit for}} libel in Maryland against both Garrison and Lundy; {{he thought to}} gain support from pro-slavery courts. The state of Maryland also brought {{criminal}} charges against Garrison, quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of $50 and court costs.

25|$|The {{initiative}} {{to build an}} airport in Røros was taken {{by a group of}} individuals in 1954, with Olav Bergersen as the most enthusiastic. They contacted Braathens SAFE and asked if they were interested in operating flights out of the town. The airline had recently gained the right to fly between Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Trondheim Airport, Værnes, and was therefore asked if they would be interested in making a stop-over for some of their services in Røros. Ludvig G. Braathen had <b>been</b> <b>traveling</b> around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted more but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning.

However, the eastbound Stockholm {{had yet to}} enter what was apparently {{the edge of a}} fog bank and was seemingly unaware of it and the movement of the other ship hidden in it. The waters of the North Atlantic south of Nantucket Island are frequently the site of intermittent fog as the cold Labrador Current encounters the Gulf Stream.|$|E

By 1727, she and Carondawana were living at Otstonwakin, a village also known as Otstuagy or French Town. The site of previous Native American villages, Otstonwakin was located along the Great Shamokin Path, at the important confluence of Loyalsock Creek with the West Branch Susquehanna River, {{on the west bank}} of the river.
