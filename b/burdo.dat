50|$|Originally {{designated}} a , DE-717, <b>Burdo</b> was re-{{designated a}}s APD-133, a fast transport, on 17 July 1944, even before being laid {{down at the}} Defoe Shipbuilding Company, in Bay City, Michigan. She was launched on 25 November 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Ida J. Botts, mother of Private <b>Burdo.</b> Builders trials before her pre-commissioning cruise were done in Lake Huron.|$|E
50|$|<b>Burdo</b> {{joined the}} Pacific Fleet in August 1945, and was {{assigned}} to serve with the Pacific Underwater Demolition Flotilla. With Underwater Demolition Team 13 (UDT-13) embarked, she sailed for Pearl Harbor on 16 August, where she {{was assigned to}} an amphibious group. On 1 September, she departed for Sasebo, Japan. At Sasebo, UDT-13 assisted in clearing channels prior to landing the occupation forces on 21 September 1945. Shortly afterwards, <b>Burdo</b> departed for San Diego via Okinawa, Guam, and Pearl Harbor. At San Diego, UDT-13 was disembarked, and after one shuttle trip to Pearl Harbor, <b>Burdo</b> sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, transiting the Panama Canal on Thanksgiving Day 1945.|$|E

50|$|Roberts {{was born}} in a {{hospital}} in Albany, New York and grew up in nearby Saratoga Springs, New York. Her parents, Delmer Hubbell Roberts and Marie <b>Burdo,</b> divorced when she was two years old. With her only child, the young Marie then returned to her own parents, and the home that the family had rented for a number of years: half of a double dwelling in a poor neighborhood in Saratoga Springs. Marie had begun experiencing the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis by 1932, but worked as much as possible. Eventually Roberts' grandfather, Joseph <b>Burdo,</b> with whom she shared a deep mystical identification, was unable to support two extra people, and the family had to rely upon public assistance.

50|$|Ponsa (Ponza/Понза or Povša/Повша) was a Dominican friar who was {{appointed}} Bishop of Bosnia {{in the midst of}} the Bosnian Crusade. The crusade's stated objective was to purge Bosnia from heresy, in other words to exterminate the autonomous Bosnian Church. His predecessor, the German-born Dominican John of Wildeshausen, repeatedly requested to be relieved of the bishopric, and in 1238 Pope Gregory IX wrote that the crusade was a success and that he had selected Ponsa as the new bishop. Ponsa was also to be assigned jurisdiction over Zachlumia, but probably only its western part, as the rest belonged to Serbia. Gregory believed Ponsa to be very capable, and named him apostolic legate to Bosnia for a term of three years. Matej Ninoslav, Ban of Bosnia, apparently refused to accept Ponsa as bishop, which the Pope regarded as an act of defiance. The crusaders penetrated into Central Bosnia, and a cathedral called Saint Peter's was built in Brdo (<b>Burdo)</b> above Vrhbosna (modern Sarajevo) in 1238.|$|E

40|$|Our paper {{seeks to}} begin a {{conversation}} about how legal academics might work collaboratively to resist neoliberal reforms in legal education. We begin by considering the existing literature about how academics have responded to recent efforts to corporatize university education. This literature reveals a great level of despondency and despair. Most acts of resistance are either individual or passive. Following this, we put forward as alternative conceptualisation of the academic – the academic activist. We consider whether this conceptualisation might offer a place from which resistance can emerge. Finally, we consider strategies that might be adopted by legal academics who wish to contest neoliberalism within the law school and the university. Given the evidence of academic despair and disempowerment, we propose a range of strategies which are both active and passive and range from the individual to the collaborative.

We note its literary sources, and explain the author’s methodology and linguistic conception regarding the etymology and meaning of words. According to the underlying structure and scientific frame in which the text is supported, Isidore distinguishes wild asses and wild horses (onagri and equiferi) from the domestic ones (asini and equi). He divides asses into smaller working donkeys (aselli) and big asses (asini Arcadici), and horses into a vulgar class for pulling carts (ueredus), including a variety of minor size (mannus), and another class of noble saddle-horses, of which he mentions eight races according to their geographical origin. Among the crossbreeds he mentions the mule (mulus), the hinny (<b>burdo)</b> and the cross of a wild ass and a jenny...|$|E
40|$|The Trypillia (Russian Tripolye) mega-sites in the Kirovograd and Cherkassy {{regions of}} Ukraine {{constitute}} the largest sites in fourth millennium BC Europe (Videiko 2004). Discovered in the 1970 s, aerial photography and geophysical prospection {{were used to}} produce plans of these sites {{in what has been}} termed 'the first mega-site methodological revolution' (Videiko 2012). The five largest mega-sites are Taljanky (340 ha), Nebelivka (260 ha), Dobrovody (250 ha), Tomashivka (220 ha) and Maydanetskoe (200 ha) (Videiko 2012). At Taljanky, over 2000 structures have been documented by geophysical prospection and excavation (<b>Burdo</b> et al. 2012). The resulting population estimates, together with an apparent three-level settlement hierarchy (Ellis 1984), imply the possibility of state-level societies contemporary with Uruk developments in Iraq. The rationale, origins and collapse of these large sites, however, has remained unclear, as has their impact on the local environment and their place in local and regional settlement structures...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the relevance of}} Hannah Arendt’s writing on responsibility and judgment for legal academics. It begins by providing a summary of Arendt’s report on the Eichmann trial, focusing in particular on the gradual shift in her thinking from theorising evil as radical to something that is banal. Following this, I connect Arendt’s thinking on judgment with her writing on plurality {{and what it means}} to keep company with oneself. I contend that Arendt’s most important contribution to moral thinking was the disenchantment of evil from its religious legacy. Finally, I consider the continued relevance of Arendt’s warning about the risks mass technological society poses for the capacity of human beings to think and make reflective judgments. These uniquely human characteristics need to be protected, if we are to guard against the rise of inverted totalitarianism and the reduction of human beings to homo oeconomicus.

40|$|On June 1 2009 Fr Thomas Berry {{passed away}} {{at his home in}} Greensboro N. C. In his final book before passing, Berry {{challenged}} human society to a carry out a transition from a period of human devastation of the Earth to a period when humans would be present to the planet in a mutually beneficial manner. This 'Great Work' encompassed religion, education, science and law. In this paper I will address Berry's argument that our current legal system supports the destruction of the environment and outline two ideas he put forward for evolving law. The first idea recognises that human law operates within and should be bound by the overarching laws of the natural world. From this perspective, the laws of nature are primary and human law would receive its legal quality and authority from its conformity with this law. The second proposal was to recognise that the earth consists of subjects, not objects and that all subjects are capable of holding rights. I will consider this argument in the context of two recent enactments of 'rights for nature' legislation in municipalities in the United States and in the constitution of Ecuador.

40|$|Legal {{philosophical}} discourse {{tends to}} be animated by some conception of self and the parameters of community. Reflecting a vast heritage of humanist philosophy and theology, western legal concepts reflect anthropocentric values. Theories of law and legal concepts promote human beings as separate {{to the environment and}} define frameworks for the exploitation of nature. Against this paradigm, environmental philosophers have sought to redefine human beings as integral members of a greater Earth community – nature is a community of subjects, not a collection of objects. This alternative conception of self carries important consequences for legal philosophy. This paper explores these consequences first by analysing the ecological conception of self and community articulated by ‘geologian’ Thomas Berry (1914 - 2009). Second, this paper uses Berry’s analysis to develop an ecological theory of jurisprudence. This theory connects human law with ecological integrity and holds that human law attains legal quality (in part) when enacted for the common good of the comprehensive Earth community. Throughout this analysis, the paper also highlights the limitations Berry’s philosophical and legal writing and seeks dialogue with leftist political theory. Peter D. <b>Burdo...</b>|$|E
40|$|Published online: 08 May 2017 Background: Cataract is a {{major cause}} of severe visual {{impairment}} in childhood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the genetic cause of syndromic congenital cataract in an Australian mother and son. Method: Fifty-one genes associated with congenital cataract were sequenced in the proband using a custom Ampliseq library on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). Reads were aligned against the human genome (hg 19) and variants were annotated. Variants were prioritised for validation by Sanger sequencing if they were novel, rare or previously reported to be associated with paediatric cataract and were predicted to be protein changing. Variants were assessed for segregation with the phenotype in the affected mother. Result: A novel likely pathogenic variant was identified in the transactivation domain of the MAF gene (c. 176 C[*]>[*]G, p. (Pro 59 Arg)) in the proband and his affected mother., but was absent in 326 unrelated controls and absent from public variant databases. Conclusion: The MAF variant is the likely cause of the congenital cataract, Asperger syndrome, seizures, hearing loss and facial characteristics in the proband, providinga diagnosis of Aymé-Gripp syndrome for the family.

40|$|Background: A novel {{phenotype}} {{consisting of}} cataract, mental retardation, erythematous skin rash and facial dysmorphism was recently described in an extended pedigree of Australian Aboriginal descent. Large scale chromosomal re-arrangements {{had previously been}} ruled out. We have conducted a genome-wide scan to map the linkage region in this family. Methods: Genome-wide linkage analysis using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers on the Affymetrix 10 K SNP array was conducted and analysed using MERLIN. Three positional candidate genes (ZBTB 17, EPHA 2 and EPHB 2) were sequenced to screen for segregating mutations. Results: Under a fully penetrant, dominant model, the locus for this unique phenotype was mapped to chromosome 1 p 35. 3 -p 36. 32 with a maximum LOD score of 2. 41. The critical region spans 48. 7 cM between markers rs 966321 and rs 1441834 and encompasses 527 transcripts from 364 annotated genes. No coding mutations were identified in three positional candidate genes EPHA 2, EPHB 2 or ZBTB 17. The region overlaps with a previously reported region for Volkmann cataract and the phenotype has similarity to that reported for 1 p 36 monosomy. Conclusions: The gene for this syndrome {{is located in a}} 25. 6 Mb region on 1 p 35. 3 -p 36. 32. The known cataract gene in this region (EPHA 2) does not harbour mutations in this family, suggesting that at least one additional gene for cataract is present in this region.
