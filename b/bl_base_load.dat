It is the sequel to <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> and is continued by <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> 3. As opposed to the original, <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> II (and the sequels) was developed directly for Nintendo's consoles and never saw an arcade version.

30|$|Note that {{residential}} loads in RL during time-period 13 on regular weekdays (weekends) {{with their}} maximum temperatures being in [14, 27  °C] {{can be treated}} as <b>base</b> <b>loads</b> as there barely exist CSL and ACL. The average {{of them can be}} used as the actual <b>base</b> <b>load</b> that is included in the residential load in RL during time-period 13, as the <b>base</b> <b>loads</b> in the same time-period on regular weekdays (weekends) within a year are almost identical (which is discussed in Sect. 3.1). For the residential load in time-period 13 on a regular day with the maximum temperature being above 27  °C or below 14  °C (see Fig.  2 a), it can be treated as the summation of the CSL and <b>base</b> <b>load.</b> Subtract the identified (average) <b>base</b> <b>load</b> from this residential load, then one can obtain the CSL included in the residential load in RL during time-period 13.|$|R
50|$|<b>Base</b> <b>load</b> {{power plants}} operate at maximum output.

25|$|Electricity demand {{can also}} be {{separated}} as <b>base</b> <b>load</b> and peak demand. <b>Base</b> <b>load</b> refers to constant, or unvarying, demand for electricity. In Ontario, <b>base</b> <b>load</b> amounts to approximately 13,000 MW and is met by nuclear and hydroelectric power. These supply options generally have low operating costs. Nuclear stations are limited in their capability to rapidly change their output. Hydroelectric stations can rapidly change their output and are typically used to adjust grid supply to match instantaneous demand.|$|R
5000|$|Though some {{characteristics}} {{remained the}} same between <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> and <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> II (e.g. the same fictitious 12-team league returns in this game, with new players. It {{is worth noting that}} all of the players on the Washington, D.C. team are named after famous politicians, while all of Los Angeles's players take their names from Hollywood luminaries. In addition, one of Hawaii's pitchers is named Ho.), there are several noteworthy changes. One new feature was the [...] "biorhythm" [...] concept; players in the game had [...] "biorhythms" [...] that could be monitored to ensure optimal performance. <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> II had a little faster play action than the original game, and the point of view once a ball was hit into play was also different. In <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> the view was from behind home plate, whereas in <b>Bases</b> <b>Loaded</b> II the view was either from the first-base line if the home team was at bat, or from the third-base line if the visiting team was at bat.|$|R

50|$|A {{plant can}} {{be out of}} service or {{operating}} at reduced output {{for part of the}} time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance. This accounts for most of the unused capacity of <b>base</b> <b>load</b> power plants. <b>Base</b> <b>load</b> plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output. Geothermal plants, nuclear plants, coal-fired plants and bioenergy plants that burn solid material are almost always operated as <b>base</b> <b>load</b> plants.|$|R

50|$|Each {{baseload}} power plant on a grid is allotted a specific {{amount of the}} {{baseload power}} demand to handle. The <b>base</b> <b>load</b> power {{is determined by the}} load duration curve of the system.

30|$|The {{template}} pools can {{be generated}} via the dataset NRL. The generation procedures can be found Fig.  3. The dataset NRL is first divided into 2 sub-datasets. The residential load data on days with the maximum temperature being in [14, 27  °C] are gathered to form the 1 st sub-dataset and the other load data in NRL are collected to form the 2 nd sub-dataset. As indicated in Fig.  4, the load in the 1 st sub-dataset can be treated as the <b>base</b> <b>load.</b> And the load in the 2 nd sub-dataset is the summation of <b>base</b> <b>load</b> and CSL. Then, the 48 load values of each day in the 1 st sub-dataset are normalized to their maximum load value to obtain the corresponding per-unit <b>base</b> <b>load</b> profile. Per-unit load profiles of all days are then gathered to form the per-unit <b>base</b> <b>load</b> pool.|$|R
