40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new {{algorithm}} of gravity-like mechanism and a multistage <b>buffer</b> for the <b>car</b> sequencing problem. The algorithm utilizes {{the principle of}} gravity and codes the cars as particles, which can achieve the ordering by the gravity of particles themselves in the sequencing buffer. The Petri net model of the Buffer is proposed and a car sequencing problem is analyzed as an example, the results prove that the algorithm and the buffer can perform well in car sequencing problem...|$|R
50|$|The {{train was}} {{composed}} of two locomotives, a covered hopper car acting as a <b>buffer</b> <b>car,</b> 107 tank cars, and a single trailing end <b>buffer</b> <b>car.</b> The train was carrying volatile Bakken crude, from North Dakota's shale fields at Manitou, North Dakota, to an oil shipping depot in Yorktown, Virginia. All of the cars were DOT-111 tank cars meeting the Casualty Prevention Circular (CPC)-1232 industry standard. These so-called CPC-1232's were introduced by the rail industry in 2011 to increase the safety of carrying flammable liquids. However, several accidents involving the cars have brought their effectiveness into doubt.|$|E
50|$|The weather at {{the time}} of the {{accident}} was 15 F with 8 in of recent snow. The train was traveling at 33 mph, below the 50 mph speed limit for the area and a 40 mph speed restriction imposed by CSX due to cold weather. The second car in the train (the first tanker car behind the <b>buffer</b> <b>car),</b> through the 28th car derailed. Shortly after the derailment occurred, the train went into emergency braking as a result of the brake line coming apart. The engines traveled 636 ft after this. The train crew must have seen the damage behind them and moved the engines and the <b>buffer</b> <b>car</b> an additional 999 ft away from the accident.|$|E

It is tested by simulation model whether the planned modifications in a <b>buffer</b> for sorting <b>cars</b> by their color would have positive effect on Perlenkette principle. The Perlenkette principle will help to stabilize supplier processes and reduction of running production times. Conclusions are deduced from carried out simulation experiments...|$|R
25|$|After being {{fitted with}} <b>buffers,</b> these power <b>cars</b> began work as {{surrogate}} DVTs {{to work with}} the Class 91s and 89. The locomotives, working with conventional Mk3 stock, worked on the line between 1987 and 1991, when the last Class 91 locomotives entered service. As well as buffers being fitted to these powercars, special remote control equipment was also added to the locomotives so they could be controlled by the locomotive at the front. Once these locomotives left DVT duties, the remote equipment was removed.|$|R

50|$|Scientists of {{university}} of Oslo from Norway {{have developed a}} battery which can be recharged less than one second. According to the scientists this battery would be interesting for example for city buses, which could be loaded at each bus stop, and thus would require only a relatively small battery. A disadvantage is, according to the researchers that the bigger the battery, the greater must be the charging current. Thus, the battery can not be very big. According to the researchers of the new battery {{could also be used}} as a <b>buffer</b> in sports <b>car</b> to provide power in the short term. For now, however, the researchers think of applications in small and micro devices.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we motivate {{the use of}} a {{declarative}} programming style and the use of massive parallel computing systems to model control strategies in concurrent systems. The simplified formulation of system components and their interaction permits to generate a rapid prototype of the system. Based on this prototype, a first simulation of the modeled strategies and the system is done on a massive parallel computing system. Using parallel hardware the massive parallelism of real systems can be naturally matched to an execution model. To allow a sophisticated modeling and rapid prototyping we use strategies based on fuzzy logic and present a prototype of a fuzzy library for the concurrent programming language PCN [4]. We demonstrate the modeling strengths of our approach by describing aspects of a 'real world problem', a color sorting assembly <b>buffer</b> used in <b>car</b> production.

30|$|This {{criterion}} {{deals with}} ways to enrich the image of subdivisions including buildings, streets, sidewalks, and public meeting places. The New Urbanists expressed {{a renewed interest in}} traditional building practices. They contended that attention to architectural details and visual stimuli can encourage civic engagement (Duany and Plater-Zyberk 1991; Katz 1994; Dutton 2001). In this respect, traditional neighborhoods in New Bern juxtapose a successful combination of elements that create a variegated and attractive built environment. Most significant is the variety in home designs, sizes, roof slopes, colors and architectural details that make each home or group of homes stand out and present a unique image along the street or curb line. Sidewalks are well-designed with plant strips and trees that define the sidewalk space and <b>buffer</b> pedestrians from <b>cars</b> parked parallel to the street. The chance to change directions and see other streets and buildings due to small size blocks and seamless connectivity with neighboring areas enhances the experiential quality of public space. On the other hand, typical suburban subdivisions display standardized built forms. They generally adopt a cookie-cutter approach that produces less articulated built environments; streets function as conduits for car traffic with little or no social functions. This trend should be reversed; subdivision ordinances should be revised to encourage architectural variety.|$|R
50|$|The {{second car}} in the train (the first tanker car behind the <b>buffer</b> <b>car),</b> through the 28th car derailed. The first five of these cars, {{position}} 2 to 6 turned over on their sides. The next 18 cars at position 7 to 24 piled up in a tight accordion style, while the last four cars that derailed at position 25 to 28 were somewhat in line. Cars 7 to 25 released their oil. Only two of the cars were punctured, four leaked due to valve or fitting damage. The remaining 13 suffered from thermal tears. These thermal tears were likely {{the cause of the}} violent fireball eruptions.|$|E

5000|$|CP runs several freight {{trains in}} both ways along almost {{the full length}} of the subdivision. They do not run {{the full length of}} the line, as the portion that ran {{south-east}} to Union Station was sold to Metrolinx/GO transit. From Lambton Yard west, freight traffic begins on the Galt Subdivision. More recently around October 2010, unit trains have commenced operation on the Galt sub. These bulk-ethanol (except for a <b>buffer</b> <b>car)</b> trains come in the way of train ID numbers 666 and 642 as eastbound loaded movements, with 667 and 643 being the westbound empty return movements. There are many other trains as well, such as manifests, intermodals, double-stacks, autorackers, and even the almost-weekly Expressway train. Regulated operating speeds on the Galt Subdivision range from 50-60 mph/80-96 km/h.|$|E
40|$|Carnitine (<b>Car)</b> <b>buffers</b> excess acetyl-CoA {{through the}} {{formation}} of acetylCar (AcCar). AcCar's acetyl group (AG-AcCar) {{gives rise to a}} peak at 2. 13 ppm in ¹H MR spectra of skeletal muscle, whereas the trimethylammonium (TMA) groups of both, AcCar and Car, are thought to contribute to the TMA peak at 3. 23 ppm. Surprisingly, in previous studies both resonances, AG-AcCar and TMA, increased after exercise. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess if the exercise-related TMA increase correlated with AcCar production. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (pulse repetition time/echo time = 1200 / 35 ms) was performed before and after prolonged exercise in the lower leg and thigh of eight runners and eight cyclists, respectively. TMA and AG-AcCar increased after exercise (P < 0. 001). TMA's increase correlated with the AG-AcCar increase (R² = 0. 73, P < 0. 001, lower leg; R² = 0. 28, P < 0. 001, thigh). The correlation of ΔTMA with ΔAG-AcCar suggests that the TMA increase is due to AcCar formation. As total Car (Car + AcCar) remains unchanged with exercise, these findings suggest that the contribution of free Car to the TMA peak is limited and, therefore, is partly invisible in muscle ¹H MR spectra. This indicates that the biochemically relevant cytosolic content of free Car is considerably lower than the overall concentration determined by radioisotopic assays, a potentially important result with respect to regulation of substrate oxidation...|$|R
