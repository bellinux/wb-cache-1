60|$|Although {{the rock}} barely made its {{appearance}} at {{this period of}} the tides till eight o'clock, yet, having now a full mile to row from the floating light to the rock, instead of {{about a quarter of}} a mile from the moorings of the Smeaton, it was necessary to be earlier astir, and to form different arrangements; breakfast was accordingly served up at seven o'clock this morning. From the excessive motion of the floating light, the writer had looked forward rather with anxiety to the removal of the workmen to this ship. Some among them, who had been congratulating themselves upon having become sea-hardy while on board the Smeaton, had a complete relapse upon returning to the floating light. This was the case with the writer. From the spacious and convenient <b>berthage</b> of the floating light, the exchange to the artificers was, in this respect, much for the better. The boats were also commodious, measuring sixteen feet in length on the keel, so that, in fine weather, their complement of sitters was sixteen persons for each, with which, however, they were rather crowded, but she could not stow two boats of larger dimensions. When there was what is called a breeze of wind, and a swell in the sea, the proper number for each boat could not, with propriety, be rated at more than twelve persons.|$|E

50|$|One {{contributing}} factor to the town's success was {{the management of}} its harbour, and therefore the efforts of its harbour board. The prospect of an official harbour board was first considered in 1913, when dissatisfaction among the Bowen Chamber of Commerce led to an inquiry into the financial arrangements of the port. The inquiry, dated November 27, 1913, found the current port revenue situation lacking, with the revenue at the time being insufficient {{to provide for the}} upkeep of the wharf, let alone improvements. As a result, the Bowen Harbour Board Act of 1914 was gazetted on September 1, 1914. The first meeting of the Board was held on March 22, 1915 in the Bowen Shire Hall, and the Board's by-laws were gazetted on July 15, 1915. Changes made to the system of revenue collection, such as charging for <b>berthage,</b> and changes to the haulage system, quickly resulted in the Harbour Board's revenue substantially increasing, and then annually increasing for a prolonged period thereafter. This in turn allowed further expansion of port facilities through the construction of new cargo sheds and facilities to accommodate the expanding range of export materials.As the port developed so did the role of the Harbour Board. By 1933 the Board was seeking a new location for its offices. The building selected by the Board was constructed in 1921 for ship owners/agents, MacDonald Hamilton and Co., who occupied the site until closing their business in Bowen in 1930. When the Bank of New South Wales and the Australian Bank of Commerce merged in 1929, they purchased the building. In 1931 they moved back to the original Bank of New South Wales and auctioned the building to the Bowen Harbour Board for £1150. In the same year, the upper floor of the building was leased, for one pound per week, to a Mr A. V. Murrey (the only other bidder at the auction), who was the secretary of Bowen Consolidated Mines, Bowen Salt Ltd., Bowen Fire Brigade and the Bowen Chamber of Commerce. After his death in the 1950's his son Dennie Murray took over the lease, and remained until his death in 1960, at which time he was replaced as secretary by Mr Lew Head.|$|E
40|$|The Port of Tauranga have {{proposed}} extending the <b>berthage</b> {{of both the}} Sulphur Point and Maunganui wharves southward to provide a combined length of 1, 303 m. The dredged channel (Stella Passage) will also be extended south into Town Reach, with the dredged sediment used to reclaim 4. 7 ha behind the wharf extensions and along the Sulphur Point shoreline. In this thesis a hydrodynamic model of the southern basin was developed and used to predict the potential impacts of the wharf extensions on the hydrodynamics in Stella Passage and the upper harbour. Numerical modelling of the southern basin was undertaken with Deltares Delft 3 D FLOW modelling software, using a 2 D model with a 20 x 20 m rectangular grid. Sensitivity analysis identified bottom roughness and bathymetry as having the largest influence on model outcomes. Successful calibration and verification of the southern basin model was carried out using field data collected from instruments deployed in Stella Passage and the upper harbour. Statistical analysis of the modelled water levels showed ‘excellent’ agreement with the field data. The modelled current velocities did not match quite as well, but the results were sufficiently good to provide confidence in the model predictions. The modelled hydrodynamics in Stella Passage {{were similar to those}} predicted by previous studies. Compression of the tidal volume and acceleration over the steep boundary between the two areas meant current speeds within the shallower Town Reach were significantly higher than those in the dredged Stella Passage. A clockwise eddy of residual velocities indicated increased sediment transport on the ebb dominant western side of Town Reach. No previous models of the southern basin have modelled the hydrodynamics in the upper harbour beyond the Railway Bridge. Within the upper harbour the largest effects on the existing hydrodynamics were caused by the bridge causeways and {{the size and shape of}} the basins. Residual velocity eddies were created around the causeways from velocity gradients caused by shadow zones on the lee sides of the causeways. As the residual velocities and net sediment transport rates were low, the upper harbour was deemed to be in dynamic equilibrium. Modelled existing hydrodynamics within Stella Passage, Town Reach and the upper harbour were compared to three modelling scenarios simulating the 2015 2016 capital dredging, and proposed wharf extensions, dredging and reclamation. The modelled harbour developments had no significant impact on the hydrodynamics in the upper harbour; changes to water levels and current speeds were less than 0. 025 m and 0. 05 m. s- 1, which were smaller than model errors and the impacts of weather events. The largest impacts were localised within Stella Passage and Town Reach close to the proposed developments. The 2015 - 2016 dredging reinforced the existing patterns in residual velocity and potential sediment transport pathways. Differences in current speeds between models indicated that the largest impacts on the hydrodynamics within Stella Passage and Town Reach were from the extension of the dredged channel into Town Reach rather than the wharf extensions and reclamation. Current speeds decreased significantly within the newly dredged channel, but this effect was compensated for to a degree by the restrictions of the channel width when the wharves were constructed. In western Town Reach, current speeds increased due to the drop-off moving south and the asymmetrical shape of the dredging extension channelling the tidal flow. The potential for sediment transport and erosion increased in western Town Reach, however the actual sediment transport may be reduced following the formation of a shell lag facies which are common areas of high flow within the harbour...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{concern of}} this study is the examination of sedimentation and sedimentary processes in a rock-walled tidal inlet, Lyttelton Harbour. The harbour is distinctive from other forms of inlets commonly discussed in the literature due primarily to a negligible freshwater input, lateral grain size contours which are parallel to current flow paths, and a maintenance, channel dredging programme which greatly exceeds the natural harbour sedimentation rates. A further unusual characteristic of the harbour is the lateral limitation imposed on processes within the harbour by the surrounding rigid, rock boundaries. These boundaries influence and control circulation patterns within the harbour through the interaction between processes and geometry. Thus Lyttelton Harbour is a structurally controlled tidal inlet. The only harbour boundary which is free to respond to changes in the system is the bed. For these reasons traditional inlet concepts, applicable to estuaries and inlets with unconsolidated boundaries, were found to be unsatisfactory for explaining how Lyttelton Harbour operates. The study approach involves fieldwork and analysis of both sedimentary and hydraulic processes within the harbour. A bed sediment survey showed that the harbour can be divided along its longitudinal axis with very fine mud sediments on the northern side, and coarser, sandier sediments on the southern side. All bed sediments are predominantly fine, and a survey of near-bed suspended sediment concentrations revealed fluid mud layers on the northern side of the harbour, at the harbour entrance, and within the channel. The primary hydraulic processes operating are tidal currents, although a mixed wave field, comprising ocean swell and locally generated wind waves, frequently penetrates the harbour. Tidal current velocities are on average around 0. 22 ms-¹, with flood tide velocities stronger {{on the south side of}} the harbour and ebb tide velocities stronger on the north side, inducing a clockwise circulation pattern. External factors are an important component in the tidal driving forces, comprising coastal weather patterns and a continental shelf edge wave oscillation effect with a period of 2. 5 - 3. 5 hours. These external influences are the main cause of the duration of both ebb and flood tides varying from 5. 0 to 8. 25 hours. Interaction between tidal currents and the harbour geometry induces a large gyre in the outer harbour which varies in duration from being absent to operating for up to 50 % of any given tidal cycle. The transport of sand sized material is bidirectional along the harbour length, with erosion of sandy sediments in the centre of the harbour, and deposition at the head of the harbour and at the harbour entrance. Fine muddy sediments are transported predominantly towards the harbour entrance and accumulate in the channel, on the northern side, and in the entrance, forming fluid mud layers. The most concentrated fluid mud regions coincide with the rotatory currents at both ends of the tidal gyre, where sediment is deposited from weaker currents. Transport of sand across the harbour is not apparent, although lateral movement of fine, suspended particles occurs by advection and diffusion in response to the sediment flux differentials and flux gradients within the harbour. This movement of fines results in the lateral gradation of grain size, from coarse to fine, across the harbour from south to north. The major sedimentary process within the harbour is the maintenance dredging programme which removes up to 1, 000, 000 tonnes of sediment annually from the channel and port <b>berthage</b> areas. The dredge spoil is subsequently dumped within the harbour along the northern perimeter, although a temporal analysis of dump sites indicated that once a site capacity has been attained, all the spoil dumped at that location is rapidly removed. Sediment input from other sources, primarily erosion of the catchment, has been estimated at less than 45, 000 tonnes per annum, substantially less than the channel siltation rate, and the recirculation of dredge spoil was identified as the primary source of sediment causing channel siltation. Two processes induce spoil recirculation. Firstly the tidal gyre, and secondly the dynamic trap. The dynamic trap system provides a mechanism for the transport of fine grained sediments to regions of high sediment flux, and for the deposition of fine grained sediments under current regimes having both a high competence and a high capacity. The system provides an explanation for the lateral grain size gradation within the harbour, the maintenance of dredge spoil mounds at dump sites, the insensitivity of channel siltation rates to the location of spoil dumping sites around the harbour, and the quasi-equilibrium state of the harbour in spite of the extensive dredging operations. Little sediment is able to escape from the harbour to the open sea due to the flux gradients at the entrance, and the dynamic trap principles. Thus the long term stability of Lyttelton Harbour is maintained, under both natural and dredging conditions, by the redistribution of available sediment within the harbour as a function of internal harbour dynamics. Throughout the thesis the dynamics of Lyttelton Harbour are compared to existing inlet concepts and theories in order to identify those areas in which this type of inlet is significantly different and where other, poorly understood inlets may be comparable to Lyttelton. Finally, Lyttelton Harbour is defined and classified and a set of principles pertaining to this type of inlet are proposed...|$|E
