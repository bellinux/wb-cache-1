5|$|Since {{this report}} was released, several {{independent}} reviews {{have examined the}} body of published research for a possible thiomersal-autism link by examining the theoretical mechanisms of thiomersal causing harm and <b>by</b> <b>reviewing</b> the in vitro, animal, and population {{studies that have been}} published.

5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished <b>by</b> <b>reviewing</b> slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E

5|$|On October 26, 2005, {{four months}} after his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, obstruction of justice, racketeering, and bribery of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman. Prosecutors claimed that Scrushy had agreed to pay over $500,000 of Siegelman's debt, which he accumulated during a failed attempt to bring a state lottery to Alabama, in exchange for a seat on the Certificates of Need Review Board. The board serves the state <b>by</b> <b>reviewing</b> hospitals and approving their construction. Although the new charges were filed a month before the previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorney's accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy and Siegleman pleaded not guilty to all charges, but they were both convicted following a trial that lasted approximately six weeks. Scrushy was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, and mail fraud, while Siegelman was convicted of bribery, conspiracy, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{performed}} a few ceremonial functions {{for the remainder}} of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States. Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government <b>by</b> <b>reviewing</b> all of Wilson's communications and deciding what he would be presented with and what she would delegate to others. The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.|$|E

Set in 1950s America, the film featured Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd, the charismatic leader of a nascent Scientology-type movement who brings a troubled man (Joaquin Phoenix) under his tutelage. Hoffman was instrumental in the project's development, having been involved with it for three years. He assisted Anderson in the writing of the script <b>by</b> <b>reviewing</b> samples of it, and suggested making Phoenix's character, Freddie Quell, the protagonist instead of Dodd. A talented dancer, Hoffman was able to showcase his abilities by performing a jig during a surreal sequence; Bradshaw called it an [...] "extraordinary moment" [...] that [...] "only Hoffman could have carried off." [...] The Master was praised as an intelligent and challenging drama, and Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader also felt that it contained Hoffman's finest work: [...] "He's inscrutable yet welcoming, intimidating yet charismatic, villainous yet fatherly. He epitomizes so many things at once that it's impossible to think of [...] as mere movie character". Hoffman and Phoenix received a joint Volpi Cup Award at the Venice Film Festival for their performances, and Hoffman was also nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA Award and a SAG Award for the supporting role.|$|E
