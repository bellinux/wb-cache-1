25|$|After Greig scored 156 in 230 minutes {{against a}} strong Lancashire attack {{in his first}} game for Sussex, his future {{direction}} changed irrevocably.

6000|$|I {{began at}} once to hope and fear exceedingly; for I thought these men might have thought better of their cruelty and <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my assistance. But another disappointment, such as yesterday's, was more than I could bear. I turned my back, accordingly, upon the sea, and did not look again till I had counted many hundreds.

6000|$|Sewell {{knew that}} this emotion was largely the {{physical}} optimism of convalescence; {{but he could not}} refuse the comfort it gave him to find Barker in such a mood, and he did not conceive it his duty to discourage it. Lofty ideals, if not indulged at the expense of lowly realities, he had never found hurtful to any; and it was certainly better for Barker to think too well than too ill of Boston, if it furnished him incentives to unselfish living. He could think of enough things in the city to warrant a different judgment, but if Barker's lesson from his experience there was this, Sewell was not the person to weaken its force with him. He said, with a smile of reserved comment, [...] "Well, perhaps you'll <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> us, some day." ...|$|E
