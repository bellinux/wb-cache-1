40|$|The {{potential}} to identify individual <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Divers</b> (Gavia arctica) {{on the basis}} of breeding plumage features was explored using 278 photos, including two paired birds followed during the years 2007 - 2015 at a specific breeding location. Observations were focused on: 1) white lines on the sides of neck, 2) mantle having rows of sharply contrasting white squares, and 3) small white spots on lesser andmedian coverts. In photos, the number ofwhite lines on the sides of neck varied from four to seven (mean = 5. 0, n = 278), and the second line from the head was the highest in 92. 1 % of the photos. The number of " white square" rows on the mantle varied from 11 to 14 and the small white spots on coverts from 27 to 67. Identification of individual <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Divers</b> was potentially easiest if the plumage had some special patterns (19. 4 % of birds, n = 278). Plumage remained the same in the followed pair between years, as was also shown by the discriminant analysis, since the followed pair was correctly classified by sex but not by sides showing that sides are similar. To estimate whether it is possible to separate these two birds from other birds, a second discriminant analysis was accomplished. Thus, 125 other birds were added to analysis as a third group together with the followed pair (female andmale, nine years and n = 18 per sex). The linear discriminant analysis yielded a classification rate of 70. 8 % in original analysis and 69. 6 % based on the leave-one-out analysis (n = 161). These analyses were based on the relative height of the neck lines, their average relative height and standard deviation. When the number ofwhite spotswere added to this discriminant analysis, a correct classification rate of 77. 4 % in original analysis and 75. 7 % in the leave-one-out analysis was obtained (n = 115). These following nesting pairs during their breeding seasons in different years. Presumed female andmaleBlack-throatedDiver could be distinguished based on the shape of the forehead...|$|R
5000|$|The Rauchua / Kyttyk wetland area is {{considered}} to be the easternmost extent of so-called [...] "Kolyma fauna", such as the Terek sandpiper, brown shrike and scarlet rosefinch. The most common bird species in the Rauchua / Kyttyk wetland are the yellow-billed, <b>black-throated</b> and Pacific <b>divers.</b> One of the main reasons for the importance of the Rauchua / Kyttyk is the breeding population (figures as of 1994) of Bewick's swan (approximately 300 birds), the Pacific eider (approximately 3,000 birds) and the spectacled eider (approximately 2,000 birds). Spectacled and Pacific eider as well as <b>black-throated</b> and Pacific <b>divers</b> are also found in the Ust-Chaun region, though the Pacific eider is much more common on the Kyttyl Peninsula and near Apapelgino.|$|R

They provide habitat for a number of bird species, including heron, osprey, mallard, goldeneye, goosander, the <b>black-throated</b> <b>diver</b> and hobby in the bays; on the cobs are colonies of herring gull, seagull and the common tern; while on the fir-covered islands are capercaillie, woodpeckers and other birds.|$|E
50|$|A {{documentation}} of lake bed fauna in 1997 registered 68 species, of which fourteen were freshwater gastropods commonly found around Stockholm and five were dragonflies. Notable catches included European stream valvata (Valvata piscinalis) and duck mussel. Common fishes are perch, roach, and silver bream, with bigger variations in population for carp bream, northern pike, tench, bleak, ruffle, and zander (notwithstanding attempts {{to introduce the}} latter). Crayfish have been successfully introduced. Thirteen breeding bird pairs were documented in 1994 of which the <b>black-throated</b> <b>diver</b> is considered the most important, even though the species is sensitive to interference so breeding might be challenging. Four of five amphibians with a natural habitat in the Stockholm area are found by the lake, as were four species of bats.|$|E
5000|$|The black-throated loon, Gavia arctica, was {{originally}} described by Carl Linnaeus as Colymbus arcticus in his 18th-century work, Systema Naturae. It {{was moved to}} the genus Gavia by the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) in 1897. The genus name Gavia comes from the Latin for [...] "sea mew", as used by the ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder. The specific arctica is Latin for [...] "northern" [...] or [...] "Arctic". The name of the subspecies viridigularis stems from the Latin [...] "viridis", meaning [...] "green", and the Latin [...] "gularis", meaning [...] "throated", in reference to the green throat of this subspecies. The common name, black-throated loon, stems from its black throat patch. This loon is also called the Arctic loon and the <b>black-throated</b> <b>diver.</b>|$|E
50|$|The black-throated loon (Gavia arctica), {{also known}} as the Arctic loon and the <b>black-throated</b> <b>diver,</b> is a migratory aquatic bird found in the {{northern}} hemisphere, primarily breeding in freshwater lakes in northern Europe and Asia. It winters along sheltered, ice-free coasts of the north-east Atlantic Ocean and the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. This loon was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It has two subspecies including the nominate. It was previously considered to be the same species as the Pacific loon, of which it is traditionally considered to be a sister species, although this is debated. In a study that used mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA, the black-throated loon was found to be sister to a clade consisting of the Pacific loon and two sister species, the common loon and the yellow-billed loon.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} nesting birds on the skerries of MÃ¤laren {{are also the}} most common in the Baltic Sea. After a survey in 2005, the ten most common species {{were found to be}} common tern, herring gull, black-headed gull, common gull, mallard, tufted duck, Canada goose, common goldeneye, lesser black-backed gull and common sandpiper. White-tailed eagle, greylag goose, {{barnacle}} goose, <b>black-throated</b> <b>diver,</b> red-breasted merganser and gadwall are less common, and some of these latter are endangered in the MÃ¤laren area. Since 1994 a subspecies of great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis, has nested there as well. A 2005 survey tallied 23 breeding colonies with 2178 nests, of which the largest colony had 235 nests. Most experts believe the great cormorant population has peaked and will stabilize at around 2000 nests.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is managed}} under several {{conservation}} management units {{such as the}} Core Zone, the Buffer Zone, and the Economic Zone. The park {{is known for its}} rare and endangered endemic wildlife such as the tigers, elephants, Assam roofed turtle, hispid hare, golden and capped langurs and pygmy hog, one-horned rhinoceros, Asiatic buffalo, swamp deer, barking deers, leopards, clouded leopards, marbled cats, sloth bears, hoolock gibbons, wild boar, gharials, crocodiles, and river dolphins. Reptiles consist of pythons, common Indian crocodile, common wolf snake, cat snake and many other species. Birds listed include hornbills, common crane, common redshank, Eurasian woodcock, spotted eagles, <b>black-throated</b> <b>diver,</b> little grebe, different types of herons, black ibis, Eurasian sparrowhawk, spot-bellied eagle-owl and several others. The park is home for 22 endangered mammal species. Fish species identified are: katli, jurraha, chenga, telliah, labeo and mahaseer. Conservation measures have been undertaken to prevent poaching, overfishing, encroachments, and many other related issues. These measures are meant to minimise human interference in the fragile core zone, creation of a data base and carry out research on animal and plant populations for better conservation of the ecosystem.|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{breeding}} {{success of the}} <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Diver,</b> Gavia arctica, related to the water quality in three lakes located in the Vallentuna area, north of Stockholm, Sweden. For more than 30 years, I have studied the bird life around these three and other nearby lakes, and noticed that the <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Diver</b> breeds in some lakes, but not in others. The results confirm that the deep and clear lakes TÃ¤rnan and Stora HarsjÃ¶n have good water quality regarding pH, alkalinity, aluminium and Secchi disk values. As expected, the <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Diver</b> shows breeding success in those two lakes, but does not breed in the shallow and eutrophic lake Mysslingen...|$|E
40|$|The {{numbers of}} divers, ducks, gulls, terns and waders in the 15 km 2 {{oligotrophic}} lake Takvatn, North Norway were estimated six times during 1983 - 2012. Systematic mapping surveys were done by boat {{within the first}} week after ice-break in June. Twenty-one species were observed {{over the years and}} 12 were regarded as breeding on the lake. Red-breasted merganser Mergus serrator was the dominant diving bird, with estimated minimum number of pairs varying from 15 to 39 among years. <b>Black-throated</b> <b>diver</b> Gavia arctica (1 - 3 pairs), tufted duck Aythya fuligula (2 - 15 pairs) and common scoter Melanitta nigra (1 - 5 pairs) bred regularly, while velvet scoter Melanitta fusca (1 - 2) and goldeneye Bucephala clangula (2 - 4) were found in some years and mallard Anas platyrhynchos (1 pair) and wigeon Anas penelope (1 pair) in one year. Common gull Larus canus (6 - 30 pairs) and arctic tern Sterna paradisaea (2 - 35 pairs) bred in all years. Common sandpiper Tringa hypoleucos (3 - 9 pairs) and redshank Tringa totanus (1 - 4 pairs) were regular waders. Density variations of mergansers, gulls and terns are possibly related to density variations of three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus, their dominant fish prey. The water birds are important links in the food web of the lake. </p...|$|E
