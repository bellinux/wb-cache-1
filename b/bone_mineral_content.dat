5000|$|Body {{composition}} measurement with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is used increasingly for {{a variety}} of clinical and research applications. A DEXA scan requires medical supervision by a radiologist and some consider it to be the new [...] "Gold Standard" [...] in body composition testing.

50|$|Because DXA calculates BMD using area (aBMD: areal Bone Mineral Density), {{it is not}} an {{accurate}} measurement of true bone mineral density, which is mass divided by a volume. In order to distinguish DXA BMD from volumetric bone-mineral density, researchers sometimes refer to DXA BMD as an areal bone mineral density (aBMD). The confounding effect of differences in bone size is due to the missing depth value in the calculation of bone mineral density. Despite DXA technology's problems with estimating volume, it is still a fairly accurate measure of <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content.</b> Methods to correct for this shortcoming include the calculation of a volume that is approximated from the projected area measure by DXA. DXA BMD results adjusted in this manner are referred to as the bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) and are a ratio of the <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> versus a cuboidal estimation of the volume of bone. Like the results for aBMD, BMAD results do not accurately represent true bone mineral density, since they use approximations of the bone's volume. BMAD is used primarily for research purposes and is not yet used in clinical settings.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{present study}} aims {{to clarify the}} role of peanut oil as a {{radioprotector}} in male albino rats against oxidative stress and bone injury induced by ã-radiation. Rats were subjected to a dose of 5 Gy, over an exposure time of 133 sec, at a dose rate 3. 759 rad/sec. Prior to irradiation, rats received peanut oil subcutaneously, (0. 75 mL/kg) over a one month period, on three days/ week. Serum and <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> were estimated, and serum protein, cholesterol and creatinine concentrations were deter-mined. We also investigated some enzyme activities as well as hormonal calcium control. It seems that the deleterious effects of exposure to ã-radiation on most estimated parameters affecting Ca metabolism can be controlled to some extent by peanut oil administration prior to irradiation...|$|R

50|$|Also, {{there are}} other {{variables}} in addition to age that are suggested to confound the interpretation of BMD as measured by DXA. One important confounding variable is bone size. DXA {{has been shown to}} overestimate the bone mineral density of taller subjects and underestimate the bone mineral density of smaller subjects. This error is due to the way by which DXA calculates BMD. In DXA, <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> (measured as the attenuation of the X-ray by the bones being scanned) is divided by the area (also measured by the machine) of the site being scanned.|$|E
50|$|Male {{and female}} animals {{underwent}} a standardized phenotypic screen {{to determine the}} effects of deletion.

40|$|Objective: To {{verify the}} {{behavior}} of the <b>mineral</b> <b>bone</b> <b>content</b> and density in male adolescents according to age and secondary sexual characters. Methods: 47 healthy adolescents between 10 and 19 years old were assessed according to weight, height, body mass index, puberty stage, calcium intake, <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density and <b>content</b> in the lumbar spine and in the proximal femur. The bone mass was measured through bone densitometries. The intake of calcium was calculated through a 3 -day diet. The BMI (body mass index) was calculated with the Quetelet Index and the puberty stage was defined according to Tanners criteria. The analysis used descriptive statistics such as average and standard deviation, and variance estimates to compare the different age groups. Moreover, the Tukey test was used to determine the significant differences. Results: It was evident that the calcium intake in the different ages assessed has not reached the minimum value of 800 mg. The <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density and <b>content</b> showed an increase after the age of 14, as well as when the teenagers reached the sexual maturation stage G 4. The mineralization parameters showed a high level when the teenagers were in the G 3 stage, however, without statistical significance.

40|$|Although {{leukotriene}} B 4 (LTB 4) {{is produced}} in various inflammatory diseases, its functions in bone metabolism remain unknown. Using mice deficient in the high-affinity LTB 4 receptor BLT 1, we evaluated the roles of BLT 1 {{in the development of}} two bone resorption models, namely bone loss induced by ovariectomy and lipopolysaccharide. Through observations of <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> and <b>bone</b> morphometric parameters, we found that bone resorption in both models was significantly attenuated in BLT 1 -deficient mice. Furthermore, osteoclasts from BLT 1 -deficient mice showed reduced calcium resorption activities compared with wild-type osteoclasts. Osteoclasts expressed BLT 1, but not the low-affinity LTB 4 receptor BLT 2, and produced LTB 4. LTB 4 changed the cell morphology of osteoclasts through the BLT 1 -Gi protein-Rac 1 signaling pathway. Given the causal relationship between osteoclast morphology and osteoclastic activity, these findings suggest that autocrine/paracrine LTB 4 increases the osteoclastic activity through the BLT 1 -Gi protein-Rac 1 signaling pathway. Inhibition of BLT 1 functions may represent a strategy for preventing bone resorption diseases...|$|R

The results were summarized as follows. 1) By roentgenographic examination, the bone graft density was increased quickly in order of deproteinized, frozen, boiled, and fresh graft. 2) By gross appearance, the ossal fusion between the graft and the recipient was completed in all deproteinized and frozen grafts {{and in a few}} boiled and fresh graft. 3) The bone replacement in graft was not found up to 16 weeks after implantation in all the processed and fresh grafts. 4) The major <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> at the end of 16 weeks after implantation were nearly in agreement with the absorption rate in each graft. 5) There were no changes on blood cells and serum electrophoretic fractions of recipients implanted with non-processed fresh graft...|$|R
50|$|Bruck {{syndrome}} is characterized as {{the combination of}} arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and osteogenesis imperfecta. Both diseases are uncommon, but concurrence is extremely rare which makes Bruck syndrome very difficult to research. Bruck {{syndrome is}} thought to be an atypical variant of osteogenesis imperfecta most resembling type III, if not its own disease. Multiple gene mutations associated with osteogenesis imperfecta are not seen in Bruck syndrome. Many affected individuals are within the same family, and pedigree data supports that the disease is acquired through autosomal recessive inheritance. Bruck syndrome has features of congenital contractures, bone fragility, recurring bone fractures, flexion joint and limb deformities, pterygia, short body height, and progressive kyphoscoliosis. Individuals encounter restricted mobility and pulmonary function. A reduction in <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> and larger hydroxyapatite crystals are also detectable Joint contractures are primarily bilateral and symmetrical, and most prone to ankles.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between physical activity, calcium intake, and <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> in children. DESIGN [...] Population based, cross sectional study. SETTING [...] Primary schools in Zoetermeer, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS [...] Altogether 1359 Dutch boys and girls, aged 7 to 11 years (response rate 88 %). MEASUREMENTS [...] <b>Bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> was measured by quantitative roentgen microdensitometry of the midphalanx of the second digit at the diaphyseal and metaphyseal site. Maximal exercise testing, according to the Bruce treadmill protocol, {{was used to assess}} physical fitness. Habitual physical activity was assessed by use of a questionnaire on physical activities. Daily calcium intake from dairy products was estimated by use of a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. MAIN RESULTS [...] <b>Bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> in boys was not linearly associated with physical fitness after adjustments for differences in height, body weight, chronological age, and skeletal age. In girls a linear association was found at the metaphyseal site only. When extreme groups were compared, <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> was found to be higher in "high fitness children" (upper decile) than "low fitness children" (lowest decile), with statistical significance reached in boys only. When analyses were performed in subgroups of skeletal age, a clear linear relation between physical fitness and <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> was seen in the mature subgroup in both boys and girls. No linear association was found between habitual physical activity and <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content,</b> while the results in extreme groups (that is, upper versus lowest decile) and in subgroups of skeletal age were comparable to those on physical fitness in boys only. No association was found between daily calcium intake and <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> in this age group. CONCLUSIONS [...] This cross sectional study in children aged 7 to 11 years suggests that an increased <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> is found only in those {{with a high level of}} physical activity. This association is most pronounced in the more mature children. No evidence was found for an association between daily calcium intake and <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> in childhood...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> in well nourished {{patients}} with cystic fibrosis {{and to seek}} a correlation with fat-free mass. METHODS: Fourteen cystic fibrosis patients aged 6 to 20 years were studied and compared to 14 healthy controls matched for gender, age, and nutritional status. <b>Bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> was determined by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DEXA). RESULTS: Nutritional inquiry showed higher ingestion of macronutrients and micronutrients by cystic fibrosis patients than by controls. Mean whole skeleton <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> was 1. 184 (SD 0. 536) kg in cystic fibrosis patients and 1. 229 (0. 576) kg in controls (p = 0. 84). Mean lumbar spine <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> was 0. 031 (0. 013) kg and 0. 031 (0. 016) kg, respectively (p = 0. 99). Anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and DEXA showed that fat-free mass was similar in the two groups. <b>Bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> was strongly correlated to fat-free mass. Mean blood calcium, phosphorus, serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 -OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and osteocalcin were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> and body composition are normal in a well nourished young cystic fibrosis population.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{compare the}} {{relationship}} of skeletal muscle mass with <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> in an ethnically diverse group of 6 to 18 year old boys and girls. Methods 175 healthy children (103 boys; 72 girls) had assessments of body mass, height, and Tanner stage. Whole body <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content,</b> non-bone lean body mass (nbLBM), skeletal muscle mass, and fat mass were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Muscle mass was estimated from an equation using appendicular lean soft tissue measured by DXA, weight and height. Estimates of skeletal muscle mass and adipose tissue were also assessed by whole body multi-slice magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Linear regression {{was used to determine}} whether skeletal muscle mass assessed by DXA or by MRI were better predictors of <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> compared with nbLBM after adjusting for sex, age, race or ethnicity, and Tanner stage. Results Greater skeletal muscle mass was associated with greater <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> (p 2 statistic) compared with assessment by DXA for predicting <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content.</b> The proportion of skeletal muscle mass in nbLBM was significantly associated with greater <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> adjusted for total nbLBM. Conclusions This study is among the first to describe and compare {{the relationship of}} skeletal muscle to bone using both MRI and DXA estimates. The results demonstrate that the use of MRI provides a modestly better fitting model for the relationship of skeletal muscle to bone compared with DXA. Skeletal muscle had an impact on <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> independent of total non-bone lean body mass.

40|$|Osteoporosis, an {{important}} health problem, essentially concerns postmenopausal women since {{women have a}} lower peak bone mass than men when they reach adulthood and since the menopause is associated with an accelerated bone loss.

The <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> and densities of the mid- and distal radius (BMC m-rad, BMD m-rad, BMC d-rad, BMD d-rad) and of the lumbar L 2 -L 4 vertebra (BMC L 2 -L 4, BMD L 2 -L 4) were measured using single and dual photon absorptiometer, respectively. The relations between age, height, weight, body mass index and the bone measurements were studied using multiple regression analyses. The anthropometric factors were accepted as first factors in the equations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the anti{{osteoporosis}} effects of garlic oil in an ovariectomized (Ovx) rat model of osteoporosis and to compare its efficacy with lovastatin (a synthetic hypocholesterolemic drug) and 17 β -estradiol (a potent antiosteoporotic agent). Animals were divided into five groups: sham-operated control, ovariectomized, ovariectomized supplemented with lovastatin, ovariectomized supplemented with garlic oil and ovariectomized supplemented with 17 β -estradiol. In our study, the development of a high rate of bone turnover and osteoporosis in the ovariectomized animals were confirmed by significant alterations of serum alkaline phosphatase activity, serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, hydroxyproline and urinary calcium to creatinine ratio, when compared with the shamoperated control group. Supplementation of these animals with either garlic oil or lovastatin or 17 β -estradiol, in addition to their hypocholesterolemic effect, could counterbalance all these changes. The results revealed that all three compounds significantly protected the hypogonadal bone loss as reflected by higher bone densities and higher <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>contents</b> than the ovariectomized group of animals. The results emphasize that, like 17 β -estradiol, the hypocholesterolemic compounds garlic oil and lovastatin are also effective in suppressing bone loss owing to estrogen deficiency and their efficacy in the order of lower to higher is garlic < lovastatin < 17 β -estradiol.
