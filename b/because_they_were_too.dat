5|$|Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and {{his system}} was largely {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.|$|E
5|$|Lee’s army {{fought a}} series of battles in the Appomattox Campaign against Grant that {{ultimately}} stretched thin his lines of defense. Lee's extended lines were mostly on small sections of thirty miles of strongholds around Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. His troops ultimately became exhausted defending this line <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> thinned out. Grant then {{took advantage of the}} situation and launched attacks on this thirty mile long poorly defended front. This ultimately led to the surrender of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, the French {{utilized}} large column formations {{against the}} rebels, a tactic which the French chief-of-staff of the Army of the Levant, General André-Gaston Prételat, {{found to be}} generally ineffective against small mobile rebel units. Instead, he believed the optimal way to defeat the rebels was to recruit local militias who would share the two main strengths of the rebels: knowledge of the terrain and high mobility. However, the Syrian gendarmerie conscripted by the French military could not defeat the rebels <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> small numerically, and not entirely reliable in battles against fellow locals.|$|E
50|$|Disproportionality - The socialist {{economics}} had {{a disproportionate}} amount of available jobs and manpower. As written by Ljubo Sirc, “… The Soviet Union and other communist countries {{have the worst}} of both worlds: some enterprises or operations <b>are</b> inefficient <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> labour-intensive”.|$|R

5|$|The stave churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> small to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E
5|$|Although a real ninja wears {{black to}} be inconspicuous, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange {{jumpsuit}} {{to fit the}} shōnen genre. His wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger. According to him, a pre-existing design {{would not have made}} Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him too distinctive. Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses, the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume. Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes. The goggles Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> time-consuming to draw. One of the most difficult design choices was the color palette of Naruto's outfit. The orange in his costume makes Naruto pop and the blue parts are complementary. Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, as he considered it too difficult to animate.|$|E
5|$|Some pre-Code movies {{suffered}} {{irreparable damage}} from censorship after 1934. When studios attempted to re-issue films from the 1920s and early 1930s, {{they were forced}} to make extensive cuts. Films such as Mata Hari (1931), Arrowsmith (1931), and A Farewell to Arms (1932) exist only in their censored versions. Many other films survived intact <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> controversial to be re-released, such as The Maltese Falcon (1931), which was remade a decade later with the same name, and thus never had their master negatives edited. In the case of Convention City (1933), which Breen would not allow to be re-released in any form, the entire film remains missing. Although it has been rumored that all prints and negatives were ordered destroyed by Jack Warner in the late thirties, further research shows the negative was in the vaults as late as 1948 when it was junked due to nitrate decomposition.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>too</b> securely fixed to the rock.|$|R

25|$|The DE2 {{design was}} popular with {{steelworks}} {{and continued to}} be built until 1965. Small numbers of the DE1 and DE4 were built but were superseded in 1955 and 1956 by new designs with Rolls-Royce engines. No locomotives were built to the DE3 design, probably <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> big and heavy for use on normal railway work.|$|E

25|$|The {{victory of}} Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War (1870) caused {{a shift in}} the {{politics}} of Austria.

Instead, Emperor Joseph turned to Conservatives willing to conciliate with Slavs. New York: The MacMillan Company, 1929. 372. Hohenwart, as leader of the Conservative Federalists, was chosen in order to placate the Slavs with a new federalist system. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1951. 59. Also, Emperor Francis Joseph saw Federalism as a way to undercut the Austro-German Liberals.|$|E

25|$|On Tuesday, September 4, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, adelantado of La Florida, {{set sail}} from the harbor of St. Augustine, and {{coasting}} north, came upon four vessels {{lying at anchor}} off {{the mouth of a}} river. These were Jean Ribault's flagship, the Trinity, and three others of his ships, which the Frenchman had left {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> large to pass the bars in safety. One of them was flying the Admiral's flag, another the flag of the Captain. Menéndez recognized at once that the French reinforcements had arrived before him, and called a council of his captains to consider what action should be taken.|$|E
25|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the various LM-1 revisions. The Rev. 1 LM-1 is recognizable by its engraved buttons and lack of Shuffle and Auto-Correct LEDs. The drum buttons were engraved with a small symbol of the drum it represented (the bass drum button had a small engraving of a bass drum on it). These buttons were later discontinued <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> expensive to manufacture. Internally it was different as well. It had single chips for the kick, tom, and conga sounds, and double chips for the clap. The Rev. 1 LM-1's {{did not have the}} filter on the kick, toms, and congas that Rev. 2 and later machines had. As a result, it didn't sound as nice as the Rev. 2 and later machines, but the toms and congas could be played simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} Indochinese soldiers, {{auxiliaries}} first, and then regular troops, {{had been present}} {{since the beginning of}} French conquest. French troops were never numerically sufficient to assert control of the populace and then maintain Pax Gallica in the colony, thus requiring local reinforcements. Home grown French troops were lacking <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> expensive for Paris and Hanoi, in contrast to the substantially cheaper native troops. A lack of manpower back in Europe caused by other imperial programs and the demographic trough caused by mass casualties in World War I on the Western Front further caused a need for the recruitment of Indochinese troops. Because French Indochina was a domination and exploitation colony rather than a settler colony, the pool of local Frenchmen was far too small to build a settler-army. Native troops generally knew the land and people much better, could be used in terrain on which foreign troops were disadvantaged. They were far more abundant than French born troops, whose deployment to Indochina was time consuming, expensive and risky. Aside from the risks associated with the closure of sea lanes, the emergency dispatch of metropolitan troops from Paris could not be taken for granted. Particularly after 1915, French Indochina was expected to financially contribute to the defence of the colony and even to send native troops to France.|$|E

500|$|Edge and Eurogamer's Welsh faulted the {{morality}} system {{because they did}} not think it had enough influence on the story. IGN's Ingenito called it [...] "woefully outdated", and felt that making evil choices severely jarred with Delsin's character. He found the system redundant because Delsin became more powerful when he strictly adhered to either a good or evil play-style, rather than crossing in-between. GameSpot's Mc Shea felt that {{the morality}} system was too binary because there was no [...] "moral gray area" [...] between playing good and evil. Polygon's Kollar reflected Mc Shea's opinion that the morality choices were too binary, and had difficulty connecting to his choices <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> polarized between good and evil. OPM's Meikleham felt that the morality system had [...] "little to no impact on gameplay". Danny Cowan of Joystiq thought that the morality system was well-balanced, with equal incentive and drawback tied to Delsin's choices.|$|E
500|$|In Karnick's eyes, {{contemporary}} {{critics have}} failed {{to see how the}} film has affected audiences and subsequently branded the film series as [...] "both irresponsible (for numbing audiences to violence) and puritanical (for showing the murders of sexually active teens)". Quoting director John Carpenter, Karnick emphasized that [...] "teens thus dispatched became victims not as punishment for sexual activity but simply <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> preoccupied to notice the presence of a murderer". Pointing to Roger Ebert as a prime example of how critics have misunderstood the films (Ebert wrote that during a screening of Friday the 13th Part 2, he noticed that the audience had no sympathy for the victims and cheered during death scenes), Karnick explains that Ebert's remarks show how the film series forces [...] "audiences to experience the very thing that motivates the murders: a lack of compassion". In closing, Karnick suggested that these films were not puritanical, but proved that audiences [...] "could be just as indifferent and callous as the characters in the films".|$|E
