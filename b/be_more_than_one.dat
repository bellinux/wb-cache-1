5|$|Apart from Goloka and Patala, Kamadhenu is also {{described}} as {{residing in the}} hermitages of the sages Jamadagni and Vashista. Scholar Mani explains the contradicting stories of Kamadhenu's birth and presence in the processions of many gods and sages by stating that while there could <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> Kamadhenu, {{all of them are}} incarnations of the original Kamadhenu, the mother of cows.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> way to continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|While {{experimenting with}} the {{products}} of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> type of atom at each position on the periodic table. The term isotope was coined by Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that {{belong to the same}} element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of stable isotopes.|$|E

5|$|Many parasites {{latch onto}} whales, notably whale lice and whale barnacles. Almost all species of whale lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of whale, and there can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> species per whale. Whale lice eat dead skin, resulting in minor wounds in the skin. Whale louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, whale barnacles latch onto {{the skin of}} a whale during their larval stage. However, in doing so it does not harm nor benefit the whale, so their relationship is often labeled as an example of commensalism. Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and whale barnacles, attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic diatom, Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
5|$|Where ν and Ediff are as {{described}} above, Γ is the jump or hopping rate, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Ediff must be {{smaller than the}} energy of desorption for diffusion to occur, otherwise desorption processes would dominate. Importantly, equation 1 tells us how very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature. The manner in which diffusion takes place {{is dependent on the}} relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor: when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion. This case, known as mobile diffusion, is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems. For the phenomena described throughout this article, it is assumed that Ediff >> kBT and therefore Γ << ν. In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the ν and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, D, versus 1/T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present (see below), there may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature.|$|E

25|$|Knots can be {{described}} in various ways. Given a method of description, however, there may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> description that represents the same knot.
