500|$|The type {{of letters}} written with {{a tone of}} incensed moral outrage have become {{commonly}} described as [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] letters, even though the writer may not be from Royal Tunbridge Wells. For example, actor Michael Caine once said: [...] "I don't want to sound like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> {{there should be some}} sort of national service for young men". People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the Daily Mail, despite the original letters not originating in that publication.|$|E
500|$|Sean Gregory of Time {{wrote of}} Lin's zero Division I {{scholarship}} offers: [...] " [...] was scrawny, but don't doubt {{that a little}} racial profiling, intentional or otherwise, contributed to his underrecruitment." [...] Diepenbrock stated, [...] "If [...] was African American or Caucasian, {{it might have been}} a different deal"; he did not think Lin's race affected his recruiting until later seeing 10 Division I coaches express interest in a black student who Diepenbrock assessed as [...] "a nice junior college player". Lin said: [...] "I'm not saying top-5 state automatically gets you offers, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> [...] did affect the way coaches recruited me. I think if I were a different race, I would've been treated differently." [...] Walters added, [...] "People who don't think stereotypes exist are crazy. If [...] white, he's either a good shooter or heady. If he's Asian, he's good at math. We're not taking him." [...] During Lin's college career, fewer than 0.5% of men's Division 1 basketball players were Asian-American.|$|E
500|$|Several {{historians and}} {{commentators}} hold {{the view that}} Bush {{was one of the}} most consequential presidents in American history. Princeton University scholar Julian Zelizer described Bush's presidency as a [...] "transformative" [...] one, and said that [...] "some people hate him, some people love him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> he'll have a much more substantive perception as time goes on". Bryon Williams of The Huffington Post referred to Bush as [...] "the most noteworthy president since FDR" [...] and said that the Patriot Act [...] "increased authority of the executive branch at the expense of judicial opinions about when searches and seizures are reasonable" [...] as evidence. Bush's administration presided over the largest tax cuts since the Reagan administration, and his homeland security reforms proved to be the most significant expansion of the federal government since the Great Society. Much of these policies have endured in the administrations of his two immediate successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. A 2010 Siena Research Institute survey of the opinions of historians, political scientists, and presidential scholars ranked him 39th out of 43 presidents. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence.|$|E

500|$|The {{style of}} Uematsu's {{compositions}} is diverse, ranging from stately classical symphonic pieces and heavy metal to new-age and hyper-percussive techno-electronica. For example, in Lost Odyssey, the score ranges from classical orchestral arrangements to contemporary jazz and techno tracks. Uematsu {{has stated that}} he is a big fan of Celtic and Irish music, and some of his work contains elements from these musical styles. Uematsu's Final Fantasy scores vary from upbeat, to dark and angry, to melancholic in nature. For instance, the music of Final Fantasy VIII is dark and gloomy, while the soundtrack to Final Fantasy IX is more carefree and upbeat. His Final Fantasy music has been described as being able to convey the true emotion of a scene; an example is [...] "Aerith's Theme" [...] from Final Fantasy VII. In an interview with the Nichi Bei Times, Uematsu said [...] "I don't really self-consciously compose music for Japan or for the world, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> there is something in my more melancholy pieces that has a distinctly Japanese quality." [...] He has been named one of the [...] "Innovators" [...] in Time Magazines [...] "Time 100: The Next Wave — Music" [...] feature. He has also been called the [...] "John Williams of the video game world" [...] and been credited for [...] "increasing the appreciation and awareness" [...] of video game music.|$|E

Creativity is everywhere. ... The initial idea for a job comes to me literally just like that sometimes, and if that first idea is good then you are on the right track. It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> a lot of creativity depends on your relationships with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or whatever. Your personal happiness or unhappiness comes out in your work, it's a reflection of your emotional state and you can't separate the two." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, Hopkins {{suggested}} that African American fighters who possessed {{what he described}} as a [...] "slick" [...] inner-city style of fighting would be successful against Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao. [...] "Maybe I'm biased because I'm black, but I think that this is what is said at people's homes and around the dinner table among black boxing fans and fighters. Most of them won't say it [...] because they're not being real and they don't have the balls to say it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that a fighter like the Ray Leonards or anyone like that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game.

She is not married and is a {{surrogate}} aunt to the Ryans' two daughters. In 1991, she said: [...] "I'm afraid of marriage because I'm afraid someone might want me because of who I am instead of because they loved me... I wouldn't go rushing into anything unexpected, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> {{a great deal about}} this". Her relationship with a Spanish man ended in 1997, around the time when she considered taking time out of music to have a family, but found she was putting pressure on herself over the matter and [...] "gone the route I wanted to go". [...] She declares herself as [...] "more spiritual than religious... I derive from religion what I enjoy." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{passing on}} the 2009 NFL Draft for his senior season at Florida, Tebow went on to enter the 2010 NFL Draft. Despite his college success, Tebow's NFL {{potential}} was much debated. According to former Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden, who said he could [...] "revolutionize" [...] the pro game. Says Gruden: [...] "Tim Tebow is 250 pounds, and he's the strongest human being that's ever played the position. He can throw well enough at any level." [...] Former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy said he would pick Tebow with a top 10 pick over any quarterback in the 2010 Draft. However, NFL analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. believed Tebow {{did not have the}} intangibles to play quarterback in the NFL. [...] "I don't think he can be a fulltime quarterback. I don't think he can be the quarterback of the future for you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> in the third round, maybe the second round, he'll be the same as Pat White", said Kiper.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once I was free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, let me put it that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 14, 2013, Kid Ink {{announced}} his first project released by RCA, a digital-only EP titled Almost Home, {{which it was}} released on May 28, 2013. The EP featured artists, such as French Montana, Wale, Meek Mill, ASAP Ferg and Rico Love, among others. Upon its release, the EP debuted at number 27 on the US Billboard 200 and it has sold 15,000 copies in its first week. It {{was supported by the}} single's [...] "Bad Ass" [...] and [...] "Money and the Power" [...] both will be included on the deluxe edition of My Own Lane.

2500|$|Chomsky {{was always}} {{critical}} of the Soviet Union and he does now accept that Mao's regime in China was responsible for 'a huge death toll, {{in the tens of}} millions'. However, back in 1960s, Chomsky was considerably less {{critical of the}} communist movements in Asia, noting what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, [...] "I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. There are many things to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable." [...] Chomsky continued: [...] "There are even better examples than China. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which {{a good deal of the}} collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step." [...] He said of Vietnam: [...] "Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carlo Santos of Anime News Network {{felt that}} the dead baby trope and pushover protagonists were {{overused}} by Tatsumi to elicit emotion. He also criticized the choice to flip the art. Santos concludes that [...] "although the stories hammer the same point over and over again, and seemingly with the same character each time, their brutal honesty and stark settings will be a refreshing change for readers who wonder {{whatever happened to the}} diversity of the [...] artform." [...] Tim O'Neil of PopMatters noted the dark and misanthropic themes in the stories, but said that Tatsumi distinguishes himself with the longer stories, especially [...] "Who Are You", because of their [...] "narrative lyricism" [...] and [...] "subjectivity". Grant Goodman of Comics Village felt that Tatsumi's characters were portrayed through his art rather than dialogue, saying of his stories: [...] "I cannot call any of them particularly excellent, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that Tatsumi's style is refreshing and a welcome alternative to the style of current manga best-sellers." [...] Ng Suat Tong of the Hooded Utilitarian criticized the art, describing it as [...] "crude, inexperienced and laid down with the kind of haste which begets mistakes" [...] as well as the predictable misogyny in the stories and their linear structure, especially disliking [...] "Telescope". Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order podcast {{felt that the}} stories in the manga were a product of postwar Japan and difficult to identify with in a modern context, adding that the although the stories are similar, they are more concentrated due to their short length. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly compared the tone of the stories as [...] "between contemporary short fiction and EC Comics' old 'shock' comics", noting the theme of social maladjustment and complimenting Tatsumi's [...] "evocative settings" [...] and the flow of his stories. Andrew D. Arnold of Time complimented the naturalism of the stories and art, but disliked the misogyny present in the men's relationships, concluding that the collection [...] "feels as fresh and revelatory as when the works of Japanese cinema first began arriving in the U.S." [...] R.C. Baker of The Village Voice said that the manga's expressive art helped speak for its silent characters and that the subject matter distinguished itself from modern Japanese popular culture: [...] "A fearless spelunker of the id, Tatsumi delves beneath the button-down uniformity of Japan's legions of office drones." [...] Tom Rosin of Manga Life was reminded of kitchen sink films by the stories and called Tatsumi a [...] "master of the short story", saying that the manga [...] "is so unlike the Japanese comics we're accustomed to now, and such a strong example of his early work I find it slightly terrifying that this book only contains selections of his best comics from 1969!" [...] David Cozy of the Asahi Herald Tribune felt that manga was distinguished from literature with the eight-page limit—which forced Tatsumi to distill his stories and was appropriate for representing his [...] "characters' constricted lives"—as well as with the identifiable [...] "everyman" [...] in his art.|$|E
