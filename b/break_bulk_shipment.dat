Farmers dry the coffee cherries whole, {{for up to three}} weeks. After the drying, the dry cherries are hulled. Farmers sell the cherries to collectors, who sell them to both exporters and for sale on the domestic market. The exporters dry the crop to 12 to 13% moisture, and it is then sorted and graded. Exports are usually made in <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>shipments,</b> rather than in containers as with C. arabica.|$|R
