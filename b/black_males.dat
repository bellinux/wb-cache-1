5|$|The Rosewood {{massacre}} was {{a racially}} motivated massacre {{of black people}} and destruction of a black town that {{took place during the}} first week of January 1923 in rural Levy County, Florida. At least six black people and two white people were killed, though eyewitness accounts suggested a death toll as high as 150. The town of Rosewood was abandoned and destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Racial disturbances were common during the early 20th century in the United States, reflecting the nation's rapid social changes. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of <b>black</b> <b>males</b> in the years before the massacre, including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.|$|E

40|$|This study theorizes how <b>Black</b> <b>male</b> {{students}} narrate {{their experiences}} at a traditionally White institution (TWI). To date, research focusing on Black men {{in higher education}} highlights the continual struggles of Black men against racism (Feagin, Vera, 2 ̆ 6 Imani, 1996; Harper, 2006, 2009, 2012; Smith, Yosso, 2 ̆ 6 Solórzano, 2007); however, what remains to be extensively theorized is <b>Black</b> <b>male</b> academic excellence. Thus, I {{argue that it is}} vital to progressively broaden what we know about <b>Black</b> <b>male</b> students as intellectuals. In this study I forefront how <b>Black</b> <b>male</b> students articulate their intellectual identities and educational experiences on a traditionally White campus. Guided by critical race theory (CRT), this study positions <b>Black</b> <b>male</b> undergraduate interviewees to speak to the following themes: 1) racism as everyday, 2) <b>Black</b> <b>male</b> students 2 ̆ 7 educational experiences, and 3) counterstories that resist dominant racial ideologies. Their narratives are crucial because the voices and experiences of <b>Black</b> <b>male</b> students are often marginalized in higher education in general, and the field of communication in particular. Ultimately, insight gained from this study encourages scholars to include <b>Black</b> <b>male</b> students who academically excel in the realm of academic inquiry, especially scholars who have an interest in the success of <b>Black</b> <b>male</b> students...|$|R

Similar debate has occurred {{as to whether he}} should be described as a black author, given his status as a best-selling writer. Mosley has said that he prefers to be called a novelist. He explains his desire to write about [...] "black male heroes" [...] saying [...] "hardly anybody in America has written about <b>black</b> <b>male</b> heroes...

25|$|While {{the general}} {{bisexual}} {{population as a}} whole faces biphobia, this oppression is also aggravated by other factors such as race. In his examination of the bisexual male perspective, entitled, Managing Heterosexism and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective, Grady L. Garner delves into the oppression that he faces as both a black and bisexual male. He explains that the internalization of negative sociocultural messages, reactions, and attitudes can be incredibly distressing as bisexual <b>black</b> <b>males</b> attempted to translate or transform these negative experiences into positive bisexual identity sustaining ones. The experience of bisexual <b>black</b> <b>males</b> is different from that of bisexual white males. As the demands and tribulations of black bisexual males appear to be comparatively more distressing than those that black and white, homo- and heterosexual individual's encounter, this acknowledgement is important and vital to the understanding of biphobia from an intersectional perspective.|$|E

40|$|As America’s K- 12 student {{population}} continues {{to become more}} diverse, {{it is important that}} the ethnic background of the teacher population reflect this change. A crucial aspect of this diversification effort includes <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers. ^ The purpose of this study was to explore and examine the experiences and perspectives of African American male K- 12 teachers. In doing so, this study would help to tell us more about their identities, teachings and relationships with other educational staff and students. Other secondary focus areas include <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teacher experiences within their educational settings and how <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers describe their relationships with minority students-especially males. ^ In conducting the study one-on-one face-to-face interviews were conducted along with participant observations. Emergent themes that surfaced were: lack of <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers, being the only <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teacher, being a role model, being a disciplinarian, and teaching being a gendered and ethnic dominated profession. The participants highlighted issues that questioned notions of gender matching teachers and students along with debating the assurance of acceptance of <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers from minority students solely on the basis of their ethnic background. Additionally, participants described issues of ascribed and self-defined identities as <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers. ^ Findings in this study can be used by teacher preparation programs, educational policy makers and administrators to facilitate positive change in the continued diversification of America’s teacher workforce for the purpose of improving academic achievement for K- 12 students. ...|$|R
25|$|Black feminist {{criminology}} is {{the solution}} to this problem. It takes four factors into account: One, it observes the social structural oppression of Black women. Two, it recognizes the Black community and its culture. Three, it looks at Black intimate and familial relations. And four, it looks at the Black woman as an individual. These four factors will help distinguish Black women from <b>Black</b> <b>males</b> into an accurate branch of learning in the criminal justice system.|$|E

Members of the group acted as activists, curators and promoters to challenge the white establishment of the art world; their art drew on the language both of American Black Nationalism and indigenous English identity, while they simultaneously challenged Black culture itself to move away from being defined by heterosexual <b>black</b> <b>males.</b>|$|E
40|$|While {{a chorus}} of teacher {{education}} programs, urban school districts, and educational scholars has called for more <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers to serve as role models and father figures for black students, the amount of empirical research on {{what it means for}} <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers to meet these expectations remains relatively small. The extant body of work, while certainly addressing important concerns, has left heteropatriarchal and racially essentialist assumptions of the roles of <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers largely unchallenged. Grounded in life history narrative inquiry and informed by black masculinity studies and critical educational theory, this study reveals how dominant cultural and institutional constructions of black manhood were used by a variety of stakeholders to promote, prescribe, and police the participation of eleven <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers in secondary, predominantly minority urban schools, thus forcing these teachers into complex negotiations of their identities and pedagogies. Critical insights from this study fall into three sets of findings: (i) the master narrative on the significance of <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers anticipated and offered insights into some {{of the ways in which}} participants 2 ̆ 7 identities and pedagogics were constructed as black men in the teaching profession; (ii) the master narrative on <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers presumed a black identity politics that policed and complicated study participants 2 ̆ 7 engagements in the teaching profession; and (iii) the master narrative on <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers reproduced patriarchal gender ideologies that fueled challenging negotiations of power with students and women colleagues. In all, these findings illuminate competing discourses on black masculinity that, in addition to circumscribing the lives of study participants, may affect other black men in the urban teaching profession. By assuming a critical stance on race and gender, this study complicates cursory valorizations of <b>black</b> <b>male</b> teachers as role models by exploring black masculinity as a contested terrain of privilege and marginality for <b>black</b> <b>male</b> educators. In so doing, this study also surfaces invaluable perspectives for teacher education programs, school districts, and policymakers who want to devise tangible strategies for attracting, supporting, and retaining more black men in urban classrooms. ...|$|R

40|$|In higher education, the <b>black</b> <b>male</b> {{experience}} is understudied. This phenomenological study explored {{the experience and}} meaning of <b>black</b> <b>male</b> doctoral students at a predominantly white university. The study was guided by two central research questions: 1) How do <b>black</b> <b>male</b> doctoral students, {{in the state of}} Florida, experience attending a predominantly white university? 2) What kind of conflict, if any, do <b>black</b> <b>male</b> doctoral students encounter in higher education? This research included face-to-face interviews with ten <b>black</b> <b>male</b> doctoral students, from various disciplines, at a predominantly white university in the state of Florida. Scholarly academic literature, coupled with four theoretical frameworks, inform this study’s research design and data analysis. This study utilized Johan Galtung’s (1969) theory of structural violence; Arthur Chickering’s (1969) theory of identity development, experienced at the collegiate level; Jean Phinney’s (1993) three stage model of ethnic identity development, {{as it relates to the}} lived experiences of <b>black</b> <b>male</b> doctoral students in higher education; and Derrick Bell and Alan Freeman’s (Delgado, 1994) critical race theory, which emphasizes conflict in race, racism, and power. The analysis of the data indicated that the essence of the {{experience is}} participants search for support from feeling isolated from the majority of the population of students. The underlying themes of racism, support, financial stability, identity, and the environment of the institution engender the need for such support. Conflict practitioners, administrators, and educators seeking to improve student development, discourage racial disparities, and prevent educational injustice, for <b>black</b> <b>male</b> doctoral students, will benefit from this study and findings...|$|R
25|$|While Pager’s {{study is}} greatly informative, it does lack some {{valuable}} information. Pager only studied white and <b>black</b> <b>males,</b> which leaves out women {{and people of}} other races. It also fails {{to account for the}} fact that applying for jobs has largely shifted from applying in person to applying over the Internet. A study done by Scott H. Decker, Cassia Spohn, Natalie R. Ortiz, and Eric Hedberg from Arizona State University in 2014 accounts for this missing information. This study was set up similarly to the Pager study, but with the addition of female job applicants, Hispanic job applicants, and online job applications. Men and women of white, black, and Hispanic ethnicities account for 92% of the US prison population.|$|E
25|$|Although incarceration {{in general}} {{has a huge}} effect on employment, the effects become even more {{pronounced}} when looking at race.

Black men with no criminal background have a harder time finding employment than white men who have a history of criminal activity. While having a criminal record decreases the chance of a callback for white men by 50%, it decreases the callback chances for black men by 64%.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} some of the church's most {{damaging}} publicity {{had to do with the}} church's policy of discrimination toward blacks. Blacks were always officially welcome in the church, and Joseph Smith established an early precedent of ordained <b>black</b> <b>males</b> to the Priesthood. Smith was also anti-slavery, going so far as to run on an anti-slavery platform as candidate for the presidency of the United States. At times, however, Smith had shown sympathy toward a belief common in his day that blacks were the cursed descendants of Cain. In 1849, church doctrine taught that though blacks could be baptized, they and others could not be ordained to the Priesthood or enter LDS temples. Journal histories and public teachings of the time reflect that Young and others stated that God would some day reverse this policy of discrimination. It is also important to note that while blacks as a whole were specifically withheld from priesthood blessings (although there were some exceptions to this policy in both the 1800s and 1900s), other races and genealogical lineages were also prohibited from holding the priesthood.|$|E

25|$|The giant {{trevally}} reaches {{sexual maturity}} at 54 to 61cm {{in length and}} {{three to four years}} of age, although many authors narrow this down to 60cm and three years of age. Sex ratio estimates from the Hawaiian Islands suggest the population is slightly skewed toward females, with the male:female ratio being 1:1.39. Spawning occurs during the warmer months in most locations, although the exact dates differ by location. In southern Africa, this occurs between July and March, with a peak between November and March; in the Philippines between December and January, with a lesser peak during June; and in Hawaii between April and November, with a major peak during May to August. Lunar cycles are also known to control the spawning events, with large schools forming in certain locations at specific phases of the moon in Hawaii and the Solomon Islands. Locations for spawning include reefs, the reef channels and offshore banks. Sampling of schools prior to spawning suggests the fish segregate into schools of only one sex, although the details are still unclear. Observations in the natural habitat found spawning occurred during the day immediately after and just before the change of tide when there were no currents. Giant trevally gathered in schools of over 100 individuals, although ripe individuals occurred slightly deeper; around 2–3 m above the seabed in groups of three or four, with one silver female being chased by several <b>black</b> <b>males.</b> Eventually, a pair would sink down to a sandy bottom, where eggs and sperm were released. The fish then diverged and swam away. Each individual appears to spawn more than once in each period, with only part of the gonads ripe in spawners. Fecundity is not known, although females are known to release several thousand eggs on capture during the spawning process. Eggs are described as pelagic and transparent in nature.|$|E
