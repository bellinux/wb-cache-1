40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{quantify}} to what extent the scar tissue formation following the transfer of flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) to the distal tendon of extensor carpi radialis (ECR) affects the force transmission from transferred FCU in the rat. Five weeks after recovery from surgery (tendon transfer group) and in a control group, isometric length–force characteristics of FCU were assessed for progressive stages of dissection: (i) with minimally disrupted connective tissues, (ii) after full dissection of FCU distal tendon exclusively, and (iii) after additional partial dissection of FCU muscle belly. Total and passive length–force characteristics of transferred and control FCU changed significantly <b>by</b> <b>progressive</b> <b>stages</b> of dissection. In both groups, tendon dissection decreased passive FCU force exerted at the distal tendon, as well as the slope of the length–force curve. However, force and slope changes were more pronounced for transferred FCU compared to controls. No additional changes occurred after muscle belly dissection. In contrast, total force increased in transferred FCU following both tendon and muscle belly dissection at all lengths studied, while dissection decreased total force of control FCU. In addition, after tendon and muscle belly dissection, we found decreased muscle belly lengths at equal muscle–tendon complex lengths of transferred FCU. We conclude that scar tissue limits the force transmission from transferred FCU muscle via the tendon of insertion to the skeleton, but that some myofascial connectivity of the muscle should be classified as physiological...|$|E
40|$|Human {{history is}} marked <b>by</b> <b>progressive</b> <b>stages</b> of {{dominant}} human interrelation patterns. Marx examined these patterns {{and believed that}} history could {{be understood as a}} variation on a Fichtian science of material dialectics where a thesis would meet its antithesis, and a new synthesis would emerge from the violent struggle found at their intersection. This dissertation takes a slightly different perspective, concentrating on the contemporary stage of dominant human interrelation patterns, their origin, and consequences from an educational organisation perspective. This is an emerging discussion of the foundational and philosophical structures of interorganisational relationships involving educational administration. Beginning with a discussion of the origins and development of contemporary relational structures writ large—in terms of social, political, and economic antecedents—I show how their convergence around a dual falsehood has produced a self-perpetuating dominance in the modern era. The dual falsehood is manifest in the conflation of science and technology, and social Darwinist assumptions of human nature. Misunderstanding the nature of this dual falsehood, proponents of post-modernity are exposed as providing an anaemic or counterproductive response to the problems of modernity. I explore the particular problems of modernity faced by education as a general area of study and practice, and educational administration more specifically. The root of these problems is demonstrated in a misalignment of (a) dominant relational structures falsely self-declaring their basis in science, and (b) education as a genuine scientific pursuit (as defined herein). I further explore psychopathologies of relationships when negotiated in terms of such false self-declared and contextually dominant beliefs. The implications of psychopathological relationship negotiations are discussed for educational administration and strategies are explored for educational leadership and advocacy. Two stages of correction for the dominant issues described herein are posited on behalf of educational organisations. Stage one advocates the construction of a singular definition of pedagogy for public consumption. Stage two articulates areas of responsibility for various intraorganisational elements within education. The purpose of stage two is to disseminate widespread propaganda based upon Habermas’ (1970) communicative competence to eradicate dysfunctional communication that perpetuates the dominance of modern and post-modern relational structures. Furthermore, stage two advocates the adoption of Mouffe’s agonistic position for interorganisational relations between education and non-education entities. Stages are to be evaluated in terms of an adaptation upon Giddens’ (1979) analysis of sedimented practices of educational administration {{within the context of the}} Mouffian (2005) political...|$|E
50|$|In 1906 {{scenes from}} the play were given <b>by</b> the <b>Progressive</b> <b>Stage</b> Society of New York. The first US {{production}} of Peer Gynt opened at the Chicago Grand Opera House on October 24, 1906, and starred the noted actor Richard Mansfield, {{in one of his}} very last roles before his untimely death. In 1923, Joseph Schildkraut played the role on Broadway, in a Theatre Guild production, featuring Selena Royle, Helen Westley, Dudley Digges, and, before he entered films, Edward G. Robinson. In 1944, at the Old Vic, Ralph Richardson played the role, surrounded by some of the greatest British actors of the time in supporting or bit roles, among them Sybil Thorndike as Åse, and Laurence Olivier as the Button Molder. In 1951, John Garfield fulfilled his wish to star in a Broadway production, featuring Mildred Dunnock as Åse. Sadly, this production was not a success, and is said by some to have contributed to Garfield's death at age 39.|$|R

40|$|Autoantibodies are {{valuable}} markers for {{the recognition of}} autoimmune diseases. Over the last 25 years, several investigators have consistently shown that autoantibodies precede the clinical onset of cognate diseases by years or decades. This phenomenon, regularly observed in {{the natural history of}} autoimmune diseases, indicates that autoimmunity develops through successive stages across a variable period of time until the characteristic manifestations of disease are clinically apparent. Recent evidence indicates that the pre-clinical stages of autoimmune diseases involve a series of immunologic derangements and that this process is dynamic and progressive. During the years preceding clinical disease onset, there is progressive intensification in the humoral autoimmune response, characterized by increases in autoantibody titer, avidity, number of immunoglobulin isotypes, and spread of epitopes and of autoantigens targeted. This scenario is reminiscent of cancer processes that develop slowly <b>by</b> means of <b>progressive</b> <b>stages,</b> and may be interrupted by early detection and therapeutic intervention. Therefore, it might be reasoned that early intervention may be more effective in reverting the less firmly established autoimmune abnormalities at the pre-clinical stage of autoimmunity. With the continuous progress in novel immunologic therapeutic strategies, one can envision the possibility that early intervention at pre-clinical stages may lead to prevention of overt disease development and even cure of the autoimmune disorder.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{maturation}} {{phase of}} mammalian erythroid differentiation, highly proliferative cells {{committed to the}} erythroid lineage undergo dramatic changes in morphology and function to produce circulating, enucleated erythrocytes. These changes are caused by equally dramatic alterations in gene expression, which in turn are driven by changes in the abundance and binding patterns of transcription factors such as GATA 1.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the longitudinal angiogenic activity of subchondral bone and cartilage during {{the progression of}} osteoarthritis (OA) using a rabbit model of OA. Materials and methodsOA was surgically induced by anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT) in left knee of 12 months old female New Zealand white rabbits (n =  33). Histological examination, immunohistochemistry, and angiogenic activity assay was done at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 weeks after ACLT. Histologic evaluation was performed with haematoxylin and eosin, safranin-O staining to assess the OA change of medial femoral condyle (MFC) and lateral femoral condyle (LFC). CD 31 immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the vascular invasion at osteochondral junction. A co-cultured tubule formation assay was conducted to evaluate angiogenic activity of the subchondral bone and cartilage of MFC and LFC as well as synovium. Association between histological changes, angiogenic activity, and vascular invasion were evaluated. ResultsOA changes increased in a time-dependent manner both in MFC and LFC. Angiogenic activity of subchondral bone showed a monomodal change during the OA progression, achieved a peak {{in the early to}} <b>progressive</b> <b>stage</b> and decreased to normal level in the late stage of OA.
