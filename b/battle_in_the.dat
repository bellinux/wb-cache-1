The republic's inability to defend itself added momentum to Texas's eventual annexation into the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Moorefield was a cavalry <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American Civil War, {{which took}} place on August 7, 1864.

This Union triumph was the third of three major victories (Battle of Droop Mountain, Battle of Rutherford's Farm, and the Battle of Moorefield) for Brigadier General William W. Averell, who performed best when operating on his own.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Vijithapura was {{a decisive}} and major <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{campaign}} {{carried out by}} Sri Lankan king Dutthagamani against the invading South Indian king Elara.

5|$|The Persian fleet {{was still}} {{large enough to}} both bottle up the Allied navy in the straits of Salamis, and send ships to land troops in the Peloponnese. However, in the final reckoning, both sides were {{prepared}} to stake everything on a naval <b>battle,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of decisively altering {{the course of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|According to Muslim biographies, Muhammed, having {{received}} intelligence that Byzantine forces were concentrating in northern Arabia with alleged intentions of invading Arabia, led a Muslim army north to Tabouk in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia, {{with the intention}} of pre-emptively engaging the Byzantine army; the news, however, proved to be false. Though it was not a <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> typical sense, nevertheless the event represented the first Arab attack on the Byzantines. It did not, however, lead immediately to a military confrontation.|$|E

5|$|After this failure, Pyrrhus ravaged the Spartan {{hinterland}} whilst {{fending off}} counter-attacks by the victorious Spartans. On {{the invitation of}} an Argive ally, Pyrrhus attempted to seize Argos. The assault culminated in a fiasco with Pyrrhus being attacked by his Argive opponents, the pursuing Spartan army of Areus and a Macedonian army commanded by Antigonus Gonatas. Pyrrhus {{was killed in the}} ensuing <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets of Argos, ending Epiriote hopes of establishing a hegemony in Greece.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath was the {{location}} of the Battle of Arbroath in 1446. A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford and Bishop James Kennedy of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop's lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was excommunicated for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.|$|E
5|$|As a final factor, Lee faced {{a new and}} {{formidable}} {{opponent in}} George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as Winfield S. Hancock to make decisions where {{and when they were}} needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of fierce Confederate attacks.|$|E

5|$|At the Republican State Convention on March 22, 2014, Baker {{received}} 2,095 votes (82.708%), Fisher received 374 votes (14.765%) {{and there}} were 64 blank votes (2.527%). The threshold for making the ballot is 15% and the party announced that Baker had thus received the nomination {{without the need for}} a primary election. However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are not counted for the purposes of determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the ballot. He sued the Massachusetts Republican State Committee and was certified for the primary ballot after a lengthy <b>battle.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> primary election held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Cöln and Dresden {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers. They were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, and participated in an abortive fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys. They were to have led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet <b>battle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final days of the war, but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both Dresden and Cöln remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E

Separate statistics were kept for African Americans and Asian Americans.|$|E
