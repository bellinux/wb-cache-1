The girls got off at Walton-on-Thames railway station, one stop before Dowler's usual stop of Hersham, and went to eat at the station cafe. After Dowler telephoned her father at 3:47pm to say she would <b>be</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> half an hour, the girls left the cafe at 4:05, with Dowler walking home alone.
