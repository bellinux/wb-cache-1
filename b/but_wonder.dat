25|$|Filippo Maria Visconti, the Duke of Milan, has {{attended}} a ball, but he leaves early and encounters his assembled courtiers. He is bored with everyone; {{all seem to}} be paying obeisance to his wife because they regard her as the more powerful, his title and power having come only from his marriage to her: “Such torment and such martyrdom I cannot bear much longer”. His sycophantic courtiers tell him how much they sympathize <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> why he does not break free given his position as Duke. Also, they warn {{him that if he}} does not act, Beatrice's servants may well begin plotting against him.|$|E
500|$|Some critics, however, {{were less}} {{impressed}} by the album. Shirley Halperin of Rolling Stone offered a mixed review by giving the album a three-star rating and saying [...] "Clarkson isn't ready for her new sound." [...] She asked, [...] "You can't help <b>but</b> <b>wonder,</b> Who is the real Kelly Clarkson, and when will she stop wearing her big sister's hand-me-downs?" [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian gave it a two-star rating, saying that [...] "the title track expresses Clarkson's novel desire to [...] "spread my wings and learn to fly", but settles into a catchy enough rut at times." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{writer of}} Rap-Up {{magazine}} {{noted that the}} remix of the song which was featured on the mixtape Big R Ego was [...] "potent, but not quite fatal". Eskridge of Sister 2 Sister wrote in her review of the song that [...] "we can't help <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> why {{it would have been}} cut". Matthew Richardson of Prefix Magazine noted, [...] "As far as songs that got left in the studio, 'Poison' actually isn't that bad. The song's production isn't loud enough for this to be a single, but Beyonce sounds fine here." [...] Nia Beckwith of the website AllHipHop gave a positive review about the song, saying that it was [...] "the most noteworthy" [...] track she heard during the week of its premiere. She wrote, ...|$|E
500|$|Rick Ross drops by to say hi, {{keeping his}} {{appearance}} so brief that I can't help <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics {{that have nothing}} to do with the rest of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. But all that other stuff fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's a whirlwind of energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living fuck out of the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time." ...|$|E
500|$|In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) he was Indiana Jones' greaser son Mutt Williams. His {{performance}} {{was met with}} mixed reviews with Todd Gilchrist of IGN commenting [...] "one can't quite help <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> what Spielberg saw in the young actor that inspired him to cast LaBeouf". LaBeouf told the Los Angeles Times that he felt he as an actor [...] "dropped the ball" [...] on Jones' legacy, and [...] "there was a reason" [...] the film wasn't universally accepted. His next film was Eagle Eye, released on September 26. His performance received mixed reviews, with Josh Bell of Las Vegas Weekly saying he [...] "makes a credible bid for action-hero status, although his occasional stabs at emotional depth don't really go anywhere." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} on May 10, 1993 that The Who's Tommy had received eleven Tony Award nominations, tying with Kiss of the Spider Woman {{for the most}} nominations that year. Gaven received a nomination in the [...] "Best Featured Actress in a Musical" [...] category. However, {{as the result of}} an allergic reaction, she could not perform in the musical some nights. When Daryl Miller interviewed Gaven in the Los Angeles Times in 1997, he noted that [...] "this {{was one of the biggest}} disappointments of her life, and clouds cross her face for the first time in the conversation. She glances across the room at the Tony citation—recognizing her nomination for best featured actress in a musical—as she describes how her throat became infected due to a reaction to the oil in a haze-making compound that designers pump onstage to enhance lighting effects. She missed a lot of performances, and an untold number of Tony voters missed her performance. She can't help <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> how that affected the outcome." [...] At one point, Gaven's understudy Alice Ripley took her place for eight consecutive weeks while Gaven recovered. Gaven eventually had to leave The Who's Tommy some months after it opened because of her allergy. She also disliked the idea of performing in one musical for more than a year.|$|E
500|$|Lacroix {{felt that}} with Unbreakable TNA [...] "truly {{cemented}} the formula needed for delivering great pay per views." [...] He concluded with [...] "TNA's Unbreakable PPV was an astounding buffet of action, {{catering to the}} variety of tastes among professional wrestling fans." [...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If you missed it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title. Now, this is the part where I go into a detail review of the match, but I'm not going to that. Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was." [...] Regarding the Four Way Elimination match, Lacroix believed Johnny Candido's participation was [...] "a nice gesture", <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> [...] "if they could have come up with something else, preferably outside of the match." ...|$|E
500|$|Anton Chekhov in {{his plays}} The Seagull, Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters {{describes}} the tortured emotional states of doctors who {{at some point}} in their careers have turned their back on conscience. In his short stories, Chekhov also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in The Fit describes it as a [...] "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair... in his breast, under the heart" [...] and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in From a Case Book calls it an [...] "unknown, mysterious power... in fact close at hand and watching him." [...] Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to Sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: [...] "Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of Sakhalin, the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of conscience and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} is later revived {{in the pages}} of [...] (20089). Having been placed in a Kryptonian healing chrysalis 1000 years ago by Starman (Thom Kallor) of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Kon-El awakens in the 31st century to once again battle Superboy-Prime. After Superboy-Prime is retconned by himself, Superboy and Kid Flash (Bart Allen), who has also been resurrected, Bart and Kon are returned to the 21st century to resume their lives. Superboy briefly featured as the main character in a revival of Adventure Comics, one of DC's oldest Superman books. During the Blackest Night storyline, Conner was briefly turned into a member of the Black Lantern Corps, <b>but</b> <b>Wonder</b> Girl manages to free him by using the temporally-complex nature of his resurrection against his Black Lantern self, luring him to the Fortress so that the ring can be drawn off him by the presence of his deceased self, allowing Conner to destroy the ring before it can take control of either of him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{strike and}} ensuing fire sale left fans in Montreal livid. The Expos {{finished}} {{last in the}} NL East in , and average game attendance fell by nearly 26%, from 24,543 to 18,189. [...] Interest in the Expos continued to decline {{in the years that}} followed; they would never draw more than 20,000 fans per game again during their tenure in Montreal. While noting the Atlanta Braves went on to win 11 consecutive NL East titles following the strike, Jonah Keri expressed the viewpoint of the fans as it related to Brochu and the team's owners: [...] "Expos fans couldn't help <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> if that could have been them celebrating every year ... had Brochu convinced the team's cheapskate owners to spend a few damn dollars, or taken a leap of faith that short-term financial pain would lead to long-term success." [...] The media, meanwhile, had taken to calling the Expos a [...] "Triple-A team" [...] as the team seemed to enter a period where they would develop players only to move them on to other organizations.|$|E

2500|$|Many critics blamed Paramount's initial ad {{campaign}} for the film not finding a mainstream audience. The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern praised Douglas' work in the film, but criticized the poster, which featured a headshot of Douglas: [...] "a raffishly eccentric role, and he's never been so appealing. (Don't be {{put off by the}} movie's cryptic poster, which makes him look like Michael J. Pollard.)" [...] The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan also slammed the poster: [...] "The film's ad poster brings Elmer Fudd to mind." [...] Hanson said that the poster made Douglas look [...] "like he was trying to be Robin Williams". In an interview with Amy Taubin, Hanson said, [...] "The very things that made Michael and I want to do the movie so badly were the reasons it was so tricky to market. Since films go out on so many screens at once, there's a need for instant appeal. <b>But</b> <b>Wonder</b> Boys isn't easily reducible to a single image or a catchy ad line".|$|E
2500|$|The series {{began at}} a time when {{violence}} on television was under intense scrutiny. As a result, Wonder Woman was less frequently seen punching or kicking people the way she did in the early episodes. She would usually be shown pushing and throwing enemies or using creativity to get them to somehow knock themselves out (such as jumping high into the air to cause pursuers to collide). Despite the wartime setting, she almost never resorted to deadly force. The only exception occurs in the pilot episode when she sinks a German U-boat by crashing an airplane into it, presumably killing everyone aboard. [...] Wonder Woman herself was occasionally overpowered by chloroform and poison gas, but she always came {{back in the second half}} of the show to save the day. In some episodes, her enemies learn the secret of her superhuman strength – her magic belt – and temporarily steal it, leaving her with average human strength. Her indestructible lasso and bracelets were stolen or taken away in one episode (leaving her defenseless against gunfire), <b>but</b> <b>Wonder</b> Woman recovered them by the end of the episode. (In the comics, Wonder Woman's bracelets were welded onto her forearms, and she would lose most of her strength if men were to join them forcibly with metal.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Just Whitney {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with aggregated reviews on Metacritic awarding the album 53 out of 100. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that Just Whitney was [...] "an assertion that she 's {{returning to her}} basics." [...] He {{also said that the}} album was a measured attempt to salvage a career that's on the verge of destruction. He concluded by saying, [...] "It would be a good standard-issue Whitney album if it wasn't for her disarming, defensive attempt to defuse every rumor hurled in her direction." [...] Billboard reviewed the album commenting that [...] "Just Whitney appears and sounds more like a work-in-progress than a finished disk" [...] and said that the album showcased an artist simply going through the motions and her voice lacked emotion and verve." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today graded the album two-and-half stars out of four, giving a mixed review saying, [...] "At her best, Houston is full of sass and attitude and, most of all, joy. But with so much emphasis on what's bothering her, you can't help <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> whether the thrill is gone." [...] According to The Guardian, the album takes [...] "a musical step backwards".|$|E
