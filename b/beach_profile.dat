50|$|Conversely, the <b>beach</b> <b>profile</b> {{is lower}} in the storm season (winter in {{temperate}} areas) due to the increased wave energy, and the shorter periods between breaking wave crests. Higher energy waves breaking in quick succession tend to mobilise sediment from the shallows, keeping it in suspension where it is prone to be carried along the beach by longshore currents, or carried out to sea to form longshore bars, especially if the longshore current meets an outflow from a river or flooding stream.

40|$|Coastal erosion has {{attracted}} serious {{attention from the}} government of Malaysia. The changes in land use along {{the east coast of}} Johor due to rapid development and mining activities have caused short and long term effects on shoreline evolution. This study analyse the <b>beach</b> <b>profiles</b> of Desaru <b>beach,</b> Johor. For the purpose of this study, the <b>beach</b> <b>profiles</b> were measured using Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and the tide gauge was also been installed. The <b>beach</b> <b>profiles</b> data were then converted into x-y coordinate to show accretion and erosion on the profiles.

After a storm, the berm on the foreshore has been cut away because of the influence of northeast monsoon. Sediment loss and gain are greatest during spring tide in mid November and during neap tide in the end of September respectively. The sediment loss from the beach were greater than the sediment added to the beach although the loss of sediment occurred from the chainage of 15 m to 45 m compared to the sediment added from the chainage of 15 m to 55 m.

40|$|Four beach types were {{identified}} from field surveys of <b>beach</b> <b>profiles</b> on low-energy sandy beaches in Cockburn Sound, a micro-tidal, semi-enclosed basin in southwestern Australia.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} the {{medium-term}} response of <b>beach</b> <b>profiles</b> was investigated at two sites: a gently sloping sandy beach and a steeper mixed {{sand and gravel}} beach. The former is the Duck site in North Carolina, {{on the east coast}} of the USA, which is exposed to Atlantic Ocean swells and storm waves, and the latter is the Milford-on-Sea site at Christchurch Bay, on the south coast of England, which is partially sheltered from Atlantic swells but has a directionally bimodal wave exposure. The data sets comprise detailed bathymetric surveys of <b>beach</b> <b>profiles</b> covering a period of more than 25 years for the Duck site and over 18 years for the Milford-on-Sea site. The structure of the data sets and the data-driven methods are described. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to find linkages between the wave characteristics and <b>beach</b> <b>profiles.</b> The sensitivity of the linkages was investigated by deploying a wave height threshold to filter out the smaller waves incrementally. The results of the analysis indicate that, for the gently sloping sandy beach, waves of all heights are important to the morphological response. For the mixed sand and gravel beach, filtering the smaller waves improves the statistical fit and it suggests that low-height waves do not play a primary role in the medium-term morphological response, which is primarily driven by the intermittent larger storm waves...|$|R
50|$|Transitions between beach {{states are}} often caused {{by changes in}} wave energy, with storms causing {{reflective}} <b>beach</b> <b>profiles</b> to flatten (offshore movement of sediment under steeper waves), thus adopting a more dissipative profile.

50|$|Beaches {{are usually}} heavily eroded during storm surges and the <b>beach</b> <b>profile</b> steepened, whereas normal wave action on flat coasts tends {{to raise the}} beach. Not {{infrequently}} {{a whole series of}} parallel berms is formed, one behind the other. There is a consequent gradual increase in height with the result that, over time, the shoreline advances seawards. A striking example of land-forming system of berms is Skagen Odde on the northern tip of Vendsyssel in the extreme north of Denmark. This headland is still growing today as more berms are added.|$|E
50|$|A {{concrete}} ramp {{should follow}} the natural {{profile of the}} beach {{to prevent it from}} changing the normal flow of waves, longshore currents, water and wind. A ramp that is below the <b>beach</b> <b>profile</b> will tend to become buried and cease to provide a good surface for vehicular traffic. A ramp or stair that protrudes above the <b>beach</b> <b>profile</b> will tend to disrupt longshore currents creating deposits in front of the ramp, and scouring behind. Concrete ramps are the most expensive vehicular beach accesses to construct requiring use of a quick drying concrete or a coffer dam to protect them from tidal water during the concrete curing process. Concrete is favored where traffic flows are heavy and access is required by vehicles that are not adapted to soft sand (e.g. road registered passenger vehicles and boat trailers). Concrete stairs are commonly favored on beaches adjacent to population centers where beach users may arrive on the beach in street shoes, or where the foreshore roadway is substantially higher than the beach head and a ramp would be too steep for safe use by pedestrians. A composite stair ramp may incorporate a central or side stair with one or more ramps allowing pedestrians to lead buggies or small boat dollies onto the beach without the aid of a powered vehicle or winch. Concrete ramps and steps should be maintained to prevent buildup of moss or algae that may make their wet surfaces slippery and dangerous to pedestrians and vehicles.|$|E
50|$|A gravel ramp {{is formed}} by {{excavating}} the underlying loose sediment and filling the excavation {{with layers of}} gravel of graduated sizes as defined by John Loudon McAdam. The gravel is compacted to form a solid surface according {{to the needs of}} the traffic.

Gravel ramps are subject to erosion by water. If the edges are retained with boards or walls and the profile matches the surrounding <b>beach</b> <b>profile,</b> a gravel ramp may become more stable as finer sediments are deposited by percolating water.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{disclose}} the essential relationship between beach process and wavecharacteristics, two dimensional model tests are often performed for beach profilechanges due to incident breaking waves normal to the beach.

The boat was donated through the legacy of the Misses Wingate of Edinburgh and had five service launches between 1903 and 1921 in which no lives were saved.

50|$|Since the {{completion}} of construction of two large dams on the Luan River in 1979, its annual sediment delivery to the Bohai Sea has been cut from 20.2 million tons to an annual sediment flux of only 1.9 million tons. This sharp reduction in sediment discharge {{has been accompanied by}} phase shift of the Luan River Delta into para-abandonment. This drop in sediment yield has inevitably altered the longshore transport equilibrium in the local coastal area. With prevailing northward winds, shoreline retreat rates north of the Luan River have increased from 1 m/y to 3.7 m/y over twenty-year period since dam construction, rapidly changing the morphology and <b>beach</b> <b>profile</b> via positive feedback until a new equilibrium was reached, at which the present retreat is back at its original 1 m/y.

5000|$|Hapua {{have been}} {{identified}} as establishing in the Canterbury Bight coastal region on the east coast of the South Island. They are often found in areas of coarse-grained sediment where contributing rivers have moderately steep bed gradients. [...] MSG beaches in the Canterbury Bight region contain a wide range of sediment sizes from sand to boulders and are exposed to the high energy waves that make up an east coast swell environment. [...] MSG beaches are reflective rather than dissipative energy zones due to their morphological characteristics. They have a steep foreshore which is known as the ‘engine room’ of the <b>beach</b> <b>profile.</b> In this zone, swash and backwash are dominating processes alongside longshore transport. [...] MSG beaches do not have a surf zone; instead a single line of breakers is visible in all sea conditions. [...] Hapua are associated with MSG beaches as the variation in sediment size allows for the barrier to be permeable.|$|E
40|$|A new mode ofbeach {{response}} {{to changes in}} wave height is identified for reflective beaches where waves break close to the shoreline. This response involves vertical adjustment of the beach face morphology, especially the beach step. It is found that profile relief varies with wave height rather than inversely to it as expected from existing models. As a result the characteristic steep reflective profile can be maintained under certain conditions, during periods of beach erosion. A field program which included surveys of 67 <b>beach</b> <b>profiles</b> on a persistently reflective beach measured vertical adjustments of the beach step and as-sociated wave and sediment conditions. Based on these data a model is developed to des-cribe {{the changes in the}} amplitude ofthe beach step related to changes in breaker height and sediment size. It was found that as breaker height increases the step height increases, while the surf zone width remains constant. Larger grain sizes and changes in grain size across the beach face are also associated with larger step heights. This step adjustment model implies that if wave height increases, under the range ofconditions observed, the resultant increase in step amplitude and associated deepening of the nearshore will be sufficient to delay wave breaking, allowing a reflective profile to be maintained. Therefore the model can account for the environmental conditions which produce changes in step heights and favour the maintenance ofa reflective system. The model also implies that a threshold exists between this mode and the conventionally recognised mode ofbeach response and therefore differentiates between transient reflective profiles, and those of less mobile reflective beach systems.

30|$|Another {{approach}} {{that could be}} built based on results of clustering analysis of data obtained from BQM is <b>beach</b> <b>profiling.</b> Unlike the <b>beach</b> zoning previously iterated involving multiple zones per <b>beach,</b> <b>beach</b> water <b>profiling</b> is a general picture involving a classification system for several beaches, in which case, multiple beaches per class or zone. <b>Beach</b> water <b>profiling</b> is increasingly gaining increasing acceptance in some countries. A fundamental objective {{of this approach is}} to allow the citizenry to make an informed choice on which beach to choose for recreational activities. This is done via the annual public disclosure {{in the form of a}} report, the bacteriological quality of available coastal and freshwater bathing waters. Clusters built from data generated from BQM could be aligned with other factors to produce a profiling system that includes a general description of the bathing water, where wastewater outfalls and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) are positioned, potential sources of pollution, management measures, the location of the sampling points and how the beach has performed against bathing quality ratings over the previous months and years. With a <b>beach</b> <b>profiling</b> program in place, beaches could then be classified as good, fair or poor based on pre-defined quality criteria counts. It is noteworthy to assert that relevant agencies in Malaysia have made giant strides in this direction particularly for rivers in Malaysia. Water quality data from the 143 river basins throughout Malaysia are used to determine the water quality status weather in clean, slightly polluted or polluted category and to classify the rivers in Class I, II, III, IV or V based on Water Quality Index (WQI) and Interim National Water Quality Standards (INWQS) for Malaysia every year (Dada et al 2012). It is hoped that a similar classification scheme be developed for recreational beach waters. A further improvement of this approach will involve the designation of beach managers for each beach who will be responsible for putting up signs at each designated bathing waters advising on the beach class, current beach water quality and potential pollution sources.|$|R
