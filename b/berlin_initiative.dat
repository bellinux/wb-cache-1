However, preferred equations and filtration markers in elderly individuals are debated. In 805 adults enrolled in the community-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) -Reykjavik Study, we measured GFR (mGFR) using plasma clearance of iohexol, standardized creatinine and cystatin C, and eGFR using the CKD-EPI, Japanese, <b>Berlin</b> <b>Initiative</b> Study (BIS), and Caucasian and Asian pediatric and adult subjects (CAPA) equations. We evaluated equation performance using bias, precision, and two measures of accuracy. We first compared the Japanese, BIS, and CAPA equations with the CKD-EPI equations to determine the preferred equations, and then compared eGFRcr and eGFRcys with eGFRcr-cys using the preferred equations. Mean (SD) age was 80. 3 (4. 0) years. Median (25 th, 75 th) mGFR was 64 (52, 73) ml/min per 1. 73 m(2), and the prevalence of decreased GFR was 39 % (95 % confidence interval, 35. 8 to 42. 5). Among 24 comparisons with the other equations, CKD-EPI equations performed better in 9, similar in 13, and worse in 2.

Results. Prevalence of specific eGFR category (i. e., ≥ 75, 60 – 74, 45 – 59, and < 45) according to eGFR equation was 12. 3 %, 38. 4 %, 37. 3 %, and 12. 0 % for BIS 1; 48. 3 %, 27. 8 %, 16. 2 %, and 7. 8 % for CKD-EPIcr; 14. 1 %, 38. 6 %, 37. 6 %, and 9. 6 % for BIS 2; and 33. 5 %, 33. 4 %, 22. 0 %, and 11. 1 % for CKD-EPIcr,cysc, respectively. Over 9 ± 4 years, 667 (51. 8 %) women died. For each equation, women with eGFR < 45 were at increased risk of mortality compared to eGFR ≥ 75 [adjusted HR (95 % CI) : BIS 1, 1. 5 (1. 1 – 2. 0); CKD-EPIcr, 1. 7 (1. 3 – 2. 2); BIS 2, 2. 0 (1. 4 – 2. 8); CKD-EPIcr,cysc, 1. 8 (1. 4 – 2. 3); p-trend < 0. 01].

GFR was estimated using five creatinine-based equations: the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), MAYO Clinic, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) and <b>Berlin</b> <b>Initiative</b> Study- 1 (BIS- 1). Survival analysis was used to study mortality in subjects with reduced eGFR (< 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2)) compared to subjects with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2). Prevalence of reduced GFR was 90. 7 % with the C-G, 48. 1 % with MDRD, 23. 3 % with MAYO, 53. 6 % with CKD-EPI and 84. 4 % with BIS- 1. After adjustment for confounders, two-year mortality was significantly increased in subjects with reduced eGFR using BIS- 1 and C-G equations (adjusted HRs: 2. 88 and 3. 30, respectively). Five-year mortality was significantly increased in subjects with eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2) using MAYO, CKD-EPI and, in a graduated fashion in reduced eGFR categories, MDRD. After 5 years, oldest old with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2) showed a significantly higher risk of death whichever equation was used (adjusted HRs between 2. 04 and 2. 70). In the oldest old, prevalence of reduced eGFR varies noticeably depending on the equation used. In this population, risk of mortality was significantly higher for reduced GFR estimated with the BIS- 1 and C-G equations over the short term. Though after five years the MDRD appeared on the whole a more consistent predictor, differences in mortality prediction among equations over the long term were less apparent.

40|$|Serum {{creatinine}} (SCr) is {{the main}} variable for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Due to interassay differences, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) varies according to the assay used, and calibration standardization is necessary. For SCr, isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) is the gold standard. Systematic differences are observed between Jaffe and enzymatic methods. Manufacturers subtract 0. 30 mg/dl from Jaffe results to match enzymatic results (‘compensated Jaffe method’). The analytical performance of enzymatic methods is superior to that of Jaffe methods. In the original Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, SCr was measured by a Jaffe Beckman assay, which was later recalibrated. A limitation of this equation was an underestimation of GFR in the high range. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) consortium proposed an equation using calibrated and IDMS traceable SCr. The gain in performance was due to improving the bias whereas the precision was comparable. The CKD-EPI equation performs better at high GFR levels (GFR[60 ml/ min/ 1. 73 m 2). Analytical limitations {{have led to the}} recommendation to give a grade ([60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2) rather than an absolute value with the MDRD equation. By using both enzymatic and calibrated methods, this cutoff-grade could be increased to 90 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (with MDRD) and 120 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (with CKD-EPI). The superiority of the CKD-EPI equation over MDRD is analytical, but the precision gain is limited. IDMS traceable enzymatic methods have been used {{in the development of the}} Lund– Malmo¨ (in CKD populations) and <b>Berlin</b> <b>Initiative</b> Study equations (in the elderly).

We agree that disagreement in the estimation of kidney function was previously found by a number of authors. However, in our paper 1 we describe this aspect in very specific population – geriatric, palliative care patients – with high prevalence of cachexia and substantial muscle mass loss. Our group has shown some similarities (low creatinine generation) to the group of patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa studied by Fabbian et al. 2 However, it has to be stressed that patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were much younger, and therefore had much better, mostly normal kidney function. The second population analyzed by Fabbian et al 3 – diabetic patients – also differ from out cohort, as they were better nourished. Regardless of these differences, the conclusions concerning the disagreement of different methods in the estimation of kidney function are quite similar. Importantly, the disagreement is more clinically significant in older population, including geriatric, palliative care patients, due to much greater prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) 4 that affects adjusting drug dosage.

Methods: Using cross-sectional analysis we assessed 95 very elderly persons (mean 85 years) living in the community. GFR was measured by iohexol (mGFR) and compared with estimates using six equations: MDRD, CKD-Epi_creatinine, CKD-Epi_cystatin, CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin, BIS_creatinine and BIS_creatinine-cystatin. Results: Mean mGFR was 55 (range, 19 - 86) ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2). Bias was smaller with the CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin and the CKD-Epi_creatinine equations (- 4. 0 and 1. 7 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2). Accuracy (percentage of estimates within 30 % of mGFR) was greater with the CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin, BIS_creatinine-cystatin and BIS_creatinine equations (85 %, 83 % and 80 %, respectively). Among the creatinine-based equations, the BIS_creatinine had the greatest accuracy at mGFR < 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2) and the CKD-Epi_creatinine was superior at higher GFRs (79 % and 90 %, respectively). the CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin, BIS_creatinine-cystatin and CKD-Epi_cystatin equations yielded the greatest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at GFR threshold = 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2) (0. 88, 0. 88 and 0. 87, respectively). in participants classified based on the BIS_creatinine, CKD-Epi_cystatin, or BIS_creatinine-cystatin equations, the CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin equation tended to improve CKD classification (net reclassification index: 12. 7 %, p = 0. 18; 6. 7 %, p = 0. 38; and 15. 9 %; p = 0. 08, respectively). Conclusions: GFR-estimating equations CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin and BIS_creatinine-cystatin showed better accuracy than other equations using creatinine or cystatin C alone in very elderly persons. the CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin equation appears to be advantageous in CKD classification. If cystatin C is not available, both the BIS_cr equation and the CKD-Epi_cr equation could be used, although at mGFR < 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2), the BIS_cr equation seems to be the best alternative.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} encounters between Germans and immigrants to Germany. Specifically I am interested in how Germans are {{coming to terms with}} the changing cultural dynamics of group identity and how notions of “Germanness” are created, negotiated, and contested. I take as my point of departure the postcolonial observation that hegemonic representations of “others” are simultaneously projects promoting particular notions of “self. ” Based on ethnographic research in Berlin, Germany between 1998 and 1999, I explore three different sites of German discursive encounters with foreign residents: (1) The neighborhoods of Berlin-Mitte and Berlin-Kreuzberg; (2) A conservative political action protesting dual citizenship; (3) The efforts of an east <b>Berlin</b> anti-racist <b>initiative</b> to promote the integration of foreign residents. Drawing on a variety of theoretical perspectives including feminist and poststructuralist theorization of identity, critical discourse analysis, urban anthropology, and race and whiteness studies, each chapter analyses a different moment in which particular notions of Germanness are constituted in opposition to representations of foreignness. By presenting a collection of moments instead of focusing attention on a single instance I convey both the fractured experience of urban ethnography while demonstrating that the discursive manifestations of German identity emerge in many different places and in many different ways. Through these examples I explore how certain discourses homogenize the German population while other discourses reveal fissures within the category of “German,” specifically between and east and west Germans. I then conclude the dissertation with the argument that each of the various discussions presented can be seen as part of a discourse in which notions of “foreigner” and “German” are racialized. With this work, I endeavor to contribute to the postcolonial call to question the asymmetrical relations of power, to disrupt assumptions of separate and bounded social and cultural entities, and to reveal the relational nature of conceptions of difference. ...|$|R

Among others, the names of Albert Einstein, Joseph Rotblat, Andrei Sakharov stand as illustrative examples. The 1955 Russell-Einstein Manifesto would not have achieved lasting influence, had it not given birth to the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, to which Jo Rotblat devoted his life. If the lonely voice of Andrei Sakharov, advocating convergence between freedom and justice, emphasizing respect for human rights and international law, had been adequately upheld by alert civil society organizations, East and West, we would clearly be all better off nowadays. Scientific societies and professional associations have much to contribute for the success of our ambitious European project: replacement of war by law, emergence of a culture of fair-play and reciprocity.

40|$|Background: Accurate {{and precise}} {{measurement}} of GFR {{is important for}} patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sampling time of exogenous filtration markers may have great impact on measured GFR (mGFR) results {{but there is still}} uncertainty about optimal timing of plasma clearance measurement in patients with advanced CKD, for whom the 24 hours measurement is recommended. This satellite project of the <b>Berlin</b> <b>Initiative</b> Study evaluates whether the 24 hours Iohexol plasma clearance reveals a clinically relevant difference compared to the 5 hours measurement in older adults. Methods: In 104 participants {{with a mean age of}} 79 years and diagnosed CKD we performed the standard GFR measurement over 5 hours (mGFR 300) using Iohexol plasma concentrations at 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after injection. With an additional sample at 1440 minutes we assessed the 24 hours GFR measurement (mGFR 1440). The study design was cross-sectional. Calculation of mGFR was conducted with a one-compartment model using the Brochner-Mortensen equation to calculate the fast component. mGFR values were compared to estimated GFR values (BIS, CAPA, CKD-EPI, Cockcroft Gault, MDRD, Revised Lund-Malmo). Results: In all 104 subjects mGFR 1440 was lower than mGFR 300 (23 ± 8 versus 29 ± 9 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2, mean ± SD; p < 0. 001). mGFR 1440 was highly correlated with mGFR 300 (r = 0. 9). The mean absolute difference mGFR 300 - mGFR 1440 was 5. 9 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 corresponding to a mean percentage difference of 29 %. In individuals with eGFRCKD-EPI ≤ 30 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2, percentage difference of mGFR 300 and mGFR 1440 was even higher (35 %). To predict mGFR 1440 from mGFR 300 we developed the correction formula: mGFR 1440 = - 2. 175 + 0. 871 x mGFR 300 (one-fold standard error of estimate: ± 2. 3 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2). The GFR estimating equation with the best accuracy and precision compared to the mGFR 1440 was the Revised Lund Malmö equation. Conclusion: In elderly CKD-patients measurement of Iohexol clearance up to 5 hours leads to a clinically relevant overestimation of GFR compared to the 24 hours measurement. In clinical care this effect should be bared in mind, especially for patients with considerably reduced GFR levels. A new correction formula has been developed to predict mGFR 1440 from mGFR 300. For accurate GFR estimates in elderly CKD patients we recommend the Revised Lund Malmö equation...|$|E

This study evaluated the concordance and feasibility of using various creatinine-based equations for estimating GFR in elderly Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Methods: A cross-sectional analytical {{study was conducted in}} 21, 723 older diabetic patients (≥ 60 years) based on electronic health records (EHR) for Minhang District, Shanghai, China. The concordance of chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification among different creatinine-based equations was assessed based on Kappa values, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) statistics, and the eGFR agreement between the equations was tested using Bland–Altman plots. The GFR was estimated using the Cockcroft–Gault (CG), <b>Berlin</b> <b>Initiative</b> Study 1 (BIS 1), simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), MDRD modified for Chinese populations (mMDRD), chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI), CKD-EPI in Asians (CKD-EPI-Asia), and Ruijin equations. Results: Overall, the proportion of CKD stages 3 – 5 (eGFR < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) was calculated as 28. 9 %, 39. 1 %, 11. 8 %, 8. 4 %, 14. 3 %, 11. 5 %, and 12. 7 % by the eGFRCG, eGFRBIS 1, eGFRMDRD, eGFRmMDRD, eGFRCKD-EPI, eGFRCKD-EPI-Asia, and eGFRRuijin equations, respectively. The concordance of albuminuria and decreased eGFR based on the different equations was poor by both the Kappa (< 0. 2) and ICC (< 0. 4) statistics. The CKD-EPI-Asia equation resulted in excellent concordance with the CKD-EPI (ICC = 0. 931), MDRD (ICC = 0. 963), mMDRD (ICC = 0. 892), and Ruijin (ICC = 0. 956) equations for the classification of CKD stages, whereas the BIS 1 equation exhibited good concordance with the CG equation (ICC = 0. 809). In addition, significant differences were observed for CKD stage 1 among all these equations. Conclusion: Accurate GFR values are difficult to estimate using creatinine-based equations in older diabetic patients. Kidney function is complex, and the staff {{need to be aware of}} the individualized consideration of other risk factors or markers of reduced renal function in clinical practice.

Accurate assessment of renal function is necessary for appropriate drug dosage. Several equations are used to estimate kidney function. Aims: 1) To investigate the differences (Δ) in kidney function assessed with simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), <b>Berlin</b> <b>Initiative</b> Study (BIS 1), and Cockcroft–Gault (C-G) formulas in geriatric palliative care patients, and 2) to assess factors that may influence these differences. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data of patients aged ≥ 70  years admitted to a palliative care in-patient unit. The agreement between C-G, MDRD, and BIS 1 equations was assessed with Bland–Altman analysis. Partial correlation {{analysis was used to}} analyze factors influencing the discordance. Results: A total of 174 patients (67 men; mean age 77. 9 ± 5. 8  years) were enrolled. The mean Δ MDRD and C-G was 18. 6 (95 % limits of agreement 55. 3 and - 18. 2). The mean Δ BIS 1 and C-G was 6. 1 (25. 7 and - 13. 5), and the mean Δ MDRD and BIS 1 was 12. 5 (40. 6 and - 15. 6). According to the National Kidney Foundation classification, 61 (35. 1 %) patients were differently staged using MDRD and C-G, while ~ 20 % of patients were differently staged with BIS 1 and C-G and MDRD and BIS 1. Serum creatinine (SCr) and body mass index (BMI) had the most important influence on variability of Δ MDRD and C-G (partial R 2 37. 7 % and 28. 4 %). Variability of Δ BIS 1 and C-G was mostly influenced by BMI (34. 8 %) and variability of Δ MDRD and BIS 1 by SCr (42. 2 %). Age had relatively low influence on differences between equations (3. 1 %– 9. 5 %). Conclusion: There is a considerable disagreement between renal function estimation formulas, especially MDRD and C-G in geriatric palliative care patients, which may lead to errors in drug dosage adjustment. The magnitude of discrepancy increases with lower SCr, lower BMI, and higher age. Keywords: creatinine clearance, estimated glomerular filtration rate, MDRD, BIS 1, Cockcroft-Gault ...|$|E
40|$|A {{key element}} of the G 20 's {{partnership}} with Africa is the Compact with Africa (CWA) initiative, the primary aim {{of which is to}} support private and infrastructure investment. Draft compacts of five African countries - Côte d'Ivoire, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, and Tunisia – may be presented at the G 20 Africa Partnership Conference in <b>Berlin.</b> The CWA <b>initiative</b> cannot and should not be seen as a quick fix vis-à-vis the root causes of flight and migration. It might support development in Africa, but alone it will not be decisive. The initiative addresses a key mechanism of economic (under) development, but the coordination problem that explains Africa's low income levels extends well beyond the realm of investment and infrastructure. An investment plan that fails to recognise this is bound to fail. The CWA omits four very important issues. First, it ignores investment in education, which is an essential complement to physical infrastructure and private investment. Second, it fails to discuss the G 20 's responsibility in creating an uncertain trade and investment policy environment that harms investment in Africa. Third, while the compact has much to say on investor risk, it does not address the social and environmental risks associated with private investment. Fourth, the CWA fails to take seriously a comprehensive sustainable development agenda, as implied by the 2030 Agenda. The CWA does better in a technical sense and proposes a number of instruments that aim to achieve a better-matched supply of capital and to facilitate better preparation of investment projects. However, the priority seems to be de-risking through subsidies, which may waste resources or induce excessive risk-taking. Other instruments and domestic financial markets may be better at leveraging private investment for small, highly profitable, and highly risky African projects. Support to Africa can only succeed as a long-term endeavour. The CWA initiative needs to be more comprehensive; this can be achieved by linking it to country development strategies based on the 2030 Agenda. Investment in education should {{be an integral part of}} the compacts. The G 20 should commit to a predictable trade regime for Africa. Investors, multilateral development banks, and host countries need to address potentially adverse ecological and socio-economic effects of private investment by adhering to adequate international standards and by effectively implementing safeguards...|$|R
40|$|Background and Resources The rise {{of digital}} {{publication}} has ushered {{in an unprecedented}} era of collaboration, sharing, and availability of research. Indeed it has even made possible new ways of conducting research, the potentials of which are not yet fully realized. In the digital age, we can reduce the costs of sharing our ideas by eliminating the materials, printing, and dissemination costs associated with physical journals. However, the prices of many journal subscriptions continue to increase dramatically. Often times, at several {{times the rate of}} inflation. This situation creates a barrier between your published works and researchers – both stateside and overseas [...] that may not have access to pricy journal subscriptions. This barrier not only effectively limits the audience for your scholarly works, but it impedes the developing culture of research which rewards collaboration and utilizes research methods dependent on open access to previous research via the internet. When you publish your work with a traditional publisher, read the publication agreement. Does the publisher require you to transfer your exclusive rights under copyright to them? If so, you may not be legally permitted to share your work with colleagues or students, or post it to your personal website or an institutional repository such as USU’s Digital Commons. Adopting an institutional Open Access Policy, such as USU’s Policy 586, can be an effective response to this situation. In 2008, Harvard University became the first US institution to pass an Open Access Policy, similar to our Policy 586. This policy joined many European Institutions in requiring faculty to deposit their works in an open institutional repository, and in sharing a nonexclusive copyright to their works with the University. Harvard’s policy was adopted to promote free and open communication and ideas, to resist a publishing industry that erects barriers between scholars and the research they need, and to share the intellectual wealth of the institution with the world. As the land grant institution of the state of Utah, and as a major research university, USU supports these goals. As such, we have joined a growing body of US institutions, and become a leader among public institutions, in adopting an Open Access Policy. This policy has been designed to interfere as little as possible with your existing publication, while maximizing the impact of your research through Open Access dissemination.
