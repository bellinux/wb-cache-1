5|$|On 27 October, {{the same}} day Rhys-Davids died in action, a British {{intelligence}} officer finally gained access to the wreckage after it had lain {{a month in the}} open. He verified it was a triplane, and noted that its upper surfaces were camouflage green and its <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> were blue. Second Lieutenant Barfoot-Saunt removed some small pieces from the wreck to accompany his report, illustrating technical points. The technical information that was reported gave the British their first insight into the new craft, although Voss had swapped in a French Le Rhone engine.|$|E
5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are out of phase. When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E
50|$|The {{upward force}} on the cube is the {{pressure}} on the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> integrated over its area. The surface is at constant depth, so the pressure is constant. Therefore, the integral of the pressure over the area of the horizontal <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> of the cube is the hydrostatic pressure at that depth multiplied by the area of the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|R
30|$|Effective depth: The FDOT SDG {{requires}} that cast-in-place decks shall have a bottom reinforcement concrete cover of 2.0 inches (Table  1.4. 2 - 1). The ODOT BDM requires a 1.5 inch minimum {{cover for the}} concrete deck <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> (BDM 301.5. 7). The PennDOT DM 4 requires a 1.0 inch minimum cover for the concrete deck <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> (DM 4 Part B, 5.12. 3). The INDOT Ch 404 requires a 1.0 inch minimum cover for the concrete deck <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> (404 - 2.01. 3). The effective depth {{is a function of}} the deck thickness and the reinforcement cover to the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> of deck. Assuming that the deck thickness varies from 7 to 11 inches and the minimum cover to the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> is 1.0 inch, this research considered a range of 6 – 10.0 inches to be used in the effective depth.|$|R
30|$|Competition {{with other}} benthos for {{settlement}} space and post-settlement mortality due to overgrowth of other organisms may also limit coral recruitment on the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> in subtropical reefs (Birkeland 1977; Harriott and Banks 1995). In this study, the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> of settlement plates was frequently occupied by macrobenthos such as bryozoans, ascidians, polychaetes, and barnacles. These cryptic organisms often have higher growth rates and may quickly occupy the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface,</b> thus prohibiting or excluding {{the settlement of}} coral recruits (Birkeland 1977).|$|R
5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E
25|$|The wing is of single-spar {{construction}} that {{passes through the}} aircraft's fuselage. The wingspan and total length of the Canberra are almost identical at just under 20 metres. Outboard of the engine nacelles, the wing has a leading edge sweep of 4° and trailing edge sweep of −14°. All flight controls are manual, using push-rods rather than cables, but are otherwise conventional. These actuate the aircraft's flight control surfaces, including shrouded-nosed ailerons, four-section conventional split-type flaps, and atypical airbrakes which comprise 40 hydraulically-raised fingers located {{on the top and}} <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the wings. Swept-wings were considered, but not adopted, since the expected operational speeds did not warrant them and because they could have introduced new aerodynamic problems into what was otherwise anticipated to be a straightforward replacement for RAF Hawker Typhoon and Westland Whirlwind fighter-bombers.|$|E

500|$|The waffle-iron filter {{was invented}} by Seymour B. Cohn at Stanford Research Institute in 1957. [...] The basis for the filter is the corrugated-waveguide filter. [...] This {{consists}} {{of a series of}} ridges, or corrugations, across the width of the filter. [...] There are corrugations inside the waveguide on both the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces.</b> [...] The rising and descending ridges are aligned with each other but do not meet in the middle; there is a gap in between. [...] In the waffle-iron filter there are, in addition, slots cut through the ridges {{down the length of the}} waveguide. [...] This leaves a matrix of square islands, or teeth, on the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces.</b>|$|E
500|$|The waffle-iron filter is {{a variant}} of the corrugated-waveguide filter. [...] It has similar {{properties}} to that filter with the additional advantage that spurious TE20 and TE30 modes are suppressed. [...] In the waffle-iron filter, channels are cut through the ridges longitudinally down the filter. [...] This leaves a matrix of teeth protruding internally from the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the waveguide. [...] This pattern of teeth resembles a waffle iron, hence the name of the filter.|$|E
500|$|Platyhelminthes are bilaterally {{symmetrical}} animals: {{their left}} and right sides are mirror images of each other; this also implies they have distinct top and <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> and distinct head and tail ends. Like other bilaterians, they have three main cell layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm), while the radially symmetrical cnidarians and ctenophores (comb jellies) have only two cell layers. Beyond that, they are [...] "defined more by what {{they do not have}} than by any particular series of specializations." [...] Unlike other bilaterians, Platyhelminthes have no internal body cavity, so are described as acoelomates. They also lack specialized circulatory and respiratory organs, both of these facts are defining features when classifying a flatworm's anatomy. Their bodies are soft and unsegmented.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study has}} been carried out to study the effects of axial conduction in a conjugate heat transfer situation involving simultaneously developing laminar flow and heat transfer in a square microchannel subjected to constant wall temperature at bottom of substrate while the other exposed surfaces are kept insulated. The study is carried out for different partial heating cases. They are: (i) The entire <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> of microchannel is subjected to constant wall temperature while all other outer surfaces are insulated (ii) 6 mm of <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> is insulated from both inlet and outlet end of micro channel and remaining length of <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> is subjected to constant wall temperature (iii) 6 mm of <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> is insulated from inlet end of micro channel and remaining length of <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> is subjected to constant wall temperature (iv) 6 mm of <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> is insulated from outlet end of micro channel and remaining length of <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> is subjected to constant wall temperature. Simulations are carried out for different conductivity ratio, Re and substrate thickness to channel depth ratio. It is found that value of Nuavg is increasing with decreasing value of ksf upto ksf approximately equal to 25 and beyond that on decreasing ksf value further, value of Nuavg starts decrease rapidly. This sudden decrease in Nuavg value is because under such situation the case becomes a one side heating problem rather than three sided heating problem. Now as ksf is increased beyond a range axial back conduction comes into play and this causes value of Nuavg to decrease. Thus, there exists an optimum ksf for which Nuavg is maximum for given flow Re and wall thickness ratio. Secondly, it is observed that higher axial conduction causes the boundary condition experienced at the solid fluid interface to drift more towards iso-flux condition although isothermal condition is applied on outer surface...|$|R
30|$|Combining Figs.  3 and 4 with Fig.  2, we can {{conclude}} {{that there is an}} alternating convex-concave curling deformation at the four corners and the track center. The reason for this phenomenon is that the poor thermal conductivity of mortar causes a temperature gradient in the vertical direction of track slab. When the temperature at the top surface is higher than that at the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface,</b> tensile stress occurs at the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface</b> and induces downward curling of the four corners; when the temperature at the top surface is lower than that at the <b>bottom</b> <b>surface,</b> there will be tensile stress at the top surface and four corners will curl upward.|$|R

2500|$|Lentic {{systems are}} diverse, {{ranging from a}} small, {{temporary}} rainwater pool a few inches deep to Lake Baikal, which has a maximum depth of 1740 m. The general distinction between pools/ponds and lakes is vague, but Brown states that ponds and pools have their entire <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> exposed to light, while lakes do not. [...] In addition, some lakes become seasonally stratified (discussed in more detail below.) [...] Ponds and pools have two regions: the pelagic open water zone, and the benthic zone, which comprises the bottom and shore regions. [...] Since lakes have deep bottom regions not exposed to light, these systems have an additional zone, the profundal. These three areas can have very different abiotic conditions and, hence, host species that are specifically adapted to live there.|$|E

2500|$|Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the lift force on an airfoil, if the behaviour of the fluid flow {{in the vicinity of the}} foil is known. [...] For example, if the air flowing past the top surface of an aircraft wing is moving faster than the air flowing past the bottom surface, then Bernoulli's principle implies that the pressure on the surfaces of the wing will be lower above than below. This pressure difference results in an upwards lifting force. Whenever the distribution of speed past the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>surfaces</b> of a wing is known, the lift forces can be calculated (to a good approximation) using Bernoulli's equations – established by Bernoulli over a century before the first man-made wings were used for the purpose of flight. Bernoulli's principle does not explain why the air flows faster past the top of the wing and slower past the underside. See the article on aerodynamic lift for more info.|$|E
