40|$|We {{describe}} an implemented system for robust domain-independent syntactic parsing of English, using a unification-based grammar of part-ofspeech and punctuation labels {{coupled with a}} probabilistic LR parser. We present evaluations of the system's performance along several different dimensions; these enable us to assess the contribution that each individual part is making {{to the success of}} the system as a whole, and thus prioririse the effort to be devoted to its further enhancement. Currently, the system is able to parse around 80 % of sentences in a substantial corpus of general text containing a number of distinct genres. On a random sample of 250 such sentences the system has a mean crossing <b>bracket</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 71 and recall and precision of 83 % and 84 % respectively when evaluated against manually-disambiguated analyses...|$|E
40|$|Many {{different}} metrics {{exist for}} evaluating parsing results, including Viterbi, Crossing <b>Brackets</b> <b>Rate,</b> Zero Crossing <b>Brackets</b> <b>Rate,</b> and several others. However, most parsing algorithms, including the Viterbi algorithm, attempt {{to optimize the}} same metric, namely the probability of getting the correct labelled tree. By choosing a parsing algorithm appropriate for the evaluation metric, better performance can be achieved. We present two new algorithms: the "Labelled Recall Algorithm," which maximizes the expected Labelled Recall Rate, and the "Bracketed Recall Algorithm," which maximizes the <b>Bracketed</b> Recall <b>Rate.</b> Experimental results are given, showing that the two new algorithms have improved performance over the Viterbi algorithm on many criteria, especially the ones that they optimize. 1 Introduction In corpus-based approaches to parsing, one is given a treebank (a collection of text annotated with the "correct" parse tree) and attempts to find algorithms that, given unlabelled tex [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Excellent {{results have}} been {{reported}} for DataOriented Parsing (DOP) of natural language texts (Bod, 1993 c). Unfortunately, existing algorithms are both computationally intensive and difficult to implement. Previous algorithms are expensive due to two factors: the exponential number of rules that must be generated {{and the use of}} a Monte Carlo p arsing algorithm. In this paper we solve the first problem by a novel reduction of the DOP model toga small, equivalent probabilistic context-free grammar. We solve the second problem by a novel deterministic parsing strategy that maximizes the expected number of correct con- stituents, rather than the probability of a correct parse tree. Using ithe optimizations, experiments yield a 97 % crossing <b>brackets</b> <b>rate</b> and 88 % zero crossing <b>brackets</b> <b>rate.</b> This differs significantly from the results reported by Bod, and is compara- ble to results from a duplication of Pereira and Schabes's (1992) experiment on the same data.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionPrimers are {{considered}} widely essential for bonding orthodontic brackets. However, {{their role in}} minimizing <b>bracket</b> failure <b>rates</b> has been frequently questioned. ObjectiveTo investigate {{the difference in the}} <b>bracket</b> failure <b>rate</b> in direct bonding with and without the use of orthodontic primer. Setting and designA prospective, single blinded clinical study at a private clinical practice in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. Methods and material 38 class I bimaxillary protrusion patients requiring all first premolar extraction treatment were assigned to primer and non primer group (19 /group) and bonded in a standardized manner. They were followed up from strap up till the end of treatment and <b>bracket</b> failure <b>rate</b> during the entire treatment was recorded, assessed and compared. Statistical analysisStatistical significance between the two groups was checked using Fischer’s exact test (P less than. 05 was considered significant). ResultDebonding in non primer group was more than in primer group but not statistically or clinically significant.

30|$|When {{assessing}} distribution per arch (Table  1), {{we found}} a higher <b>bracket</b> failure <b>rate</b> in the lower arch (9.5 %), and this result agrees with previous studies [1, 5, 9, 19, 20]. The challenge in maintaining the lower arch dry during bracket bonding, the higher initial crowding, and the occlusal interference may be the causes of greater failure [1, 17, 20].|$|R
30|$|<b>Bracket</b> failure <b>rates</b> are an {{accepted}} method {{for the evaluation}} of bracket performance, allowing the comparison with the results of other studies [17].

40|$|Thank you for {{inviting}} me to testify today at this hearing on extension of the incentives for savings and investment that are scheduled to expire {{in the next few}} years. Major tax incentives enacted in 2001 and 2003 that are scheduled to expire and that the Congress may consider renewing include the special lower tax rates for capital gains and dividend income enacted in 2003, and the increase in the annual deduction amount for qualified section 179 property, the savers credit, and the above the line deduction for qualified post-secondary education expenses, all enacted in 2001. The education deduction and the increase in the section 179 deduction expire {{at the end of this}} year, the savers credit expires at the end of 2006, and the lower tax rates for capital gains and dividends expire at end of 2008. My remarks will focus mainly on the effects of extending lower rates for capital gains and dividends. I will also comment briefly on the savers credit and the education deduction. Lower Rates for Capital Gains and Dividends Prior to 2003, dividends of individuals were taxed at the same rate as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains were subject to a maximum tax rate of 20 percent for taxpayers in the 25 percent tax <b>rate</b> <b>bracket</b> and above and of 10 percent for taxpayers in the 15 percent tax <b>rate</b> <b>bracket</b> and below. Between 2003 and the end of 2007, dividends and capital gains will both be subject to a maximum rate of 15 percent for taxpayers in the 25 percent <b>rate</b> <b>bracket</b> and above and 5 percent for taxpayers in lower <b>brackets.</b> (The lower <b>rate</b> on dividends was effective January 1, 2003; the lower rate on capital gains for sales of assets after May 6, 2003). In 2008, the rates drop to zero for taxpayers in the 15 percent income tax <b>rate</b> <b>bracket</b> and below. The lower rates for dividends and capital gains expire at the end of tax year 2008. The lower rates for dividends and capital gains have been justified on two grounds: 1) relief of the double taxation of corporate income, so that all income is taxed once, and 2...|$|R

30|$|Patient {{motivation}} for orthodontic treatment arises {{as an important}} factor, especially when considering time and even quality of the results. When the orthodontist cannot get the patients to adhere to treatment, they become less concerned and do not properly follow the instructions for appliances use and care, increasing the chances of appliance breakage thus compromising the treatment outcomes [1, 10 – 14]. Moreover, patients that are less committed to treatment and present higher <b>bracket</b> failure <b>rate</b> could have longer treatment duration, a situation that affects patient quality of life, considering financial and satisfaction aspects [2, 10, 12, 15, 16].|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{time dimension}} into income taxation. Economic theory derives optimal income taxation by explaining individual behaviors through utility and social welfaremaximization. We argue that observing collective behaviors through {{the distribution of}} number of returns and the revenue themselves offers a viable alternative. Our study is confined toUS joint returns individual income tax from 1996 to 2008. We introduce a combination of cubic spline fit to data and Pareto distribution to estimate the revenue and number of returns distributions. Normalization admits comparative study of year to year changes in those distributions. We discover that the tax burden of low income taxpayers has decreased consistently, while the conventional rule of inflation indexation of tax bracket only is applied. This is an instability {{in the sense that}} the distribution of revenue transforms into a qualitatively different distribution over time. We derive the control of the instability. Control using brackets only implies optimal brackets arewidened over the peak of the revenue and shifted to the right for higher <b>brackets.</b> Control using <b>rates</b> only implies an overall reduction of marginal tax rates. Control using both <b>brackets</b> andmarginal <b>rates</b> combines these two features. Some brackets are removed and consequently marginal rates for some taxpayers are reduced. Dependency of the distribution of number of returns to tax liability and tax parameters proves to have insignificant effect on the optimal tax parameters. Fairness is defined in the literature as tax liability per unit income. Control of the instability togetherwith a uniformchange in fairness is addressed. There is a trade-off between controlling instability and ensuring constant change in the fairness of the tax system. We derive the optimal <b>brackets</b> and marginal <b>rates</b> that minimize this trade-off. As expected, the general rule for optimality is that marginal tax rates are barely changed to provide constant change in fairness. Yet, small adjustment of the brackets provides control of the instability...|$|R
