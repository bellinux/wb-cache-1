5|$|The two men saw an {{extraordinarily}} dense cloud rising rapidly above the peak. This cloud and {{a request by}} a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon {{the house for the}} courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous wave action in the Bay of Naples.|$|E
5|$|The attack tapered {{off with}} the coming of daylight, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> it resumed. The North Koreans struck {{repeatedly}} at the defense line. This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September. The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops. Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning. All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points. At one time, the regimental reserve was down to six men. When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12:00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E

40|$|I remain uncomfortable when {{entering}} my patients' homes, {{especially when}} {{there is little to}} offer beyond the dubious benefit of my presence. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>night's</b> visit felt different. Neither my patient nor I knew yet that he was dying, and neither of us knew that the same disease that would take his life would soon touch me, too...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> soon <b>that</b> <b>night</b> she was closeted with Dudley, {{and closely}} {{questioning}} {{him about the}} affair. My lord was mightily vehement.|$|R
5|$|On 7June the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion at Le Mesnil was {{attacked}} by units from the 857th and 858th Grenadier Regiments, supported by tanks and self-propelled guns. The battalion inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans, but only managed to drive them back with a bayonet charge by 'B' Company. The next day the battalion was involved in several small battles, and on the 9June sent a reconnaissance patrol to check if the Germans were still occupying Bavent. The patrol was driven back by a strong German force, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> another patrol entered the village and planted explosive charges on weapons and in buildings. Attacks by German infantry and armour continued until {{the night of the}} 12/13June, when Bréville was finally captured by the division's only reserves, a mixed force from the 12th Parachute Battalion and 12th Devonshire Battalion supported by a troop of tanks from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars. On 13 June the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division crossed the River Orne from the west, and took over responsibility for the southern sector of the Orne bridgehead. At the same time the 4th Special Service Brigade was attached to the 6th Airborne Division, which gave them the ability to rotate one brigade at a time out of the front line to allow them to rest. The 3rd Parachute Brigade, having suffered more casualties than the division's other brigades, was the first formation relieved.|$|E
5|$|On 8 and 9 January 1943, Div Cav {{advanced}} again. The A Squadron vehicles at Nofilia {{were loaded}} on transporters, which {{drove down the}} main road {{while the rest of}} the regiment screened the New Zealand Division advance. The A Squadron vehicles were unloaded near Wadi Bei el Chebir, east of the expected German rearguard near Wadi Temet, and the regiment caught up on 14 January. The following day, A Squadron crossed the road and withstood shelling by anti-tank guns and artillery until the afternoon. B Squadron probed south, also encountering German anti-tank guns. After one of its Stuart tanks knocked out an anti-tank gun, B Squadron advanced through the German line, dislodging anti-tank guns and destroying a Sd.Kfz. 250 half-track. During the afternoon, C Squadron failed to break through the German centre <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> the Germans withdrew. On 16 January, the regiment advanced to high ground above the airstrip at Sedada, losing a tank and carrier. C Squadron advanced down the plateau in the darkness, losing a carrier to a mine on the trail. The regiment found an alternate route, ending the day in Wadi Merdum. On 18 January, Div Cav advanced through rugged country to Beni Ulid. The regiment advanced towards Tarhuna the following day, bivouacking halfway there, before discovering a route through the hills north of the road.|$|E
5|$|The ROK {{disorganization}} was {{so great}} {{in the face of}} continued North Korean pressure that Task Force Jackson could not launch its planned attack. The US 21st Infantry was in an assembly area north of An'gang-ni and ready for an attack the morning of the 28th, but during the night the ROK 17th Regiment lost its position on the high ridge northward at the bend of the Kigye valley, and the attack was canceled. The South Koreans regained their position in the afternoon <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> lost it again. At the same time, elements of the NK 5th Division penetrated the ROK 3rd Division southwest of P'ohang-dong. Coulter directed the 21st Infantry to repel this penetration. During the day on August 29, B Company, 21st Infantry, supported by a platoon of tanks of B Company, 73rd Medium Tank Battalion, successfully counterattacked northwest from the southern edge of P'ohang-dong for a distance of , with South Korean troops following. The American units then withdrew to P'ohang-dong. That night the ROK's withdrew, and the next day an American infantry-tank force repeated the action of the day before. The 21st Infantry then took over from the ROK 3rd Division a sector extending north and northwest of P'ohang-dong.|$|E
6000|$|Little {{more was}} said, <b>but</b> from <b>that</b> <b>night</b> Mrs Gaff changed her manner and her practice. She set herself earnestly and doggedly {{to prepare for}} the return of her husband and child! ...|$|R
60|$|And {{where he}} lay, Hereward never knew. <b>But</b> from <b>that</b> <b>night</b> Martin got {{a trick of}} {{stroking}} and patting his little axe, and talking to {{it as if it}} had been alive.|$|R

5|$|The next day, Laura {{meets with}} Heather and Wendy, who hold a séance {{to try to}} contact Christine. When she returns to the hotel Laura informs John that Christine has said he is in danger and must leave Venice. John loses his temper with Laura, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> they receive a {{telephone}} call informing them that their son (Nicholas Salter) has been injured in an accident at his boarding school. Laura departs for England, while John stays on to complete the restoration. Under the assumption that Laura is in England, John is shocked when later that day he spots her on a boat {{that is part of}} a funeral cortege, accompanied by the two sisters. Concerned about his wife's mental state and with reports of a serial killer at large in Venice, he reports Laura's disappearance to the police. The inspector (Renato Scarpa) investigating the killings is suspicious of John and has him followed.|$|E
5|$|Hela and {{the rest}} of the fleet {{anchored}} off Helgoland on 811 September. During the day the ships conducted training with steam tactics. On 11 September the ships returned to Wilhelmshaven where on the following two days the ships replenished their coal supplies. On 14 September the final operation of the annual maneuvers began. The situation specified that the naval war had gone badly for Germany; only four battleships were still in service, along with Hela, Freya, and a division of torpedo boats. The ships were to be stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river to protect the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and access to Hamburg. On 15 September, the hostile force blockaded the Elbe, along with other rivers and harbors on the North Sea. The torpedo boats, which had been scattered in the previous engagement, were tracked and destroyed by the hostile force. The hostile battleship squadron steamed to the mouth of the Elbe, where Hela, Freya, and the remaining torpedo boats were stationed as lookouts. Nothing happened during the day of 16 September, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> several German torpedo boats managed to destroy one of the blockading cruisers and badly damage another. The following day, Prinz Heinrich engaged Hela and Freya briefly before forcing the two ships to retreat. The weather began to storm so the operation was postponed until the following day. That morning, the hostile fleet forced its way into the Elbe, past the fortifications at the mouth of the river. The German flotilla made a desperate attack which resulted in the sinking of two of the hostile battleships. The hostile force, however, ultimately overwhelmed the outnumbered German ships and the exercise ended with their victory.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} the first march, on March 9, 1965, Martin Luther King, Jr. led a {{symbolic}} march over the bridge. By then local activists and residents had been joined by hundreds of protesters from across the country, including numerous clergy and nuns. Whites made up one-third of the marchers. That day King pulled the marchers back from entering the county and having another confrontation with county and state forces. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> white minister James Reeb, who had traveled to the city from Boston, was attacked and killed in Selma by white members of the KKK.|$|E
60|$|It was {{an unusual}} thing for Carson Chalmers to play the Caliph. <b>But</b> on <b>that</b> <b>night</b> he felt the inefficacy of {{conventional}} antidotes to melancholy. Something wanton and egregious, something high-flavored and Arabian, he must have to lighten his mood.|$|R
50|$|However, she is miserable {{in their}} apartment. When Grabovsky tracks {{her down to}} offer her a film {{contract}} with Sound Films International, she tears up the contract, <b>but</b> later <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> reconsiders and sneaks away to accept, leaving only a letter of explanation for Andre.|$|R
60|$|Still, I was {{undoubtedly}} anxious, and slept <b>but</b> little <b>that</b> <b>night</b> {{thinking of the}} wretch. When the following morning I arrived at my office and still could see no trace of him, I had serious thoughts of putting the law in motion on his behalf.|$|R
25|$|White {{was carried}} {{to a doctor}} and they {{initially}} thought he would recover, and the next day, he gave a statement that exonerated Curly Bill of murder, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> White's condition worsened. Brocius later claimed that his gun discharged accidentally and reportedly immediately regretted shooting White. He testified at his trial {{that he did not}} consider himself to have committed a crime. Brocius waived his right to a preliminary hearing, apparently because he feared a lynching, as White was very popular as town marshal. Brocius was anxious to be moved out of town. Pima County Deputy Marshal Earp and George Collins immediately took Brocius to Tucson for trial.|$|E
500|$|Cave {{attempted}} further {{negotiations with}} Khalid, but these failed and Rawson sent an ultimatum, requiring him to haul down his flag {{and leave the}} palace by 09:00 on 27 August or he would open fire. During the afternoon, all merchant vessels were cleared from the harbour and the British women and children removed to St. George and a British-India Steam Navigation Company vessel for their safety. That night, Consul Mohun noted that: [...] "The silence which hung over Zanzibar was appalling. Usually drums were beating or babies cried <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> there was absolutely not a sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Mexican troops {{arrived in}} San Patricio {{in the early}} hours of February 26. [...] After a fifteen-minute battle, Johnson's men were defeated; six Texians, {{including}} Johnson, escaped, and the remainder were killed or captured. [...] While Urrea waited for reinforcements before beginning his march towards Goliad, his advance party searched for Grant and the remaining Texians. [...] Unaware of Johnson's fate, on February 27 Grant and his party began their march northward to San Patricio, driving a herd of several hundred horses he had purchased. [...] The men camped along San Fernando Creek on March 1. [...] Local ranchers welcomed them, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> sent a messenger to Urrea with Grant's location and plans.|$|E

60|$|It must be confessed <b>that</b> Dave slept <b>but</b> little <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> His {{mind was}} filled with what was before him.

60|$|I had {{not seen}} old Snortfrizzle again, <b>but</b> late <b>that</b> <b>night</b> I had heard a row in the hotel, and I expect it was him back from the Cat and Fiddle. Whether he was inquiring for me or not I don't know, or what he was doing, or what he did.|$|R
500|$|On 19 August, Gorizia {{departed}} Kiel and steamed to Tangier, arriving {{five days}} later. After a short stop, the ship left the port, bound for Italy, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> her forward aviation gas tank exploded, causing serious damage. She {{was forced to}} return to Tangier before proceeding to Gibraltar on 25 August for temporary repairs. While in dry dock, British officials examined the vessel and concluded that she exceeded her nominal 10,000-ton displacement, though they lodged no formal complaint for Italy's violation of the Washington Naval Treaty. The repairs were completed by 9 September, allowing Gorizia to leave Gibraltar for La Spezia, where permanent repairs would be effected. She arrived two days later; the work was completed by November, and on the 27th, she {{took part in a}} naval review for the Regent of Hungary, Miklós Horthy. Gorizia again lost her role as divisional flagship on 17 May 1937, this time being replaced by her sister [...] A naval review was held in the Gulf of Naples on 7 June, followed by another the following year on 5 May; the latter was to honor German dictator Adolf Hitler during his state visit to Italy.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens in}} Havana, Cuba. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) surprises a now-bearded Duncan (Teddy Dunn), who denies killing Lilly (Amanda Seyfried). At school, Veronica avoids Logan, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> Logan {{shows up at}} Veronica's door. Logan apologizes for owning GHB before Veronica informs him about her rape. Logan denies being her rapist, but Veronica says she'll punish whoever it is, even if it's Logan. Veronica talks to Meg (Alona Tal) about the party, and she {{mentions}} seeing Veronica being harassed by some boys before she left. Keith returns Duncan to the Kanes before threatening Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan). Veronica approaches Luke (Sam Huntington) about a trip to Tijuana {{to pick up some}} GHB; he admits getting the drugs, but he says that he gave them to Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen). Luke states that Madison Sinclair was seen writing [...] "slut" [...] on Veronica's car after the party. Veronica confronts Madison, who says that she defaced Veronica's car because she made out with Dick, her boyfriend. However, Veronica doesn't remember this incident due to the effects of the drugs. Veronica attempts to barge in on a fight between Keith and Alicia over Wallace's involvement in the Wiedman case, but her intervention does nothing to defuse the situation. Veronica talks to Casey, who confirms the make out sessions with Dick and Cassidy, and Veronica was also forced to make out with Shelly for the boys' amusement.|$|E
2500|$|These {{events and}} {{a request by}} {{messenger}} for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, continuing to study, and bathing, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon {{the house for the}} courtyard. At another tremor near dawn the population abandoned the village. After still a third [...] "the sea seemed to roll back upon itself, and to be driven from its banks", which is evidence for a tsunami. There is, however, no evidence of extensive damage from wave action.|$|E
60|$|It {{can well}} be {{imagined}} that the boys slept <b>but</b> little <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> In the morning they telegraphed to Putnam Hall for their trunks, and also let Captain Putnam and their chums know how matters stood.

Packard stated, [...] "I had a character named Pete and I usually had him encountering all these different adventures on an isolated island. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> I {{was running out of}} things for Pete to do, so I just asked what they would do." [...] His two daughters came up with different paths for the story to take and Packard thought up an ending for each of the paths. [...] "What really struck me was the natural enthusiasm they had for the idea. And I thought: 'Could I write this down?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|During the {{experimental}} detonation of a gamma bomb, scientist Bruce Banner saves teenager Rick Jones who has driven onto the testing field; Banner pushes Jones into a trench to save him, but is {{hit with the}} blast, absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation. He awakens later seemingly unscathed, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> transforms into a lumbering grey form. A pursuing soldier dubs the creature a [...] "hulk". Originally, Banner transformed into the Hulk at sunset and reverted at sunrise. Banner was cured in The Incredible Hulk #4, but chose to restore Hulk's powers with Banner's intelligence. The gamma-ray machine needed to affect the transformation-induced side effects that made Banner temporarily sick and weak when returned to his normal state.|$|E
2500|$|Before long Commodore John Reynolds arrived aboard [...] and {{superseded}} Roddam {{as senior}} officer. Reynolds assessed {{the possibility of}} attacking the convoy lying in the river, but was advised by his captains {{that it could not}} be done. Roddam requested permission to try anyway, as Colchester was 'an old man of war, not worth much, and the loss of her would be trifling {{for the good of the}} service.' Reynolds forbade Roddam from trying, whereupon Roddam suggested that Reynolds cruise off one of the channels of Belle Île, while Roddam covered the other. Reynolds agreed to this, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> the French were able to elude Reynolds, and escaped into the river Vans. On Duff's return aboard [...] to resume command of the squadron, and finding Colchester in need of repairs, Roddam was sent back to Plymouth, to refit and re-provision.|$|E
5000|$|Grand Empress Dowager Guo {{tried to}} commit suicide as she failed to demand respect from Emperor Xuānzong and Empress Dowager Zheng.
