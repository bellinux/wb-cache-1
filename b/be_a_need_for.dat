5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most {{important aspects of the}} psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E

25|$|A drop lock can {{consist of}} two {{conventional}} lock chambers {{leading to a}} sump pound, or a single long chamber incorporating the sump - although the term properly applies only to the second case. As the pounds {{at either end of}} the structure are at the same height, the lock can only be emptied either by allowing water to run to waste from the sump to a lower stream or drain, or (less wastefully) by pumping water back up to the canal. Particularly in the two-chamber type, there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a bypass culvert, to allow water to move along the interrupted pound and so supply locks further down the canal. In the case of the single-chamber type, this can be achieved by keeping the lock full and leaving the gates open while not in use.|$|E
25|$|Early {{molecular}} phylogenetic studies {{confirmed the}} genus was monophyletic and suggested four clades, which were labelled as series, {{and showed that}} Davis' subseries were not monophyletic. An expanded study in 2013 demonstrated seven major clades corresponding to biogeographical distribution. This study used nuclear encoded nrITS (Nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer), and plastid encoded matK (Maturase K), trnL-F, ndhF, and psbK–psbI, and examined all species recognised at the time, and also two naturally occurring putative hybrids. The morphological characteristic of vernation that earlier authors had mainly relied on was shown to be highly homoplasious. A number of species, such as G. nivalis and G. elwesii demonstrated intraspecific biogeographical clades, indicating problems with speciation and there may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> recircumscription.

500|$|At {{both ends}} of the runway, the taxiway ends [...] {{from the start of the}} runway, forcing {{aircraft}} which need the full length to backtrack. An extension of the taxiways would help with this problem. Both at Terminal A and B, there will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> double taxiways. This will result in insufficient space for general aviation at its current location, and this has been proposed moved eastwards past the military installations. Several airlines, in particular Helitrans, has indicated need for more space. Proposals have been made to establish a heliport to allow flight to oil platforms on the Norwegian continental shelf. The military has suggested to fill in a large section of the river delta at the west end of the runway, and move some of the cargo and helicopter operations there, but environmental concerns have been raised by among others Avinor. The cost of establishing access to the artificial land is also high. By 2050, there may be need for a second, parallel runway to meet demand, and initial plans call for a [...] runway which would be used by general aviation, regional airlines and helicopters.|$|E

2500|$|A {{complete}} miscarriage is {{when all}} products of conception have been expelled; {{these may include}} the trophoblast, chorionic villi, gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetal pole (embryo); or later in pregnancy the fetus, umbilical cord, placenta, amniotic fluid, and amniotic membrane.

Therefore, there may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> e.g. follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including an ectopic pregnancy. [...] An incomplete miscarriage occurs when some products of conception have been passed, but some remains inside the uterus. However, an increased distance between the uterine walls on transvaginal ultrasonography may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness and/or a polyp. The use of a Doppler ultrasound may be better in confirming the presence of significant retained products of conception in the uterine cavity. In cases of uncertainty, ectopic pregnancy must be excluded using techniques like serial beta-hCG measurements.|$|E
