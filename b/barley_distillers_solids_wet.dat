The variability in the chemical composition was assayed from ten samples of DS. The variation in chemical composition was high, dry matter (DM) ranging from 140 to 236 g kg- 1, crude protein ranging from 432 to 599 g kg- 1 DM and lysine ranging from 37 to 51 g (160 g N) - 1. In vitro digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen was determined from DS and soyabean meal (SBM) and was found to be lower in DS than in SBM (dry matter: 0. 560 vs. 0. 708; nitrogen: 0. 662 vs. 0. 922). A growth experiment was conducted with 160 growing pigs (40 pigs in each treatment) from 25 to 105 kg live weight range. Four pigs were kept in each pen (two female and two castrated males). In four isonitrogenous and isolysineous diets, 0, 0. 33, 0. 66 or all SBM was replaced by DS and synthetic lysine. The daily feeding allowance was restricted to provide uniform crude protein intakes. The daily weight gain and feed conversion ratio of the pigs remained about the same when one-third of SBM was replaced by DS, but they both decreased linearly (p< 0. 001) when higher amounts of DS were added to the diets. Dietary DS also linearly decreased the content of lean in valuable cuts and in carcass (p< 0. 001). In organoleptic evaluation of meat samples no {{differences were found between the}} treatments. In conclusion, the lower performance of the pigs on DS diets was mainly a result of the high variation in chemical composition of DS, which affected the protein and amino acid supply of the pigs. The results also indicated that the quality of protein is impaired during the processing of DS. vo...|$|R

40|$|While {{calculation}} {{procedures for the}} design of storage bins for dry bulk materials have been long acknowledged, the design of <b>wet</b> <b>solids</b> storage vessels is an on-going issue. Because the effects of the <b>wet</b> <b>solids</b> properties such as consolidation behavior, water permeability and viscosity on the material discharge have not been investigated yet, existing design procedures employ the principles of Jenike for dry bulk materials to describe the stress fields in a surge bin during initial filling and discharge.

40|$|The {{influence}} of random self-affine and mound substrate roughness on the wetting scenario of adsorbed van der Waals films is investigated {{as a function}} of characteristic roughness parameters. The roughness influence, which leads to triple-point wetting, is calculated by the bending free energy penalty of a solid film picking up the substrate morphology. For self-affine roughness, an increment of the roughness exponent H and/or a decrement of the roughness ratio w/ξ (with w being the rms roughness amplitude and ξ the in-plane correlation length) leads to a noticeable increment of the thickness of adsorbed solid films. Similarly for mound roughness the thickness dependence of the <b>solid</b> <b>wetting</b> layer on the average mound separation λ and system correlation length ζ follow the general scenario that smoother substrates (w/ζ« 1 and/or w/λ« 1) lead to thicker solid films.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of surface {{roughness}} on fluid viscosity using molecular dynamics simulations. The three-dimensional model consists of liquid argon flowing between two solid walls whose surface roughness was modeled using fractal theory. In tandem with previously published experimental work, our results show that, while the viscosity in smooth channels remains constant across the channel width, {{in the presence of}} surface roughness it increases close to the walls. The increase of the boundary viscosity is further accentuated by an increase in the depth of surface roughness. We attribute this behavior to the increased momentum transfer at the boundary, a result of the irregular distribution of fluid particles near rough surfaces. Furthermore, although the viscosity in smooth channels has previously been shown to be independent of the strength of the solid-liquid interaction, here we show that in the presence of surface roughness, the boundary viscosity increases with the solid's wettability. The paper concludes with an analytical description of the viscosity {{as a function of the}} distance from the channel walls, the walls’ surface roughness, and the <b>solid's</b> <b>wetting</b> properties. The relation can potentially be used to adjust the fluid dynamics equations for a more accurate description of microfluidic systems...|$|R

40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Mater of Science-Biology MicrobiologyGreenhouse gasses such as methane {{and carbon}} dioxide are thought {{to play a major}} role in global climate change. Anthropogenic methane is derived mainly from energy production, {{agricultural}} sources, and waste management practices. Anaerobic digesters function to produce energy using the methane derived from organic matter which would typically be deposited in landfills. The three main types of digesters are low <b>solids</b> <b>wet</b> digesters, high <b>solids</b> <b>wet</b> digesters, and dry anaerobic digesters. The dry anaerobic digester, which is the least common type, has relatively high solids content with very few moving parts, and the bulk phase of the system is solid instead of liquid. Due to the rarity of dry anaerobic digesters, the microbial community responsible for the production of biogas is less-studied than in other types of digesters. Biogas, which is usually comprised of methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide, is produced as a result of four metabolic steps which include hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. In hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and acetogenesis, bacteria break down organic matter, and in methanogenesis archaea use the products of acidogenesis and acetogenesis to produce methane. The main objective of this research was to determine if a fluctuation pattern in the concentrations of two orders methanogenic archaea (Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales) existed over a 28 -day fermentation in a dry anaerobic digester. To address this objective, taxonomic groups present within the digester were determined by 454 -pyrosequencing, and the biogas composition and volume were characterized. The 16 S rRNA gene copy concentrations of Methanosarcinales spp. and Methanomicrobiales spp. were determined using qPCR. Bench-scale biogas experiments were conducted with and without substrate, and biological samples were collected at regular time intervals for qPCR analysis. Pyrosequencing results indicate that within the dominate class Methanomicrobia, the orders Methanosarcinales (73. 7 %) and Methanomicrobiales (26. 2 %) were most common in the tested anaerobic digester before biogas experiments. Biogas experiments show that fermenters with substrate produce a greater volume of biogas and methane than those without substrate. qPCR analysis showed that during the 28 -day fermentation, Methanosarcinales spp. were present at approximately 107 16 S genes per gram of sample, whereas Methanomicrobiales spp. had concentrations between 104 and 106 16 S genes per gram of sample. Overall, Methanosarcinales was consistently more abundant at every tested time point. The different concentrations of methanogens could indicate that the nutrients and conditions within the tested digester are more suited to the metabolism of Methanosarcinales spp. than Methanomicrobiales spp. This information could be used in the future to dictate the type of substrate used in a particular dry anaerobic digester...|$|R

Then, of all bodies, {{the gases}} are those {{which might be}} {{expected}} to show some mutual action whilst jointly under the attractive influence of the platina or other solid acting substance. Liquids, such as water, alcohol, &c., are in so dense and comparatively incompressible a state, as to favour no expectation that their particles should approach much closer to each other by the attraction of the body to which they adhere, and yet that attraction must (according to its effects) place their particles as near to those of the <b>solid</b> <b>wetted</b> body as they are to each other, and in many cases it is evident that the former attraction is the stronger. But gases and vapours are bodies competent to suffer very great changes in the relative distances of their particles by external agencies; and where they are in immediate contact with the platina, the approximation of the particles to those of the metal may be very great. In the case of the hygrometric bodies referred to (621.), it is sufficient to reduce the vapour to the fluid state, frequently from atmospheres so rare that without this influence it would be needful to compress them by mechanical force into a bulk not more than 1/10th or even 1/20th of their original volume before the vapours would become liquids.|$|R
