5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{work for}} the period is Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus's Philippic History.

These surviving histories are complemented by fragments of other histories, including Theopompus's 58-volume history of Philip (which was the source for much of Trogus's Philippic History) and by contemporary epigraphic sources.|$|E

5|$|Between {{two thirds}} and three {{quarters}} of the population live in urban areas. Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years. This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use. However, {{from the beginning of the}} 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E
5|$|Despite reservations, Hitler {{remained}} {{committed to}} the offensive. He and the OKW, early in the preparatory phase, were hopeful that the offensive would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused {{more and more on}} the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the Panther tank, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> Elefant tank destroyer and greater numbers of the Tiger heavy tank. He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival. Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the offensive to allow for more equipment to reach the front.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} officially began in January 2013. Ubisoft Montreal, the {{developer}} of Patriots, handled the game's development, with Ubisoft's offices in Barcelona, Toronto, Kiev, Shanghai and Chengdu providing assistance. The game was originally called Rainbow Six Unbreakable, a title that reflected not only the game's destruction mechanic <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> mindset of the development team, who had to deliver a game that was once stuck in development hell. According to Alexandre Remy, the brand director, the team was confident in their new vision for the game but very nervous when they revealed it, realizing the change of direction would likely disappoint some fans.|$|E
5|$|Fraudulent {{accounting}} {{can arise}} {{from a variety}} of issues. These problems usually come to light eventually and could ruin not only the company <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> auditors for not discovering or revealing the misstatements. Several studies have proposed that a firm's corporate culture as well as the values it stresses may negatively alter an accountant's behavior. This environment could contribute to the degradation of ethical values that were learned from universities.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their reproductive capacity and litter size, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E

Two rolls contained his own compositions: Berceuse (Cradle Song) (c. 1920–21) and Prélude tragique (1924). Ornstein never recorded, in any format, even a single example of his futurist pieces which had brought him fame.|$|E
