5|$|Although many in NASA's Voyager {{program were}} {{supportive}} of the idea, there were concerns that taking a picture of Earth {{so close to the}} Sun risked damaging the spacecraft's imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan's idea was put into practice, but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to Voyager 1 were also <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> off or transferred to other projects. Finally, NASA Administrator Richard Truly interceded to ensure that the photograph was taken.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 a new fish counter was {{commissioned}} for the Shimna {{river and the}} initial results indicated that fish numbers had reached approximately 76% of the conservation limit (the number of fish required to spawn) in the 2010 season. This is an improvement from the estimated 12% in 2009. However, in 2014 concerns about salmon levels in the river were raised again after {{it was observed that}} the number of eggs <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> was still below conservation limits.|$|E
5|$|Like other bird-hipped dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gryposaurus {{appears to}} have only existed {{for part of the}} {{duration}} of time that the rocks were being formed. As the formation was <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> down, it recorded a change to more marine-influenced conditions. Gryposaurus is absent from {{the upper part of the}} formation, with Prosaurolophus present instead. Other dinosaurs known from only the lower part of the formation include the horned Centrosaurus and the hollow-crested duckbill Corythosaurus. Gryposaurus may have preferred river-related settings.|$|E

5|$|The {{cattle egret}} engages in {{low levels of}} brood parasitism, {{and there are a}} few {{instances}} of cattle egret eggs <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E
5|$|The strain took a toll, and by June he was <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> up {{for days}} on end with stomach problems, {{headaches}} and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of Darwin's illness remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.|$|E
5|$|A royal {{charter of}} 1215 gave Wellington {{its status as}} a town, and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> out, with the church at the east end of town, in a similar manner to other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution.

5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs <b>being</b> <b>laid.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E

Calabria spent long periods abroad in her first decade of service. She was operating in Chinese waters in 1899 when the Boxer Rebellion broke out. She joined an international fleet that included representatives from the fleets of the Eight Nation Alliance {{in the mouth of}} the Hai River while a contingent of 475 soldiers traveled to Beijing to reinforce the Legation Quarter.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of charges <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> against his son, Atherton's father approached Member of Parliament and King's Counsel John Diefenbaker in December 1950 {{and sought to}} retain him as defence counsel. The Athertons were Diefenbaker's constituents; their hometown, Zealandia, Saskatchewan, was in his riding, Lake Centre. Diefenbaker declined the case, stating that Parliament had first call on his time, that his wife Edna was seriously ill with leukemia, {{and that he was}} not admitted as a lawyer in British Columbia. As Edna Diefenbaker was well known as an influence over her husband, in desperation Alfred Atherton Sr. talked his way into her Saskatoon hospital room.|$|E
50|$|The Pintados de Pasi Festival, in Passi City, central of Iloilo province, {{is one way}} of {{celebrating the}} cityhood of Passi in March 1998.

It is the most popular spectator cultural event and the most popular for the community that has a large following. Theatrical-like street dancing performances are a celebrated part of the Pintados festivity that is characterized by heavy and aggressive body movements.

5|$|Near {{the hinge}} {{of the shell}} is the umbo, often a rounded, knob-like {{protuberance}} usually surrounding the beak. The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell, with extra material gradually <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> down along the margins on the opposite sides. The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{work had}} begun well before that date, however, and Ericsson's {{consortium}} contracted with Thomas R. Rowland of the Continental Iron Works at Greenpoint, Brooklyn on 25 October {{for construction of}} Monitors hull, with her keel <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> on that same day. The turret was built and assembled at the Novelty Iron Works in Manhattan, disassembled and shipped to Greenpoint where it was reassembled. The ship's steam engines and machinery were constructed at the DeLamater Iron Works, also in Manhattan. Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers, who once served aboard Merrimack, was appointed Superintendent of the ship while she was undergoing construction. Although never formally assigned to the crew, he remained aboard her as an inspector during her maiden voyage and battle.|$|E
