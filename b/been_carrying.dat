5|$|Following {{the failed}} landing by the Australians at Porton Plantation, the {{commander}} of the Australian II Corps, Savige, decided to focus the main effort of the Australian campaign upon driving south towards the Japanese garrison at Buin, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were holding out. In order to concentrate enough forces for the next phase of the operation, Savige decided that the 11th Brigade, which had <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> the advance north, should be relieved so that it could be transferred to the south following a period of rest and reorganisation.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{who might have}} been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 1947, a {{day after}} sailing from Rio de Janeiro for Europe, oil spilled on the ship’s boilers, causing an engine-room fire that quickly spread through the first class cabins and killed 27. The ship was towed from its {{position}} off Cabo Frio into Rio de Janeiro on 1 August 1947. The ship had <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> 1,060 passengers bound for Lisbon, Naples, and Marseille, along with 500 crew members, and {{had been scheduled to}} carry Italian refugees on its return voyage.|$|E
5|$|Operation Teardrop was a United States Navy {{operation}} of World War II conducted during April and May 1945 to sink German U-boats approaching the United States East Coast that {{were believed to}} be armed with V-1 flying bombs.

5|$|Still {{relatively}} inexperienced, Low ordered {{too many}} {{men to the}} outside of the boat to work on the buildup, and the Rose Pink tipped over too far. The portholes had been left open, and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men.

5|$|The {{ships in}} the orders of battle below {{are listed in the}} order in which they {{appeared}} in the respective battle lines.

5|$|With {{some people}} unable {{to believe that}} the Japanese would be so ruthless, rumours began to spread almost {{immediately}} after news of the attack was made public. The most common rumour was that Centaur had <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> munitions or commandos {{at the time of her}} sinking, with the Japanese made aware of this prior to her departure. This stemmed from an incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1794, Thomson {{spoke with}} a ship that was sailing for Botany Bay. The ship had {{encountered}} a French privateer, of 14 guns, which the British ship managed to drive off after an engagement that lasted almost two hours. Reportedly, Prince of Wales went on to recapture a British brig that a French 74-gun ship of the line had captured. Prince of Wales sent the brig into Oporto. However, {{this may have been}} Best. Lastly, in early 1974, Prince of Wales captured and brought in Flugen, of Malmö, which had <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> wine, brandy, and bale goods from Bordeaux to Saint-Domingue.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and appeared to have <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice, and oil were thrown on the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) {{would be needed to}} repair the damage, and the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|E
5|$|Richard Ferguson QC, for the defence, {{argued that}} the ESDA test, which {{suggested}} that the disputed words had {{been added to the}} notes later, was not reliable. The defence also produced 14 witness statements from the two Blakelock inquiries, seven of them excerpts from Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry and seven from the original investigation in 1985, the latter read out to the jury as statements H to N.

5|$|The Holderness {{coastline}} suffers {{the highest}} rate of coastal erosion in Europe: 2 metres a year on average or 2million tonnes of material a year. Some of this is transported by longshore drift with about 3% of material being deposited at Spurn Head spit, to the south. The coastline has retreated noticeably in the last 2,000 years, with many former settlements now flooded, particularly Ravenser Odd and Ravenspurn, which was a major port until its destruction in the 14th century. Erosion is an ongoing concern in the area. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council has <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> out cliff erosion defences between Sewerby and Kilnsea since 1951. The Holderness area drains mostly into the Humber and the eponymous River Hull drains the area north of Hull.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{scored a}} notable {{success on the}} night of 2 December 1943 when 105 Ju 88 bombers struck the port of Bari. Skilfully using chaff to confuse the Allied radar operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most {{destructive}} air raid on Allied shipping since the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. Burning oil and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port was put out of action for three weeks. Moreover, one of the ships sunk, SS John Harvey, had <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> mustard gas, which enveloped the port in a cloud of poisonous vapours.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders had {{a number}} of preparatory hurdles to {{overcome}} before the battle. The men of the Rifle Brigade had, for the previous few weeks, <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> out engineering work for II ANZAC Corps and were fatigued. The ongoing rainfall affected both the roads by which the division had to move to its starting positions and the placement of the supporting artillery. The muddy ground did not provide a stable platform for the guns and howitzers. Furthermore, the artillery barrage targeting the barbed wire emplacements protecting the strongpoints on the slopes of Belluvue Spur failed to destroy them, a fact determined by scouts on 11 October. Once this information reached the brigade commanders, Braithwaite and A. E. Stewart (who took over command of the Rifle Brigade following Young's wounding), they pressed Russell for cancellation of the attack; this was refused.|$|E

After the final race of the season, series champion Dale Earnhardt and race winner Wallace drove a side-by-side Polish victory lap carrying flags for Kulwicki and Allison. Kulwicki finished 41st in the final points standings despite competing in only five races. Seven months {{after the death of}} Allison, Neil Bonnett died at Daytona. Racing Champions issued a die-cast version of Alan Kulwicki's No. 7 car that was a tribute to Kulwicki's 1992 title.|$|E
5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide in tall trees). An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pčinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had <b>been</b> <b>carrying</b> in her huge ears. If an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E
