Furthermore, it examines the problems of ageism or discrimination because of age. The practical part of the bachelor thesis is based on research and findings that were acquired in such research. The objective of the whole thesis was to determine - {{by means of a}} semantic differential - teenagers? opinions of seniors and vice versa. Our intention was to ascertain from respondents, who completed <b>record</b> <b>sheets,</b> if they are prejudiced in any way against the other generation and if they are influenced by stereotypes. Identical <b>record</b> <b>sheets</b> were prepared for both target groups, whereas these <b>record</b> <b>sheets</b> introduced contradictory traits of character., such as slow-fast, beautiful-ugly, tidy-untidy, communicative- uncommunicative and similar. Results of this evaluation of individual character traits performed by respondents reveal apparent differences. However, the overall findings show that both groups perceive each other positively. This bachelor thesis may be used for future publication activities and as potential documentation tackling the issues of ageism...|$|R
