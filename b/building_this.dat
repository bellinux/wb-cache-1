5|$|The name Whitehall {{was used}} for several {{buildings}} in the Tudor period. It either referred to a building made of light stone, or as a general term for any festival <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> included the Royal Palace of Whitehall, which in turn gave {{its name to the}} street.|$|E

The corrosion was eventually so severe that the weld on a connection failed, resulting in the collapse.|$|E
5|$|A {{district}} {{post office}} {{was established in}} 1871 at the railway siding's station house. By 1908 the post office was run from the chapel house in {{the main part of}} the town, and a shop ran from the same <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> building was used for around 70 years as a store, telephone exchange, mail exchange and petrol station. The post office closed in 1977 and has not reopened.|$|E

5|$|A slip ramp {{was also}} planned in 2000 {{to connect to}} Lafayette Street in Norristown {{as part of a}} {{revitalization}} plan for the community. The project would involve extending Lafayette Street to the new ramp. This proposed slip ramp is projected to cost $160 million. Montgomery County officials have proposed a surcharge for the new exit in {{to help pay for the}} project. Work on engineering and environmental approval for the interchange occurred in 2008, and acquisition of land began in 2011. On January 7, 2015, the turnpike commission committed $45 million to <b>building</b> <b>this</b> interchange. Construction on the interchange at Lafayette Street may begin as soon as 2018.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. They finally did so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler <b>Building.</b> <b>This</b> design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the Cornerstone article, English Heritage stepped in to begin legal proceedings that would lead to the compulsory purchase of the barn. It carried out emergency repairs of the barn in November 2009, without the owners' consent, under an Urgent Works Notice. The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works, declassifying the barn from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> enabled the notice to be issued more speedily, overriding the owners' objections.|$|E
5|$|The Perth City Council {{had been}} based from 1871 in the Perth Town Hall, then in 1925 moved to offices in Murray Street. The {{site of the}} Public Offices on St Georges Terrace {{was chosen as the}} site for a new home for the Perth City Council in 1954. Immediately south of the Public Offices {{building}} stood the Soldiers' Institute <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> building was taken over from the Returned Soldiers' League by the ABC in 1937 for its 6WF radio studio.|$|E
5|$|The present château {{with its}} five conical towers and watchtower capped by slate roofs {{began to be}} built in the 15th century, and was altered and {{extended}} several times since then.

5|$|There was a {{post office}} in Meander by 1888, {{probably}} started the previous year. Prior to this there was an unofficial post office, a mail depot run by locals. The post office continued in a separate building until then postmaster, Harold Taylor, retired in 1977. After this post function was a service provided by the local store. There was a manual telephone exchange in the post office <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> was replaced with an automatic exchange in June 1975.|$|E
5|$|To the {{north-east}} of {{the house}} is the estate's former stable <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> was built {{around the time of the}} fifth Earl's extension {{of the house}} and is aligned on a north-south axis. The building comprises three three-storey gable-fronted pavilions separated by a pair of two-storey wings. The façades are of brick, with the west façade painted white and the east unpainted. The roof is of slate with a clock tower in the centre of the east side of the central pavilion. Close to the stables is an underground brick-built ice house accessed by a vaulted tunnel. The ice house dates from 1788.|$|E
5|$|While {{the library}} {{building}} {{dates to the}} early 20th century the move toward intellectual outreach in Oregon started years before. The first Oregon library was organized in 1872, though it had no building of its own. Before the library had its own building, library books were stored in a drug store {{and then in the}} County Treasurer's office. Eventually the Oregon Library occupied rented office space in the First National Bank <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> situation persisted until 1905 when Oregon voters voiced their collective opinion on the library's future.|$|E

5|$|Mr Knight of Cannington {{alerted the}} nuns {{to the sale}} of Taunton Lodge, and they raised the £3,150 {{required}} to purchase it. They completed the purchase in early May 1807, after some minor quibbles with the Coles family. When the abbess visited the Lodge prior to the purchase, she had identified that it would require £1,000 worth of improvements {{in addition to the}} money already spent on its acquisition. The plans included extending the existing building to gain a staircase and some dormitories for the school girls, and the addition of a new wing that would include a chapel, infirmary, four cells, and rooms for the male chaplain and servants. The new building was begun in March 1808, and by June of that year, the entire community had moved from Winchester, despite the work being ongoing. The shell of the new body was completed by the autumn of 1808, but the work was delayed {{due to a lack of}} finances as £1,908 had already been spent on altering the old <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> cost did not include the erection of the new wing, thus the constructions costs were already far surpassing the original estimate.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, 2008, a {{bond issue}} {{for a new}} $95 million high school was passed. Groundbreaking for the new high school took place on September 23, 2009, and {{construction}} was completed on April 1, 2012 at $7 million under budget. As a result, the school board approved construction of a $975,000 ticket/concession/restroom and storage <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> also allowed the asphalt parking to be changed to concrete and for adding artificial turf to the football field, which saves on future maintenance costs. Installation of the football field's turf was completed in September 2011. In early 2012, the Board of Education approved a 1-1 initiative, providing every student with an iPad. In 2012, GCHS was selected as one of 314 Blue Ribbon Schools nationwide. The Blue Ribbon Award recognizes {{public and private schools}} which perform at high levels or have made significant academic improvements. In addition, principal James Mireles was honored with the Terrel H. Bell Award for Outstanding Leadership.|$|E

5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common life changed, the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the <b>building.</b> <b>This</b> allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E
