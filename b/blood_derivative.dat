Cellular differentiation was examined by scanning electron microscopy, inverted microscopy and transepithelial electrical resistance. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to {{evaluate the}} effects of the <b>blood</b> <b>derivatives</b> on corneal epithelial wound healing in vivo. Different <b>blood</b> <b>derivatives</b> were applied topically every 2 hours for 2 days after corneal epithelial debridement. The concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor -β 1 (TGF-β 1), fibronectin, platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB), PDGF-BB, and hyaluronic acid in different <b>blood</b> <b>derivatives</b> were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vitro experiments demonstrated statistically comparable epitheliotropic characteristics in cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation for the two commercialized HPLs compared to FBS and HPS. Cells cultured without any serum were used as control group. The epitheliotropic capacities were statistically higher in the two commercialized HPLs compared to the control group (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction The {{objective}} of this prospective randomised blind controlled clinical trial was to appraise the effectiveness of topical application of autologous platelet gel (PG) in canine chronic non-healing wounds. Material and Methods Dogs with bilateral chronic wounds caused by protracted decubitus ulcers (n = 18) were considered in the study. For each dog, the wound side was randomised to receive either platelet gel (group G) every 5 days for 5 dressing changes, or paraffin gauze dressings (group C), as a negative control. Wound healing and wound surfaces were compared at admission and then evaluated every 5 th day, until the 25 th day. The following outcome variables were measured: open wound area, reduction of open wound area compared to admission and to each preceding dressing change and time to complete epithelialisation. Results Significant differences in the healing process were observed at day 5 and throughout the entire study period (P< 0. 0001). The final mean percentage value of surface reduction was 93. 5 % in group G and 13. 2 % in group C (P< 0. 0001).

40|$|INTRODUCÃO: A hepatite C é uma das principais causas de doença hepática em todo mundo. Apresenta um curso evolutivo dinâmico e influenciável por diversos co-fatores. Dentre eles, a infecção pregressa pelo vírus B (anti-HBcAg [+] e HBsAg [-]) tem se associado a pior prognóstico histológico e terapêutico. Este trabalho teve como objetivo analisar a associação entre a infecção pregressa pelo vírus B e fibrose hepática em portadores de hepatite C crônica, de maneira independente. MÉTODOS: Foram revistos retrospectivamente prontuários médicos de pacientes infectados cronicamente pelo vírus C, atendidos consecutivamente durante um ano no ambulatório de Doenças Infecciosas e Parasitárias - HC FMUSP, quanto aos dados epidemiológicos, clínicos, laboratoriais e histológicos. A análise de independência do impacto da infecção pregressa pelo vírus B foi realizada através de modelo estatístico de regressão logística multivariado, considerando a detecção do anti-HBcAg como variável de exposição, sendo o desfecho a alteração estrutural histopatológica graus 3 e 4 (septos com formação de nódulos e cirrose). 0 RESULTADOS: 145 indivíduos foram avaliados pelo estudo, 47. 2 % com anti-HBcAg (+). O fator de risco mais comumente relatado foi transfusão de sangue e hemoderivados (35, 9 %). Embora necrose em saca-bocado tenha sido encontrada com maior frequência no grupo de infecção pregressa, a sorologia anti-HBcAg (+) não se associou à fibrose hepática avançada. CONCLUSÕES: A infecção pregressa pelo vírus B não parece acentuar a lesão estrutural desencadeada pela hepatite C crônica, após controle estatístico para outros co-fatores sabidamente capazes de influenciar a história natural desta infecção. INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C is a {{major cause}} of liver disease worldwide. Its {{evolutionary}} course is dynamics and may be influenced by several cofactors. Among them, previous hepatitis B virus infection (anti-HBcAg [+] and HBsAg [-]) has been associated with worse histological and therapeutic prognosis. This study had the objective of independently assessing the relationship between previous hepatitis B infection and liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: The medical records of patients chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus who had been seen consecutively during a one-year period at the infectious and parasitic diseases outpatient clinic of HC FMUSP were retrospectively reviewed in relation to epidemiological, clinical and histological data. Analysis on the independence of the previous hepatitis B infection was performed using the statistical model of multivariate logistic regression. Detection of anti-HBcAg was taken to be the independent variable. The outcome was taken to be grade 3 and 4 histopathological abnormality (septa with nodule formation and cirrhosis). RESULTS: 145 subjects were evaluated in this study. 47. 2 % of them were anti-HBcAg (+). The main risk factor for infection was blood and <b>blood</b> <b>derivative</b> transfusion (35. 9 %). Findings of anti-HBcAg (+) were not related to advanced liver fibrosis, although piecemeal necrosis has been found frequently in patients with this serological marker. CONCLUSIONS: Previous hepatitis B infection does not seem to increase the structural liver damage triggered by chronic hepatitis C virus infection, after statistical control for other co-factors capable to impact the natural history of this infection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Issues {{of nursing}} care when transfusing Current situation: A {{transfusion}} is putting whole blood or its complements (plasma; erythrocytes) into the bloodstream. The doctor who transfuses {{is responsible for}} transfusing. While transfusing, cooperation between the nurse and the doctor is important; any mistake can endanger the patient's health and life (Vyhnálek, 2003). When transfusing, the nurse's competencies include taking the patient's blood for blood type testing and cross testing, preparing equipment and a set, ensuring the venous access, ensuring blood compatibility and blood at the patient's bedside, monitoring the patient while transfusing, and keeping documents (Vokurka, 2005). The aim of the research: To determine issues of the nursing care of a patient requiring blood transfusion. In addition, to determine whether nurses observe the standard nursing procedure for patients requiring blood transfusion. Methodology: The empirical part of the bachelor's thesis was prepared {{on the basis of}} qualitative research data collection through interviews. The qualitative research was supplemented with observations of nurses using an audit technique. The results were processed using open coding. Codes were created using a pencil and paper and then divided into categories and subcategories. Participants: Interviews were intended for general nurses working at the surgical and orthopaedic departments of hospital České Budějovice, a. s. The interviews were conducted by agreement with the nurses in charge of the departments concerned. It was a deliberate choice that was influenced by the participants' willingness to cooperate. Sampling was terminated when the data obtained were theoretically saturated. An audit was carried out in the case of 5 nurses within the semester thesis. Results: It was found out {{on the basis of the}} research that the nurses had good theoretical knowledge in the area of the care of a patient requiring blood transfusion, but there were certain areas in which the nurses showed a weakness. The nurses showed their greatest weakness in the case of blood derivatives. There we found out from the research that the nurses were unable to explain what <b>blood</b> <b>derivative</b> was during the research. The results show that the nurses' knowledge in the area of patient care before transfusing is excellent. Another examined part of the research was to determine what duties the nurses had to perform while transfusing. There it was found out that not all nurses observed the recommended procedure for monitoring the patient while transfusing. The last part of the research was to find out what responsibilities the nurses had after transfusing. The research results show that the nurses know how to handle the completed transfusion and that they should keep it in a special refrigerator for 24 hours. After the end of transfusing all the nurses interviewed also measure the patient's physiological functions and then record them in the nursing documentation. Furthermore, it was discovered by the research that the longer practice nurses have and the more often they meet with transfusing, the less danger of damage to the health of the patient is. The results of the audit of transfusing show that the most frequent mistakes the nurses made were the insufficient identification of the patient, failure to observe the recommended time of application, and the unsatisfactory checking of the patient's condition while and after transfusing. Conclusions: The research results show that the nurses interviewed have relatively wide knowledge of the issues concerned. They know the nursing care of a patient requiring blood transfusion before, while and after transfusing. The research shows that the more often the nurse meets with transfusing the better her skills in transfusing are. The research proved that although the nurses knew the standard nursing procedure for a patient requiring blood transfusion, in practice they did not observe it fully...|$|E

Whole blood (WB), membranes obtained from whole blood cells (Mem), lysed blood (LB), homogenized blood clot (CLOT), serum (SER), platelet rich plasma (PRP), platelet poor plasma (PPP) and individual plasma proteins (albumin, fibrinogen) were added to the sub-phase in the equivalent proportion of 10 parts of DPPC per million parts (w/v) of hematological inhibitor. Cell membranes were found to be the most inhibitory agent for DPPC surface activity as evidenced by an increase in the minimum surface tension (from 0. 818 ± 0. 219 to 7. 373 ± 0. 854 mN/m) and percentage area change required to reduce the surface tension from 30 to 10 mN/m (from 21. 24 ± 0. 99 to 66. 83 ± 4. 44). The inhibitory potential of pure plasma proteins differed from those of more complex <b>blood</b> <b>derivatives</b> like platelet rich plasma and serum. Whole blood and platelet poor plasma were non-inhibitory, but serum, platelet rich plasma and clot significantly increased the minimum surface tension of DPPC to 6. 819 ± 0. 925, 6. 625 ± 2. 261 and 6. 060 ± 0. 640 mN/m, respectively. These results were statistically significant with one-way analysis of variance and Newman-Keul's test (P< 0. 05). The present study suggests that, not only the presence of the individual blood component(s) in the lung alveoli but also their interactions decide their inhibitory capability. Pure plasma proteins are not representative of the inhibitory effects of <b>blood</b> <b>derivatives</b> like serum, platelet rich plasma and blood cell membranes which would be more relevant for inhibitory models of ARDS. © Elsevie...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present a}} 51 -year-old {{patient with a}} severe case of {{gas-producing}} phlegmone following incision of a perianal abscess. Early diagnosis and extensive surgical excision during the first 12 hours from the onset of symptoms are crucial. Treatment of sepsis complicated by multiple organ failure: lung insufficiency (respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation), kidney insufficiency (requiring rehydration, furosemid, manitol), circulation (<b>blood</b> <b>derivatives,</b> saline, colloid solutions, cardio tonics, anti-arrhythmic drugs) and liver must be aggressive. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is essential with repeated identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (hemoculture, tissue sample, wound swab), their sensitivity to antibiotics and repeated surgical debridment of the wound. Following this treatment the patient was transferred to plastic surgery where Thiersh transplants covered skin defects. He survived with an abdominal wall hernia due to a team effort and aggressive multidisciplinary treatment by the general surgeon, anesthesiologist, hyperbaric medicine specialist, microbiologist and plastic surgeon. He refused hernia repair...|$|R
40|$|The protein corona {{formed around}} {{nanoparticles}} in protein-rich fluids {{plays an important}} role for nanoparticle biocompatibility, as found in several studies during the last decade. Biological fluids have complex compositions and the molecular components interact and function together in intricate networks. Therefore, the process to isolate blood or the preparation of <b>blood</b> <b>derivatives</b> may lead to differences in the composition of the identified protein corona around nanoparticles. Here, we show distinct differences in the protein corona formed in whole blood, whole blood with EDTA, plasma, or serum. Furthermore, the ratio between particle surface area to protein concentration influences the detected corona. We also show that the nanoparticle size per se influences the formed protein corona due to curvature effects. These results emphasize the need of investigating the formation and biological importance of the protein corona in the same environment as the nanoparticles are intended for or released into...|$|R
40|$|Musculoskeletal {{injuries}} {{that occur in}} horses during sports activities are often disabling and require {{a long period of}} treatment and rehabilitation, most resulting in scar tissue, predisposing to recurrence. In search of more effective therapies and tissue regeneration, studies have been carried out with <b>blood</b> <b>derivatives</b> - platelet rich plasma and autologous conditioned serum. In spite of both being bloodderived therapies, platelet rich plasma and autologous conditioned serum are distinct products, with equally distinct indications for their use. Platelet rich plasma shows promising results in ligament and tendon injuries in clinical and experimental trials. This occurs also in osteoarticular lesions with both hemoderivates, autologous conditioned serum and platelet rich plasma. This review aims to present clinical and experimental studies (in vivo and in vitro) in the equine species, as an aid for an appropriate therapeutic choice, when hemoderivates are considered for treatment of musculoskeletal lesions. ...|$|R
