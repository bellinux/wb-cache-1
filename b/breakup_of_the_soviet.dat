5|$|The 1789 {{discovery}} of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus. Eugène-Melchior Péligot {{was the first}} person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety.

40|$|ABSTRACT (100 - 400 words) : For <b>the</b> {{fulfillment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thirsty ambition <b>of</b> self-sufficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> for cotton production, {{the arid}} Central Asian region {{and in particular}} Uzbekistan has been extensively exploited. In fact, vast tracts of deserts have been converted into irrigated agricultural lands without proper consideration to environment and technical standards. As a result trends in natural resource degradation (soil salinity, desertification, water quality) as well as declining crop yields have dramatically increased. The agricultural sector is the backbone for employment, food security and export revenues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Asian countries. Since <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Central Asian countries (after <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union) <b>the</b> situation has changed dramatically in terms of institutional, political and technical systems. Political transition, which {{is defined as a}} shift from once planned centralized economy to a market-driven one, has introduced ‘new’ concepts like land tenure, water rights and different kinds of ownership.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{apparent}} intensification in hyper-nationalist sentiments in Greece {{and elsewhere in}} the Balkans resulting in part from international recognition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) as an independent nation-state in 1993 - 1994. The thesis concludes that Balkan hyper-nationalism and irredentism come to the fore when external powers are no longer imposing a quasi-peace on the Balkans and when there is a threat to <b>the</b> delicate balance <b>of</b> power in <b>the</b> Macedonian region. Both conditions have emerged since <b>the</b> <b>breakup</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Yugoslavia in 1991.

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this book}} is to present new {{mathematical}} techniques for modeling global issues.

In all these cases the data  is difficult to measure and an assumption of randomness and/or statistical validity is questionable.   We apply our methods to real world issues in international relations such as  nuclear deterrence, smart power, and cooperative threat reduction. We next apply our methods to issues in comparative politics such as successful democratization, quality of life, economic freedom, political stability, and failed states. Finally, issues involving deaf and hard of hearing children are explored. ...|$|R
