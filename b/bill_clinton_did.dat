25|$|Johnson County is {{at present}} and {{historically}} a powerfully Republican county. No Democrat has ever won {{a majority of}} the county's vote since at least 1880, though <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> gain narrow pluralities in 1992 and 1996, and Lyndon Johnson lost to Barry Goldwater by a mere twenty-two votes in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Obama's {{developing}} presidential {{agenda was}} divided into {{domestic and foreign policy}} issues. In most cases, this agenda involved addressing crises already underway. His principal strategic decisions concerned how quickly to move bills through Congress. Some of his advisors suggested moving quickly, as Franklin D. Roosevelt did in 1933, under the belief that a more moderate approach would waste valuable time early in his presidency, when his political capital will be strongest. Others suggested moving more slowly, as <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> before his attempt to enact a national healthcare program, based on the notion that rapid change could quickly wear down any bipartisan consensus. He was expected, in any case, to issue a series of executive orders within days of his inauguration, including a reversal of Bush-era executive orders restricting funding to family planning (including abortion) services and stem-cell research. There was also a possibility that a new cabinet level advisory post would be created overseeing the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
2500|$|Before the caucus, {{comments}} made by Obama concerning former Republican president Ronald Reagan attracted rebuke from rivals and dissection from all sections of the media. Obama had stated in an interview that: [...] "Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America {{in a way that}} Richard Nixon did not and in a way that <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not." [...] According to the New York Times, Hillary Clinton [...] "ridiculed the idea that the Republicans were the party of ideas, suggesting Mr. Obama had said that the Republicans had 'better' ideas". MSNBC noted that Senator John Edwards [...] "criticized Obama specifically for referring to Ronald Reagan as an agent of change [...] in a newspaper interview [...] 'I would never use Ronald Reagan as an example of change.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Amnesia" [...] lyrically {{explores the}} {{dishonesty}} {{of politicians and}} the ignorance of voters who continue to vote them into office. Chumbawamba's Alice Nutter told MTV that the group [...] "wrote [...] "Amnesia' before the general election in England, and we basically wrote it about Blair's new labor sic," [...] adding that the song has a universal message, noting that [...] "people forget that what <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> says before he gets elected is not what <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> will <b>do</b> when he's in office, and that's not about <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> that's about all politicians."

2500|$|During Clarke's earlier testimony, {{he stated}} that <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not have a {{comprehensive}} plan on dealing with terrorism. During later testimony, {{he stated that}} President Clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) that the Clinton administration had no overall plan on al-Qaeda {{to pass on to}} the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, Mr. Bush said he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that Mr. Bush ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. Bush could have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that President Clinton was more concerned about al-Qaeda than Mr. Bush was." ...|$|E

50|$|Historically, the {{district}} has been very Democratic, mirroring {{the state as a}} whole. However, West Virginia Democrats tend to be somewhat more socially conservative than their counterparts {{in the rest of the}} nation, and {{the district}} has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in the state at the national level. No Democrat since <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> (who <b>did</b> so by a plurality in a three way race) has carried the 1st District in presidential elections. George W. Bush carried the district both times in 2000 with 54% of the vote and 2004 with 58% of the vote. John McCain carried the district in 2008 with 56.77% of the vote while Barack Obama received 41.51%.|$|R

50|$|Virginia {{voted for}} the Democratic nominee, {{incumbent}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt, over the Republican nominee, attorney Wendell Willkie. Roosevelt ultimately won the national election with 54.74 percent of the vote. As of 2017, {{this is the last}} time the Democratic nominee has won the counties of Greene, Madison and Wythe. It also proved the last time the Democrats would win Montgomery County until <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> so in 1992.|$|E
5000|$|At a {{press conference}} the next day, Obama {{strongly}} defended the compromise agreement, after numerous congressional Democrats had strongly objected to aspects of it. [...] Obama labelled Republicans as [...] "hostage takers" [...] for forcing the situation, but also lashed out at liberal Democratic opponents of the deal as [...] "sanctimonious" [...] purists and compared it to their unhappiness over {{the lack of a}} public option in the health care reform legislation the previous year. [...] His stance led to immediate speculation among pundits that he was engaging in political triangulation, akin to what President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> had <b>done</b> following the 1994 Republican Revolution. [...] The White House denied any such thing was happening.|$|R
2500|$|Recently, media {{expectations}} for the New Hampshire primary {{have come to be}} almost as important as the results themselves; meeting or beating expectations can provide a candidate with national attention, often leading to an infusion of donations to a campaign that has spent most of its reserves. For example, in 1992, <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> although he <b>did</b> not win, did surprisingly well, with his team dubbing him the [...] "Comeback Kid"; the extra media attention helped his campaign's visibility in later primaries.|$|R

50|$|At {{the presidential}} level, Stoddard County {{generally}} tends to lean Republican. John McCain carried Stoddard County over Barack Obama {{by more than}} a two-to-one margin in 2008. George W. Bush also carried Stoddard County twice in 2000 over Al Gore and in 2004 over John Kerry when he received just under 70 percent of the vote. <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> manage to carry Stoddard County in 1992 but narrowly lost it in his reelection bid in 1996 to Bob Dole.|$|E
50|$|This {{association}} however {{has shifted}} as the Democratic Party came to also support environmentalism. For example, Democratic President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not send the Kyoto Protocol to the U.S. Senate for ratification, {{as he thought}} it unfair to the United States. President George W. Bush also publicly opposed ratification of the Kyoto Protocols {{on the grounds that}} they unfairly targeted Western industrialized nations such as the United States while favoring developing Global South polluters such as China and India.|$|E
50|$|On 16 February 1995, Madeleine Albright, at {{the time}} the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, signed the Convention. However, though {{generally}} supportive of the Convention, President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> not submit it to the Senate. Likewise, President Bush did not submit the Convention to the Senate. President Barack Obama has described the failure to ratify the Convention as 'embarrassing' and has promised to review this. The Obama administration said that it intended to submit the Convention to the Senate, but failed to do so.|$|E
50|$|A {{predominantly}} suburban county, Jefferson County {{is fairly}} independent-leaning {{at the federal}} level but does have a tendency to tilt Democratic. Presidential elections in Jefferson County are almost always extremely close; George W. Bush just narrowly carried the county in 2004 by less than 600 votes and by just over a half of a percentage point. Al Gore and Barack Obama also just narrowly carried the county in 2000 and 2008, respectively. <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton,</b> however, <b>did</b> manage to carry Jefferson County by double digits both times in 1992 and 1996. However, in 2012 the county swung hard to Mitt Romney, who carried it with 55 percent of the vote. In 2016 Donald Trump carried the county with 65% of the vote, the largest margin of any candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, Canady made a {{successful}} {{bid for the}} U.S. House of Representatives, narrowly defeating his Democratic opponent Tom Mims. In Congress, Canady was credited for coining the term [...] "partial-birth abortion" [...] while developing the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995. [...] According to Keri Folmar, the lawyer responsible for the bill's language, the term was developed in early 1995 in a meeting among herself, Canady and National Right to Life Committee lobbyist Douglas Johnson. [...] Canady could not find this particular abortion practice named in any medical textbook and therefore he and his aides named it. [...] He {{was one of the}} managers appointed to conduct the impeachment proceedings of President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton.</b> He <b>did</b> not seek re-election to a fifth term in 2000, keeping a term limits pledge he made in 1992.|$|R
2500|$|In 1993, the US Congress {{passed a}} joint Apology Resolution {{regarding}} the overthrow; {{it was signed}} by President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton.</b> The resolution <b>did</b> not apologize and did not say the overthrow was illegal.

50|$|President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> {{not support}} a {{constitutional}} amendment, but in his 1992 campaign, he called for balancing the budget through ordinary fiscal policy. He came into office facing a large deficit. Clinton signed into law the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which attacked the deficit by raising taxes. Beginning with the 1998 budget year, during his second term, the federal government ran a yearly budget surplus through FY 2001. During the Clinton administration, there was an official surplus of $419 billion during fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001.|$|E
50|$|Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W.

President George W. Bush made his first presidential act be the {{announcement}} of a National Day of Prayer, and he held events at the White House in each year of his presidency. President Barack Obama did not hold any public events at the White House, though he has issued presidential proclamations regularly each year.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>did</b> {{subsequently}} {{maintain a}} lower profile on the campaign, relying on standard talking points and rarely mentioning Obama by name, {{or if he}} did, praising him: [...] "I'm not against anybody. I'm for Hillary ... If you disagree, you have another very attractive choice." [...] Bill Clinton said that in retrospect, [...] "Everything I have said has been factually accurate, but I think the mistake I made was to think I was a spouse {{just like any other}} spouse who could defend his candidate. I think I can promote Hillary but not defend her because I was president." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cuban {{refugees}} were always welcome {{with open arms}} until the 1990s. President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> “reacted by <b>doing</b> what no U.S. president had ever done - he ordered {{a halt to the}} special treatment of Cuban refugees. For more than thirty years, a succession of presidents had dispensed unprecedented financial aid to those fleeing Cuba.” [...] These new arrivals of {{refugees were}} labeled as “los marielitos” as they arrived in large numbers. Unlike the prior waves of Cuban immigration, these new waves lacked the skills the earlier Cuban settlers held. Also, Americans perceived these new refugees negatively for their darker skin tone and more rapid Spanish speaking compared to prior Cuban refugees.|$|R
50|$|Broaddrick filed {{a lawsuit}} against Clinton in December 1999 to obtain {{documents}} that the White House may have gathered about her, claiming its refusal to accede to her demand for such documents violated the Privacy Act of 1974. Her lawyer was conservative judicial activist Larry Klayman, head of Judicial Watch. The suit was dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Henry H. Kennedy, Jr. in March 2001. The judge ruled that the Privacy Act did not apply in this case and that Broaddrick had failed to show evidence that the U.S. Department of Justice had improperly released documents about her. The lawsuit did not ask for money, and indeed unlike many of the women involved in <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> instances, Broaddrick <b>did</b> not seek out financial settlements, publishing deals, or a role as a celebrity.|$|R

5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton.</b> Warner <b>did</b> not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|R
