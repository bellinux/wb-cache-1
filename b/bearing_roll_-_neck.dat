In addition, we investigated {{the influence of}} ceramics, such as Si 3 N 4, ZrO 2 and SiC, on rolling life of bearings in water. All ceramic bearings possess from 15 to 70 times longer rolling life than all AISI 440 C steel bearings. All Si 3 N 4 and ZrO 2 ceramic bearings possess from 3. 5 to 5 times longer rolling life than hybrid <b>bearings.</b> <b>Rolling</b> life of all SiC ceramic bearings is approximately the same as hybrid <b>bearings.</b> <b>Rolling</b> life of ceramic bearings in water is mainly due to propagation of cracks, pitting and flaking...|$|R

Thus, high points of each surface can touch, but [...] "valleys" [...] do not. The bearing load is thus spread over much less area increasing the contact stress, causing pieces of each surface {{to break off}} or to become pressure-welded then break off when the <b>bearing</b> <b>rolls</b> on.|$|R

Actuator sizing and configuration of the system are explained, and the control laws developed for linearizing and compensating the magnetic <b>bearings,</b> <b>roll</b> induction motor and gimbal torquers are given. Decoupling, feedforward and error compensation for the vernier and gimbal controllers is developed. The algorithm for computing the strapdown attitude reference is derived, and the allowable sampling rates, time delays and quantization of control signals are specified...|$|R

40|$|The Circumstellar Imaging Telescope (CIT) is a 1. 9 m visible {{wavelength}} Cassegrain instrument {{whose primary}} {{mission is to}} locate extra-solar planets by direct imaging. The current reference concept calls {{for it to be}} deployed as a Space Station attached payload some time in the late 1990 s. Mission and signal processing demands impose the following attitude control requirements: pointing accuracy - 250 nrad RMS, pointing stability - 50 nrad RMS over 30 minutes, <b>roll</b> accuracy <b>-</b> 1 mrad RMS, roll stability 1 mrad RMS over 30 minutes. This paper reports on the results of a recent design study in which it was determined that these requirements can be met on the Space Station by a three tiered control system consisting of a two degree of freedom mechanical gimbal for course pointing, a magnetically suspended <b>roll</b> <b>bearing</b> for <b>roll</b> accommodation, translational isolation and intermediate pointing control, and articulation of the secondary mirror for fine pointing...|$|R
