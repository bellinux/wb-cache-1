5|$|<b>By</b> <b>matching</b> {{up these}} curves on the HR diagram the {{absolute}} magnitude of main-sequence {{stars in the}} cluster can also be determined. This in turn provides a distance estimate to the cluster, based on the visual magnitude of the stars. The difference between the relative and absolute magnitude, the distance modulus, yields this estimate of the distance.|$|E
5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and <b>by</b> <b>matching</b> their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} green luminescence of the cookiecutter shark is {{the strongest}} known of any shark, and {{has been reported to}} persist for three hours after it has been taken out of water. The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below <b>by</b> <b>matching</b> the downwelling light, a strategy known as counter-illumination, that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the mesopelagic zone. The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye, suggesting they have evolved to fool animals with high visual acuity and/or at close distances.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} was dated c. 1446 by Wolfgang Schöne in the 1930s, mainly <b>by</b> <b>matching</b> {{the style and}} fashion of her clothing to contemporary trends. In the early 20th century the dating and authorship of works then attributed to Christus were challenged. Max Friedländer proposed a number of dates and an ordering of works in the 1957 volume of his Early Netherlandish painting, but many of his assumptions were discounted by Otto Pächt {{just a few years}} later.|$|E
5|$|Around 1995, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) {{called a}} bidding {{to sell the}} property. The tender went to a Malaysian firm, the Renong Berhad and ITT-Sheraton combine over Emilio Yap, a Chinese Filipino billionaire tycoon {{and owner of the}} Manila Bulletin, the country's largest {{newspaper}} by circulation. Yap went to the Supreme Court of the Philippines and won <b>by</b> <b>matching</b> Rehong's bid and citing the Constitution's Filipino First policy in the ownership of a 'national patrimony'. Fifty one percent of the ownership was awarded to Yap's Manila Prince Hotel Corporation (MPHC), while new owners joined on April 25, 1997 as 49 percent shareholder. Yap signed a check for ₱673.2 million and the MPHC took over the property on May 7, 1997. One of the first things Yap did was to pull down the three brass chandeliers in the lobby, upon recommendation of a feng shui expert, and replace them with five.|$|E
5|$|The use of Yehudi {{lights to}} {{camouflage}} aircraft <b>by</b> <b>matching</b> their luminance with the background sky was developed, in part, by the US Navy's Project Yehudi from 1943 onwards, following pioneering {{experiments in the}} Canadian diffused lighting camouflage project for ships early in the Second World War. A Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, had serendipitously stumbled upon the principle when he saw an aircraft coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish; {{he realized that the}} reflected light had increased its brightness just enough to match the background sky. The ships were fitted with ordinary projectors mounted on small platforms fixed to their sides, with the projectors pointing inwards at the ship's side. The brightness was adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The Canadian experiment showed that such counter-illumination camouflage was possible, arousing interest in both Britain and America, but the equipment was cumbersome and fragile, and neither the Royal Canadian Navy nor their allies brought it into production.|$|E

5|$|There is a Practice mode {{which allows}} the player to {{practice}} any track with opponents. Time Attack lets the player choose a track and complete a 3-lap race in the shortest time possible. Transparent re-enactments of Time Attack performances, or ghost data, from the player or game developer can be raced against. Up to 3 player-contributed ghosts can be raced against simultaneously, but only one can be saved per track. Death Race has the player annihilating the 29 other racers as speedily as possible on a specialized course. There is no selectable difficulty level, or set amount of laps, but the boost is immediately available. Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where 2 to 4 players compete in a 3-lap race, and slots not in use by players can be operated by the artificial intelligence. A slot machine for those {{out of the race}} early will appear if the option is enabled. Players can adversely affect the energy levels of those still competing <b>by</b> <b>matching</b> symbols.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the next}} {{two and a half}} hours, Cho {{returned}} to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho <b>by</b> <b>matching</b> the fingerprints on the guns used in the shootings with immigration records. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to Norris Hall was as a student in the sociology class, which met in a classroom {{on the second floor of}} the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E
