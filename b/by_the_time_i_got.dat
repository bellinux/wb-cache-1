[...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
500|$|The gates {{were opened}} at 11:30am as advertised, {{three and a}} half hours before the match was due to begin, and until 1:00pm the flow of people into the stadium was orderly. By 1:00pm, however, a vast number of people were pouring into the stadium, and after an {{inspection}} by the stadium authorities, the decision was made to close the gates at 1:45pm. [...] Spectator William Rose said later that Olympic Way was [...] "seething with people" [...] and that [...] "the nearer I got to the stadium the worse it got, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> there the turnstiles had been closed". Although the information was relayed to various railway stations, thousands of people continued to arrive and mass outside the gates. [...] Organisation within the stadium was poor, and in his report on the match the correspondent for the Daily Mail described the stewarding as [...] "useless" [...] and stated that officials in and around the stadium [...] "seemed to know nothing". Fans were not directed to any specific area, and the tiers in the lower half of the stadium filled up much faster than those higher up.|$|E

500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E
2500|$|Rauschenberg {{picked up}} trash and found objects that {{interested}} {{him on the}} streets of New York City and brought these back to his studio where they could become integrated into his work.

And if it wasn't a surprise at first, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> through with it, it was. [...] So the object itself was changed by its context and therefore it became a new thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'It does arise {{directly}} from the consideration of the struggle {{to get away from}} speaking Cornish dialect and to speak correct English, a struggle which I began thus early and pursued constantly with no regret, for was it not the key which unlocked the door to all that lay beyond—Oxford, the world of letters, the community of all who speak the King’s English, from which I should otherwise have been infallibly barred? But the struggle made me very sensitive about language; I hated to be corrected; nothing is more humiliating: and it left me with a complex about Cornish dialect. The inhibition which I had imposed on myself left me, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to Oxford, incapable of speaking it; and for years, with the censor operating subconsciously...' ...|$|E
