40|$|International audienceAbstractThe {{distribution}} of <b>bluetongue</b> <b>viruses</b> (BTV) in Australia {{is represented by}} two distinct and interconnected epidemiological systems (episystems) —one distributed primarily {{in the north and}} one in the east. The northern episystem is characterised by substantially greater antigenic diversity than the eastern episystem; yet the forces that act to limit the diversity present in the east remain unclear. Previous work has indicated that the northern episystem is linked to that of island South East Asia and Melanesia, and that BTV present in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and East Timor, may act as source populations for new serotypes and genotypes of BTV to enter Australia’s north. In this study, the genomes of 49 <b>bluetongue</b> <b>viruses</b> from the eastern episystem and 13 from Indonesia were sequenced and analysed along with 27 previously published genome sequences from the northern Australian episystem. The results of this analysis confirm that the Australian BTV population has its origins in the South East Asian/Melanesian episystem, and that incursions into northern Australia occur with some regularity. In addition, the presence of limited genetic diversity in the eastern episystem relative to that found in the north supports the presence of substantial, but not complete, barriers to gene flow between the northern and eastern Australian episystems. Genetic bottlenecks between each successive episystem are evident, and appear to be responsible for the reduction in BTV genetic diversity observed in the north to south–east direction...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bluetongue</b> <b>viruses</b> (BTV) were {{isolated}} from sentinel cattle in Malaysia and at two sites in Indonesia. We identified eight serotypes {{some of which}} appeared to have a wide distribution throughout this region, while others were only isolated in Malaysia or Australia. Nearly half of the 24 known BTV serotypes have now been identified in Asia. Further, we investigated the genetic diversity of their RNA segments 3 and 10. Using partial nucleotide sequences of the RNA segment 3 (540 bp) which codes for the conserved core protein (VP 3), the BTV isolates {{were found to be}} unique to the previously defined Australasian topotype and could be further subdivided into four distinct clades or genotypes. Certain of these genotypes appeared to be geographically restricted while others were distributed widely throughout the region. Similarly, the complete nucleotide sequences of the RNA segment 10 (822 bp), coding for the non-structural protein (NS 3 / 3 A), were also conserved and grouped into the five genotypes; the BTV isolates could be grouped into three Asian genotypes and two Nth American/Sth African genotypes...|$|R
40|$|Humans are sero-negative toward <b>bluetongue</b> <b>viruses</b> (BTVs) since BTVs do not infect {{normal human}} cells. Infection and {{selective}} degradation of several human cancer cell lines but not normal ones by five US BTV serotypes have been investigated. We determined the susceptibilities of many normal and human cancer cells to BTV infections and made comparative kinetic analyses of their cytopathic effects, survival rates, ultra-structural changes, cellular apoptosis and necrosis, cell cycle arrest, cytokine profiles, viral genome, mRNAs, and progeny titers. The wild-type US BTVs, without any genetic modifications, could preferentially infect and degrade {{several types of}} human cancer cells but not normal cells. Their selective and preferential BTV-degradation of human cancer cells is viral dose–dependent, leading to effective viral replication, and induced apoptosis. Xenograft tumors in mice were substantially reduced by a single intratumoral BTV injection in initial in vivo experiments. Thus, wild-type BTVs, without genetic modifications, have oncolytic potentials.

Since the late 19 th century it is known, that bloodsucking insects can serve as vectors of pathogens, causative agents of many infection diseases. As climate change, the distribution and abundance of arthropods including bloodsucking insects can be affected. Emergence of new vector-borne diseases in Europe {{is likely to be}} among the most important effects of global changes. In recent years, several vector- borne diseases affecting humans and domestic animals have (re) emerged and spread in Europe with major health, ecological and socio-economical consequences.

On the other hand, two newly emerged zoonosis, caused by <b>Bluetongue</b> and Schmallenberg <b>viruses</b> and transmitted by biting midges, affect mainly small domestic ruminants.

40|$|Biting midges of {{the genus}} Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are small hematophagous dipterans {{responsible}} for transmitting major viruses to livestock such as African horse sickness virus in equids, and epizootic haemorrhagic disease and <b>bluetongue</b> <b>viruses</b> (BTV) in ruminants. Between 1998 and 2005, BTV outbreaks occurred into many countries around the Mediterranean basin associated with the northward extension of C. imicola, which colonized new Mediterranean territories in the past decades due to the global increase of temperatures. In August 2006, BTV serotype 8 (BTV- 8) was unexpectedly introduced in the Netherlands and was intensively transmitted by autochthonous Palaearctic Culicoides species, leading in 2007 and 2008 to a major sanitary crisis in whole continental Europe with huge economic losses due to animal movement restrictions. This chapter presents a synthesis of the data gathered through the different entomological surveillance networks implemented in France since 2000 when C. imicola was recorded {{for the first time}} in France. These networks aimed at first to monitor the spread and establishment of the invasive C. imicola and then from 2006 onwards, to study the diversity and dynamics of autochthonous Culicoides species. The data collected enable to describe for the first time the spread of C. imicola into French mainland, propose an updated list of Culicoides species for France, describe the Culicoides species distribution and seasonal dynamics, and report assays to identify BTV in field-collected Culicoides during outbreaks.

Modeling is a relevant integrative approach for investigating the large panel of persistence mechanisms evidenced through experimental and observational studies on specific biological systems. Inter-seasonal persistence of virus may occur in hosts due to viremia duration, chronic infection, or vertical transmission, in vector resistance stages, and due to a low continuous transmission in winter.

40|$|The baculovirus-insect cell {{expression}} {{system is a}} well-established technology {{for the production of}} heterologous viral (glyco) proteins in cultured cells, applicable for basic scientific research {{as well as for the}} development and production of vaccines and diagnostics. Arboviruses form an emerging group of medically important viral pathogens that are transmitted to humans and animals via arthropod vectors, mostly mosquitoes, ticks or midges. Few arboviral vaccines are currently available, but there is a growing need for safe and effective vaccines against some highly pathogenic arboviruses such as Chikungunya, dengue, West Nile, Rift Valley fever and <b>Bluetongue</b> <b>viruses.</b> This comprehensive review discusses the biology and current state of the art in vaccine development for arboviruses belonging to the families Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae and Reoviridae and the potential of the baculovirus-insect cell {{expression system}} for vaccine antigen production The members of three of these four arbovirus families have enveloped virions and display immunodominant glycoproteins with a complex structure at their surface. Baculovirus expression of viral antigens often leads to correctly folded and processed (glyco) proteins able to induce protective immunity in animal models and humans. As arboviruses occupy a unique position in the virosphere in that they also actively replicate in arthropod cells, the baculovirus-insect cell expression system is well suited to produce arboviral proteins with correct folding and post-translational processing. The opportunities for recombinant baculoviruses to aid in the development of safe and effective subunit and virus-like particle vaccines against arboviral diseases are discussed...|$|R

In late August 2008, BTV was reported with 12 nucleotide differences in the S 10 amplicon (S 10 genotyping). This virus was identified as serotype 6, here named BTV 6 /net 08. Promptly, serotype specific real-time PCR tests were developed for serotypes 1, 6, and 8 (S 2 genotyping). Agreement was found between results by S 10 - and S 2 genotyping. Further, BTV 1 was identified by both S 10 - and S 2 genotyping in one imported animal. After initial discovery of BTV 6 in the Netherlands, animals from 18 holdings tested PCR positive for BTV 6 /net 08 in 2008.
