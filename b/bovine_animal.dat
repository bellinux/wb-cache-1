Normally a cool, calculating combatant, inside the shell he becomes a rampaging engine of destruction that tries to destroy everything in his path, never retreating. It has been speculated that the shell has a personality of its own. However, the egotistical Skullgrin has a surprising personality quirk — he loves Earth and is fascinated by it. Making him very different from other Decepticons. In his affair with Circuit-Breaker, he actually bargained for fuel instead of fighting to avoid any casualties. Skullgrins Pretender shell is easily distinguishable by having the skull of a <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> for a head.

From three animal experiments, clenbuterol, diethylstilbestrol and stanozolol, the steroid profiles in urine of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> were compared before and after treatment. It was demonstrated that the steroid profiles were altered due to these treatments. A predictive multivariate model was built to identify deviations from normal population steroid profiles.

50|$|Tabanus bovinus, {{sometimes}} called the pale giant horse-fly, is a species of biting horse-fly. As the name suggests, it prefers <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> {{as the source of}} blood, although it may bite other kind of mammals as well. The insect is relatively large for a horse-fly, adults usually being 25-30 mm long. Like most other horseflies, its compound eyes are very colorful with stripe-like patterns. Its body and wings are mostly colored brownish gray. It is quite fast and an able flier, being capable of evading most attempts to swat it with ease. It bites humans infrequently, because of its preference of <b>bovine</b> <b>animals.</b> This loud-buzzing horse-fly can be a nuisance, as it circles around its target and occasionally lands to deliver a bite (in the case of humans, the fly usually takes off again instead). However, to humans it is considerably less harmful than deer flies (Chrysops), which bite much more vigorously.|$|R
5000|$|An ear tag usually {{carries an}} Animal Identification Number (AIN) or code for the animal, or for its herd or flock. Non {{electronic}} ear tags may be simply handwritten {{for the convenience}} of the farmer (these are known as [...] "management tags"). Alternatively this identification number (ID) may be assigned by an organisation, such as the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA), which is a not-for-profit organisation owned by cattle, sheep and goat producers; funded by a levy on livestock sales with Federal Government input. Electronic tags may also show other information about the animal, including other related identification numbers; such as the Property Identiﬁcation Code (PIC) for the properties the animals have been located. In the case of MLA's NLIS the movement of certain species of livestock (primarily cattle, goats and sheep) must be recorded in the online database within 24 hours of the movement; and include the PICs of the properties the animals are travelling between. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) of Australia regulations require that all cattle be fitted with a RFID device {{in the form of an}} ear tag or rumen bolus (a cylindrical object placed in the rumen) before movement from the property and that the movement be reported to the NLIS. However, if animals are tagged for internal purposes in a herd or farm, IDs need not be unique in larger scales. The NLIS now also requires sheep and goats to use an ear tag that has the Property Identiﬁcation Code inscribed on it. These ear tags and boluses are complemented by transport documents supplied by vendors that are used for identification and tracking. A similar system is used for cattle in the European Union (EU), each <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> having a passport document and tag in each ear carrying the same number (see British Cattle Movement Service). Sheep and goats in the EU have a tag in one or both ears carrying the official number of their flock and also for breeding stock an individual number for each animal; one of these tags (usually the left) must have a RFID chip (or the chip may instead be carried in a rumen bolus or on an anklet).|$|E

All the raw materials have been selected from a group of organic farms in Apulia region. The plant residues have been crushed and the <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> manure has been prepared before preparing the mixture. Two piles of about 30 tons have been prepared with different composition. The first heap had the following composition: 60 % of <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> manure and 40 % olive wastes, the second one 70 % of manure and 30 % vineyard wastes.

40|$|Domestic <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> are {{valuable}} resources to Filipinos {{because they are}} used as work animals and food source. Filipino farmers depend on water buffalos or carabaos for farm work. They consider the carabao as their beast of burden because it helps them till the lands. Cattle, like carabaos are also domesticated in the Philippines because they serve as important sources of meat and means of transport. Surely, Filipinos have a great need for domestic animals because they serve as sources of meat and milk and assist in agricultural-related activities. However, disaster struck the domestic <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> in the Philippines when carabaos and cattle were decimated by dangerous contagions during the American Period.

Pattern recognition of steroid profiles is a promising approach for tracing/detecting the abuse of natural hormones administered to cattle.

40|$|Farm, cattle {{group and}} {{individual}} bovine {{risk factors for}} bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle herds in the South West of England were explored. A cohort study using 148 well characterised cattle herds was conducted in SW England 2001 - 2004. The study {{was set up in}} areas affected by foot-and-mouth disease in 2001 and all farms were taking part in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). The use of a standard questionnaire and national data records from the skin intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin test (SICCT) and from the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS) databases were combined. The two main statistical techniques used were survival analysis and multilevel logistic regression with random effects. Associations with the risk of herd breakdown with bTB were explored using survival analysis. The main factors associated with disclosure of reactor cattle were the purchase of cattle from markets and the storage of slurry and manure in close containment. In the investigation of the risk of an individual <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> becoming a reactor using multilevel logistic regression with random effects analysis, explanatory variables at herd, individual cattle and test levels, were explored. The potential exposure to reactor cattle in previous tests was the most significant finding as a risk for a <b>bovine</b> <b>animal</b> reacting at a current test. Only 9 / 19, 027 cattle became reactors if they had not been exposed to a reactor animal previously. When the risk of an animal group having at least one reactor disclosed in the group was investigated using the location of the animal groups within the farm by monthly periods, the risk increased with the number of cattle in the groups when these were housed and with the presence of badgers in the fields when they were grazing. This thesis has provided a deep investigation into the risk factors that can affect the introduction and persistence of infection with M. bovis in cattle herds, and the importance that cattle play in these factors has been highlighted.
