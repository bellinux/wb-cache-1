5|$|Once the 342 {{individual}} {{images were}} cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, {{they had to}} be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely <b>between</b> <b>sets</b> of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, {{he could barely}} {{be heard over the}} sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him <b>between</b> <b>sets.</b> He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan's first {{concert was}} around 1945, with trombonist Frank Rosolino. Given Flanagan was only around 15 {{years old at}} the time, he could not stay in the bar area of the club; <b>between</b> <b>sets,</b> therefore, he went to another room and did some homework. As a teenager, he played in a band led by Lucky Thompson that also {{contained}} Pepper Adams and Kenny Burrell. Still in his teens, Flanagan also sat in on piano for some appearances by Charlie Parker in Detroit. During 1949, Flanagan had his first residence, at the Blue Bird Inn in Detroit. In 1950 he played with Rudy Rutherford, until the clarinetist returned to the Count Basie band. Flanagan then played jazz and rhythm and blues with saxophonist George Benson in Toledo, before being drafted into the army in 1951.|$|E

There is limited evidence however about the relationship <b>between</b> <b>setting</b> and primary school children’s characteristics and how teachers perceive them. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate associations <b>between</b> <b>set</b> positioning for English and Maths and teachers’ perceptions about 11 year olds’ behaviour and school attitudes and future education goals, and children’s psychosocial and cognitive characteristics and background through secondary data analyses of the fifth sweep of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). The study employed binary logistic regression analyses and revealed strong associations <b>between</b> <b>set</b> positioning and teacher perceptions of 11 year olds’ behaviour and attitudes and future education goals. Associations <b>between</b> <b>set</b> position and teacher perceptions of children’s identity as learners were stronger than those for children’s self- reported attitudes and behaviour. Also, family income and gender emerged as strong predictors of children’s position in sets. Set positioning is not a neutral act; it has implications about children’s personal agency and their identity as learners...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the relationship <b>between</b> <b>set</b> constraints and the monadic class of first-order formulas {{and show that}} set constraints are essentially equivalent to the monadic class. From this equivalence we can infer that the satisfiability problem for set constraints is complete for NEXPTIME. More precisely, we prove that this problem has a lower bound of NTIME(c n= log n). The relationship <b>between</b> <b>set</b> constraints and the monadic class also gives us decidability and complexity results for certain practically useful extensions of set constraints, in particular "negative projections" and subterm equality tests...|$|R
25|$|An {{equivalence}} relation ~ on X is the equivalence kernel of its surjective projection π : X → X/~. Conversely, any surjection <b>between</b> <b>sets</b> determines a partition on its domain, {{the set of}} preimages of singletons in the codomain. Thus an {{equivalence relation}} over X, a partition of X, and a projection whose domain is X, are three equivalent ways of specifying the same thing.|$|E
25|$|If {{every member}} of set A {{is also a member}} of set B, then A is said to be a subset of B, written A ⊆ B (also {{pronounced}} A is contained in B). Equivalently, we can write B ⊇ A, read as B is a superset of A, B includes A, or B contains A. The relationship <b>between</b> <b>sets</b> established by ⊆ is called inclusion or containment.|$|E

25|$|Klaus Voormann once watched {{performances}} by The Hurricanes and The Beatles in the club, and invited photographer Astrid Kirchherr and friend Jürgen Vollmer {{to watch the}} performances the next day.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the year, {{finances}} and morale were low; despite constant performing, they were heavily in debt, and tensions within the group were nearing breaking point.

Their final show of the year was on New Year's Eve, and <b>between</b> <b>sets</b> the band members talked through their problems, patched up their differences, and agreed that Sambell had to go. Wheatley offered to take on their day-to-day bookings and promotion work, leaving Ford and Keays free to concentrate on writing.|$|E
25|$|Later in the year, Guns N' Roses {{went on the}} Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, with American {{heavy metal}} band Metallica, being {{supported}} by Faith No More, Motörhead, and Body Count. During a show in August 1992 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, Metallica's lead singer James Hetfield suffered second degree burns to his hands and face after malfunctions with a pyrotechnics blast. Metallica was forced to cancel the second hour of the show, but promised {{to return to the}} city for another performance. After a long delay, during which the audience became increasingly restless, Guns N' Roses took the stage. However, the shortened time <b>between</b> <b>sets</b> did not allow for adequate tuning of stage monitors, resulting in members of GN'R not being able to hear themselves. In addition, Rose claimed that his throat hurt, causing the band to leave the stage early. The cancellation led to another audience riot, with three police officers and 10 rioters injured. Police made at least a dozen arrests related to the incident.|$|E

25|$|At Rock Band 4 release, {{the game}} {{supported}} three main modes. Quickplay allows {{the players to}} select any song to play that is on disc or in the downloadable content library of songs. Players can also engage in Shows which {{are a series of}} songs broken up into a number of sets. Some songs in these Shows are predetermined, but others are left to be voted on during a short period between songs by the band members; individual members also have the opportunity to select a song from a limited list during periods of the current song when their musical part is inactive. The available options are based on what songs the collective band members have in their library and the band's chosen theme, and voting options may include specific songs (including one selected mid-song), or broad classifications such as by genre type, release year, or song length. To aid in the cooperative nature of the game, any scoring multipliers and remaining Overdrive are carried over between songs in Gig lists as well as <b>between</b> <b>sets</b> in the Career mode.|$|E
500|$|However, as {{algorithmic}} {{improvements and}} computer performance have erased purely technical deficiencies in older approaches, {{it has become}} clear that there is no one universal criterion for the 'optimal' structural alignment. TM-align, for instance, is particularly robust in quantifying comparisons <b>between</b> <b>sets</b> of proteins with great disparities in sequence lengths, but it only indirectly captures hydrogen bonding or secondary structure order conservation which might be better [...] metrics for alignment of evolutionarily related proteins. Thus recent developments have focused on optimizing particular attributes such as speed, quantification of scores, correlation to alternative gold standards, or tolerance of imperfection in structural data or ab initio structural models. An alternative methodology that is gaining popularity is to use the consensus of various methods to ascertain proteins structural similarities.|$|E
