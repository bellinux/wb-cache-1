5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, <b>Balsam</b> <b>Poplar),</b> birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E
25|$|The White Spruce Cover Type {{may include}} other species in small numbers. In Alaska, {{associates}} include paper birch, trembling aspen, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980). Seral species {{giving way to}} white spruce include paper birch, aspen, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> jack pine, and lodgepole pine. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a). Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce–paper birch, white spruce–aspen, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by mosses. Vascular plants are typically few, but shrubs and herbs that occur “with a degree of regularity” include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling mosses and lichens. Several white spruce communities {{have been identified in}} interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).|$|E
25|$|Riding Mountain National Park is {{also well}} known for its wildflowers and wide range of unique vegetation, most of which is not seen {{anywhere}} else in the prairie regions of Canada. There are 669 species of plants in the park. Vegetation common to the region includes aspen poplar, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> white birch or paper birch, white spruce, balsam fir, jack pine, black spruce, tamarack, American elm, Manitoba maple, and bur oak.|$|E

25|$|Floodplain {{deposits}} in the Northwest Territory, Canada, {{are important in}} relation to the development of productive forest types with a component of white spruce (Jeffrey 1964). The most recently exposed surfaces are occupied by sandbar vegetation or riparian shrub willows and alder (Alnus incana); with increasing elevation, the shrubs give way successively to <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> and white spruce forest. In contrast, older floodplains, with predominantly brown wooded soils, typically carry white spruce–trembling aspen mixedwood forest.|$|E
25|$|The native {{trees of}} the Paudash Lake area include the silver, red, sugar, mountain, and striped maple; the jack, red, and white pine; the largetooth and {{trembling}} aspen; the yellow and white birch; black, white, and possibly red spruce; the bur and red oak; the white, black, and red ash; the pin, black, and choke cherry, and the balsam fir, eastern tsuga (hemlock), tamarack (larch), <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), American beech, ironwood (Ostrya virginiana), and speckled alder.|$|E
25|$|Black spruce (Picea mariana), {{white spruce}} (Picea glauca), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus balsamifera) are found {{throughout}} much of the territory. Although relatively uncommon, the Alaska birch (Betula neoalaskana) is also found in most areas. The lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) reaches its northern extreme in the south-central part of the territory, while tamarack (Larix laricina) is found in the southeast and the subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) is found at higher elevations {{in the southern part of}} the territory.|$|E
50|$|Whether the {{northeast}} Asian Sichuan poplar (P. szechuanica) and P. tristis belong here {{or with the}} aspens is not yet resolved. Likewise, the affiliation of P. cathayana and the Yunnan poplar (P. yunnanensis) {{are in need of}} further study, though these may well be <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars</b> — {{also known}} as Populus sect. Tacamahaca — are {{a group of about}} 10 species of poplars, {{indigenous}} to North America and eastern Asia, distinguished by the balsam scent of their buds, the whitish undersides of their leaves, and the leaf petiole being round (not flattened) in cross-section. They are large deciduous trees, 30 - 60 m tall, with leaves with a rounded base, pointed apex, and a whitish waxy coating {{on the underside of the}} leaf; this latter distinguishes them from most other poplars. The name is derived from the pleasant balsam smell of the opening buds and leaves in spring, produced by a sticky gum on the buds which also helps protect the buds from insect damage. The <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars</b> are light-demanding trees that require considerable moisture but are tolerant of very cold conditions, occurring further north than other poplars except for the aspens.|$|R
50|$|Much of the landscape, {{including}} the Athabasca Plain, is the boreal forest that covers {{so much of}} Canada at this latitude, consisting of black spruce (Picea mariana), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), white birch (Betula papyrifera), <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars,</b> white spruce (Picea glauca), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea). The dominant tree of the wetlands is black spruce, while the rocky outcrops are covered with lichens.|$|R
25|$|Common {{types of}} trees present in BC's forests include Western Redcedar, Yellow-cedar, Rocky Mountain juniper, Lodgepole pine, Ponderosa or yellow pine, Whitebark pine, Limber pine, Western white pine, Western larch, Tamarack, Alpine larch, White spruce, Engelmann spruce, Sitka spruce, Black spruce, Grand fir, Amabilis fir, Subalpine fir, Western hemlock, Mountain hemlock, Douglas-fir, Western yew, Pacific dogwood, Bigleaf maple, Douglas maple, Vine maple, Arbutus, Black hawthorn, Cascara, Garry oak, Pacific crab apple, Choke cherry, Pin cherry, Bitter cherry, Red alder, Mountain alder, Paper birch, Water birch, Black cottonwood, <b>Balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> Trembling aspen.|$|E
25|$|Black spruce, jack pine, {{trembling}} aspen, white birch, white spruce, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> and {{balsam fir}} are the dominant {{trees in the}} area. A prominent forest form {{in this part of}} the black spruce distribution is the black spruce/feathermoss climax forest, which characteristically exhibits moderately dense canopy and features a forest floor of feathermosses. Moose, beaver, muskrat, snowshoe hare, as well as numerous predators roam this area, including marten, ermine, fisher, otter, black bear, wolf, and lynx. The many wetlands and lakes support a diversity of bird species, such as great blue herons, ducks, geese, and that symbol of the north, the common loon. Ground and tree dwelling birds are also plentiful, including grouse, partridge, robins, blue jays, and gray jays as well as birds of prey such as hawks.|$|E
25|$|The forested, or {{woodlands}} area {{is dominated}} by trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> (Populus balsamifera), other poplars and spruces, although other species of trees do occur. Pines, mostly jack pine and lodgepole pine will often grow in areas that have sandy soil conditions. Other native species may include box elder, tamarack and willow, while the foothills area in the southeast of the region, such as Turtle Mountain or Spruce Woods Provincial Park, have woodland of white spruce and balsam fir but quaking aspen will domninate where the woodland has been cleared by fire. The proportion of forests to grasslands has increased somewhat over the prairie in areas not affected by agriculture in the last 100 years. This increase {{is partly due to}} the reduction of prairie fires which used to destroy the new saplings on the fringes of the aspen groves. Also, it was a common practice for farmers to plant stands of trees as windbreaks.|$|E
50|$|The mountainsides {{are covered}} with scrubby vegetation, the higher slopes by low scrub such as black {{crowberry}} (Empetrum nigrum) and other ericas (Vaccinium)s, the tiny Arctic willow (Salix arctica) and white mountain avens (Dryas octopetala) while the lower slopes have various willow trees among the shrubs and the low coastal plains have tall green alder (Alnus viridis sinuata) and willow trees with <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars</b> (Populus balsamifera) in the warmer and wetter areas.|$|R
40|$|The {{wettability}} {{of leaves}} of 60 poplar (Populus spp.) clones from sections Aigeiros (black) and Tacamahaca (balsam) and their hybrids {{was assessed by}} measuring the contact angle of calibrated water droplets on their abaxial leaf surface. The frequency and duration of dew on these clones were recorded in two nurseries. Black poplar leaves had the highest wettability, with relatively flat-shaped water droplets and a short drying time, in both the laboratory and nursery. Conversely, round-shaped water droplets on <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars</b> dried more slowly in the laboratory. In the nursery, dew was more frequent and persisted longer. First-generation intersectional hybrids behaved like <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars,</b> but successive backcrosses with black poplar (P. deltoides) resulted in clones with leaves that were more wettable and possessed less frequent and persistent dew. Infection by Melampsora larici-populina on two hybrid clones (‘Robusta’ and ‘Beaupré’), assessed {{by the number of}} uredinia in the laboratory, was dependent on the duration of leaf moisture. Maximum infection occurred when water was present on the leaves for 12 h. Leaf wettability should be considered as an additional trait when breeding poplar for durable resistance to M. larici-populina, as this characteristic {{is likely to be a}} useful defense against all pathotypes of the pathogen...|$|R
50|$|The taiga {{forests are}} mainly white spruce (Picea glauca) in the warmer drier areas and black spruce (Picea mariana) {{where it is}} marshier but the {{ecoregion}} also contains scrubby areas of dwarf birch (Betula nana) and riverbanks of willows, alders, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars</b> and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). Specific habitats include the peat bogs and fens of the Old Crow Flats. Warmer, south-facing valley slopes are home to rare plants that have survived in this harsh climate including Shacklett's cryptantha (Cryptantha shacklettiana), Erysimum asperum and alpine golden buckwheat (Eriogonum flavum).|$|R
25|$|According to BC's Ecoregion Classification System {{most of the}} Regional District {{is located}} in the Boreal Plains Ecoprovince of the Polar Ecodomain. This area is {{characterized}} by a continental climate with low year-round precipitation. Moist Pacific air loses its precipitation over several mountain ranges before moving over the region, while Arctic air masses are uninterrupted. About 61% of BC's bird species and 46% of all breeding species occur in this ecoprovince. This ecoprovince is divided into four ecosections: the rolling uplands with few ridges and wide valleys of the Clear Hills and Halfway Plateau ecosections, the wide plains with deeply incised rivers of the Peace Lowland ecosection, and the rolling uplands and Rocky Mountain foothills of the Kiskatinaw Plateau ecosection. These ecosections have many wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams the area is a major migratory corridor for water- and shorebirds. Moose are the most common large mammal but mule and white-tailed deer, caribou, and elk are also very common. The ecosystem also supports Dall sheep, black bear, grizzly bear, and gray wolf. There are few small mammal or reptile species. Fish species are restricted to freshwater fish like the Arctic grayling, northern pike, and slimy sculpin. Major tree species include white spruce, black spruce, trembling aspen, lodgepole pine, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> tamarack, subalpine fir, and paper birch.|$|E
2500|$|A {{considerable}} {{range of}} soil pH is tolerated by white spruce (Nienstaedt 1957). Thrifty stands of white spruce in Manitoba have developed on soils of pH 7.6 at only 10nbsp&cm {{below the surface}}, and pH 8.4 at 43nbsp&cm below the surface (Stoeckeler 1938, USDA Forest Service 1938); rooting depth in those soils was at least 81nbsp&cm. An abundant calcium supply is common to most white spruce locations in New York state (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Chlorosis was observed in young white spruce in heavily limed nursery soils at about pH 8.3 (Stone, cited by Nienstaedt 1957). Wilde (1966) gave 4.7 to 6.5 as the approximate optimum range of pH for white spruce in Wisconsin, but optimum growth seems possible at pH levels up to 7.0 and perhaps higher (Sutton 1968). Alluvium on the floodplains of northern rivers shows pH levels from 5.0 to 8.2 (Zasada et al. 1977). High-lime ecotypes may exist (Pelletier 1966), and in Canada Forest Section B8 the presence of <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> and white spruce {{on some of the}} moulded moraines and clays seems to be correlated with the considerable lime content of these materials (Rowe 1972, [...] Stiell 1976), while calcareous soils are favourable sites for northern outliers of white spruce (Hustich 1953).|$|E
5000|$|Populus balsamifera, {{commonly}} called <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> bam, bamtree, eastern balsam-poplar, hackmatack, tacamahac poplar, tacamahaca, is a tree {{species in the}} <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> species group in the poplar genus, Populus. The genus name Populus is from the Latin for poplar, and the specific epithet balsamifera from Latin for [...] "balsam-bearing". [...] Other common names for the species include heartleaf <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> and Ontario <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar.</b> The black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa, is sometimes considered a subspecies of P. balsamifera and may lend its common name to this species, although the black poplars and cottonwoods of Populus sect. Aigeiros are not closely related.|$|E
25|$|Human {{settlements}} {{are marked}} by lush fields and trees, all irrigated with water from glacial streams, springs, and rivers. Higher altitude villages grow barley, peas, and vegetables, and have one species of willow (called Drokchang in Ladakhi). Lower villages also grow wheat, alfalfa, mustard for oil, grapes, and {{a greater variety of}} vegetables. Cultivated trees in lower villages include apricots, apples, mulberries, walnuts, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars,</b> Afghan poplars, oleaster (Elaeagnus angustifolia), and several species of willow (difficult to identify, and local names vary). Elms and white poplars are found in the Nubra Valley, and one legendary specimen of white poplar grows in Alchi in the Indus Valley. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), Himalayan cypress and horse chestnut have been introduced since the 1990s.|$|R
2500|$|The flora of {{the mountainous}} {{district}} about Turnagain Arm {{is different from}} that of the coastal plains of other parts of the inlet.

40|$|The {{species of}} the genus Populus, collectively known as poplars, are widely {{distributed}} over the northern hemisphere and well known for their ecological, economical, and evolutionary importance. The extensive interspecific hybridization and high morphological diversity in this group pose difficulties in identifying taxonomic units for comparative evolutionary studies and systematics. To understand the evolutionary relationships among poplars {{and to provide a}} framework for biosystematic classification, we reconstructed a phylogeny of the genus Populus based on nucleotide sequences of three noncoding regions of the chloroplast DNA (intron of trnL and intergenic regions of trnT-trnL and trnL-trnF) and ITS 1 and ITS 2 of the nuclear rDNA. The resulting phylogenetic trees showed polyphyletic relationships among species in the sections Tacamahaca and Aigeiros. Based on chloroplast DNA sequence data, P. nigra had a close affinity to species of section Populus, whereas nuclear DNA sequence data suggested a close relationship between P. nigra and {{species of the}} section Aigeiros, suggesting a possible hybrid origin for P. nigra. Similarly, the chloroplast DNA sequences of P. tristis and P. szechuanica were {{similar to that of the}} species of section Aigeiros, while the nuclear sequences revealed a close affinity to species of the section Tacamahaca, suggesting a hybrid origin for these two Asiatic <b>balsam</b> <b>poplars.</b> The incongruence between phylogenetic trees based on nuclear- and chloroplast-DNA sequence data suggests a reticulate evolution in the genus Populus...|$|R
