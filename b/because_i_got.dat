500|$|In 2017, Durant became {{involved}} with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement. On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it. In his first vlog, he detailed, [...] "I'm so excited <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube." [...] As of April 26, 2017, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 100,000 subscribers and one million video views.|$|E
500|$|Guillory {{explained}} that she [...] "became an actor because I {{wanted to know what}} it was like to be other people. Because possibly I don't like myself", and later said [...] "I hate acting, really hate it. I kind of fell into it sideways ... I started acting <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E
500|$|After being {{evicted from}} his Highland Park home, Keef {{relocated}} to Los Angeles. In {{an interview with}} Noisey's Rebecca Haithcoat, Keef told Haithcoat his favorite part about Los Angeles is, [...] "the quiet." [...] After moving to Los Angeles, Keef began indulging in his new-found hobby of art collecting, once he discovered the paintings of art teacher Bill da Butcher, while in rehab. Once acquainted, da Butcher began working on paintings personally meant for Keef. Keef believed that his move to Los Angeles benefited him; {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Keef stated [...] "I got away from all the unnecessary trouble. It's better out here [...] than in Chicago, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in so much trouble. I like living out here. I think it improved me. It changed me, and [...] me to go somewhere bigger." ...|$|E

500|$|Howlett, like Janet, is Deaf. Unlike Howlett, however, Janet is [...] "quite passive, quiet, {{sweet and}} {{generally}} happy looking after people, especially her boss". As Janet sings, Howlett faced a particular acting challenge. She possesses, she explained, [...] "very little {{understanding of what}} constitutes music, and no idea at all about things like keys, pitch or melody – I even struggle {{with the concept of}} 'high' and 'low' sounds". The song Janet sings—"Only You" [...] by Yazoo—was particularly challenging. Howlett sought help from the composer John Chambers, with whom she had previously worked, and with his help, learnt the song's rhythm and then placed the lyrics relative to it. Chambers then produced a [...] "board of 'tune'", with words sung with a high note placed physically higher on the board, and Howlett tried various methods to train herself to sing different pitches. The whole process took a considerable amount of time, but [...] "In the end, it paid off, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the role. It {{was one of the best}} and most welcoming sets I've been on, especially in mainstream filming. I never once felt like a token Deaf, which is rare and beautiful." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} probably my favorite album to record <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to work and sing and be with my friends. Out of everything in this whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E
2500|$|Adelson denies those {{explanations}} {{for his political}} beliefs and behavior, suggesting such depictions of him are tainted by his critics' own political ideology. He stated, [...] "My critics nowadays like to claim it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> wealthy or because I didn't want to pay taxes or because of some other conservative caricature. No, {{the truth is the}} Democratic Party has changed in ways that no longer fit with someone of my upbringing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Norman was {{borrowed}} from Ealing. He {{had just made}} his directorial debut with The Night My Number Came Up. He later said [...] "I hated working at Hammer... <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> on with Anthony Hinds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is, it is, you silly old man," [...] cried Tabitha excitedly. [...] "I have hunted everywhere, and I cried {{about it}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> another, and can't buy one here, and the needle hurts my finger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lor!" [...] he said, [...] "it's Bert. I thought you'd {{be coming}} back some day, and I'm glad to see you. But I carn't arst you to eat {{anything}}, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> 'aven't <b>got</b> anything to eat.... Where you been, Bert, all this time?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Bass {{demanded a}} better royalty rate and artistic control; she {{approached}} her then manager Billy Davis about securing her writing credit on the song but was {{told not to}} worry about it. When the record came out and her name was still not on it she was told it would be on the legal documents, but this never happened. She continued to agitate about the matter {{for a couple of years}} but later recalled: [...] "It actually side-stepped me in the business <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a reputation of being a trouble maker." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{also criticized}} {{scientific}} types with overly rigid belief systems, equating them with religious fundamentalists in their fanaticism. In a 1988 interview, {{when asked about}} his newly published book , Wilson commented: I coined the term irrational rationalism because those people claim to be rationalists, but they're governed by such a heavy body of taboos. They're so fearful, and so hostile, and so narrow, and frightened, and uptight and dogmatic... I wrote this book <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> tired satirizing fundamentalist Christianity... I decided to satirize fundamentalist materialism for a change, because the two are equally comical... The materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the Christian fundamentalists, because they think they're rational! ...They're never skeptical about anything except the things they have a prejudice against. None of them ever says anything skeptical about the AMA, or about anything in establishment science or any entrenched dogma. They're only skeptical about new ideas that frighten them. They're actually dogmatically committed to what they were taught when they were in college....|$|E
2500|$|By 2000, DeVille had cured his two-decades-long {{addiction}} to heroin. He relocated to Cerrillos Hills, New Mexico, where he produced and played on an album, Blue Love Monkey, with Rick Nafey, {{a friend from}} his youth in Connecticut who had played in DeVille's first band, Billy & the Kids, as well as The Royal Pythons. In New Mexico, DeVille's wife Lisa committed suicide by hanging; DeVille discovered her body. He said:I got {{in a car accident}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> crazy. I think I was somewhat taunting death because somebody who I loved very much died. And I found them. That's what that lyric in that song means ("she hurts me still since I cut her down" [...] ). I cut her down. Next thing you know the police show up, I was in tears... I was in love with another woman and we were going through some hard times, and I got in the car and I wanted to go off the cliff. I was in the mountains in New Mexico... They came right around the corner head on. You know how big a Dodge Ram truck is? I broke my arm in three places and my knee went into the dash board... It was bone to bone... I was on crutches and on a cane for about three years and I couldn’t go anywhere or do anything. I was fucked up. I was ready for the scrapheap.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{coming to}} UNM, Hobson {{broke down and}} cried. [...] "You always wished that you were there and playing on that level," [...] Hobson said. [...] "When <b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> there, <b>I</b> just sat {{in my room and}} just thanked God and cried {{for a couple of hours}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> to the place where I always wanted to get." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vy? <b>because</b> <b>I</b> 'adn't <b>got</b> {{no better}} place to go to. I was used to sleep there. I slep' in the self-same water-butt where Punch was born. That's 'ow I come to scrape {{acquaintance}} with 'im. I'd bin away from 'ome {{in the country for}} a week's slidin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} would--absolute nonsense. He {{is a poor}} man with a good position, {{and he wants to}} marry me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> that which he wants.

2500|$|According to Duff, {{the album}} chronicles her {{experiences}} {{over the year}} before its release: [...] "some of its good, {{and some of its}} bad, and a lot of its, like, a big learning experience", she explained. She expressed an interest in recording lyrically more aggressive material ("Well, I'm not going to be singing about lollipops because I no longer relate to lollipops") than the songs on Metamorphosis (2003) and wanted the album to reflect that, according to her, she is a normal sixteen-year-old. [...] "Basically, I'm not Lizzie McGuire anymore", she said. She said the album deals with issues she would not discuss publicly and provides [...] "some answers", but she disagreed with people who believed the album presented a different side of her, saying [...] "I think it's just more me this time <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to really do it how I wanted to." [...] Duff called the album [...] "different [...] " [...] Metamorphosis and [...] "much more mature", particularly in its [...] "sound", but not {{to the point where it}} would be inappropriate for children; [...] "I just think that other people will relate better", she said. According to her, she was more [...] "involved" [...] compared to the production of her first album and [...] "confident enough to make suggestions" [...] about the style of the album: [...] "If I thought it needed to be more heavy, more rock, I said so". Its US release date, October 4, 2004, was a week after Duff's seventeenth birthday.|$|E
6000|$|... "It jumps," [...] said he. [...] "It {{strikes me}} when I ain't looking for it. I {{had to give}} up second-story work <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> stuck {{sometimes}} half-way up. Tell you what--I don't believe the bloomin' doctors know what is good for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s what I thought," [...] {{said his}} niece, [...] "but it wasn’t, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> her off at last and searched it through and through. I never saw {{anything}} like her clothes {{in all my}} life. There was hardly a button or a tape on; and as for her stockings—" ...|$|E
500|$|Corman {{has noted}} that making the film was a pleasurable experience: [...] "I enjoyed The Pit and the Pendulum <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{actually}} <b>got</b> the chance to experiment a bit with {{the movement of the}} camera. [...] There was a lot of moving camera work and interesting cutting in the climax of the film." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{then how}} {{did you happen to}} drop onto that idea in this curious fashion? It's just mind-reading, that's what it is, though you may not know it. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> a private project that {{requires}} a Bank of England at its back. How could you divine that? What was the process? This is interesting." ...|$|R
5000|$|Spielberg {{confessed that}} during {{production}} he became increasingly disenchanted with the film, admitting, [...] "I beat myself up... growing {{more and more}} impatient with myself... It made me wistful about doing a talking picture, <b>because</b> sometimes <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the feeling <b>I</b> was just making this big silent-roar movie... I found myself saying, 'Is that all there is? It's not enough for me.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Starve nothin'," [...] shrieked Skipper Simms. [...] "Do you reckon I'm a-goin' to sit quiet {{here for}} a week an' let any blanked wharf rat own that there fo'c's'le just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a lot o' white-livered cowards aboard? No sir! You're a-goin' down after that would-be bad man an' fetch him up dead or alive," [...] and with that he started menacingly toward the three who stood near the hatch, holding their {{firearms}} safely {{out of range of}} Billy Byrne below.|$|E
6000|$|... "A man, half mad, half imbecile, who {{was once}} my father's servant in Greece, and who has a rancorous hatred towards me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him {{dismissed}} for theft. Now you have the whole mystery, and the further satisfaction of knowing that I am again in danger of assassination. The fact of my wearing the armour, about which {{you seem to have}} thought so much, must have led you to infer that I was in danger from this man. Was that the reason you chose to cultivate his acquaintance and invite him into the house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all tommy rot!" [...] ejaculated Mr. Prim; [...] "but I'll {{call the}} police, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{to report the}} theft. It's some slick outsider, that's who it is," [...] and he started down stairs toward the telephone. Before he reached it the bell rang, {{and when he had}} hung up the {{receiver}} after the conversation the theft seemed a trivial matter. In fact he had almost forgotten it, for the message had been from the local telegraph office relaying a wire they had just received from Mr. Samuel Benham.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{conjecture}} further {{about this}} true tale of mystery; {{and that for}} two reasons. First, the story is so true that I have had to put a lie into it. Every word of this narrative is veracious, except the one word Paley. And second, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> {{to go into the}} next room and dress up as Dr. Johnson.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're meditating it,--are you? I shouldn't go just at present, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{have not}} <b>got</b> a {{sovereign}} in the world. I {{was going to}} speak to you about money. You must let me have some." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A party! No,--who gives a {{party in}} London {{at this time of}} the day? Oh, you mean <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have just <b>got</b> a few things on.

60|$|I {{got more}} and more troubled and worried, and my {{troubles}} made me see spirits and hear voices, and I could not think straight and clear on any subject, but got confused and involved and had to give it up, because my head hurt so. It got to be worse and worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in the night, then in the day too. They were always whispering around my bed and plotting against me, and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> no good rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Last night I ate a {{piece of}} mince pie," [...] she said, [...] "and a lot of pickles, and two grape jelly tarts. But I guess I overdid it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> real sick and couldn't sleep at all, so of course I didn't have any dreams. I should have stopped with the pie and pickles and left the tarts alone. Peter did, and he had an elegant dream that Peg Bowen caught him {{and put him on}} to boil alive in that big black pot that hangs outside her door. He woke up before the water got hot, though. Well, Miss Felicity, you're pretty smart. But how will you like to walk to Sunday School with a boy who wears patched trousers?" ...|$|E
60|$|Five or {{six years}} ago a lady from Finland asked me to tell her a story in our Negro dialect, so that she could get an idea of what that variety of speech was like. I told her one of Hopkinson Smith's Negro stories, and gave her a copy of 'Harper's Monthly' {{containing}} it. She translated it for a Swedish newspaper, but by an oversight named me as the author of it instead of Smith. I was very sorry for that, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a good lashing in the Swedish press, which would have fallen to his share but for that mistake; for it was shown that Boccaccio had told that very story, in his curt and meagre fashion, five hundred years before Smith took hold of it and made a good and tellable thing out of it.|$|E
