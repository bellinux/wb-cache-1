25|$|The main {{building}} at Graceville had a butterfly roof formed with a reinforced concrete slab lined with <b>bituminous</b> <b>felt</b> and supported on ten pre-cast, reinforced concrete beams that cantilevered off a continuous lintel resting on ten brick piers. A range of materials {{were used to}} fill the gaps between the brick frame: including orange-coloured face brick, screened openings, some small sections of render and various aluminium-framed windows. On either side of this building, two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating were erected. Each {{was made up of}} four sets of steel columns and cantilevered steel tapering I-beams bolted together. The seating, made with timber slats and a steel and timber frame, was placed back-to- back facing each track. Dividing each row of seating were metal ribbed screens. Fitted to each steel column and under each beam were panels framed in steel and filled with glass above the seat level and sheet steel below. The other narrower platform necessitated smaller butterfly-roofed awnings be built there. They were essentially the same construction as the larger ones with only three bays, two of which were given over to seating. The subway system with its street ramps and stairs to both platforms was constructed with reinforced concrete.|$|E

50|$|New {{materials}} {{used on the}} library were detailed in the May/June 1961 issue of Building Materials, which featured the building. Such materials included Rotary Red Cedar Exterior plywood panelling, also featured in the Plywood and Plywood Products journal of September 1961. The roof membrane of the library was formed with 2 inch thick laminated fibre board clad with <b>bituminous</b> <b>felt</b> and finished with white grain render and a copper fascia. When completed, the centre point of {{the roof of the}} building was finished with an amber acrylic light dome, apparently the largest acrylic dome produced in Australia at the time. Machinery connected to the upper most level of glazing surrounding the building allowed the windows to be mechanically opened. Installed in the ceiling of the library were two concentric light troughs formed with fluorescent tubes between purlins concealed with a translucent acrylic sheeting, operating {{in much the same way}} internal lighting operates with most current suspended ceiling systems. As well there were a number of suspended lighting features of circular fluorescent tubes fixed together on a light framework.|$|E

40|$|Mineral {{aggregate}} surfacing {{is applied}} to built-up roofing to protect the top coating of bitumen from direct sunlight and to reflect solar radiation. It reduces the maximum surface temperature, the seasonal range of temperatures and the short-time fluctuations at the black surface. It thus inhibits weathering of the bitumen and the <b>bituminous</b> <b>felts</b> of the roofing membrane. There are some disadvantages {{to the use of}} mineral aggregate surfacing. Apart from the added dead weight, which must be carried by the deck and structure, the principal difficulty relates to inspection and maintenance. The aggregate surfacing hides defects and breaks in the membrane and must be removed to make repairs.

50|$|The stand's wooden roof, {{covered with}} layers of highly-flammable <b>bituminous</b> roofing <b>felt,</b> offered no {{resistance}} to the flames. Burning timbers and molten materials fell from the roof onto the crowd and seating below, and black smoke enveloped a passageway behind the stand, where many spectators were trying to escape. It took less than four minutes for the entire stand to be engulfed in flames.|$|R
50|$|The {{techniques}} used to erect Kinkabool were {{not new to}} Queensland, although they were new to the Gold Coast. The structural frame of the building {{was made up of}} reinforced concrete raft foundations, columns and slabs, with similarly made reinforced concrete party walls separating individual dwelling units. The roof areas were flat and sealed with <b>bituminous</b> <b>felt.</b> Exterior in-fill walls were made with a carefully orchestrated pattern of rendered concrete and columns of red face-brick panels. A range of timber-framed window types were used throughout the building, including sliding doors to the balconies. The facade to Hanlan Street was formed using a formal patterning of timber mullions, sashless glass sliders and glass panels painted black before a sill-height wall was installed behind. The balcony balustrading consisted of painted steel verticals with a steel top-rail. A full-height section comprising painted Oregon timber blades set on an angle shielded part of the balcony. A septic tank with associated pump and filter services was installed beneath the building. Water tanks on the roof provided the necessary water pressure for the building's plumbing system.|$|E

40|$|Cold pitched roofs, {{with their}} form of {{construction}} situating insulation on a horizontal ceiling, are intrinsically vulnerable to condensation. This study reports the results derived from using a simulation package (Heat, Air and Moisture modelling tool, or HAM-Tools) {{to investigate the}} risk of condensation in cold pitched roofs in housing fitted with a vapour-permeable underlay (VPU) of known characteristics. In order to visualize {{the effect of the}} VPUs on moisture transfer, several scenarios were modelled, and compared with the results from a conventional <b>bituminous</b> <b>felt</b> with high resistance (200 MNs/g, Sd = 40 m). The results indicate that ventilation is essential in the roof to reduce condensation. However, a sensitivity analysis proved that reducing the overall tightness of the ceiling and using lower-resistance VPUs would help in controlling condensation formation in the roof. To a large extent, the proposed characteristic performance of the VPU as predicted by manufacturers and some researchers may only be realistic if gaps in the ceiling are sealed completely during construction, which may be practically difficult given current construction practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{environmental}} impacts and achieve sustainability, {{it is important to}} balance the interactions between the built and natural environment. The construction industry is becoming more aware of ecological concerns and the importance that biodiversity and maintenance ecosystem services has for sustainability. Bats constitute an important component of urban biodiversity and several species in the UK are highly dependent on buildings, making them particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic and environmental changes. Many buildings suitable for use as bat roosts often require re-roofing as they age and traditional <b>bituminous</b> roofing <b>felts</b> are frequently being replaced with breathable roofing membranes (BRMs). In the UK new building regulations and modern materials may substantially reduce the viability of existing roosts, yet at thesame time building regulations require that materials be fit for purpose. Reports suggest that both bats and BRMs may experience problems when the two interact. Such information makes it important to understand how house dwelling bats and BRMs may be affected. This paper considers the possible ways in which bats and BRMs may interact, how this could affect existing bat roosts within buildings and the implications for BRM service life predictions and warranties.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{sustainability}} {{it is necessary to}} balance the interactions between the built and natural environment. Biodiversity plays an important part towards sustainability within the built environment, especially as the construction industry comes under increasing pressure to take ecological concerns into account. Bats constitute an important component of urban biodiversity and several species are now highly dependent on buildings, making them particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic and environmental changes. As many buildings suitable for use as bat roosts age, they often require re-roofing and traditional <b>bituminous</b> roofing <b>felts</b> are frequently being replaced with breathable roofing membranes (BRMs), which are designed to reduce condensation. Whilst the current position of bats is better in many respects than 30 years ago, new building regulations and modern materials, may substantially reduce the viability of existing roosts. At the same time building regulations require that materials be fit for purpose and with anecdotal evidence that both bats and BRMs may experience problems when the two interact, {{it is important to know}} what roost characteristics are essential for house dwelling bats and how these and BRMs may be affected. This paper reviews current literature and knowledge and considers the possible ways in which bats and BRMs may interact, how this could affect existing bat roosts within buildings and the implications for BRM service life predictions and warranties. It concludes that in order for the construction and conservation sectors to work together in solving this issue, a set of clear guidelines should be developed for use on a national level. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{type and}} {{thickness}} of insulation on the topside horizontal of cold pitched roofs {{has a significant}} role in controlling air movement, energy conservation and moisture transfer reduction through the ceiling to the loft (roof void) space. To investigate its importance, a numerical model using a HAM software package on a Matlab platform with a Simulink simulation tool has been developed using insitu measurements of airflows from the dwelling space through the ceiling to the loft of three houses of different configurations and loft space. Considering typical UK roof underlay (i. e. <b>bituminous</b> <b>felt</b> and a vapour permeable underlay), insitu measurements of the 3 houses were tested using a calibrated passive sampling technique. Using the measured airflows, the effect of air movement on three types of roof insulation (i. e. fibreglass, cellulose and foam) was modelled to investigate associated energy losses and moisture transport. The thickness of the insulation materials were varied but the ceiling airtightness and eaves gap size were kept constant. These instances were considered in order to visualize the effects of the changing parameters. In addition, two different roof underlays of varying resistances were considered and compared to access the influence of the underlay, if any, on energy conservation. The comparison of these insulation materials in relation to the other parameters showed that the type of insulation material and thickness, contributes significantly to energy conservation and moisture transfer reduction through the roof and hence of the building as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Ventilation often {{accounts}} for {{a significant portion of}} the heating or cooling load and also affects the moisture levels of buildings. Arguably in the UK, houses with cold pitched roofs, with insulation on a horizontal ceiling, are the most vulnerable to the formation of condensation in the roof. This study is a numerical investigation that compares the occurrence and the risk of condensation formation in a cold pitched roof fitted with two underlay (a vapour permeable underlay (VPU) and an impermeable <b>bituminous</b> <b>felt).</b> The energy benefits that would be obtained from reducing the ventilation gaps in the eaves and improving the airtightness of the ceiling are investigated. In order to visualize these effects, several cases and scenarios have been modelled with a HAM software package. The results showed that, the VPU with a very low vapour resistance, Sd< 0. 02 is most effective in reducing condensation formation when the roof is sealed. It was observed that reducing the thickness of insulation on the ceiling would increase the energy losses but would reduce condensation formation risks. To a large extent, the proposed characteristic performance of the VPU as predicted by manufacturers and some researchers may only be realistic if gaps in the ceiling are sealed off completely when houses are being built, which may be practically difficult given current construction practice. Substantial energy gains were predicted when the roof was completely sealed off. Ideally, reducing the overall tightness of the building envelope to smaller air change rates (< 5 ach at 50 Pa), would reduce the airflow through the ceiling, and would help i...|$|E
40|$|In {{some regions}} of the United States so called cool roofs have become {{mandatory}} {{in order to save}} cooling energy in summer and it is expected that these roofs will also become more widespread {{in other parts of the}} world. A cool roof uses a bright surface to reflect incident solar radiation which significantly lowers the day-time surface temperature compared to conventional roofs with <b>bituminous</b> <b>felt.</b> However, since most energy savings measures involve some sort of moisture related issue, the question is whether the widespread application of these roofs may lead to durability problems. There are already rumors that the so-called self-drying roofs that do not have a vapor barrier might face moisture accumulation when equipped with a reflective surface, because the solar vapor drive helping to dry out the roofs during summer time is diminished. In order to clarify this important durability issue experimentally verified hygrothermal simulations have been carried out on light-weight flat roofs with and without reflective surface layer. Because the long-wave radiation to the sky is an important factor for the night-time roof temperature and thus also for the risk of interstitial condensation, the sky radiation has been measured as part of the meteorological data collection at the field test site in Holzkirchen. Together with continuous surface temperature recordings of different roofs these meteorological data have been used to validate the new radiation exchange model of a hygrothermal simulation tool. Afterwards a typical light-weight cool roof has been selected and its moisture behavior simulated under different outdoor conditions. The results show that severe moisture accumulation will only occur in colder regions of Europe and North-America. However, among these regions there are also some where cool roofs could be beneficial for cooling energy savings...|$|E
