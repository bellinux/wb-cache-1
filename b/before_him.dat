5|$|The first cyclist {{to cross}} the finish line {{received}} 1 point. Other cyclists received one point more than the cyclist who passed the line directly <b>before</b> <b>him,</b> plus an additional point for every five minutes between them, with a maximum of ten points. In this way, a cyclist could not get more than 11 points more than the cyclist that crossed the finish line just <b>before</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burton himself {{alleged that}} Roosevelt had orchestrated his {{prosecution}} in March 23, 1907 speech in Abilene, Kansas {{after his release}} from prison. Burton pointed out that his was the first prosecution under § 1782 and that numerous other public officials <b>before</b> <b>him</b> had potentially violated it, under the interpretation that prevailed in the Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|Even though Thomas is {{the first}} known Bishop of Finland, {{it is certain that}} he was not the first bishop overall. An unnamed Bishop of Finland is {{mentioned}} dead in a letter by Pope Innocent III already in 1209. A 15th-century chronicle names bishops Henry, Rodulff and Folquinus <b>before</b> <b>him,</b> but no indisputable records survive of them.|$|E
5|$|Galileo, like Tycho <b>before</b> <b>him,</b> {{tried in}} vain to measure the {{parallax}} of this new star, and then argued against the Aristotelian view of an immutable heavens. The remnant of this supernova was identified in 1941 at the Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
5|$|His {{thinking}} threw {{light in}} a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function. His decisions, beyond just the vote they represented, were sufficiently philosophical to be of enduring interest. He decided the case <b>before</b> <b>him</b> with that respect for its particulars, its special features, that marks alike the honest artist and the just judge.|$|E

5|$|However, when Kraft {{began to}} plan NASA's flight operations, no human being had yet flown in space.

5|$|In {{another version}} of this event, it is said that, to test Uttanka, Krishna once {{appeared}} <b>before</b> <b>him</b> disguised as an untouchable hunter and offered him water which was polluted with urine. Uttanka rejected the offer as it was being offered by the hunter, an untouchable. This displeased Krishna who then appeared before Uttanka in his true form.|$|E
5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances Jan Smuts would have, in time, {{taken over}} {{the running of the}} family farm, spending his life as a farmer as his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had <b>before</b> <b>him.</b> However this was not to be; events were to conspire to change this predetermined fate.|$|E

5|$|Scalia doesn't {{come into}} oral {{argument}} all secretive and sphinxlike, feigning indecision on {{the nuances of}} the case <b>before</b> <b>him.</b> He comes in like a medieval knight, girded for battle.

5|$|The Florida Panthers {{originally}} {{held the}} first overall pick, but traded {{it and the}} 73rd pick (Daniel Carcillo) to the Pittsburgh Penguins for the third pick (Horton), the 55th pick (Stefan Meyer), and Mikael Samuelsson.

25|$|While {{perfectly}} legal, some {{contend that}} by convention, a bowler should warn a batsman who persists in backing up <b>before</b> dismissing <b>him</b> in that fashion.

5|$|The spectators {{were mostly}} stunned into silence, but some wailed and several began praying.

5|$|Æthelwold, (Old English 'noble ruler') was {{a member}} of the Wuffingas dynasty, the {{youngest}} son of Eni and a nephew of Rædwald of East Anglia. Two of his brothers, Anna and Æthelhere, ruled in succession <b>before</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{side effect}} of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied {{assertion}} of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, especially when he {{made a point of}} celebrating mass at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear <b>before</b> <b>him</b> and take the cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.|$|E

5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{work for}} the period is Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus's Philippic History. Justin's epitomised history is also much condensed from the no-longer-extant original and covers not only Philip's reign, but also the history of Macedon <b>before</b> <b>him,</b> the exploits of Philip's son, Alexander the Great, and his diadochi successors during the Hellenistic period. These surviving histories are complemented by fragments of other histories, including Theopompus's 58-volume history of Philip (which was the source for much of Trogus's Philippic History) and by contemporary epigraphic sources.|$|E
5|$|At Hogwarts, the first-years are {{assigned}} by the magical Sorting Hat to houses that best suit their personalities.

Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor. Draco is sorted into Slytherin, like his whole family <b>before</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{continued}} on to Philadelphia, {{where he met}} with members of Congress about his rank.

Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there.|$|E
