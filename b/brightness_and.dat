5|$|After the ε ring, the α and β {{rings are}} the {{brightest}} of Uranus's rings. Like the ε ring, they exhibit regular variations in <b>brightness</b> <b>and</b> width. They are brightest and widest 30° from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the periapsis. The α and β rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these rings are 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared, {{which means they}} are geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. However, the same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β ring, which was also observed earlier by Voyager 2.

5|$|At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin {{began work}} {{related to her}} {{controversial}} thesis regarding galaxy clusters with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube spectrograph. This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight seen through the telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too dim to see. The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in {{the expansion of the}} Universe on the scale of 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its <b>brightness</b> <b>and</b> proximity to Earth. First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid. The effect is now known as large scale streaming. The pair also briefly studied quasars, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.|$|E
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star {{of our galaxy}} despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of <b>brightness</b> <b>and</b> distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to <b>brightness</b> <b>and</b> color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{scenario}} {{for the formation}} of disks which explains not only the properties of normal galaxies, but the properties of the population of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) as well. We use a gravitationally self-consistent model for disk collapse to calculate the observable properties of disk galaxies as a function of mass and angular momentum of the initial protogalaxy. The model naturally produces smooth, asymptotically flat rotation curves, exponential surface brightness profiles over many disk scale lengths, the Tully-Fisher relation as a function of surface brightness, the observed distribution of scale lengths <b>and</b> surface <b>brightnesses,</b> <b>and</b> the variation of rotation curve shapes. In the model, low mass and/or high angular momentum halos naturally form low surface <b>brightness</b> disks. Theoretical <b>and</b> numerical calculations suggest galaxy halos should form {{with a wide range of}} mass and angular momenta, and thus, the disks which form within these halos should have a wide range of surface <b>brightnesses</b> <b>and</b> scale lengths.

40|$|In {{this article}} we use 1420 MHz data to {{demonstrate}} the likely reality of Galactic radio Loops V and VI. We further estimate distances and spectral indices for both these and the four main radio loops. In the cases of Loops I - IV, radio spectral indices are calculated from the mean <b>brightnesses</b> at 1420 <b>and</b> 820 / 404 MHz. The spectral indices of Loops V and VI are obtained from T - T plots between 1420 and 408 MHz. Using the supernova remnant (SNR) hypothesis for the origin of radio loops, distances are calculated from the surface <b>brightnesses</b> <b>and</b> the angular diameters at 1420 MHz. We also study how results for <b>brightnesses</b> <b>and</b> distances of radio loops agree with current theories of SNR evolution. For this purpose, the ambient density and initial explosion energy of the loops are discussed. We also discuss applications of different Σ - D relations. The results obtained confirm a non-thermal origin and nearby locations for the Galactic radio loops. Therefore, we have indications {{that they are very}} old SNRs that evolve in low ambient densities, with high initial explosion energies. Comment: 6 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures.

40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} photon count {{histogram}} (PCH) analysis describes {{the distribution of}} fluorescence fluctuation amplitudes due to populations of fluorophores diffusing through a focused laser beam and provides a rigorous framework through which the <b>brightnesses</b> <b>and</b> concentrations of the fluorophores can be determined. In practice, however, the <b>brightnesses</b> <b>and</b> concentrations {{of only a few}} components can be identified. <b>Brightnesses</b> <b>and</b> concentrations are determined by a nonlinear least-squares fit of a theoretical model to the experimental PCH derived from a record of fluorescence intensity fluctuations. The χ 2 hypersurface in the neighborhood of the optimum parameter set can have varying degrees of curvature, due to the intrinsic curvature of the model, the specific parameter values of the system under study, and the relative noise in the data. Because of this varying curvature, parameters estimated from the least-squares analysis have varying degrees of uncertainty associated with them. There are several methods for assigning confidence intervals to the parameters, but these methods have different efficacies for PCH data. Here, we evaluate several approaches to confidence interval estimation for PCH data, including asymptotic standard error, likelihood joint-confidence region, likelihood confidence intervals, skew-corrected and accelerated bootstrap (BCa), and Monte Carlo residual resampling methods. We study these with a model two-dimensional membrane system for simplicity, but the principles are applicable as well to fluorophores diffusing in three-dimensional solution. Using simulated fluorescence fluctuation data, we find the BCa method to be particularly well-suited for estimating confidence intervals in PCH analysis, and several other methods to be less so. Using the BCa method and additional simulated fluctuation data, we find that confidence intervals can be reduced dramatically for a specific non-Gaussian beam profile...|$|R
