500|$|Clair {{has since}} been {{established}} as a feminist icon. Vox's Lauren Williams credits the character with teaching [...] "me about feminism <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what it was". Writing for Jezebel, Hilary Crosley Coker crowned Clair [...] "a Trojan Horse for" [...] both feminism and black feminism. Dubbing the character [...] "a bonafide feminist warrior", Daily Life Ruby Hamad praised Clair for teaching her [...] "that a woman is no less of a woman, {{a mother and a}} wife for working." [...] Slate critic Jason Bailey observed that, during The Cosby Shows initial run, critics and audiences were too busy commenting on the race of the sitcom's main characters to notice that Cosby had imbued his series with [...] "proud and vocal feminism" [...] in the form of Clair. According to Bailey, The Cosby Show was not only successful because Clair [...] "was a strong, liberated woman with a career"; she also [...] "had a husband and family who supported and valued her endeavors." [...] Dubbing Clair's influence on pop culture as [...] "one of TV’s great feminists" [...] the [...] "Other Huxtable Effect", Bailey concluded that the character's impact remains indisputable despite Cosby's recent sexual assault allegations, and thus maintains that The Cosby Shows legacy as a feminist series should not be discredited.|$|E
