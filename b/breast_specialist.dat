A series of information cards were developed by <b>breast</b> <b>specialist</b> secondary care professionals {{for members of the}} primary health care team. Women with breast cancer were involved in the communication pathway and were asked to take the information cards to their own general practitioner (GP) practice. It was envisaged that women {{would be more likely to}} utilize the primary health care team for information if they were aware that the primary health care team was in receipt of information specific to the treatment they had received. Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer were allocated to either an intervention (n= 38) or non-intervention (n= 38) group. Patient interviews were carried out around the time of diagnosis and at 4 months from diagnosis. Interviews were also carried out with 31 GPs to ascertain their views on the provision of information for women with breast cancer, and on the information cards if relevant. The study findings were interesting although not significant in terms of the direction anticipated. The cards did not impact on the utilization of the primary health care team and women in the intervention group were no more likely to utilize primary care sources of information than women in the non-intervention group. Factors such as the long-standing relationship women had with their GP, the perceived lack of specialist knowledge on the part of GPs and district nurses, and the women's perception that information seeking was not a tangible reason for primary care contact had an impact on information-seeking behaviour...|$|E

Nested within the questionnaire developed for the European InCRisC (International Cancer Risk Communication Study) project were 14 items assessing expected benefits (8 items) and drawbacks (6 items) of the process of breast/ovarian genetic cancer testing (BRCA 1 / 2). Another item assessed agreement with the statement that, overall, the expected health benefits of BRCA 1 / 2 testing exceeded its drawbacks, thereby justifying its prescription. The questionnaire was mailed to a sample of 1, 852 French doctors. Of these, 182 <b>breast</b> <b>specialists,</b> 275 general practitioners and 294 gyneco-obstetricians completed and returned the questionnaire to the research team. Principal Component Analysis, Cronbach's α coefficient, and Pearson's correlation coefficients were used in the statistical analyses of collected data.

30|$|Metastatic {{breast cancer}} {{represents}} an important challenge for <b>breast</b> <b>specialists,</b> and its incidence {{has not changed}} during the last decades, while we have assisted to a progressive reduction of locally advanced breast cancers and a consensual increase of early breast ones, thanks {{to the introduction of}} an organized mammographic screening in our region since 2005 (Driul et al. 2013; Cedolini et al. 2014 a). A first explanation may be that distant metastasis by haematogenous way do not depend on tumor size neither on lymph node involvement, which is usually expression of metastatization by lymphatic way.

It can be due to non-infectious inflammation, infection (generally of bacterial origin) but can also be caused by inflammation resulting from malignant tumor growth. Mastitis always manifests clinically by three cardinal signs of inflammation, which are redness, heat and pain. <b>Breast</b> <b>specialists</b> examining women with mastitis should proceed as follows: first, {{it is important to}} distinguish between cancer-related and non-cancer-related breast inflammation, since their clinical presentation can be misleading. Cancer-related mastitis reflecting the presence of aggressive cancer is less commonly observed than other forms of mastitis but its diagnosis, which can sometimes be difficult, needs to be made, or excluded, without delay.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionBreast cancer now occurs {{worldwide}} and each country {{has its own}} approach to breast surgery, which is constantly evolving. A training program was established in Brazil to familiarize breast surgeons with basic oncoplastic techniques and recent developments.

ResultsThe most part (11) of the breast surgeons surveyed had been <b>breast</b> <b>specialists</b> {{for more than five}} years. Just under one third (27. 3 %) wished to perform oncoplastic procedures in conjunction with a plastic surgeon. After the course the experience of the first group showed that just over half (seven) of the twelve specialists developed their skills sufficiently to perform Urban procedures at level III, and eleven others could perform until level II procedures. ConclusionOrganized oncoplastic training centers can enable breast surgeons to undertake reconstructive breast procedures without the assistance of a plastic surgeon...|$|R
40|$|Although, {{in recent}} years, {{advances}} in {{diagnosis and treatment}} have been made, breast cancer remains a major public health issue in Ireland and is responsible for approximately 650 deaths annually. It is now recognised that patients with breast diseases are best served {{by a team of}} specialists working together. Strong evidence exists that women with breast cancer are at lower risk of relapse and have a better opportunity of long-term survival if they are treated in a multidisciplinary setting. Thus, surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, medical oncologists, radiotherapists, plastic surgeons, nurses, counsellors and others all bring expertise together to provide the best care for each patient. Such an arrangement can be achieved only by establishing <b>Specialist</b> <b>Breast</b> Units, strategically placed throughout the country, each treating sufficiently large numbers of patients in order to maintain expertise and to promote best practice.

40|$|With this survey, we {{aimed to}} address the reasons why {{physicians}} are reluctant to prescribe breast cancer preventive therapy with the selective oestrogens receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen or raloxifene despite a strong evidence of efficacy. A self-administered 5 -point Likert questionnaire was given during breast cancer meetings in Europe or sent via email to rank the importance of 10 pre-defined reasons for low uptake of SERMs for breast cancer therapeutic prevention. Analyses tested the associations between the stated reasons and physician characteristics such as gender, age, country of work and specialty. Of 246 delivered questionnaires, 27 were incomplete and were excluded from analysis. Overall, {{there was a small}} variability in response scores, with a tendency for physicians to give moderate importance (score= 3) to all 10 statements. However, the top five reasons were: the expected greater preventive effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors (70. 3 % with score> 3), difficulty applying current risk models in clinical practice (69. 9 %), the lack of clarity on the most appropriate physician for prevention advice (68. 4 %), the lack of reliable short-term biomarkers of effectiveness (67. 5 %) and the lack of commercial interest in therapeutic prevention (66. 0 %). The lack of reliable short-term biomarkers showed a tendency to discriminate between medical oncologists and other <b>breast</b> <b>specialists</b> (OR= 2. 42, 95 % CI, 0. 93 - 6. 25).

40|$|Aims The aim of {{this study}} was to explore breast cancer patients’ {{experiences}} during survivorship. Particular attention is given to the role of <b>specialist</b> <b>breast</b> care nurses in supporting women throughout this phase. Background There is a relative lack of research involving long-term breast cancer survivors. Yet, many survivors experience substantial psychosocial and iatrogenic harms created by diagnosis, symptoms of disease and treatment. A more comprehensive understanding may assist in supporting the needs of breast cancer survivors. Design An exploratory qualitative approach was used to collect data on breast cancer survivors’ experiences during 2013. Methods Semi-structured interview data were collected from seven British women aged 38 – 80 years exploring the support received during survivorship. Data were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Findings Breast cancer survivors perceived a systemic absence in support from oncology teams and rapid deterioration of support from personal support networks. Despite this, survivors were able to find benefits from the cancer experience. This allowed for adjustment and enabled patients to assume a new identity as a breast cancer survivor. We recommend <b>specialist</b> <b>breast</b> care nurses would be suitably placed to provide extended support allowing for a salient transition from treatment to survivorship. Conclusion This study yields insights into breast cancer survivorship and specifically the role of <b>specialist</b> <b>breast</b> care nurses.

The concomitant treatment of this disease places a considerable burden on the health care system and the supporters of the person diagnosed with this disease. While there are many government and non-government organisations that provide treatment and support services for the person with breast cancer, these services are usually provided in person either in the home or at the organisation’s offices. This study extended the information advice and support aspects of these services to the online or Internet based realm via the design and development of a breast cancer focused online support community www. breastcancerclick. com. au and explored the role of the expert nurse through the employment of a <b>specialist</b> <b>breast</b> care nurse as a member, moderator and health professional within this online community. This study used an ethnonetnographic approach, including online (on the Internet) and offline (face-to-face) methods, to explore the role of the <b>specialist</b> <b>breast</b> care nurse within the online, breast cancer support, community. The study was comprised of three phases, Phase One, the offline and online identification of the information, advice and support needs of Western Australian women with breast cancer and their Internet use; development of a website designed to meet those needs and to foster the development of an online support community; Phase Two, the employment and introduction of a <b>specialist</b> <b>breast</b> care nurse as a member and provider of evidence-based information, advice and support for online community members; Phase Three, the online and offline collection of data relevant {{to the role of the}} <b>specialist</b> <b>breast</b> care nurse within the online support community.
