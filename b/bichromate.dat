25|$|These discoveries soon led to {{the carbon}} print, gum <b>bichromate,</b> and other {{photographic}} printing processes based on differential hardening. Typically, after exposure, the unhardened portion was rinsed away with warm water, leaving a thin relief that either contained a pigment included during manufacture or was subsequently stained with a dye. Some processes depended on the hardening only, {{in combination with the}} differential absorption of certain dyes by the hardened or unhardened areas. Because some of these processes allowed the use of highly stable dyes and pigments, such as carbon black, prints with an extremely high degree of archival permanence and resistance to fading from prolonged exposure to light could be produced.|$|E
25|$|During {{this same}} year White and Stieglitz {{undertook}} an artistic experiment {{in which they}} jointly created a series of photographs of two models, Mabel Cramer and another known only as Miss Thompson. Stieglitz offered suggestions about posing the models, White focused the camera, and {{one or the other}} of them would snap the shutter. White also developed the negatives and printed the photographs. One of the intentions of the experiment was to try a variety of printing techniques and papers, including platinum, gelatin silver and gum <b>bichromate</b> prints. On a few signed of the prints they signed with a monogram that combined both of their initials. During this collaboration, White learned the Autochrome color process from Stieglitz, who had just returned from Europe with this technical knowledge. White and Stieglitz jointly created at least one Autochrome during this time, which they exhibited later in the year.|$|E

5000|$|Screenless {{lithography}} is a reprographic {{technique for}} halftoning dating to 1855, when the French chemist and civil engineer Alphonse Poitevin discovered the light-sensitive properties of <b>bichromated</b> gelatin and invented both the photolithography and collotype processes. After {{the invention of}} the halftone screen in the 1880s, screenless lithography was abandoned. Until the end of World War II, two kinds of photomechanically made plates were used in lithography: albumin plates and deep-etch plates. Presensitized plates appeared in the 1950s, and wipe-on plates appeared in the 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|Early in the 1910s, several {{printers}} {{experimenting with}} photo-reactive chemicals used the well-known actinic light-activated cross linking or hardening traits of potassium, sodium or ammonium chromate and dichromate chemicals with glues and gelatin compounds.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to provide basis information of the 25 local specific wood species indigenous from Java treated by copper <b>bichromated</b> boron (CCB). The full-cell process for 2 hours and 150 psi during the pressure-keeping period was employed. The IUFRO method was applied for the determination of wood treatability class. The treated and untreated wood specimens were tied together using plastic cord, arranged into a raft like assembly, and then exposed for 3, 6, and 12 months to the brackish water situated at Rambut Island 2 ̆ 7 s coastal area. The Nordic Wood Preservation Council (NWPC) standard No. 1. 4. 2. 2 / 75 was used to determine the intensity of marine borer infestation. The results revealed that 19 out of those 25 species were classified as easy to be preser ved, four species as moderate, and the remaining two were difficult to be preser ved. Those 19 species, i. e. Tamarindus indica L., Diplodiscus sp., Ficus variegate R. Br., Ehretia acuminata R. Br., Meliocope lunu-ankenda (Gaertn) T. G. Hartley, Colona javanica B.

DC. and Azadirachta indica Juss. were the least permeable judging that the CCB retention and penetration were lowest and shallowest. The treated wood specimens in this regard were able to prevent marine borers attack. Meanwhile, the untreated specimens were susceptible to marine borers attack, except Azadirachta indica. The attacking borers consecutively are MartesiastriataLinne that belongs to the Pholadidae family; and Teredo bartschi Clapp., Dicyathifer manni Wright., and Bankia cieba Clench. to the Terdinidae family...|$|R

50|$|At this time, high-contrast negatives {{were made}} using the wet plate {{collodion}} method (a solution of nitrocellulose in ether or acetone on glass). Once the negative had been made, {{a sheet of}} thin tracing paper was coated {{in a mixture of}} saturated potassium <b>bichromate</b> solution and gum water, and dried. This was then placed under the photographic negative and exposed to light for 2-3 minutes. The bichromate/gum mixture remained soluble on the parts of the tracing paper that were shielded from light by the opaque areas of the negative, allowing it to be removed, leaving an insoluble ‘positive’ image. This <b>bichromate</b> positive was then placed on a sheet of zinc covered in lithographic ink, and put through a printing press three or four times. After removal of the paper, the zinc plate was washed in a tray of hot water (containing a small amount of gum), using a camel-hair brush to remove all the soluble <b>bichromate</b> combined with ink. What remained on the zinc plate was a perfect representation in ink of the original composition, by virtue of the ink binding to the insoluble potassium <b>bichromate.</b>|$|E

5000|$|He {{discovered}} gum <b>bichromate</b> printing {{through his}} search for premises to work in. During a visit, a huge print displayed inside the room caught his attention and drove him to research the process at his local library. Working from a book published in 1850, he developed his first gum <b>bichromate</b> picture in a soup plate at his home. He immediately {{fell in love with}} the technique, which he said rendered pictures more theatrical and removed any temporal notions. Benaïm has continued to use the printing technique until today, with lighting becoming one of his main points of focus. His work consists mostly of dimly-lit shots, yet using diffused light to bring the subject to the fore. He has been linked to influences Man Ray and Patrick Faigenbaum.

50|$|Carbon print: This is an {{extremely}} delicate print made by coating tissue paper with potassium <b>bichromate,</b> carbon black or another pigment and gelatin.

50|$|Gum <b>bichromate</b> is a 19th-century {{photographic}} printing process {{based on the}} light sensitivity of dichromates.
