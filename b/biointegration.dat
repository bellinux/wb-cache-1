A range of biomolecules in the subendothelial space {{have been shown}} to play critical roles in local regulation of thrombosis, endothelial growth and smooth muscle cell proliferation, making these attractive candidates for modulation of vascular device <b>biointegration.</b> However, classically used biomaterial coatings, such as fibronectin and laminin, modulate only one of these components; enhancing endothelial cell attachment, but also activating platelets and triggering thrombosis.

40|$|Successful {{implantation}} of any biomaterial {{depends on}} its mechanical, architectural, and surface properties. Materials with good bulk properties seldom possess the appropriate surface characteristics required for good <b>biointegration.</b> The present study investigates the results of surface modification of a highly porous, fully fluorinated polymeric substrate, expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE), {{with a view to}} improving the surface bioactivity and hence ultimately its <b>biointegration.</b> Modification involved gamma irradiation-induced graft copolymerization with the monomers monoacryloxyethyl phosphate (MAEP) and methacryloxyethyl phosphate (MOEP) in various solvent systems (water, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone, and mixtures thereof). In order to determine the penetration depth of the graft copolymer into the pores and/or the bulk of the ePTFE membranes, angle-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used. It was found that the penetration depth was critically affected by the choice of monomer and solvent {{as well as by the}} technique used to remove dissolved oxygen from the grafting mixture: nitrogen degassing versus vacuum. Difficulties due to the porous nature of the membranes in establishing the lateral position of the graft copolymers were largely overcome by combining data from microattenuated total reflectance Fourier transfer infrared (μ-ATR-FTIR) mapping and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) imaging. Results show that the large variation in graft heterogeneity found between different samples is largely an effect of the underlying substrate and choice of monomer.

The spikes of the MSC-Scaffold prototype mimic the interdigitations of the articular subchondral bone, which is the natural biostructure interfacing the articular cartilage with the periarticular trabecular bone. To enhance the osteoinduction/osteointegration potential of the MSC-Scaffold, the attempts to modify its bone contacting surfaces {{by the process of}} electrochemical cathodic deposition of Ca-P was performed with further immersion of the MSC-Scaffold prototypes in SBF in order to transform the amorphous calcium-phosphate coating in hydroxyapatite-like (HA-like) coating. The pilot experimental study of <b>biointegration</b> of unmodified and Ca-P surface-modified MSC-Scaffold prototypes was conducted in an animal model (swine) and in osteoblast cell culture. On the basis of a microscope-histological method the <b>biointegration</b> was proven by the presence of trabeculae in the interspike spaces of the MSC-Scaffold prototype on longitudinal and cross-sections of bone-implant specimens. The percentage of trabeculae in the area between the spikes of specimen containing Ca-P surface modified scaffold prototype observed in microCT reconstructions of the explanted joints was visibly higher than in the case of unmodified MSC-Scaffold prototypes. Significantly higher Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) activity and the cellular proliferation in the case of Ca-P-modified MSC-Scaffold pre-prototypes, in comparison with unmodified pre-prototypes, was found in osteoblast cell cultures. The obtained results of experimental implantation in an animal model and osteoblast cell culture evaluations of Ca-P surface-modified and non-modified biomimetic MSC-Scaffold prototypes for biomimetic entirely-cementless RA endoprostheses indicate the enhancement of the osteoinduction/osteointegration potential by the Ca-P surface modification of the Ti-alloy MSC-Scaffold prototype.

The porcine collagen-based biomaterial Permacol tm in sheet form is useful as a stable implant in reconstructive surgery, but its use as a dermal substitute has been hindered by slow cell penetration and vascularisation. Here, a paste formulation was evaluated as a dermal substitute in full-thickness wounds to encourage cellular infiltration. Full-thickness biopsy and wound-chamber models were done in the large white pig under local ethics committee approval and government license. Biopsy model allowed 24 samples of 8 mm diameter and the chamber-model allowed 6 samples of 4 cm diameter per pig. Permacol was applied as a paste to the wound bed and covered with a split-thickness skin graft or non-adherent dressing, with suitable control wounds in parallel. Biopsies taken at specific time points were assessed for <b>biointegration</b> and neovascularisation using histological and immunofluorescent analysis. Permacol paste accepted host dermal mesenchymal and epidermal cells. It was well penetrated by cells on day 2 and integrated into the host without causing excessive inflammation, indicating successful <b>biointegration.</b> host cellular infiltration of Permacol paste was much superior to Permacol sheet and very similar to Integra. Paste was visible within the tissue samples and intact up to day 27, indicating presence of a stable biomaterial. Early neovascularisation was noted at day 4, and functional microvessels with circulating blood cells were discovered at day 7 and confirmed by immunostaining for vascular endothelium. This was comparable to Integra, currently the gold standard dermal substitute.

40|$|Summary: Hydroxyapatite {{bioceramic}} {{was used}} for the manufacture of an orbital floor prosthesis from spiral CT data acquired transaxially at 1 -mm beam collimation, pitch of 1, and 0. 2 -mm reconstruction intervals. CT data were converted to vector file format for subsequent prosthesis manufacture on a stereolithography machine. The orbital floor prosthesis was engrafted onto an acrylic model of the orbit as a qualitative indication of its overall accuracy. High anatomic accuracy was achieved, as determined by visual inspection. Cross-hatching of the vector file data allowed a porous internal architecture of the prosthesis. Refinements in chemical structure of the hydroxyapatite bioceramic are expected to enhance mechanical properties. Index terms: Eyes, surgery; Orbits, computed tomography As the science of synthetic biomaterials matures from its present infancy, the role of the radiologist in the implementation of imagingderived bioceramic prostheses for surgical applications will become more obvious. Among these applications is the creation of biodegradable scaffolds that induce ingrowth of bioengineered tissue in promoting accelerated postoperative healing (1). Such scaffolds will ideally be porous, resorbable, flexible, and workable while providing an anatomically accurate “carrier. ” The theoretical basis for such implants stands in contrast to some alloplastic materials that are bioinert and that heal by fibrous encapsulation rather than <b>biointegration</b> (2). The capacity for <b>biointegration</b> and remodeling allows a more physiological result. The same factors that contribute to the accuracy of three-dimensional images reconstructed from medical imaging data will be critical in generating biomedical implants. These have been thoroughly reviewed, and include section thickness, threshold value, imaging plane, and reconstruction algorithm (3). A new set of variables is introduced by the need to render the bioimplant integratable into surrounding tissue. Of these variables, implant pore size and pore directionality have been identified (4). Our purpose in this article is to illustrate the manufacture of an orbital floor prosthesis from a hydroxyapatite bioceramic by using medical imaging data.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, various implantable devices have been {{developed}} to treat diseases that were previously difficult to manage such diabetes, chronic pain, and neurodegenerative disorders. However, translation of these novel technologies into clinical practice is often difficult because fibrotic encapsulation and/or rejection impairs device function after body implantation. Ideally, cells of the host tissue should perceive the surface of the implant being similar to the normal extracellular matrix. Here, we developed an innovative approach to provide implant surfaces with adhesive protein micropatterns. The patterns were designed to promote adhesion of fibroblasts and macrophages by simultaneously suppressing fibrogenic activation of both cell types. In a rat model, subcutaneously implanted silicone pads provided with the novel micropatterns caused 6 -fold lower formation of inflammatory giant cells compared with clinical grade, uncoated, or collagen-coated silicone implants. We further show that micropatterning of implants resulted in 2 - 3 -fold reduced numbers of pro-fibrotic myofibroblast by inhibiting their mechanical activation.

Modifications achieved by excimer laser irradiation of titanium samples were investigated {{in order to improve}} their surface characteristics so as to facilitate <b>biointegration.</b> To enlarge the effective interfacial area of bone-implant contact, holes were ablated by laser pulses of ns or sub-ps length. During ns ablation, crown-like projecting rims formed around the borders of the holes. Ultra-short (0. 5 ps) KrF excimer laser pulses were successfully applied to avoid these undesirable formations. Since a smooth dental implant surface is necessary to maintain a healthy connection with the soft tissues, laser polishing of samples was investigated, too. Irradiation with a series of ns laser pulses resulted in effective smoothing, as measured with atomic force microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the laser-polished titanium surface revealed that laser treatment led to a decrease of the surface contamination and in thickening of the oxide layer.

Methods: A total of 15 adult domestic pigs underwent full thickness chest wall resection and reconstruction with Parietene (polypropylene composite; PTE, n = 5), Parietex (polyester composite; PTX, n = 5) or Bard (purely polypropylene, n = 5) mesh. After an observation period of 90 days all animals were sacrificed, intrathoracic adhesions classified via thoracoscopy (VATS), meshes explanted and peak peal strength required for lung/mesh separation recorded. Results: Adhesions assessed through VATS-exploration were strongest in the PTX-Group while PTE and BM showed comparable results. Tensiometric analyses of peak peal strength confirmed lower values in BM than for PTE and PTX. Both composite materials showed good overall bioincorporation with post-surgical perigraft-fibrosis being strongest in BM.

Ti-based alloys with low elastic modulus are attracting a lot of interest for avoiding stress shielding, but their osseointegration potential is still very low. In this study, we report on how cell adhesion is influenced by linear RGD, cyclic RGD, and recombinant fibronectin fragment III 8 - 10 coated on titanium versus a novel low-modulus TiNbHf alloy. The bioactive molecules were either physisorbed or covalently coupled to the substrates and their conformation on the surfaces was investigated with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The influence of the different bioactive coatings on the adhesion of rat mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated using cell culture assays and quantitatively analyzed at the single cell level by AFM-based single-cell force spectroscopy. Our results show that bioactive moieties, particularly fibronectin fragment III 8 - 10, improve cell adhesion on titanium and TiNbHf and that the covalent tethering of such molecules provides the most promising strategy to biofunctionalize these materials.

On one hand, implants may suffer from poor osseointegration, and their rejection results in repeated surgery, patient's suffering, and extensive expenses. On the other hand, there are severe systemic adverse effects of toxic chemotherapeutics which are administrated systemically. In this paper, {{in order to address}} these two problems, we present a new type of localized drug-releasing titanium implants with enhanced implants' <b>biointegration</b> and drug release capabilities that could provide a high concentration of anticancer drugs locally to treat bone cancers. The implants are fabricated by 3 D printing of Ti alloy followed by an anodization process featuring unique micro- (particles) and nanosurface (tubular arrays) topography. We successfully demonstrate their enhanced bone osseointegration and drug loading capabilities using two types of anticancer drugs, doxorubicin (DOX) and apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo 2 L/TRAIL). In vitro study showed strong anticancer efficacy against cancer cells (MDA-MB- 231 -TXSA), confirming that these drug-releasing implants can be used for localized chemotherapy for treatment of primary {{and secondary}} bone cancers together with fracture support.

40|$|Abstract: We {{conducted}} in AFM analysis of roughness on 7 materials {{widely used in}} bone reconstruction. Roughness was evaluated by measuring Root Mean Square (RMS) values and RMS/average height (AH) ratio, in different dimensional ranges, varying from 100 microns square to a few hundreds of nanometers. The results showed that Titanium presented a lower roughness than the other materials analyzed, frequently reaching statistical significance. On the contrary, bioactive materials, such as hydroxyapatite (HA) and bioactive glasses, demonstrated an overall higher roughness. In particular, this study focuses attention on AP 40 and especially RKKP, which proved {{to have a significant}} higher roughness at low dimensional ranges. This determines a large increase in surface area, which is strongly connected with osteoblast adhesion and growth and to protein absorption. Therefore, the <b>biointegration</b> properties of bioactive glasses can also be given as answer in terms of surface structures in which chemical composition can influence directly the biological system (e. g. with chemical exchanges and development of specific surface electrical charge) and indirectly, via the properties induced on tribological behavior that expresses itself during the smoothing of the surfaces. We also test two new bioactive glasses, RBP 1 and RBP 2, with a chemical composition similar to AP 40, but with some significant small additions and substitutions of components, in order to make preliminary considerations on their potential role in orthopedics.

40|$|Biofunctionalization of {{metallic}} materials with cell adhesive molecules {{derived from the}} extracellular matrix is a feasible approach to improve cell-material interactions and enhance the <b>biointegration</b> of implant materials (e. g., osseointegration of bone implants). However, classical biomimetic strategies may prove insufficient to elicit complex and multiple biological signals required in the processes of tissue regeneration. Thus, newer strategies are focusing on installing multifunctionality on biomaterials. In this work, we introduce a novel peptide-based divalent platform with the capacity to simultaneously present distinct bioactive peptide motifs in a chemically controlled fashion. As a proof of concept, the integrin-binding sequences RGD and PHSRN were selected and introduced in the platform. The biofunctionalization of titanium with this platform showed a positive trend towards increased numbers of cell attachment, and statistically higher values of spreading and proliferation of osteoblast-like cells compared to control noncoated samples. Moreover, it displayed statistically comparable or improved cell responses compared to samples coated with the single peptides or with an equimolar mixture of the two motifs. Osteoblast-like cells produced higher levels of alkaline phosphatase on surfaces functionalized with the platform than on control titanium; however, these values were not statistically significant. This study demonstrates that these peptidic structures are versatile tools to convey multiple biofunctionality to biomaterials in a chemically defined manner.
