5|$|Scotland {{enjoys a}} {{diversity}} of temperate ecologies, incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodlands, and moorland, montane, estuarine, freshwater, oceanic, and tundra landscapes. Approximately 14% of Scotland is wooded, much of it forestry plantations, but prior to human clearing {{there would have been}} much larger areas of boreal Caledonian and <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>forest.</b> Although much reduced, significant remnants of the native Scots Pine woodlands can be found in places. 17% of Scotland is covered by heather moorland and peatland. Caithness and Sutherland have some {{of the largest and most}} intact areas of blanket bog in the world, supporting a distinctive wildlife community. 75% of Scotland's land is classed as agricultural (including some moorland) with urban areas accounting for around 3% of the total. The number of islands with terrestrial vegetation is nearly 800, about 600 of them lying off the west coast. Scotland has more than 90% of the volume and 70% of the total surface area of fresh water in the United Kingdom. There are more than 30,000 freshwater lochs and 6,600 river systems.|$|E

40|$|A phytosociological {{study was}} {{conducted}} on evergreen <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>forests</b> in the Chichibu district of central Honshu. Four associations and one community were determined: a Polysticho-Perseetum thunbergii, an Ardisio-Castanopsietum sieboldii, a Quercetum myrsinaefoliae, a Sakakio-Cyclobalanopsietum and a Quercus glauca community. These vegetation units occur in different horizontal habitats and precipitation areas. Evergreen <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>forests</b> in this district, except the Ardisio-Castanopsietum sieboldii, contain summergreen species, about 70 % as many {{as the number of}} evergreen species growing there.

30|$|Forests cover over 58 % of {{the total}} land area of Taiwan (Taiwan Forestry Bureau 1994), and this amount of {{coverage}} {{would be expected to}} contribute to more SOC sequestration. However, crops and plantations have been widely replaced many of the native <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>forests</b> in the montane area in central Taiwan. Cash crops mostly tea tree and bamboo can be commonly found in the montane area at the elevation from 1000 to 1500  m because of their high economic value and the proper climate for their growth; therefore, many of local farmers use the forestlands illegally in an effort to increase economic benefits. Consequently, crops gradually replaced natural <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>forests,</b> and land overuse and abuse have become pervasive. Besides, most of the natural <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>forests</b> in the same area had been logged since the 1950 s. To counter this, the Experimental Forest, National Taiwan University (NTU) has been reforesting land after the logging of natural forests and after reclaiming illegally used lands.|$|R
