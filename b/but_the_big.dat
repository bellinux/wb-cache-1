5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
5|$|Control {{went back}} and forth at the {{beginning}} of the match between Hulk Hogan and Earthquake. When Earthquake rolled out of the ring, both wrestlers' corner-men got involved, as Hogan and the Big Boss Man fought against Earthquake and Dino Bravo. Bravo and Earthquake powerslammed Hogan while the referee was distracted, which allowed Earthquake to lock Hogan in a Boston crab hold. After being powerslammed outside of the ring by Earthquake, Hogan tried to lift his opponent but was unsuccessful. Earthquake powerslammed Hogan and performed two Earthquake splashes but was unable to get the pinfall. Hogan recovered and bodyslammed Earthquake. He performed a legdrop on Earthquake before Earthquake's manager, Jimmy Hart interfered. Hogan threw him out of the ring and then bodyslammed Earthquake onto a table at ringside. Hogan got back into the ring and won the match via countout. Earthquake attacked Hogan after the match, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Boss Man saved Hogan by hitting Earthquake with a chair.|$|E
5|$|The other {{predominant}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Matt Hardy and Edge, a real life issue transformed into a storyline. At SummerSlam, Edge defeated Hardy after dropping him onto {{the top of a}} ring post. This was scripted to caused Hardy to bleed heavily, which forced the referee to end the match and declare Edge the winner because Hardy could not continue. The next night on Raw, Hardy had a match with Rob Conway, in which Conway pinned Hardy for the win. After the match, Edge attacked Hardy. On the August 29 episode of Raw, Edge and Hardy were scheduled to compete in a Street Fight, a match where there are no disqualifications, no countouts, and scoring conditions can occur anywhere in the arena. The match ended in a no-contest after Hardy and Edge brawled at the stage ramp. Hardy grabbed Edge by the side and threw both himself and Edge off the stage and into electrical equipment. Both Hardy and Edge laid motionless on the floor as sparks flew everywhere. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took both men away in ambulances for medical attention. The following week, Bischoff booked Hardy and Edge in a steel cage match at Unforgiven, where the ring would be enclosed by a steel cage. Following the announcement, Bischoff scheduled a match between Hardy and Snitsky, which Hardy lost. After the match, Snitsky threatened to hit Hardy with a ring bell <b>but</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Show came down. He was unable to stop Snitsky, and as a result, Snitsky succeeded in hitting Hardy with the bell.|$|E

He permanently adjusted and readjusted his hitting style and pitching mechanics, came back from many injuries, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Boy of Barlovento (el Muchachote de Barlovento in Spanish) persevered and won recognition as pitcher and slugger in all leagues where he played.|$|E

The State attracted foreign companies in order to obtain more capital and to get access to foreign markets, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> foreign companies got contracts with this huge net of small sized, familiar and national companies, which were a very important percentage of the industrial output.|$|E
25|$|When the 2nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment {{was changed}} to artillery, the blue hat cord {{was changed to}} red and the collar {{insignia}} was changed from the crossed rifles to crossed cannon. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> change was from the rifle to the six-inch howitzer, which was used in shelling enemy positions. It took eight horses to pull {{one of the big}} cannons. After several months of classroom training, the 142nd began live fire on the horse drawn 4.7inch weapon in April 1918.

National Basketball Assn.). The following season, the SuperSonics went on to record their first winning season at 47–35. The team, led by player-coach Wilkens and First Team forward Haywood, held a 46–27 mark on March 3, but late season injuries to starters Haywood, Dick Snyder, and Don Smith contributed to the team losing eight of its final nine games; otherwise, the 1971–72 team might very well have become the franchise's first playoff team.|$|E
25|$|The Big Show wasn't quite {{big enough}} to put {{television}} in its place and keep it there. NBC cancelled the show after two seasons and a reported loss of $1 million, a major figure in those years. In fact, it was primarily because the program was unable to attract more advertisers than those who sustained the second half-hour segment (6:30-7:00pm) during the first season: RCA Victor, American Home Products/Whitehall Pharmacal's Anacin, and Liggett & Myers' Chesterfield cigarettes. The show's failure to pull the audience needed to keep it alive longer than two years might also {{have been due to}} the former NBC hits now nestling on rival CBS, including The Jack Benny Program (directly opposite The Big Show), Amos 'n' Andy and Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. <b>But</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Show is remembered {{as one of the great}} final stands, at its best, of classic American old-time radio and---for its wit, colorful music and dramatics---as good as broadcast variety programming got on either medium.|$|E
25|$|Luke Weaver {{made his}} debut in Chicago on August 13 ending their 11-game unbeaten streak in the month, {{pitching}} four innings, giving up just two runs on four hits (Double and two-run HR by Addison Russell), striking out three, and walking three. Alex Reyes gets {{his first major}} league win in relief, pitching three innings (fifth-seventh), giving up only one hit, while walking one and striking out three. Brandon Moss hit his 20th home run, a solo blast in the sixth, cutting the Chicago lead to 2-1. Jedd Gyorko hit his 17th {{home run in the}} seventh, a solo blast that tied the score. Two runs on a wild pitch and a bases-loaded walk gave the Birds a 4-2 lead. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> blow was then a grand slam in the eighth inning by 25th birthday boy Randal Grichuk. It was only the second time a Cardinals' player has hit a grand slam on his birthday, with Colby Rasmus the first. It was the first slam by a Cardinals' player at Wrigley Field since Adam Kennedy in 2008. Grichuk has hit two home runs since his recall from AAA on August 11.|$|E

25|$|McCarthy {{first came}} to {{prominence}} on the inter-county scene {{as a member of}} the Cork minor hurling team in the early 1960s. He lined out for Cork in this grade in 1963, however, his side was defeated in the early rounds of the championship. In 1964 McCarthy was a key member of both the Cork under-21 and intermediate hurling teams. Success was slow in coming <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> breakthrough for Cork and McCarthy came in 1966. That year he won a Munster title with the under-21 team following a 5–12 to 2–6 defeat of Limerick. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork play Wexford in an interesting encounter. After an entertaining sixty minutes of hurling both sides finished level with Cork scoring 3–12 to Wexford's 5–6. The replay took place shortly afterwards, however, both sides finished all square again with 4–9 apiece. A second replay had to be played to eventually find a winner. At the third time of asking Cork emerged victorious with a huge tally of 9–9 to 5–9. This victory gave Cork their first All-Ireland title in this grade and gave McCarthy an All-Ireland under-21 medal.|$|E
25|$|From {{early in}} the 19th century, it was a custom to hold boat races on the Tyne. The Tyne had {{a large number of}} keelmen and wherrymen, who handled boats as part of their jobs. As on the River Thames, there were {{competitions}} to show who was the best oarsman. As a wherryman did not earn very much, professional rowing was seen as a quick way of earning extra money. Regattas were held, and provided modest prizes for professionals, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> money was made in challenge races, in which scullers or boat crews would challenge each other to a race over a set distance for a side stake. The crews would usually have backers, who would put up the stake money, as they saw the chance of financial gain from the race. In the days before mass attendances at football matches, races on the river were enormously popular, with tens of thousands attending. Betting would go on both before and during a race, the odds changing as the fortunes of the contestants changed. Contestants who became champions of the Tyne would often challenge the corresponding champions of the River Thames, and the race would be arranged to take place on one of the two rivers.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} between The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von), and Big Show and Kane for the Dudley Boyz's WWF Tag Team Championship. Kane {{dominated}} in the beginning, and tagged in The Big Show. The Big Show also dominated, {{but as he}} attempted a chokeslam, Bubba Ray held the ropes and raked the eyes of The Big Show. D-Von tagged in but received a sidewalk slam from The Big Show. The Big Show then hit D-Von {{with a series of}} hip attacks. Kane and The Big Show dominated in the ring, knocking the Dudleys out of the ring. Kane went to the top rope and jumped to the outside, knocking out Dudleys. In the ring, Stacy Keibler tried to encourage the Dudleys, <b>but</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Show snuck up and pulled down her skirt. The Dudleys hit Kane with a double suplex and started working on him. They gave Kane a diving headbutt low blow, and a series of double-team maneuvers. They set him for the Dudley Death Drop but Kane kicked D-Von in the head and hit Bubba Ray with a clothesline. Kane tagged in The Big Show, who tried to chokeslam D-Von but Bubba Ray hit him a chop block. Kane tried to hit D-Von with a flying clothesline but accidentally hit The Big Show. Dudleys fell to the outside while Kane and Show argued in the ring. The Dudleys then hit The Big Show with a Hotshot onto an exposed turnbuckle for the win, retaining their title.|$|E
