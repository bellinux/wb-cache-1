We view data integration as an iterative process where data understanding gradually increases as the data scientist continuously refines his view {{on how to}} deal with learned intricacies like data conflicts. This paper presents a probabilistic approach for integrating data on groupings. We focus on a bio-informatics use case concerning homology. A <b>bio-informatician</b> has a large number of homology data sources to choose from. To enable querying combined knowledge contained in these sources, they need to be integrated. We validate our approach by integrating three real-world biological databases on homology in three iterations...|$|E

The biositemap concept is based on ideas from Efficient, Automated Web Resource Harvesting and Crawler-friendly Web Servers, and it integrates the features of sitemaps and RSS feeds into a decentralized mechanism for computational biologists and <b>bio-informaticians</b> to openly broadcast and retrieve meta-data about biomedical resources.|$|R
40|$|MINING {{biological}} data is {{an emerging}} area of intersection between data mining and bioinformatics. <b>Bio-informaticians</b> {{have been working}} on the research and development of computational methodologies and tools for expanding the use of biological, medical, behavioral, or health-related data. Biological data mining aims to extract significant information from DNA, RNA and proteins. Many biological processes are not well-understood Biological knowledge is highly complex. In this paper we discussed in discovering genetic features and environmental factors that are involved in multifactorial diseases such as (obesity, diabetes). To exploit this data, data mining tools are required and we using a specific genetic algorithm. 1...|$|R
40|$|Diagnostics using next {{generation}} sequencing (NGS) requires high-quality interdisciplinary collaboration. In order to gain insight into this crucial collaborative process, we made video recordings of a new multidisciplinary team {{at work in the}} clinical genetics department of the University Medical Centre Groningen. Conversation Analysis was used to investigate {{the ways in which the}} team members deal with the disciplinary boundaries between them. We found that the team established different 'participation frames' in which to discuss recurring topics. Patients were discussed only by the medical doctors, whereas results of genetic tests were discussed by doctors, molecular biologists and genetic laboratory technicians. Information technology (IT) aspects were discussed by biologists, genetics analysts and <b>bio-informaticians,</b> but not doctors. We then interviewed team members who said they believed that the division of labour embodied in these participation frames contributes to achieving their team's goals...|$|R
40|$|Grid {{computing}} is {{a revolutionary}} {{new technology that}} has sparked significant interest in research and scientific communities in the past decade. The Grid is a vast service for sharing resources, such as computational power and data storage, over the Internet. A critical aspect of Grid computing is the collection and indexing of these resources thereby making them accessible to a growing user community comprising of physicists, astronomers, <b>bio-informaticians</b> etc. The major contribution of this work is the design and analysis of a novel resource discovery protocol intended for Grid applications. Based on the fundamentals of peer-topeer computing, this resource discovery scheme uses well-established ideas from one domain of distributed computing to surmount shortcomings native to Grid computing. The resulting solutions are elegant and facilitate both multiple attribute and continuous value queries. Trace-driven experiments presented demonstrate that the proposed solutions are both efficient and practical. iii To my Parents and Sister iv Acknowledgement...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} with the centrally-organised curation of the Gene Ontology, many biological ontologies are developed by loosely-organised groups who develop their ontology remotely. These groups tend to be formed from scientists and <b>bio-informaticians</b> from research groups with a common interest, who {{want to create a}} resource that will be useful to the community, rather than being formally mandated. Until recently, technological support for bio-ontology development relied on stand-alone editors running on users&#x 2019; desk- tops for creating new ontology versions (e. g. OBO-Edit, COBrA and Prot 9;g 9;) and on private email, email lists and perhaps Wikis for the distribution of ontology files and discussions. Clearly, much better use could be made of the storage, versioning and visualisation techniques being developed by the database and e- Science communities.

40|$|The {{availability}} of the banana reference genome sequence (D’Hont et al., 2012) and Next Generation Sequencing technologies have boosted research that helps {{to better understand the}} banana (Musa spp.) genetic diversity held in the Bioversity International Musa Germplasm Transit Centre (ITC). New insights into the genetics of the crop, associated with phenotyping, enable the exploration of banana genetic resources for a range of important end-users’ traits, to support further uses to enhance food and nutritional security. We are taking advantage of the latest Next Generation Sequencing technologies to i) produce high-density genetic markers for a large number of samples at low cost, and ii) to sequence, assemble and annotate key genomes, thus generating an unprecedented volume of information for researchers and breeders. Using the deluge of genomics data creates both a challenge and an opportunity. It places a unique challenge upon <b>bio-informaticians</b> to deal with the volume, speed and variety of data generated and to provide adequate storage, analyses and graphic visualization. At the same time, it provides a unique opportunity to unlock the potential of the genetic diversity stored in genebanks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Research in {{molecular}} biology has generated {{a huge amount}} of data. Various bioinformatics techniques are applied for the storage, analysis and manipulation of molecular data in different applications. One of the important application areas of bioinformatics is sequence analysis. Sequence analysis is used to identify structure, functions and features of long biological sequences. Sequence alignment {{is one of the key}} activities performed by <b>bio-informaticians</b> under molecular sequence analysis to identify the similarities between protein sequences or nucleotides. Many algorithms are available for molecular sequence alignment depending upon the type of application. Among one of the widely used algorithms are BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), which identifies the regions of local similarity between the query sequence and library sequences. Depending upon the matches between the sequences similarity score is calculated. High score represents better alignment means close association between molecular sequences. In this paper a new model of distributed BLAST for Local Area Network is proposed. In proposed algorithm query sequence is distributed by master node dynamically. Before query execution no of available slave nodes will be checked by master node and query sequence will be divided into same no of segments. In this implementation database will be replicated on all the slave nodes. Different algorithms will be executed by master and slave nodes of a LAN...|$|R
40|$|Gastric {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In {{advanced}} and metastatic gastric cancer, the conven-tional chemotherapy with limited efficacy shows an overall survival period of about 10 months. Patient specific and effective treatments known as personalized cancer therapy is of significant importance. Advances in high-throughput technologies such as microarray and next generation sequencing for genes, protein expression profiles and oncogenic signaling pathways have reinforced the discovery of treatment targets and personalized treatments. However, there are numerous challenges from cancer target discoveries to practical clini-cal benefits. Although there is a flood of biomarkers and target agents, {{only a minority of}} patients are tested and treated accordingly. Nu-merous molecular target agents have been under investigation for gastric cancer. Currently, targets for gastric cancer include the epider-mal growth factor receptor family, mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor axis, and the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase–AKT–mammalian target of rapamycin pathways. Deeper insights of molecular characteristics for gastric cancer has enabled the molecular classification of gastric cancer, the diagnosis of gastric cancer, the prediction of prognosis, the recognition of gastric cancer driver genes, and the dis-covery of potential therapeutic targets. Not only have we deeper insights for the molecular diversity of gastric cancer, but we have also prospected both affirmative potentials and hurdles to molecular diagnostics. New paradigm of transdisciplinary team science, which is composed of innovative explorations and clinical investigations of oncologists, geneticists, pathologists, biologists, and <b>bio-informaticians...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The OBML 2010 workshop, {{held at the}} University of Mannheim on September 9 - 10, 2010, is the 2 nd in {{a series}} of {{meetings}} organized by the Working Group “Ontologies in Biomedicine and Life Sciences” of the German Society of Computer Science (GI) and the German Society of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS). Integrating, processing and applying the rapidly expanding information generated in the life sciences — from public health to clinical care and molecular biology — {{is one of the most}} challenging problems that research in these fields is facing today. As the amounts of experimental data, clinical information and scientific knowledge increase, there is a growing need to promote interoperability of these resources, support formal analyses, and to pre-process knowledge for further use in problem solving and hypothesis formulation. The OBML workshop series pursues the aim of gathering scientists who research topics related to life science ontologies, to exchange ideas, discuss new results and establish relationships. The OBML group promotes the collaboration between ontologists, computer scientists, <b>bio-informaticians</b> and applied logicians, as well as the cooperation with physicians, biologists, biochemists and biometricians, and supports the establishment of this new discipline in research and teaching. Research topics of OBML 2010 included medical informatics, Semantic Web applications, formal ontology, bio-ontologies, knowledge representation as well as the wide range of applications of biomedical ontologies to science and medicine. A total of 14 papers were presented, and from these we selected four manuscripts for inclusion in this special issue. An interdisciplinary audience from all areas related to biomedical ontologies attended OBML 2010. In the future, OBML will continue as an annual meeting that aims to bridge the gap between theory and application of ontologies in the life sciences. The next event emphasizes the special topic of the ontology of phenotypes, in Berlin, Germany on October 6 - 7, 2011. </p...|$|R
