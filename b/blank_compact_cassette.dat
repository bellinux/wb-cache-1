50|$|The ad hoc system {{relied on}} a system of trust, meaning that tapes were swapped {{in a kind of}} honor system; those who did not {{subscribe}} to this ethos and received tapes without returning the favor accordingly would become known as 'rip-offs' or 'rip-off traders' and were regarded with scorn. Flyers advertising gigs, recordings and other merchandises for sale were often swapped in conjunction with tape trading. Music that had been licensed to record companies (therefore subject to copyright) and released in the format of Vinyl records, CD and MC (musicassette) was also pirated onto <b>blank</b> <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> medium and traded, although this was in infringement of both unofficial 'rules' of the network and actual copyright law itself.|$|E
50|$|Loran was {{the brand}} name of a <b>blank</b> <b>compact</b> audio <b>cassette</b> marketed {{throughout}} the 1970s and 1980s and manufactured by Loran Cassettes & Audio Products, Inc, a division of Loranger Manufacturing Corporation.|$|R
25|$|The mass {{production}} of <b>blank</b> (recordable) <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassettes</b> began in 1964 in Hanover, Germany. Prerecorded music cassettes (also known as Music-Cassettes, and later just Musicassettes; M.C. for short) were launched in Europe in late 1965. The Mercury Record Company, a US affiliate of Philips, introduced M.C. to the US in July 1966. The initial offering consisted of 49 titles.|$|R

The Mercury Record Company, a US affiliate of Philips, introduced M.C. to the US in July 1966. The initial offering consisted of 49 titles.However, the system {{had been designed}} initially for dictation and portable use, with the audio quality of early players not well suited for music. Some early models also had unreliable mechanical design. In 1971, the Advent Corporation introduced their Model 201 tape deck that combined Dolby type B noise reduction and chromium dioxide (CrO2) tape, with a commercial-grade tape transport mechanism supplied by the Wollensak camera division of 3M Corporation. This resulted in the format being taken more seriously for musical use, and started the era of high fidelity cassettes and players.|$|R
50|$|Philips' {{development}} of the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> in 1963 and Sony's {{development of}} the Walkman in 1979 led to widespread consumer use of magnetic audio tape. In 1990, the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> was the dominant format in mass-market recorded music. The development of Dolby noise reduction technology in the 1960s brought audiophile quality recording to the <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> also contributing to its popularity.|$|R
50|$|Philips {{named the}} {{videotape}} standard Video <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> (VCC) to complement its landmark audio <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> format introduced in 1963, but the format itself was marketed under the trademark Video 2000.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{technically}} sound, but a nearly complete {{failure in the}} marketplace, with a very low take-up by a few audiophiles only. Apart from {{the problem of the}} bulky cassettes, the performance of <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> had improved dramatically with the use of new materials such as chromium dioxide, Dolby B noise reduction, and better manufacturing quality. For most people, the quality of <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> was adequate, and the benefits of the expensive Elcaset system limited. Audiophiles turned away from Elcaset and towards high-end <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> decks from companies like Nakamichi, which began making very high-quality tape decks using the <b>compact</b> audio <b>cassette</b> in late 1973, even three years before the Elcaset was released. The tapes they made could be played on any <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> machine. Also, the Elcaset machines were expensive. Elcaset began a fast fade-out in 1978.|$|R
50|$|The {{cassette}} itself looks {{similar to}} a <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> only larger—about twice the size. Like the earlier RCA tape cartridge, it contained 6 mm (0.25 in) tape running at 9.5 cm/s (3.75 in/s), twice the width and twice {{the speed of a}} <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> providing greater frequency response and dynamic range with lower high-frequency noise than the <b>compact</b> <b>cassette.</b> Another notable difference from <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> is that the tape is withdrawn from the cassette when run through the transport mechanism so that the manufacturing tolerances of the cassette shell will not affect sound quality. The top-of-the-line Elcaset decks also have all the features of deluxe open-reel decks, such as separate heads for erasing, recording, and playback; remote control, and heavy-duty transports for low wow & flutter.|$|R

50|$|In 1979 the Walkman brand was introduced, in {{the form}} of the world's first {{portable}} music player using the <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> format. Sony introduced the MiniDisc format in 1992 as an alternative to Philips DCC or Digital <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> and as a successor to the <b>compact</b> <b>cassette.</b> Since the introduction of MiniDisc, Sony has attempted to promote its own audio compression technologies under the ATRAC brand, against the more widely used MP3. Until late 2004, Sony's Network Walkman line of digital portable music players did not support the MP3 standard natively.|$|R

5000|$|DCCs {{are similar}} to <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes,</b> except {{that there are no}} [...] "bulges" [...] where the tape-access holes are located. The top side of a DCC is flat and there are no access holes for the hubs on there (they are not {{required}} because auto-reverse is a standard feature on all DCC decks), so this side can be used for a bigger label than can be used on an analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassette.</b> A spring-loaded metal shutter similar to the shutters on 3.5 inch floppy disks and MiniDiscs covers the tape access holes and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use. Cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that DCC recorders can tell a DCC apart from an analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassette,</b> and so they can tell what the length of a DCC tape is. Also, there is a sliding marker on the DCC to enable and disable recording. Unlike the break-away notches on analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> and VHS tapes, this marker makes it easier to make a tape recordable again, and unlike on analog <b>compact</b> <b>cassettes,</b> the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassette</b> was {{a popular}} medium for distributing {{pre-recorded}} music in the late 1970s through to the 1990s. The very first [...] "Compact Cassette" [...] was introduced by Philips in August 1963 {{in the form of}} a prototype. <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassettes</b> became especially popular during the 1980s after the advent of the Sony Walkman, which allowed the person to control what they listened to. The Walkman was convenient because of its size, the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with a clip for belts or pants. <b>Compact</b> <b>cassettes</b> also saw the creation of mixtapes, which are tapes containing a compilation of songs created by any average listener of music. The songs on a mixtape generally relate to one another in some way, whether it be a conceptual theme or an overall sound. The <b>compact</b> <b>cassette</b> used double-sided magnetic tape to distribute music for commercial sale. The music is recorded on both the [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] side of the tape, with cassette being [...] "turned" [...] to play the other side of the album. <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassettes</b> were also a popular way for musicians to record [...] "Demos" [...] or [...] "Demo Tapes" [...] of their music to distribute to various record labels, in the hopes of acquiring a recording contract. The sales of <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassettes</b> eventually began to decline in the 1990s, after the release and distribution Compact Discs. After the introduction of Compact discs, the term [...] "Mixtape" [...] began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format. Recently there has been a revival of <b>Compact</b> <b>Cassettes</b> by independent record labels and DIY musicians who prefer the format because of its difficulty to share over the internet.|$|R
