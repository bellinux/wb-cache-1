5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E
5|$|The annual {{incidence}} in Canada of genital herpes due to HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection {{is not known}} (for a review of HSV-1/HSV-2 prevalence and incidence studies worldwide, see Smith and Robinson 2002). As many as one in seven Canadians aged 14 to 59 may be infected with herpes simplex type 2 virus and more than 90 per cent of them may <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their status, a new study suggests. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} about 1,640,000 HSV-2 seroconversions occur yearly (730,000 men and 910,000 women, or 8.4 per 1,000 persons).|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen sulfide is {{a highly}} toxic and {{flammable}} gas (flammable range: 4.3–46%). Being heavier than air, it tends to accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Although very pungent at first, it quickly deadens the sense of smell, so victims may <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> its presence until it is too late. For safe handling procedures, a hydrogen sulfide safety data sheet (SDS) should be consulted.|$|E
25|$|Younger {{women with}} {{an age of}} less than 40 years or women over 80 years {{tend to have a}} poorer {{prognosis}} than post-menopausal women due to several factors. Their breasts may change with their menstrual cycles, they may be nursing infants, and they may <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> changes in their breasts. Therefore, younger women are usually at a more advanced stage when diagnosed. There may also be biologic factors contributing to a higher risk of disease recurrence for younger women with breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the size}} of Olympus Mons and its shallow slopes, an {{observer}} standing on the Martian surface would be unable to view the entire profile of the volcano, even from a great distance. The curvature of the planet and the volcano itself would obscure such a synoptic view. Similarly, an observer near the summit would <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> standing on a very high mountain, as the slope of the volcano would extend far beyond the horizon, a mere 3 kilometers away.|$|E

25|$|Packaged and {{processed}} foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so {{may be a}} special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions. Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients. Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients. For example, while some vegetarians may <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> animal-derived rennet's role {{in the production of}} cheese, and may therefore unknowingly consume the product, other vegetarians may not take issue with its consumption.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, Agha Mohammad Shah sent a {{force of}} 8,000 {{soldiers}} under Suleiman Khan Qajar, followed by Mirza Mehdi, to conquer Mashhad and affirm its citizens of the Shah's generosity. A day later, Agha Mohammad Shah, followed the customary of the famous Iranian shah Abbas I the Great, and entered Mashhad by foot as a pilgrim to the Imam Reza shrine, whilst being teary eyed and kissing the ground. His pilgrimage continued for 23 days, where he seemed to <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> {{the politics of the}} country.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in the Western {{cultural}} sphere, {{which has}} portrayed its foreign intelligence agencies (such as the CIA and MI6) in different media forms, Indian authors and actors have been shy {{to explore the}} area of espionage, especially R, until the 1990s.

Excessive secrecy surrounding activities and rare declassification of the information are considered to be the major reasons behind this.|$|E

25|$|Fancy Bear {{carried out}} spear {{phishing}} attacks on email addresses {{associated with the}} Democratic National Committee {{in the first quarter}} of 2016. On April 15, which in Russia was a holiday in honor of the military's electronic warfare services, the hackers seemed to become inactive for the day. Another sophisticated hacking group attributed to the Russian Federation, nicknamed Cozy Bear, was also present in the DNC's servers at the same time. However the two groups each appeared to <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the other, as each independently stole the same passwords and otherwise duplicated their efforts. Cozy Bear appears to be a different agency, one more interested in traditional long-term espionage.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to injuries from falling and from back strains (some {{of which may}} be serious), catastrophic injuries may occur, such as finger, hand, or even arm amputations. Amputations or avulsions may result from two causes: looping or wrapping the rope around a hand or wrist, and impact from elastic recoil if the rope breaks. Amateur organizers of tugs of war may underestimate the forces generated, or overestimate the breaking strength of common ropes, and may thus <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the possible consequences if a rope snaps under extreme tension. The broken ends of a rope made with a somewhat elastic polymer such as common nylon can reach high speeds, and can easily sever fingers. For this reason, specially engineered tug of war ropes exist that can safely withstand the forces generated.|$|E
25|$|Attribute {{substitution}} is {{a psychological}} process thought to underlie {{a number of}} cognitive biases and perceptual illusions. It occurs when an individual {{has to make a}} judgment (of a target attribute) that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated heuristic attribute. This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic intuitive judgment system, rather than the more self-aware reflective system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place. This explains why individuals can <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show regression toward the mean.|$|E
