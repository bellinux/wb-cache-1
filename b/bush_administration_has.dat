25|$|The <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized}} by {{columnist}} James Bovard of The American Conservative for requiring protesters to stay within a designated area, while allowing supporters access to more areas. According to the Chicago Tribune, the American Civil Liberties Union has asked a federal court in Washington D.C. to prevent the Secret Service from keeping anti-Bush protesters distant from presidential appearances while allowing supporters to display their messages up close, where {{they are likely to}} be seen by the news media.|$|E
25|$|On July 20, 2007, President Bush {{issued an}} {{executive}} order officially banning torture of POWs by intelligence officials. Amnesty International {{points out that the}} <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> narrowly defined torture under the Bybee memo, at the time, the only known one of the Torture Memos. While the US is a signatory to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, it has failed to ratify that portion of the Geneva Convention, Protocol I, which would grant such persons POW status as the detainees at Guantanamo. The US is one of only six countries that have not.|$|E

2500|$|Council of Foreign Relations fellow Peter Beinart {{argued that}} [...] "It is terribly unfortunate that MoveOn.org is {{essentially}} calling Petraeus a Republican hack, but it’s the logical {{result of the}} position the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> put him in." [...] Fellow Max Boot accused Moveon.org of [...] "desperate attempts to besmirch {{one of the most}} admired soldiers in the entire American armed forces" [...] and argued that the ad will [...] "backfire".|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, George Packer, {{author of}} The Assassin's Gate: America in Iraq and New Yorker {{magazine}} staff writer, {{wrote an article}} about the increasing use of social science in US military operations and the early trials of the HTS program.

2500|$|According to {{a public}} opinion poll by Zogby International of 1,036 likely voters from October 10–12, 2006, 40% of American voters at least {{somewhat}} believe the Israel lobby has been {{a key factor in}} going to war in Iraq. [...] The following poll question was used: [...] "Question: Do you strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree that the work of the Israel lobby on Congress and the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> been a key factor for going to war in Iraq and now confronting Iran?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Human Rights Watch, the {{umbrella}} organization of Americas Watch, replied to these allegations: [...] "Almost invariably, U.S. pronouncements {{on human rights}} exaggerated and distorted the real human rights violations of the Sandinista regime, and exculpated those of the U.S.-supported insurgents, known as the contras...The Bush administration is responsible for these abuses, {{not only because the}} contras are, for all practical purposes, a U.S. force, but also because the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> continued to minimize and deny these violations, and has refused to investigate them seriously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other Republican {{officials}} have provided less definitive views regarding whether waterboarding is torture. Andrew C. McCarthy, a former Republican prosecutor {{including in the}} George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>has</b> stated that when used in [...] "some number of instances that were not prolonged or extensive", waterboarding should not qualify as torture under the law. McCarthy has also stated that [...] "waterboarding is close enough to torture that reasonable minds can differ on whether it is torture" [...] and that [...] "here shouldn't be much debate that subjecting someone to [...] repeatedly would cause the type of mental anguish required for torture".|$|E

2500|$|On 15 October 2008, it was {{reported}} that the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> issued a pair of secret memos to the CIA in June 2003 and June 2004 explicitly endorsing waterboarding and other torture techniques against al-Qaeda suspects. The memos were granted only after [...] "repeated requests" [...] from the CIA, who at the time were worried that the White House would eventually try to distance themselves from the issue. Field employees in the agency believed they could easily be blamed for using the techniques without proper written permission or authority. Until this point, the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> never been concretely tied to acknowledging the torture practices.|$|R
2500|$|During 2006 Lebanon War ADC filed {{a federal}} lawsuit {{claiming}} that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld failed to fulfill constitutional obligations to protect US citizens under attack in Lebanon. [...] The lawsuit asked {{the federal court}} to compel the officials to request a cease fire and to stop all U.S. military support to Israel during the evacuation of US citizens from Lebanon. ADC President Hon. Mary Rose Oakar charged that [...] "the <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> encouraged the violence by sending an urgent shipment of bombs to Israel giving that country {{the green light to}} continue in its indiscriminant bombing of Lebanon." [...] Previously, Mary Rose Oakar pleaded guilty in United States District Court to federal crimes involving violations of elections law and campaign finance regulations.|$|E

[...] While they were still regarded as [...] "enemy combatants" [...] by the US government, it had brought no specific charges against them. The New York Times and CNN reported that Bush had released Begg as a favour to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was being harshly criticised in the UK for his support of the Iraq war. The Atlantic claimed that the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{tried to make a}} gag order a condition of Begg's release, but that this would not have been acceptable to the British public.|$|E
2500|$|John Yoo, {{legal advisor}} to the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>has</b> {{explicitly}} invoked Federalist No. 70 in his support for executive power over foreign policy. Referencing Hamilton, Yoo has claimed that [...] "the centralization of authority in the President is particularly crucial in matters of national defense, war, and foreign policy, where a unitary executive can evaluate threats, consider policy choices, and mobilize national resources with a speed and energy that is far superior to any other branch.” [...] Yoo has also cited Federalist No. 70 in his support of the President’s right to unilaterally conduct operations against terrorists without congressional consent. He claims that this power applies to operations against both individuals and states. At least one scholar has also argued that, because {{the president has the}} most access to national security information, only the president can know when the War on Terror is over and no longer mandates an expansive executive authority.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> {{previously}} {{adopted the}} position {{that it would not}} finalize any rule subsequent to November 1, 2008. This last-minute rulemaking that binds the hands of an incoming administration is commonly termed the midnight drop.|$|R

50|$|These {{hearings}} {{were conducted}} {{based on the}} assertion by the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> that detainees {{in the war in}} Afghanistan were not eligible for prisoner of war status according to the terms of Article 2 of the GCIII and therefore designated unlawful combatant.

2500|$|By now the sunsets in the Patriot Act {{were getting}} closer to expiring.

50|$|Following the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld-ruling (November 2004) the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> begun using Combatant Status Review Tribunals to {{determine}} the status of detainees. By doing so the obligation under Article 5 of the GCIII was to be addressed.|$|E
5000|$|The Socialist Equality Party {{claims that}} the {{majority}} of left-wing opponents of the <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>have</b> [...] "lined up behind the Obama Administration", {{despite the fact that the}} Obama Administration's policies are in many respects similar to those of the <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration.</b> The Socialist Equality Party seeks to create a mass movement in opposition to the Obama Administration on the basis of a Socialist program.|$|R
50|$|Thompson's {{appointment}} {{as director of}} the ONAP was criticized because, unlike the two previous Bush-appointed directors of the office, she was neither a medical professional nor gay.
