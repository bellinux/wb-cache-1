5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> week.|$|E
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E

2500|$|Case {{involved}} twenty {{barrels of}} butter found and {{taken into the}} custody of the defendant. [...] Plaintiff alleged [...] the defendant's negligence had left the <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ruined condition. The court found that the loss arising from the negligence of an accidental finder was not allowed to constitute a cause of action, for no law compelleth him that finds a thing to keep it safely; as if a man finds a garment and suffers it to be moth eaten. [...] It would be otherwise {{if there had been a}} misuse.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980 the {{publishing}} house Schibsted forlag suggested {{the writing of}} a historical series of novel to Margit Sandemo. First she didn't get excited about this idea and she decided to continue to write novel series for magazines. In her own words, {{she changed her mind}} in 1981 when she saw a picture of a medieval church painting in a newspaper. It showed a woman making <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> butter churn and the Devil behind her, trying to seduce her. Sandemo got the idea for the entire 47 book series The Legend of the Ice People from this picture, although in the beginning she [...] thought that the series will comprise only eight books. The first volume, Spellbound, was published in 1982.|$|E
2500|$|Flemish waffles, or Gaufres à la Flamande, are a {{specialty}} of northern France and portions of western Belgium. The original recipe, published in 1740 by Louis-Auguste de Bourbon in Le Cuisinier Gascon, is as follows: Take [...] "deux litrons" [...] (1.7 liters or 7 cups) of flour and mix it {{in a bowl}} with salt and one ounce of brewer's yeast barm. Moisten it completely with warm milk. Then whisk fifteen egg whites and add that to the mixture, stirring continuously. Incorporate [...] "un livre" [...] (490 grams or 1.1 pounds) of fresh butter, and let the batter rise. Once the batter has risen, take your heated iron, made expressly for these waffles, and wrap some <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cloth and rub {{both sides of the}} iron with it. When the iron is completely heated, make your waffles, but do so gently for fear of burning them. Cooked, take them out, put them on a platter, and serve them with both sugar and orange blossom water on top.|$|E

Close to one plate a bunch of stocks and gilly flowers reposed on the dirty tablecloth, as though dropped and {{forgotten}} by the God of Love. Their faint perfume stole through the other odours.

60|$|The menu laid {{before the}} diner at {{this sort of}} dinner may report a variety of food for the others, but for the honored guest the sole course is taffy, with plenty of drawn <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lordly dish. The honored guest is put up beside the chairman, with his mouth propped open for the taffy, and before the end he is {{streaming}} drawn butter from every limb. The chairman has poured it over him with a generous ladle in his opening speech, and each speaker bathes him with it anew from the lordly dish. The several speakers try to surpass {{one another in the}} application, searching out some corner or crevice of his personality which has escaped the previous orators, and filling it up to overflowing. The listeners exult with them in their discoveries, and roar at each triumph of the sort: it is apparently a proof of brilliant intuition when a speaker seizes upon some forgotten point in the honored guest's character or career and drenches it with drawn butter.|$|E
60|$|This I {{would not}} hear of, {{so he took}} the top, and I faced him. It was a nice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,--and it {{acquired}} additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us. This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room,--where I found much of its parsley and <b>butter</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.|$|E
