6000|$|So {{much for}} these revenues; which {{are nothing but}} his visions, or already the {{national}} possessions without any act of his. It is easy to parade with a high talk of Parliamentary rights, of the universality of legislative powers, and of uniform taxation. Men of sense, when new projects come before them, always think a discourse proving the mere right or mere power of acting in the manner proposed, {{to be no more}} than a very unpleasant way of misspending time. They must see the object to be of proper magnitude to engage them; they must see the means of compassing it to be next to certain; the mischiefs not to counterbalance the profit; they will examine how a proposed imposition or regulation agrees with the opinion of those who are likely to be affected by it; they will not despise the consideration even of their habitudes and prejudices. They wish to know how it accords or disagrees with the true spirit of prior establishments, whether of government or of finance; because they well know, that in the complicated economy of great kingdoms, and immense revenues, which in a length of time, and by a variety of accidents have coalesced into a sort of body, an attempt towards a compulsory equality in all circumstances, and an exact practical definition of the supreme rights in every case, is the most dangerous and chimerical of all enterprises. The old building stands well enough, though part Gothic, part Grecian, and part Chinese, until an attempt is made to square it into uniformity. Then it may come down upon our heads altogether, in much uniformity of ruin; and great will be the fall thereof. Some people, instead of inclining to debate the matter, only feel a sort of nausea, when they are told, that [...] "protection calls for supply," [...] and that [...] "all the parts ought to contribute to the support of the whole." [...] Strange argument for great and grave deliberation! As if the same end may not, and must not, be compassed, according to its circumstances, by a great diversity of ways. Thus, in Great Britain, some of our establishments are apt for the support of credit. They stand therefore upon a principle of their own, distinct from, and in some respects contrary to, the relation between prince and subject. It is a new species of contract superinduced upon the old contract of the state. The idea of power must as much as possible be banished from it; for power and credit are things adverse, incompatible; Non bene conveniunt, nec in una sede morantur. Such establishments are our great moneyed companies. To tax them would be critical and dangerous, and contradictory to the very purpose of their institution; which is credit, and cannot therefore be taxation. But the nation, when it gave up that power, did not give up the advantage; but supposed, and with reason, that government was overpaid in credit, for what it seemed to lose in authority. In such a case to talk of the rights of sovereignty is quite idle. Other establishments supply other modes of public contribution. Our trading companies, as well as individual importers, are a fit subject of revenue by customs. Some establishments pay us by a monopoly of their consumption and their produce. This, nominally no tax, in reality comprehends all taxes. Such establishments are our colonies. To tax them would be as erroneous in policy, as rigorous in equity. Ireland supplies us by furnishing troops in war; and by <b>bearing</b> <b>part</b> of our foreign establishment in peace. She aids us at all times by the money that her absentees spend amongst us; which is no small part of the rental of that kingdom. Thus Ireland contributes her part. Some objects bear port-duties. Some are fitter for an inland excise. The mode varies, the object is the same. To strain these from their old and inveterate leanings, might impair the old benefit, and not answer the end of the new project. Among all the great men of antiquity, Procrustes shall never be my hero of legislation; with his iron bed, the allegory of his government, and the type of some modern policy, by which the long limb was to be cut short, and the short tortured into length. Such was the state-bed of uniformity! He would, I conceive, be a very indifferent farmer, who complained that his sheep did not plough, or his horses yield him wool, though it would be an idea full of equality. They may think this right in rustic economy, who think it available in the politic: ...|$|E

40|$|Summary This thesis evaluates how {{fat body}} mass (FBM) and lean body mass (LBM) {{influence}} bone mineral density (BMD) in total body, weight bearing and non-weight <b>bearing</b> <b>parts</b> of the skeleton. It is a cross-sectional study based on absorptiometry {{data from a}} large population based study (Tromsø V). The project involved an initial quality control of the data, and includes data from 1354 men and women aged 32 - 87 in 2001. The result shows that both FBM and LBM are independent predictors of BMD. One kilogram increase in LMB gives larger increase in BMD than one kilogram increase in FBM. Both have {{a positive influence on}} BMD in weight <b>bearing</b> <b>parts</b> (whole body and hips), whereas for non-weight <b>bearing</b> <b>parts</b> (forearm), only LBM is significant. This may indicate that the mechanical force generated by action of muscles have an additional effect on BMD other than the gravitational force from the body mass itself. The hip fracture incidence in the Norwegian population is {{among the highest in the}} world, and the proportion of elderly people in the population is increasing. Risk of fracture increases with age and it is a clear correlation between BMD and this risk. Improved knowledge of patterns and processes relevant for reducing the incidence rate is therefore important in order to improve public health.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the <b>bearing</b> <b>parts</b> {{directly}} affects the overall level of the finished bearing and {{the reliability of the}} operation.

Pulse method is the most widely used method in ultrasonic detection. However, the method is poor in high accuracy of quantitative detection, and there are some problems such as high defect detection rate and difficult blind detection. These problems limit the ultrasonic detection in many high precision applications. In this paper, the shortcomings of traditional detection methods are studied and make improvement, the method no longer relies on the sound pressure, uses linear FM ultrasonic signal as a transmission signal source, the ultrasonic echo signal coherent processing, so as to get more high detection reliability and accuracy. In this paper, a distributed multi- probe simulation system is used to demonstrate that the new method has excellent performance in defect detection...|$|R

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used in aeroengine, machine tool spindles, locomotive wheelset, and so forth. Rolling bearings are usually the weakest components that influence the remaining life of the whole machine. In this paper, a fatigue life prediction method is proposed based on quasistatic modeling of rolling bearings. With consideration of radial centrifugal expansion and thermal deformations on the geometric displacement in the bearings, the Jones’ bearing model is updated, which can predict the contact angle, deformation, and load between rolling elements and bearing raceways more accurately. Based on Hertz contact theory and contact mechanics, the contact stress field between rolling elements and raceways is calculated. A coupling model of fatigue life and damage for rolling bearings is given and verified through accelerated life test. Afterwards, the variation of bearing life is investigated under different working conditions, that is, axial load, radial load, and rotational speed. The results suggested that the working condition had a great influence on fatigue life of <b>bearing</b> <b>parts</b> and {{the order in which}} the damage appears on <b>bearing</b> <b>parts...</b>|$|R
