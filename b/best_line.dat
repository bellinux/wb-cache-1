25|$|On 30 November 1780, Osborn {{was elected}} to Parliament in a by-election, this time to the Horsham {{constituency}} in Sussex. Osborn was promoted to lieutenant general in 1787. On 1 September 1795, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany wrote a report to King George III after inspecting military units in the Northern District. The report stated that Osborn commanded the 3rd Dragoon Guards, the 8th Foot, and the Durham militia at Whitburn. The 8th Foot was praised as the <b>best</b> <b>line</b> regiment in the district though its officers were not in regulation uniforms. Only 100 troopers of the 3rd Dragoon Guards were present since two squadrons {{had been sent to}} the continent. The Durham militia were well-drilled but their uniforms and equipment were in bad condition.|$|E
25|$|Unlike show hunter classes, which reward calmness and style, jumper classes require boldness, scope, power, accuracy, and control; speed {{also is a}} factor, {{especially}} in jump-off courses and speed classes (when time counts even in the first round). A jumper must jump big, bravely, and fast but also must be careful and accurate to avoid knockdowns and must be balanced and rideable in order to rate and turn accurately. The rider must choose the <b>best</b> <b>line</b> to each fence, saving ground with well-planned turns, and lines and must adjust the horse's stride for each fence and distance. In a jump-off, a rider must balance the need to go {{as fast as possible}} and turn as tightly as possible against the horse's ability to jump cleanly with good scope.|$|E

40|$|Background:. Closing of defects of {{the lower}} limb after skin cancer {{excision}} poses a challenge in lower limb skin. Although the concept of relaxed skin tension lines has been established as ideal on the face, on the lower limb there remains confusion between Langer’s lines and wrinkle lines, and this study {{was done with the}} task of identifying and mapping biodynamic excisional skin tension (<b>BEST)</b> <b>lines</b> on the lower limb. Methods:. Following studies on <b>BEST</b> <b>lines</b> elsewhere on the body, the author investigated <b>BEST</b> <b>lines</b> on the lower limb. Using a specially designed tensiometer, inherent skin tension (pretension) and wound-closing tension were studied along with the force needed to bring the wound edges together after excision of a lesion in 23 cases with defects ranging from 1. 5 to 4. 5 [*]cm in diameter. Skin tension measurements of skin lines (relaxed skin tension <b>lines</b> (RSTL) versus <b>BEST)</b> and vertical closure (BEST) versus vertical closure with a parallel relaxing incision were undertaken and followed by statistical analyses utilizing the paired t test and the unpaired Student’s t tests. Results:. <b>BEST</b> <b>lines</b> run in the vertical direction on the lower limb, that is, closure in a vertical direction resulted in a statistically significant reduction in closing tension when compared with other directions. Using a parallel relaxing incision can offer further reduction in tension, if needed. Conclusion:. <b>BEST</b> <b>lines</b> {{of the lower}} limb are discussed, and a new technique of using parallel relaxing incisions to achieve closure of larger defects is also presented as an alternative to cutaneous flaps or grafts in the lower limb...|$|R

25|$|At {{first the}} {{promoters}} wanted {{the most direct}} route to London, even if that meant building a line all the way there, by-passing important towns in Cornwall and Devon. Before the interested parties could raise the money and get parliamentary authority for their line, the Government actually removed {{the bulk of the}} packet trade to Southampton, so that most of the income for any new line was removed. Some interests continued to press for the <b>best</b> <b>line</b> to London, hoping that the packet trade would return; if necessary they would link with another new railway, but the huge cost of this proved impossible to raise. A more practical scheme running to Plymouth gradually took priority, and at first the trains were to cross the Hamoaze, the body of water {{at the mouth of the}} River Tamar on a steam ferry. This was shown to be unrealistic, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel was called in to resolve the difficulty. He designed the bridge over the River Tamar at Saltash, the Royal Albert Bridge: when it was built it was the most prodigious engineering feat in the world. He also improved the details of the route elsewhere. By reaching Plymouth, the company could connect with the South Devon Railway and on to London over the Bristol and Exeter railway and the Great Western Railway. The line was built on the broad gauge.|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend commented: [...] "The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired, never truly horrible.

500|$|Canadian-American filmmaker Jason Reitman {{later came}} upon the novel (initially {{attracted}} by the Christopher Buckley blurb on the cover) while browsing in the Los Angeles bookstore Book Soup. Reitman persuaded his father, Canadian-American filmmaker Ivan Reitman, to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from Ted Griffin and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turner's script in their work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the original script that was (unbeknownst to Reitman) written by Turner. Some Turner inventions {{that were used in}} the film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech ("Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now..."), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male). Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, then later admitted to confusion when the Writers Guild of America ruled that he should share credit with Turner, whose script Reitman claimed to have never read. He and Turner later appeared at a WGA event where both said they were happy to share credit, after Turner's contribution to the final product was made clear.
