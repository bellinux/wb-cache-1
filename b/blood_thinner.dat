5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (<b>blood</b> <b>thinner).</b> It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E

50|$|The {{decision}} to begin therapeutic anticoagulation often {{involves the use}} of multiple bleeding risk predictable outcome tools as non-invasive pre-test stratifications due to the potential for bleeds while on <b>blood</b> <b>thinning</b> agents. Among these tools are HAS-BLED, ATRIA, and CHA2DS2-VASc.|$|R
25|$|Concerns exist when ginseng is used chronically, {{potentially}} causing {{side effects}} such as headaches, insomnia, and digestive problems. The risk of interactions between ginseng and prescribed medications {{is believed to}} be low, but ginseng may have adverse effects when used with the <b>blood</b> <b>thinner,</b> warfarin. Ginseng has been shown to have adverse drug reactions with phenelzine. A potential interaction has also been reported with imatinib, resulting in hepatotoxicity, and with lamotrigine.|$|E
25|$|Rivaroxaban, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Xarelto, among others, is an {{anticoagulant}} medication (<b>blood</b> <b>thinner),</b> which is taken by mouth. It is commonly used to prevent blood clots. It was initially developed by Bayer. In the United States, it is marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutica. It is the first available active direct factor Xa inhibitor which is taken by mouth. The maximum inhibition of factor Xa occurs four hours after a dose. The effects last approximately 8–12 hours, but factor Xa activity does not return to normal within 24 hours, so once-daily dosing is possible.|$|E
25|$|Bileaflet {{heart valves}} consist of two semicircular {{leaflets}} that rotate about struts {{attached to the}} valve housing. This design was introduced in 1979 and while {{they take care of}} {{some of the issues that}} were seen in the other models, bileaflets are vulnerable to backflow and so they cannot be considered as ideal. Bileaflet valves do, however, provide much more natural blood flow than caged-ball or tilting-disc implants. One of the main advantages of these valves is that they are well tolerated by the body. Only a small amount of <b>blood</b> <b>thinner</b> is needed to be taken by the patient each day in order to prevent clotting of the blood when flowing through the valve.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to valve {{replacement}} with mechanical prostheses inhibition {{of the blood}} clotting system (anticoagulation) is not necessary after aortic valve repair. <b>Blood</b> <b>thinning</b> may only be necessary if atrial fibrillation occurs or persists {{in order to prevent}} blood clot formation in the left atrium.|$|R

50|$|However, some {{patients}} find that <b>blood</b> <b>thinning</b> medications {{can be difficult}} to tolerate or are risky. Because they prevent <b>blood</b> clots by <b>thinning</b> the <b>blood,</b> blood thinners can increase the risk of bleeding problems. In select patients, physicians determine that an alternative to blood thinners is needed to reduce AF stroke risk. Approximately 45% of patients who are eligible for warfarin are not being treated, due to tolerance or adherence issues. This applies particularly to the elderly, although studies have indicated that they can also benefit from anticoagulants.|$|R
500|$|Treatment of an MI is time critical. Aspirin is an {{appropriate}} immediate treatment for a suspected MI. Nitroglycerin or opioids {{may be used to}} help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes. Supplemental oxygen should be used in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath. In a STEMI, treatments attempt to restore blood flow to the heart, and include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), where the arteries are pushed open and may be stented, or thrombolysis, where the blockage is removed using medications. People who have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are often managed with the <b>blood</b> <b>thinner</b> heparin, with the additional use of PCI in those at high risk. In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be recommended rather than angioplasty. [...] After an MI, lifestyle modifications, along with long term treatment with aspirin, beta blockers, and statins, are typically recommended.|$|E

The same week, Vickers also announced he would be taking <b>blood</b> <b>thinner</b> medication and cannot race for at least three months.

50|$|The {{treatment}} method used {{depends on the}} cause of the hemorrhage. In most cases, the patient is advised to rest with the head elevated 30-45°, and sometimes to put patches over the eyes to limit movement prior to treatment in order to allow the blood to settle. The patient is also advised to avoid taking medications that cause <b>blood</b> <b>thinning</b> (such as aspirin or similar medications).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{improvement}} project conducted at a unit responsible for <b>blood</b> <b>thinning</b> treatment at Lidköping hospital in Sweden. The unit coordinates and monitors {{the treatment of}} 1200 patients and consists of a heart specialist and five specially trained nurses. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant (<b>blood</b> <b>thinning)</b> treatment effective for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events in various clinical contexts. The project started {{in the autumn of}} 2005 as an effort to improve the safety of patients receiving <b>blood</b> <b>thinning</b> therapy. The aim was to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing warfarin treatment. Since there is a strong association between individual variation in the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and patient morbidity/mortality in warfarin treatment, the focus of the project was to reduce variation in the INR value of patients undergoing warfarin treatment as a way to eventually decrease mortality and morbidity. In this application, an IT-solution was developed in 2006, where process INR-values are monitored online and visualized in a control chart, available to all co workers in the process. The IT-solution proved to be critical in order to encourage continuous improvement in the process The data are updated on a daily basis, stimulating reflection and daily improvement. Analyzing and learning from the data, special causes of variation in INR-values have been identified and removed from the process. The treatment process is now stable, in statistical control and patient safety has increased. As a result, the number of INR values within therapeutic range (values between 2. 0 - 3. 0) per week increased from 63 % (autumn 2005) to 66 % May 2006 to 70 % December 2007 (latest data) ...|$|R

40|$|For more {{accurate}} prescription for stroke and heart patients Singapore, May 29, 2014 – A fast and cost-effective genetic test {{to determine the}} correct dosage of <b>blood</b> <b>thinning</b> drugs {{for the treatment of}} stroke, heart problems and deep vein thrombosis has been developed by researchers at the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (IBN). Using gold nanoprobes, this new technology offers personalized healthcare based on the genetic profile of the patients. IBN Executive Director Professor Jackie Y. Ying said, “Diseases caused by blood clots can be potentially fatal. Genetic testing can improve the treatment of such medical conditions. By combining our expertise in molecular diagnostics and nanotechnology, we have developed a new genetic test that can determine the appropriate drug dosage to be administered for each patient. ” <b>Blood</b> <b>thinning</b> drugs or anticoagulant medication prevent clots from forming in the blood. They are used to treat stroke, irregular heartbeat and deep vein thrombosis. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant drug. But the dosage for each individual is highly variable, and the wrong dosage can cause an adverse reaction...|$|R
