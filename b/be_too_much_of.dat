5|$|Levine {{confirmed}} in March 2013 {{that the film}} has been officially cancelled. Levine stated that after Warner's Watchmen film in 2009 did not {{do as well as}} the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. In February 2017, Verbinski said that his crew were about eight weeks from starting filming, with plans for many elaborate sets given that the setting of Rapture could not be something easily shot on existing locations, requiring the $200 million budget. Verbinski was anticipating on releasing the film with an R-rating, when Universal approached him about changing the film's direction. Universal requested that he tone down the film and aim instead for a PG-13 movie, which would be able to draw more audiences to the film and recoup the larger budget he asked for. Verbinski insisted on keeping the R-rating, and refused the smaller budget Universal offered to make the R-rated version. Universal felt that that expensive a film with the limited R-rating would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a risk, and pulled him from the film. Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget, but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material. Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project, which he did believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises {{they would have had to}} make.|$|E

25|$|The first {{plans for}} a bridge across the Derwent River {{had been made in}} 1832, but the width and depth of the river, {{combined}} with the powerful currents, proved to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a deterrent for then current construction materials and techniques. A solution was hit upon to create a pontoon bridge, and in 1943, the Hobart Bridge was opened, spanning the Derwent River for the first time. To deal with the perceived problem of upriver shipping access, a lifting span was added near the western landing that allowed quite large vessels to pass through.|$|E

However, as Alexander Altmann, writes [...] "Herrera <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a genuine philosopher {{to believe in}} the possibility of a fusion of the two realms, and he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a genuine kabbalist to wish for it." ...|$|R

25|$|In the Fairfax Court House action, the Confederate force {{killed at}} least four of the Union troops and wounded or took {{prisoner}} most of the others. The Confederates suffered a similar number of killed and wounded according to the only report on their casualties by a Union sergeant. Some of the badly wounded Union prisoners were paroled {{at the site of}} the battle along with a few men to take care of them. Finding the prisoners from the 11th New York Cavalry and from other Union units to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a burden on the march north, Stuart paroled them at Brookeville, Maryland on the night of June 2829.|$|E
25|$|The composer, however, {{was still}} ambitious and wishing {{for a better}} post, so in 1721 he {{accepted}} the invitation to work in Hamburg as Kantor of the Johanneum Lateinschule, and {{music director of the}} five largest churches. Soon after arrival, Telemann encountered some opposition from church officials who found his secular music and activities to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a distraction for both Telemann himself and the townsfolk. The next year, when Johann Kuhnau died and the city of Leipzig was looking for a new Thomaskantor, Telemann applied for the job and was approved, yet declined after Hamburg authorities agreed to give him a suitable raise. After another candidate, Christoph Graupner, declined, the post went to Johann Sebastian Bach.|$|E
500|$|Schur {{said the}} writing staff had {{difficulty}} scripting {{the scene where}} Ann kisses Andy: [...] "We {{had a lot of}} discussions about this because we didn't want Ann to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a jerk and kiss a guy who likes another girl, and we didn't want Andy to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a jerk because he likes April. It was very delicate." [...] The episode marked a turning point for the romantic subplot between April and Andy, who shared their first kiss of the series in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti". Goor said filming of that scene, [...] "They nailed the kiss immediately." [...] While trying to get April to talk to him, Andy pretends he doesn't want to talk to her at all, which he incorrectly calls [...] "reverse psychiatry" [...] instead of reverse psychology. This line was improvised by Chris Pratt.|$|E

500|$|Some commenters on Wright's Facebook page {{were skeptical}} of his claims, {{pointing}} {{to differences in}} the costume between the two videos; Wright explained the differences by saying he wanted, and made, a better cloak for the second video. Krahbichler accepted Wright's claims. [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a hassle just to play along for this long, and making up stories that fit so well," [...] he wrote shortly after the second video was posted. [...] "I believe it is very {{safe to say that}} PWW is indeed the creator". In an early December exchange on Facebook, Wright had told him he had chosen him as the recipient since he had [...] "won the business card lottery ... you handed me your business card, at some point". Krahbichler speculated that Wright had probably attended {{at least one of the}} many tech shows where he had had a booth.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{in which the}} family throws the pizza box away was specifically designed by John Swartzwelder to look surreal, with the family panning into each other. The moon was designed to resemble a bowling ball in the scene in which Jacques drops Marge home. The restaurant that Jacques and Marge attend is called [...] "Shorty's"; it was originally intended that a chef's hat would be shown moving around in the background, implying that the owner was short, but the concept was dropped as it seemed to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a silly idea. The episode's conclusion is a reference to An Officer and a Gentleman, which David Silverman had to watch first, so that {{he knew how to}} set the scene out. Homer's line, [...] "too exciting", when he sees the lingerie store was written by James L. Brooks. During Marge's phone conversation with Patty and Selma, Maggie can be seen sucking her pacifier repeatedly, a concept dropped in later episodes as it was deemed too much of a distraction from the dialogue.|$|E
500|$|Conceived as a [...] "show about nothing," [...] {{in which}} the main {{characters}} would [...] "just make fun of stuff", Seinfeld said {{that the idea of}} the pilot episode was to explore the [...] "gaps in society where there are no rules." [...] The storyline, as well as most of the main characters, were inspired by the personal lives of its creators. Jerry was a fictionalized version of Seinfeld, George a fictionalized version of Larry David and Kessler was based on David's neighbor Kenny Kramer. Though Seinfeld was initially concerned the [...] "wacky neighbor" [...] would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a cliché, David convinced him to put the character in the script. However, anticipating that the actual Kramer would exploit the benefits of having a TV character based on him, David hesitated to call the character Kramer. Thus, in the pilot, the character's name was [...] "Kessler". However, intrigued by the name, Seinfeld was convinced that the character's name should be Kramer, prompting Kenny Kramer to call NBC's legal department with various financial and legal demands, most of which he received. The name inconsistency would eventually be corrected in the season 9 episode [...] "The Betrayal" [...] in which Kramer explains that Kessler is the name on his apartment buzzer.|$|E

500|$|Drew McWeeny {{praised the}} film's {{complexity}} as giving it repeat-viewing value, and its conclusion as [...] "perhaps the most canny move it makes." [...] Todd Gilchrist found the story too {{similar to other}} cinematic trilogies such as Star Wars, but praised the production values. Brian Lowry felt that [...] "unlike last year's bloated sequel, it at least possesses some semblance of a destination, making it slightly more coherent - if no less numbing during the protracted finale." [...] Total Film praised the performances but complained that the twists and exposition {{made it hard to}} care for the characters. Edward Douglas liked the film but had issues with its pacing, while Blake Wright criticized the Davy Jones's Locker and Calypso segments. James Berardinelli found it the weakest of the trilogy as [...] "the last hour offers adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments... which doesn't account for the other 108 minutes of this gorged, self-indulgent, and uneven production." [...] Peter Travers praised Richards and Rush but felt [...] "there can indeed <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a good thing," [...] regarding Depp's character. Travers later declared the movie {{to be one of the}} worst films of the year. Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said the film was overall a disappointment and that [...] "the final showdown ... is a non-event and the repetitive swordplay and inane plot contrivances simply become boring by the end". Richard Roeper gave a positive review, saying [...] "Gore Verbinski and the stunt and special effects crews have created one of the most impressive blends of live-action work and CGI wizardry ever put on film," [...] and believing it [...] "rarely drags and is almost always entertaining." [...] He praised the performances of the actors as one of the best things about the film.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, it was {{announced}} that William Russ would be joining the cast of The Young and the Restless as Tucker McCall, a billionaire. Initially, Russ' casting was questioned by the press {{due to the lack of}} information on the character and the unsuccessful contract negotiations between Sony Pictures Television and Eric Braeden, who portrays icon businessman Victor Newman. Speculation arose that the producers were attempting to recast Victor or looking for a character to replace him, but Tucker ended up being a completely new character. Russ made his debut on December 2, 2009. Weeks after his debut, it {{was announced}} that Russ had been replaced by soap opera veteran Stephen Nichols. Former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell released a statement concerning the casting switch, saying that Russ is a [...] "talented actor" [...] and they [...] "enjoyed working with him", but they had decided to take the character in a [...] "different direction". Bell and co-executive producer Paul Rauch stated that Nichols brought many [...] "complexities, a strength, sexuality, and drama to this character". Afterward, Nelson Branco of TV Guide revealed that former vice president of CBS Daytime, Barbara Bloom, wanted Nichols for the role from the start. Nichols made his debut on January 27, 2010. In December 2012, {{it was announced}} that Nichols had been let go from the soap opera and had taped his final scenes. He made his final appearance on January 29, 2013. [...] In May, following the death of Jeanne Cooper, several sources reported that the soap opera planned to recast the role, however, the producers decided against an immediate recast and believed it would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a distraction.|$|E

2500|$|Cusack {{found that}} the {{greatest}} challenge adapting the novel was pulling off Rob Gordon's frequent breaking of the fourth wall and talking directly to the audience. The screenwriters did this to convey Rob's inner confessional thoughts and were influenced by a similar technique in the Michael Caine film, Alfie. Cusack rejected this approach because he thought that [...] "there'd just <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> me". Once director Stephen Frears signed on to direct, he suggested using this technique and everyone agreed to use it.|$|E

He stated, [...] "If every execution is to appear on the newspapers, then there would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the news on execution. I am afraid there would be side effects, like someone might begin to show suspicion on us being 'kill too many' or 'overreact'", arguing that the campaign should be moderated to avoid creating a negative image of the CCP.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, section 24's [...] "competent jurisdiction" [...] {{limit on}} which courts may award remedies, in R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc.

[...] These elected governments {{have the authority to}} grant varying degrees of powers to courts and tribunals, and deference should be shown to the governments' decisions. [...] Reviewing courts may, however, have to exercise interpretation regarding whether lower courts have powers to award certain remedies if it is not explicit in the laws. [...] This involves examining whether the lower court can consider Charter arguments and if allowing the lower court to dispense section 24(1) remedies would disrupt its general operations or <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a work burden for the court staff.|$|E

[...] Mike Ryan at Uproxx noted the continued {{sense of humor and}} tone from the first film, and appreciated Gunn's difference in overall structure in the sequel (which he compared to The Empire Strikes Back). Ryan was positive of the cast, particularly Rooker in his expanded role as [...] "the heart" [...] of the film. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers called the film a [...] "blast" [...] and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that [...] "Vol. 2 can't match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessor… the followup, while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn't lost its love for inspired lunacy. Chicago Sun-Timess Richard Roeper also gave the film three stars, writing, [...] "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not quite as fresh as the original—but it still packs a bright and shiny and sweet punch."
