5|$|The rivers {{played a}} leading role in the {{lifestyle}} of the Aboriginal people, acting as a source of food and a means of communication and trade. Murray cod and shellfish were gathered for food and bark canoes were used for travel along the rivers. Scars on many trees alongside the rivers are evidence of this extensive use of canoes. In the summer it is likely that the Bangerang and Wiradjuri joined the Monaro groups in the <b>Bogong</b> <b>moth</b> feasts in the alpine country to the east.|$|E
5|$|Archæological {{evidence}} from the Birrigai rock shelter in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years. It {{is possible that the}} area was inhabited for considerably longer, with evidence of an Aboriginal presence in south-western New South Wales dating back around 40,000–62,000 years. Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a <b>bogong</b> <b>moth</b> resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E

50|$|Mountain {{pygmy possums}} prefer {{to feed on}} <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths</b> which make up {{about a third of}} their diet. This moth species (Agrotis infusa) migrates to the high alpine {{mountain}}ous regions during the spring and summer months. During these months, mountain pygmy possums utilize <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths</b> as their principal food source. In the autumn months, <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths</b> depart from the mountain ranges and mountain pygmy possums must supplement their diets with fruits and seeds. Burramys parvis species will supplement their diet with the mountain plum pine from the fruit-bearing conifer Podocarpus lawrencei as well as seeds from the snow beard-heaths Leucopogon spp. and blackberry Rubus spp. Upon finding food, the mountain pygmy possum will first smell the food source before picking it up with its incisors. It will then transfer the item to its forelimbs so that it may manipulate the food and tear off pieces of flesh.|$|R

25|$|For {{at least}} 40,000 years, Australia's fauna played an {{integral}} {{role in the}} traditional lifestyles of Indigenous Australians, who exploited many species {{as a source of}} food and skins. Vertebrates commonly harvested included macropods, opossums, seals, fish and the short-tailed shearwater, most commonly known as the muttonbird. Invertebrates used as food included insects such as the <b>Bogong</b> <b>moth</b> and larvae collectively called witchetty grubs and molluscs. The use of fire-stick farming, in which large swathes of bushland were burnt to facilitate hunting, modified both flora and fauna — and are thought to have contributed to the extinction of large herbivores with a specialised diet, such as the flightless birds from the genus Genyornis. The role of hunting and landscape modification by aboriginal people in the extinction of the Australian megafauna is debated.|$|E

50|$|The Wiradjuri diet {{included}} yabbies {{and fish}} such as Murray cod from the rivers. In dry seasons, they ate kangaroos, emus and food {{gathered from the}} land, including fruit, nuts, yam daisies (Microseris lanceolata), wattle seeds, and orchid tubers. The Wiradjuri travelled into Alpine areas in the summer to feast on <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths.</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2001 {{scientists}} from the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (now Department of Environment and Climate Change), La Trobe University and an environmental consulting firm investigated a mysterious death of grass outside a cave in Australia’s Snowy Mountains. Heavy rains had washed dead <b>bogong</b> <b>moths</b> (Agrotis infusa) from the cave and grass touched by this outwash died. Investigations revealed that arsenic concentrated in the dead <b>bogong</b> <b>moths</b> poisoned the grass. Worryingly, arsenic occurred in the bodies or the droppings of three mammal species eating <b>bogong</b> <b>moths,</b> so arsenic contamination was spreading in the food chain. The arsenic came from the plains of Queensland and western New South Wales, where <b>bogong</b> <b>moths</b> breed in autumn (Figure 27. 1). The grubs, called cutworm caterpillars, eat grasses and crops before pupating in the soil to develop into winged adult moths. Arsenic-based insecticides were used intensively in the early 20 th century and some are still available, so cutworm caterpillars probably absorb arsenic when eating crops. The adults migrate to the Snowy Mountains, aestivating during summer in caves until cooler weather when they return to the plains (Figure 27. 2). The bogong migration is amazing and inspirational, {{part of the natural}} legacy bequeathed by the Australian environment to its human occupants. By contrast, the moths’ residual arsenic toxicity is disturbing, showing how human intervention may squander or spoil rich natural assets. You are now, though, in a position to understand and to solve such environmental problems and to reflect on what the environment and its conservation mean to you. Chapter aims: In this final chapter we revisit the three case studies introduced in Chapter 1 : Leadbeater’s possum, the crown-of-thorns starfish and the Corrigin grevillea. We show how theories and techniques described in this book are applied to these cases. To suggest what a career in environmental biology entails, we conclude with views from two eminent Australian environmental biologists. They describe the challenges of their careers and the changes in technology and in society’s attitudes they have seen...|$|R

50|$|On {{mainland}} Australia no animal {{other than}} the dingo was domesticated, however domestic pigs were utilised by Torres Strait Islanders. The typical Aboriginal diet included {{a wide variety of}} foods, such as pig, kangaroo, emu, wombats, goanna, snakes, birds, many insects such as honey ants, <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths</b> and witchetty grubs. Many varieties of plant foods such as taro, coconuts, nuts, fruits and berries were also eaten.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} pygmy possum is {{endemic to}} the alpine regions of southern Australia. The species is currently restricted to three isolated mountain regions: (1) Mount Blue Cow in Kosciuszko National Park in New South Wales, (2) Mount Bogong and Mount Higginbotham/Loch in the Bogong High Plains in Victoria, and (3) Mount Buller in Victoria. The typical home ranges within these mountain ranges differ for males and females. Females tend to reside at higher elevations of approximately 1400-2228 m near patches of block streams and other deep boulder formations. The home range of a female {{mountain pygmy possum}} is correlated with the density of <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths,</b> the pygmy possum’s preferred food source, which varies at different elevations. Females at higher elevations have smaller home ranges due to a relatively greater abundance of <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths,</b> whereas females residing at lower elevations typically have much larger home ranges as the quantity of moths declines. Male mountain pygmy possums reside at low elevations, generally between 1200-1300m, of these mountain ranges. Male home ranges are largest during the breeding season, between November and December, when they migrate to female nesting sites, and decline thereafter.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bogong</b> <b>moth</b> is {{a native}} insect of Australia. This was once {{considered}} a delicacy by the aborigines who collected the dormant larvae and cooked them. A town, Bogong, {{in the state of}} Victoria has been named after the moth.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the First Fleet of Europeans at Sydney in 1788, Indigenous Australians survived off the often unique native flora and fauna of the Australian bush, for between 40,000 and 60,000 years. It is {{understood}} that up to 5000 species of Australian flora and fauna were eaten by Indigenous Australians. Hunting of kangaroo, wallaby and emu was common. Other foods widely consumed included <b>bogong</b> <b>moths,</b> witchetty grubs, lizards and snakes. Bush berries, fruits, and honeys were also used.|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{disruption}} of traditional Aboriginal society by white settlers from 1825, many Aboriginal groups throughout the southern tablelands and slopes moved to the high country above 1,300 m in early summer to harvest <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths,</b> hold ceremonies and conduct trade. [...] The region, including {{the area around the}} site, was subsequently used for livestock grazing and peat extraction. It is now protected within Namadgi National Park.

5000|$|Mountain {{pygmy possums}} have an annual {{reproductive}} cycle. Although females are polyestrous, {{the need for}} sufficient fat reserves during hibernation limits females to one litter per year. In order to ensure adequate fat reserves, female mountain pygmy possums will synchronize reproduction for the spring months, when <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths</b> are abundant. The breeding season typically occurs during the Austral spring months of October and November. During this time, males migrate to the higher elevation nesting sites of females to mate. Mountain pygmy possums then have an internal gestation period of 14-16 days after which the altricial young will enter the forward-facing pouch of the female. A female mountain pygmy possum has four teats, and a litter is usually three to four offspring. The young remain in the pouch for approximately 3 weeks, after which they remain at the nest for another 3-4 weeks. The offspring are then weaned at around 9-10 weeks. The mating system that occurs in Burramys parvus is resource defense polygyny. A philopatric group of females typically share a nest space within deep boulder crevices. The nest sites are generally areas of high densities of migrating <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths.</b> Shortly after mating season, females will drive the male pygmy possums from the nest. The male mountain pygmy possums {{do not participate in}} parental care. Additionally, juvenile males are driven from the nest shortly after weaning. [...] As noted in all species of Burramyids, mountain pygmy possums become sexually mature by one year of age.|$|R

50|$|The Snowy Mountains {{region was}} an {{important}} gathering point for the Aborigines of the Adaminaby and surrounding districts for many thousands of years, with intertribal summer meetings being held in the High Country involving up to a thousand people for feasting on the <b>Bogong</b> <b>Moth.</b> This practice continued until around 1865.|$|E
5000|$|Mount Bogong towers {{above the}} Kiewa River valley and {{is of great}} {{significance}} to the local traditional owners. Parks Victoria states that [...] "Many Aboriginal people have a remarkably rich history of Aboriginal use in the Victorian Alps and a vast knowledge of the cultural sites, oral history and ancestral stories {{that relate to the}} alpine region of Victoria. Throughout the many seasons each year, Aboriginal groups would come {{from as far away as}} the coast and south west slopes, to meet with the tribes of the mountains for intertribal ceremonies and feasting on <b>Bogong</b> <b>Moths.</b> During these festivities they would exchange cultural objects and materials for tools".|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the range}} in {{altitude}} in the park, {{there are a variety}} of fauna habitats. The foothill forests contain kangaroos, wallabies, and several species of possums and sugar gliders. Smaller mammals such as native rats and mice inhabit the plateau. Wombats occur in all habitats. The alpine silver xenica is a species of butterfly found only on the plateau of Mount buffalo. <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths</b> shelter in rock crevices at the horn and it is common to see birds darting in and out of the cracks to feed on them during the day and bats doing the same at night. Peregrine falcons sometimes nest in the granite rock faces. Crimson rosellas are abundant throughout the park.|$|R
5000|$|According to Eddie Kneebone, an {{indigenous}} historian, [...] "the Yiatmathong (people) controlled the Kiewa and Mitta Mitta valleys, {{they also had}} control of the Alpine region on the Victorian side. Their southern most boundary extended to Hotham and ran along the highest ridge line of the Alps in an east-west direction. Because Mount Bogong fell within the Yiatmathong territory, permission had {{to be gained from}} them by the other tribes participating in the summer feast. Once this was done, the tribes would spend summer in the cooler climate of the mountains feasting on the protein rich Bogong moth". Kneebone claims that prior to climbing Mount Bogong and the Bogong High Plains, the tribes would gather by the Murray River at Mungabarreena (near modern Albury). After ceremonies, initiations, marriages, trading, settling of disputes, and renewing of alliances and friendships, the groups would walk from Albury to the mountain region to feed on the protein-rich <b>Bogong</b> <b>moths.</b>|$|R
