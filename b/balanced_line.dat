25|$|In a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> operation, the two wires carry {{equal and}} {{opposite}} signals, and the destination detects {{the difference between}} the two. This is known as differential mode transmission. Noise sources introduce signals into the wires by coupling of electric or magnetic fields and tend to couple to both wires equally. The noise thus produces a common-mode signal which is canceled at the receiver when the difference signal is taken.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the game}} was California's second tie, Stanford was chosen {{to play in the}} Rose Bowl on New Year's Day against the University of Notre Dame's Fighting Irish coached by Knute Rockne. Like Warner, Rockne is {{considered}} one of the greatest coaches in football history. According to journalist Allison Danzig, [...] "With the exception of Knute Rockne of Notre Dame, Pop Warner was the most publicized coach in football." [...] The game was thus a test of two different and highly influential systems of football: [...] "the Warner system with the wing backs, unbalanced line and gigantic power [...] Knute Rockne system with its rhythmic, dancing shift, lightning speed, <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> and finely timed blocking". Notre Dame's backfield was composed of the renowned Four Horsemen. Nevers played all 60 minutes of the game, and rushed for [...] (more yardage than the Four Horsemen combined). Warner's offense moved the ball but was unable to score, and Notre Dame won 27–10.|$|E

Many researches have proposed various designs of assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> to solve this problem.

The result showed that u-shaped <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> provided a better solution than the straight <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> did in number of workstation.

40|$|Lecturepg. 88 The {{majority}} of horizontally split multistage pumps were designed when packing {{was the only}} cost effective method of sealing the pumpage from atmosphere. As a result, even modern pumps employ a stuffing box pressure equalization <b>line</b> (<b>balance</b> <b>line)</b> to lower stuffing box pressures. This technique of pressure equalization has a major drawback: reduced pump efficiency. The work that is done on the fluid that is throttled back to suction through the <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> is lost and acts to reduce the useful work done by the pump. While this was an acceptable compromise in the 1950 s, {{it is now a}} true waste of very expensive electrical power. The modern solution to this problem is to eliminate the <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> and apply a correctly specified mechanical seal to the high pressure side of the pump. This paper serves to show that, with careful consideration of the effects of <b>balance</b> <b>line</b> removal, pump life can be maintained and efficiency gained...|$|R

50|$|A {{balanced}} circuit is circuitry {{for use with}} a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> or the <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> itself. Balanced lines are a common method of transmitting many types of electrical communication signals between two points on two wires. In a <b>balanced</b> <b>line</b> the two signal lines are of a matched impedance to help ensure that interference induced in the line is common-mode and can be removed at the receiving end by circuitry with good common-mode rejection. To maintain the balance, circuit blocks which interface to the line, or are connected in the line, must also be balanced.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} ofthis {{research is}} to demonstrate a practical approach to balance and synchronize a monitor assembly line which is characterized by several manufacturing constraints. The constraints as such could lower production rates ofthe line ifthey are not considered as integrated parts ofthe whole system. The research begins with manufacturing constraint analysis to identifr which one has the most impact and govems the productivity of the line. The output of the analysis is then used for comparing the efficiency between single-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> and multi-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> approaches. In addition, the algorithms to <b>balance</b> the <b>line,</b> i. e. COMSOAL and the current factory method, are compared. The research enquiry is investigated by computer simulation. An experimental design with 3 factors, namely <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> methods, <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> algorithms, and conveyor speeds, are conducted to evaluate the significance ofthe factors measured {{by the number of}} stations, line efficiency, output, and throughput time. It is found that the number of stations used in the multi-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> is less than the single-model one. In addition, the <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> methods and <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> algorithms provide significant enhancements to line efficiency, output, and throughput time. The multi-model assembly <b>line</b> <b>balancing</b> combined with COMSOAL method contributes to higher line efficiency, higher output, and less throughput time.
