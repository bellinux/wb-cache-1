25|$|Brooks {{was said}} to prefer <b>butter</b> <b>over</b> clay as a molding medium. The latter had to kept moist and wrapped {{to prevent it from}} cracking, was not as {{sensitive}} for sculptural manipulation, and was more difficult to cast. Brooks had conquered the major disadvantage of butter simply by using ice. She discovered that she could even use butter for casting. After preserving her original butter Dreaming Iolanthe for a half a year, she desired a method which would not require keeping it in cold storage. Without knowing ahead of time what the results may be, she mixed up some plaster and poured it onto the butter sculpture. The plaster quickly set, and she cut a hole {{in the bottom of the}} milk pan which held her creation. Brooks then set the pan over a container of boiling water, and the butter melted and drained out of the hole. She removed the remainder of the bottom of the pan, and was left with a greased plaster negative. She placed more plaster inside and, after some difficulty removing the outer layer, was left with a successful plaster positive. Brooks was issued a patent in 1877 for her process of creating lubricated plaster molds. She did not, however, use plaster casts to reproduce her butter sculptures, instead preferring to sculpt a new one for each exhibit.|$|E
500|$|Game {{had begun}} to become scarce in the region east of the Mississippi River. This could have been from over-hunting, or the game could have been driven westward as the colonial {{population}} increased. Fortunately, Irish and Scottish immigrants had been importing cattle into the American colonies during {{the early part of}} the 18th century. Consequently, when game was becoming scarce and mutton had a [...] placed upon it, cattle were available to take their place as a protein source. This change increased farmers' profit from animal husbandry. Cattle raising had begun on a small scale during the French-Indian War, but when the American Revolution came, farmers were able to increase their cattle holdings and increase the presence of beef in the American diet. In addition to beef production, the cattle also increased the production of milk and dairy products like butter. This may have contributed to the preference for <b>butter</b> <b>over</b> pork fat, especially in the northern colonies.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified <b>butter</b> <b>over</b> an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E
