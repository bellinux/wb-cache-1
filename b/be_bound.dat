She does so while he sleeps, but when he wakes up he snaps the strings. She persists, and he tells her that he can <b>be</b> <b>bound</b> with new ropes. She ties him up with new ropes while he sleeps, and he snaps them, too. She asks again, and he says that he can <b>be</b> <b>bound</b> if his locks are woven into a weaver's loom.

5|$|Some enzymes do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to <b>be</b> <b>bound</b> for activity. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|E

5|$|Although he {{initially}} agreed to these demands, on January 17, 1868, Yoshinobu {{declared that he}} would not <b>be</b> <b>bound</b> by the Restoration proclamation and called for its rescission. On January 24, he decided to prepare an attack on Kyoto, occupied by Satsuma and Chōshū forces. This decision was prompted by his learning of a series of arsons in Edo, starting with the burning of the outerworks of Edo Castle, the main Tokugawa residence. This was blamed on Satsuma rōnin, who on that day attacked a government office. The next day shogunate forces responded by attacking the Edo residence of the daimyō of Satsuma, where many opponents of the shogunate, under Takamori's direction, had been hiding and creating trouble. The palace was burned down, and many opponents killed or later executed.|$|E
5|$|Although not an isolationist, Coolidge was {{reluctant}} to enter into foreign alliances. He considered the 1920 Republican victory as {{a rejection of the}} Wilsonian position that the United States should join the League of Nations.

He spoke in favor of the United States joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not <b>be</b> <b>bound</b> by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with reservations). The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own.

If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion.

Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
