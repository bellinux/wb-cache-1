25|$|There is {{evidence}} of differences in linguistic processing <b>between</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> stutter and {{people who do not}} stutter. Brain scans of adult people who stutter have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.|$|E

25|$|Domestic {{partnership}} in the District {{used to be}} open to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. One of the unusual features of the original bill establishing domestic partnerships was that it allowed partnerships to be created <b>between</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were related by blood (e.g., siblings or a parent and adult child, provided both were single). All couples registered as domestic partners are entitled to the same rights as family members and spouses to visit their domestic partners in the hospital and jail and to make decisions concerning the treatment of a domestic partner's remains and estate after the partner's death.|$|E
25|$|Actor Andrew Buchan was {{attracted}} {{to the role of}} Mark Latimer by the authentic quality of the part. The way Chibnall showed how the community is affected by the murder, the newly unsettled relationships between the characters, and the disintegration of the bonds <b>between</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> once trusted one another also deeply attracted him to the project. Buchan says he was worried that he wouldn't get the part. His audition scene was where Mark Latimer must identify the body of his son in the Broadchurch morgue. To win the role, he worked himself up intensely and cried profusely. After winning the role, he researched the way parents react to a child's murder in order to treat the role with as much respect and accuracy as possible.|$|E
25|$|Menelik II was {{the actual}} founder of modern Ethiopia. Before the {{centralization}} process he completed, Ethiopia had been devastated by numerous wars, {{the most recent}} of which was fought in the 16th century. In the intervening period, military tactics had not changed much. In the 16th century the Portuguese Bermudes documented depopulation and widespread atrocities against civilians and combatants (including torture, mass killings and large scale slavery) during several successive Aba Gedas' Gadaa conquests of territories located north of Genale river (Bali, Amhara, Gafat, Damot, Adal). Warfare in the region essentially involved acquiring cattle and slaves, winning additional territories, gaining control over trade routes and carrying out ritual requirements or securing trophies to prove masculinity. Wars were fought <b>between</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> might be {{members of the same}} linguistic group, religion and culture, or between unrelated tribes. Centralization greatly reduced these continuous wars; minimizing the loss of lives, raids, destruction and slavery that had previously been the norm.|$|E

25|$|Several {{studies of}} prayer {{effectiveness}} have yielded null results. A 2001 double-blind {{study of the}} Mayo Clinic found {{no significant difference in}} the recovery rates <b>between</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not. Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer. In another similar study published in the American Heart Journal in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer. Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of cardiac bypass patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.|$|E
25|$|Level I is {{typically}} used by non-age-mates and non-intimates and is unmarked {{in terms of}} prefixation or suffixation of the listener and verbs. Level II is marked by the prefix on- on the verb and is used between intimates. Some Nahuatl speakers have been observed to alternate between Level I and Level II for one listener. The use of both levels is believed to show some respect or to not subordinate the listener. Level III is marked by the prefix on-, the reflexive prefix mo-, and an appropriate transitivizing suffix based on the verb stem. Verbs in Level III may additionally be marked with the reverential suffix –tzinōa. Finally, Level IV {{is typically}} used <b>between</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> share a ritual kinship relationship (e.g. parent with godparent, godparent with godparent of the same child). Level IV {{is marked by a}} proclitic (i.e. word that depends on the following word and works similarly to an affix, such as the word “a” or “an” in English) ma. Another important aspect of Level IV is that it addresses the listener in 3rd person whereas Level I through III all use 2nd person forms. By using this 3rd person form, maximal social distance is achieved.|$|E

He {{considered}} this indicative of a [...] "deep and unsensational acceptance of death" [...] in Japanese culture, one which is to be met not with extreme sorrow, but with contemplation. Takita stated that he intended to focus on the [...] "dialogue <b>between</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have passed away and the families that survive them".

500|$|In {{response}} to the season premiere, Oscar Dahl of Buddytv.com noted the predictability of the series, but expressed hope in its further development, by stating {{that it has become}} [...] "a medical chick flick, but a damn good one" [...] with a big and attractive cast. He also praised the interaction between the characters, noting the [...] "smart" [...] dialogue that helps each character evolve. However, Dahl expressed disappointment in the over emotional scenes, describing them as [...] "off-putting" [...] and [...] "not believable", while comparing them to real life interactions <b>between</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> emote in a more subtle manner than displayed on television. [...] "Emotions ran high in the premiere and there was much crying", stated Dahl, but noted that the dialogue, who he had previously been worried would be [...] "too cutesy", was not bothering, and rather realistic, noting how the show is [...] "smartly written".

500|$|Users {{having a}} {{pleasant}} experience can {{feel a sense}} of connection to others, nature, and the universe; other perceptions and emotions are also often intensified. Users having an unpleasant experience (a [...] "bad trip") describe a reaction accompanied by fear, other unpleasant feelings, and occasionally by dangerous behavior. In general, the phrase [...] "bad trip" [...] is used to describe a reaction that is characterized primarily by fear or other unpleasant emotions, not just transitory experience of such feelings. A variety of factors may contribute to a psilocybin user experiencing a bad trip, including [...] "tripping" [...] during an emotional or physical low or in a non-supportive environment (see: set and setting). Ingesting psilocybin in combination with other drugs, including alcohol, can also increase the likelihood of a bad trip. Other than the duration of the experience, the effects of psilocybin are similar to comparable dosages of LSD or mescaline. However, in the Psychedelics Encyclopedia, author Peter Stafford noted, [...] "The psilocybin experience seems to be warmer, not as forceful and less isolating. It tends to build connections <b>between</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> are generally much more in communication than when they use LSD." ...|$|E

500|$|Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV had a {{generally}} mixed to positive {{perspective on the}} episode, expressing hope in its further development. Although originally criticizing the predictability of the event, Dahl noted an [...] "undeniable sense of originality", deeming the episode a portal to the series becoming [...] "a medical chick flick, but a damn good one". Highly praising the [...] "big and attractive" [...] cast, Dahl positively received {{the interaction between the}} characters, noting the [...] "smart" [...] dialogue that helps each character evolve.

He also described the Pompeo and Heigl's as [...] "worthy of attention". After the episode's broadcast, Robert Rorke of the New York Post deemed Stevens [...] "the heart and soul" [...] of the series, due to the episode mostly focusing on the events that come to define her as a person. Rorke named her the show's heroine, and wrote that [...] "Izzie is a welcome, calming presence, despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fiance Denny Duquette", considering her to have been more prominent than the title character, Grey, whose storyline received negative critiques: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmeas. But lately, she's been a little dopey, with that endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Abigail Chao of Television Without Pity had a positive outlook on the episode. She praised the storyline of Izzie lying on the bathroom floor, describing at as [...] "a perfect opportunity for flashbacks", which proved the strong friendship the five interns share. Montgomery's reaction to the discovery of Grey's underwear was deemed by Chao [...] "hilarious", whereas Bailey's interaction with the quarantined patient was described as [...] "touching". [...] "Now it's Meredith's turn to be feckless and indecisive", stated Chao, noting the lack of realism in Grey's love triangle with Shepherd and Dandridge. However, she praised the interaction of the three characters, who she deemed [...] "lovely adolescents".|$|E

2500|$|Though neuroimaging {{studies have}} not yet found {{specific}} neural correlates, there is much evidence that the brains of adults who stutter differ from the brains of adults who do not stutter.
