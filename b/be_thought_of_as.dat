5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion {{of the relationship between}} the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers can <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E
5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms {{have tended to be}} replaced with other terms. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system can <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E

5|$|Symmetry {{groups are}} groups {{consisting}} of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, {{such as the}} introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory can <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern {{is connected to the}} structure of the object being acted on.|$|E
5|$|The monarchy fell at a {{point when}} it had reached its highest {{popularity}} among Brazilians, {{due in part to}} the abolition of slavery on 13 May 1888.

He continued to <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a national symbol, the Father of the People personified. This view was even stronger among those of African descent, who equated the monarchy with freedom. The afro-Brazilians demonstrated their feeling of loyalty towards the monarch in subtle ways, such as by having the Imperial Crown tattooed on their bodies.|$|E

5|$|His wife {{of nearly}} half a century, Elizabeth, to whom {{he had not been}} faithful, died in 1971. Brundage had once jested that his {{ambition}} was to wed a German princess. In June 1973, this came to pass when he married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss (1936–2003), daughter of HeinrichXXXVII, Prince of Reuss-Köstritz. Von Reuss had worked as an interpreter during the Munich Games; she stated that she had met Brundage in 1955, when she was 19. When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year difference in their ages, Brundage responded that he was young for his age and she mature for hers, and instead of 85 years to 37, it should <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage's death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage's fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could be deemed investments.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter can <b>be</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>as</b> a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E
