In their place, on the Natural Ergonomic 7000 keyboard, resides the <b>battery</b> <b>indicator</b> light.|$|E
50|$|Digital Camera Review {{says that}} the camera is good overall, but not a must-have for enthusiasts and Nikon fans. In the article it is stated that the J1 and V1 {{are not meant to}} replace DSLRs but are meant for users who wish to take {{pictures}} at any moment without having to resort to many lenses and a large-bodied DSLR. The review advises users to have a spare battery on hand for a full day of shooting and be wary when the <b>battery</b> <b>indicator</b> gets to a single segment.

50|$|The Galaxy Note 7 was {{subsequently}} re-issued with batteries {{supplied by the}} Chinese company Amperex Technology Limited (which also serves as the main battery supplier for the iPhone line). These replacement models, which Samsung purportedly classified as being safe, had a prominent marking on their packaging to distinguish them from {{the first wave of}} recalled units, and render all software <b>battery</b> <b>indicators</b> with green icons. Samsung was granted special permission by Google to allow this change, as it would normally violate the requirements of the Android Compatibility Definition Document (which must be met to license Google Mobile Services software and Android trademarks) for all status bar icons to only be rendered in white. Following the announcement of the recall, Verizon Wireless released a software update to Galaxy Note 7 units purchased from the carrier, which displays the aforementioned green icons on safe devices, and an embedded recall notice on affected devices when the device is plugged in. Unlike the South Korean update, it does not include a charging cut-off.|$|R

40|$|Mobile phone {{users have}} to deal with limited battery {{lifetime}} through a reciprocal process we call human-battery interaction (HBI). We conducted three user studies in order to understand HBI and discover the problems in existing mobile phone designs. The studies include a large-scale international survey, a onemonth field data collection including quantitative battery logging and qualitative inquiries from ten mobile phone users, and structured interviews with twenty additional mobile phone users. We evaluated various aspects of HBI, including charging behavior, <b>battery</b> <b>indicators,</b> user interfaces for power-saving settings, user knowledge, and user reaction. We find that mobile phone users can be categorized into two types regarding HBI and often have inadequate knowledge regarding phone power characteristics. We provide qualitative and quantitative evidence that problems in state-of-the-art user interfaces has led to underutilized power-saving settings, under-utilized battery energy, and dissatisfied users. Our findings provide insights into improving mobile phone design for users to effectively deal with the limited battery lifetime. Our work is the first to systematically address HBI on mobile phones and is complementary to the extensive research on energy-efficient design for a longer battery lifetime.
