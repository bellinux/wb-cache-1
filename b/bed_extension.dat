40|$|A {{system of}} normal faults with similar strike that bound rotated {{blocks in the}} Sierra de San Miguelito, central Mexico, was studied to {{determine}} the genesis of rotation and to estimate the extensional strain. We show that rigid-body rotation was not the main deformation mechanism of the domino faults in this region. We propose vertical or inclined shear accommodated by slip on minor faults as the mechanism for strain in the blocks. In order to test quantitatively the amount of strain, we calculated the extension assuming vertical shear obtaining ca. ev ~ 0. 20. This value is in good agreement with extensions previously reported for the Mesa Central of México. The <b>bed</b> <b>extension</b> required in this model reaches ca. 33 % of the total horizontal extension (i. e. ebed = 0. 34 ev). Assuming self-similar geometry for fault displacements, it is shown that bed strain required in shear models can be liberated by the small faults. If the strain is calculated using the rigid-body rotation model, the lengthening is underestimated by up to 9 %. This case study shows that shear models could be applied in volcanic zones...|$|E
40|$|The {{retention}} of gas within corroded magnox sludge waste at Sellafield, UK and secondary reprocessing waste at Hanford, USA has significant economic and safety implications for decommissioning various nuclear legacy buildings, including the magnox swarf storage silos and first generation magnox storage pond. A series of laboratory scale gas retention tests within magnesium hydroxide soft sediments have revealed a 4 - 51 Pa yield stress range where consolidated beds could retain sufficient gas to become buoyant {{with respect to}} a water supernatant. Density inversion could lead to a Rayleigh-Taylor style instability which could result in an upward transfer of radioactive material from the consolidated bed. The applicable yield stress range suggests that such rollover events may occur in weaker sediment than previously hypothesized, based on current understanding of the fluidization and stable channel mechanisms for gas release from weak and very strong sediments respectively. Xray computed tomography images of gas retained by 7 Pa yield stress soft sediment reveal both a stable foam layer {{at the top of the}} bed and regions dense with microbubbles which could provide pathways for gas transport through the <b>bed.</b> <b>Extension</b> of these pathways, hidden below the surface of the sediment, to the container walls and the foam layer could represent a novel mechanism for gas release from intermediate strength sediments of < 100 Pa yield stress...|$|E
40|$|No Riacho dos Padres na Chácara Evíssima, numa microempresa de agronegócio com criação de peixes e animais domésticos, área de lazer e salão de eventos, localizada na Região Metropolitana de Curitiba, os simulídeos em grande proliferação causaram sério impacto com as picadas a tal ponto que dificultaram o convívio habitual. De janeiro a agosto de 2002, coletou-se 24. 021 pupas por meio das quais foram identificadas as espécies: Simulium inaequale, Simulium perflavum, Simulium pertinax com 85, 98 % e Simulium orbitale, Simulium subnigrum, Simulium distinctum e Simulium incrustatum com somente 14, 02 % de freqüência. O combate a estas populações iniciado em 28 de fevereiro terminou em 08 de agosto de 2002. O controle integrado consistiu na aplicação de biopesticida Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) e em manejos mecânicos não só removendo os imaturos (ovos, larvas e pupas) por meio de escovação de vertedouros, mas também pela retirada de substratos naturais e antrópicos do leito. A densidade larvária média inicial, antes da aplicação de Bti no leito do riacho (75 m) e no último vertedouro, verificada em substratos antrópicos fitilhos (área 13. 500 cm²), foi de 6, 7 e 11, 5 larvas/cm², respectivamente. Nestes habitats, o controle integrado com Bti de 1, 77 a 2, 09 mg/litro do ingrediente ativo, suplementado com manejos mecânicos, monitorado em substratos fitilhos (área 20. 250 cm²), resultou em redução larvar de 72, 61 % a 99, 97 % e de 74, 91 % a 99, 45 %, respectivamente, nas vazões de 0, 39 a 0, 45 e de 0, 38 a 0, 43 m³/min. No primeiro vertedouro (área 5. 110 cm²), porém, só com manejos mecânicos, atingiu-se a redução larvária de 53, 81 % a 99, 59 %. O controle efetuado reduziu as picadas hematófagas ao nível esperado, surtindo o efeito positivo almejado. At Riacho dos Padres, Chácara Evíssima, a small {{agribusiness}} venture featuring fish, {{poultry and}} cattle farming; a recreation outdoor facility and Event Hall, ubicated in Curitiba's Metropolitan Area, simuliid populations boast high proliferation rates, delivering serious impact to local {{people with their}} noxious bites, {{to such an extent}} as to impair the daily meetings of people. From January to August 2002, 24, 021 pupae were collected from which the following species and respective frequencies were identified: Simulium inaequale (55. 24 %), Simulium perflavum (16. 81 %), Simulium pertinax (13. 93 %), Simulium orbitale (8. 03 %), Simulium subnigrum (4. 92 %), Simulium distinctum (1. 03 %) and Simulium incrustatum (0. 04 %). Local pest control measures were carried out from the February 28 to August 8, 2002. Main integrated pest control measures taken consisted in the application of biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) and mechanical handling, not only by removing the immatures (eggs, larvae and pupae) by means of drain brushing, but also by removing natural and artificial substrates from the bed. Larval mean density, monitored at artificial polythene strips substrates (area 13, 500 cm²), averaged 6. 7 and 11. 5 larvae/cm² before the application of Bti at the creek <b>bed</b> <b>extension</b> 75 m and on the dam spillway, respectively. Larval mass reduction at creek bed and at the spillway with application of Bti from 1. 77 to 2. 09 mg/litre of active ingredient for one minute exposure time and means of mechanical handlings monitored at polythene strips substrates (area 20, 250 cm²) varied, respectively from 72. 61 % to 99. 97 % and from 74. 91 % to 99. 45 with outflows from 0. 39 to 0. 45 and from 0. 38 to 0. 43 m³/minute. At the one of the dam spillways with area of 5, 110 cm², average larval density in the first mechanic handling was 10. 27 larvae/cm². However, at this spillway, larval reduction by means of mechanical handlings was from 53. 81 % to 99. 59 %.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{heat conduction}} in granular systems both under static and slow flow conditions {{with and without}} the presence of astagnant interstitial fluid. A novel discrete simulation technique for granular heat transfer, the Thermal Particle Dynamics (TPD) method hasbeen developed. By modeling particle-particle interactions, bed heterogeneities [...] e. g., mechanical and thermal [...] are directly accountedfor and transient temperature distribution are obtained at the particle level. This technique, based on the Discrete Element Method, not onlysheds light on fundamental issues in heat conduction in particulate systems, but also provides a valuable test-bench for existingcontinuous theories. Computational results, as well as supporting experiments coupled with existing theoretical models are used to probethe validity of the proposed simulation technique. Studies on heat conduction through static beds of particles indicate that stress and contact heterogeneities [...] due primarily to theexistence of localized ``chains' of particles which support the majority of an imposed load (stress chains) [...] may cause dramaticchanges {{in the way that}} heat is transported by conduction. It is found that by matching the microstructure of an experimental system onlyqualitatively, quantitatively accurate estimates of effective properties are possible, without requiring adjustable parameters. Onekey result in this study reveals that an important consideration has been missing from previous granular conduction studies [...] the stressdistribution in the particle <b>bed.</b> <b>Extensions</b> of TPD to incorporate the ability to model heat transfer in particulate systems in the presenceof an interstitial fluid indicate that a good qualitative and quantitative agreement between measured and calculated values of theeffective thermal conductivity {{for a wide variety of}} materials in the presence of both liquid and/or gas are possible. Simulation results for slow granular flows [...] e. g., simple shear cell and a rotating drum [...] indicate that in both cases there is anenhancement of the effective thermal conductivity with increase in the shear rate due to enhanced mixing of the particles. These results arein agreement with previous theoretical and experimental investigations. In contrast to the behavior found at high shear rates, where the thermal conductivity is proportional to the shear rate, a complex non-linear relation is found for the effective conductivity in granular flows at low shear rates. This observation has not beenpreviously reported. It is argued that a balance between heat conduction and convection is necessary to explain these observations...|$|R

40|$|The Upper Eocene {{sequence}} of the Buda Hills consists of fluvial and shallow marine conglomerates, sandstones, bioclastic shallow-water limestone, marlstone and pelagic Globigerina marl. The succession illustrates rapid, overall subsidence of the area, from terrestrial environments to bathyal depths. Sedimentation occurred on slopes situated on the flanks of synsedimentary basement antiforms. Vertical growth of antiforms caused progressive tilting of <b>beds,</b> layerparallel <b>extension</b> by boudinage and faulting, and induced redeposition by mass flow. Antiforms are localised in the dextral Budaörs shear zone and in the Buda imbricate stack, which accommodated the dextral displacement.

The morphological expression of the imbricate stack is the SE-facing Buda slope. The Bakony unit, while "escaping" from the Alps, was bordered by a northern sinistral and a southern dextral shear zone.

40|$|Purpose: Given {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in the aging population and the decline in birth rate, {{there is a growing}} demand for telehealth services. For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed {{is an integral part of}} their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes. Methods: The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate. Results: Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described. Conclusion: The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the <b>bed.</b> Future <b>extensions</b> of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|I {{summarise}} observations {{within a}} continuous-discontinuous shear zone {{to discuss the}} local stress and strain conditions experienced within a mixed rheology shear zone undergoing volume loss and deformation approximating simple shear. The Chrystalls Beach Complex, New Zealand, comprises phacoids formed from dismembered <b>beds</b> by layer-parallel <b>extension,</b> enclosed within a relatively incompetent matrix. Local extension is generally subparallel to the regional direction of shortening, and overall it appears that layer-parallel extension is a geometrical necessity in low angle shear zones where significant flattening occurs in response to simple shear accompanied by volume loss. Preferential stress loading of phacoids is predicted by fibre-loading theory, {{and the failure of}} phacoids by brittle fracture is thereby governed by fibre stresses transferred from the matrix. The principal stress orientations in a phacoid are likely rotated relative to the matrix, and either parallel or perpendicular to the phacoid-matrix interface. As preferential loading of phacoids decreases the stress level in the matrix, an increased volume fraction of phacoids increases the strength of the shear zone as a whole. However, only small matrix volume fractions are required for the composite to act nearly as weak as the matrix...|$|R

I at one time imagined that perhaps an immense accumulation of shingle had originally been collected at the foot of the Cordillera; and that this accumulation, when upraised above the level of the sea, had been eaten into and partially spread out (as off the present line of coast); and that the newly-spread out bed had in its turn been upraised, eaten into, and re-spread out; and so onwards, until the shingle, which was first accumulated in great thickness at the foot of the Cordillera, had reached in thinner <b>beds</b> its present <b>extension.</b> By whatever means the gravel formation of Patagonia may have been distributed, the vastness of its area, its thickness, its superficial position, its recent origin, and the great degree of similarity in the nature of its pebbles, all appear to me well deserving the attention of geologists, in relation to the origin of the widely-spread beds of conglomerate belonging to past epochs.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{aimed to}} explore the {{relationships}} between the rock desaturation and the EDZ extension subsequent to the excavation of a century-old tunnel and recent drifts (1996 and 2003) at the Tournemire Underground Research Laboratory. The other objective of this work was {{to assess the impact of}} this desaturation on the hydraulic head profile measured around the tunnel. One section was selected per drift. Two boreholes were realized for each section: parallel and inclined (45 °) with respect to the bedding. For each borehole, we performed on-site drill core mapping, petrophysical measurements and pneumatic and hydraulic tests by means of a Modular Mini-Packer System (MMPS) device. Results indicate that EDZ around drifts is mainly a combination of unloading joints, mimicking the drift shape, and of desaturation cracks, parallel to the <b>bedding.</b> The EDZ <b>extension</b> around the tunnel is twice to three times that of drifts 1996 and 2003 and essentially composed of unloading joints resulting from the mechanical response of the rock. The masonery covering the tunnel walls is assumed to have protected the rock from the seasonal variations of the air humidity, thus limiting (without excluding) the formation of desaturation cracks. The EDZ extension deduced from core mapping is in agreement with that deduced from pneumatic tests with permeabilities several orders of magnitude greater than in the undisturbed zone. Degrees of saturation for the three sections range between 0. 9 and 1 in the EDZ area and reach 1 in the undamaged zone. The head profile deduced from measurements recorded since 2002 indicates the occurrence of sub-atmospheric water pressures with an extension of ca 40 m around the tunnel. We have searched to quantify the impact of the tunnel since its excavation on the degrees of saturation and the hydraulic heads. The simulation was performed by considering, as a first approach, the absence of fracturation in the EDZ area. A constant suction of - 3300 m, deduced from the mean annual values of relative humidity and temperature measured in the tunnel atmosphere since 2002, was applied at the tunnel wall. The degrees of saturation simulated around the tunnel are underestimated in the EDZ area and consistent to experimental data in the unfractured zone. The modelling of hydraulic heads is quite consistent to experimental values in the vertical direction and overestimated in the horizontal direction. This study has demonstrated the role played by fracturation on the distribution of petrophysical parameters and of heads around drifts and the century-old tunnel. It has also demonstrated the necessity of coupling mechanic and hydraulic calculations by considering capillary forces...|$|R
