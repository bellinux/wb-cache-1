5|$|The {{southern}} {{side of the}} massif lies mostly within Italy and is <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> the Val Veny and Val Ferret whose watercourses meet {{just above}} the town of Courmayeur. From Courmayeur these waters flow southwards as the Dora Baltea towards Aosta, eventually joining the Po river. However, the extreme southwestern end of the massif does lie within France and is <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> the Vallée des Glaciers (which connects to the Val Veny over the watershed of the col de la Seigne), and its waters flow southwards towards the Isère river and onwards to the Rhône. The northeastern end of the massif falls within Switzerland, and is <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> a separate valley, confusingly also called Val Ferret, and which separates it from the Pennine Alps further east. Its watercourse, la Dranse de Ferret, flows northwards to join the Rhône at Martigny.|$|E

However, even the graphs of bounded degree, a much stronger requirement than having bounded expansion, can have unbounded book thickness.|$|E

However, no Ontario court is <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> decisions of any British Columbia court and no British Columbia court is <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> decisions of any Ontario court. Nonetheless, decisions made by a province's highest court (provincial Courts of Appeal) are often considered as [...] "persuasive" [...] even though they are not binding on other provinces.|$|R
