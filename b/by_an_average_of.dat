5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E

5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only a few kilometers deep.

When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called cirrostratus.
