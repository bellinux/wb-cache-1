25|$|On 21 May Cruiser was {{south of}} St Abb's Head when at 11a.m. she sighted two luggers further south. Wollaston set off after them, but {{the weather was}} too {{unsettled}} for him to keep them continually in sight. Still, by correctly estimating where they were headed {{he was able to}} catch up by 4:30, only to have a sudden gust of wind take away Cruizers main-top-gallant=mast. Cruizer was not able to catch up with them again until 9p.m. Wollaston was not able to close and lost sight of them again. However, at daylight, as Cruizer was about two or three leagues off Scarborough Castle, Wollaston again sighted one of the luggers about eight miles away. After a six-hour chase, Cruizer captured the privateer, {{which turned out to be}} Deux Freres, Captain Jacques <b>Bellet,</b> 14 guns (12 of which she had thrown overboard during the chase), and 50 men. She was from Calais and had been cruising since 16 April. Captain <b>Bellet</b> informed Wollaston that the second lugger was Tipoo Sahib, of 12 guns. Tipoo Sahib had thrown all her guns and her boat overboard during the chase and had gone either to France or Norway. Wollaston decided that as 26 of his crew were away in prizes, and he had 50 prisoners on board, that he would come into Yarmouth to land the prisoners before returning to his station.|$|E

2500|$|Provence {{has eight}} major wine regions with AOC designations. The Côtes de Provence {{is the largest}} {{followed}} by Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence. Other significant wine regions include Les Baux-de-Provence, Coteaux Varois en Provence, Coteaux de Pierrevert, Bandol, Cassis, <b>Bellet</b> and Palette. Sub-appellations include the Fréjus, La Londe, Pierrefeu and Montagne Sainte-Victoire regions. The Côtes du Luberon AOC in the nearby Vaucluse département is occasionally cited by some sources with Provence due to some similarities in wine style; the appellation is however officially part of the Rhône wine region and its typicity more closely approaches that of its neighbour on its northern border, Côtes de Ventoux AOC, also [...] a Rhône wine. The region has several vin de pays designations, with Bouches-du-Rhône, near Aix-en-Provence, {{being one of the}} most common designations seen abroad.|$|E

He insisted that the heart beating in the Confederate population was a French heart. Adam Gurowski, a Polish-born US citizen working in the US State Department, replied to du <b>Bellet</b> on June 20, 1861 stating that the Confederates were opportunists, [...] "French in Paris and English in the London Times". Du <b>Bellet</b> was highly critical of Edwin de Leon, the Confederacy's unofficial propaganda agent in Europe, who disbursed important sums of money to influence journalists and newspapers to the Southern cause. Regarding De Leon's thirty-two page pamphlet entitled [...] "La Vérité sur les Etats Confédérés d'Amérique" [...] (The Truth on the Confederate States of America), du <b>Bellet</b> mocked its [...] "peculiar style of French, which he thought a bit too Americanized for the tastes of French editors".|$|E
