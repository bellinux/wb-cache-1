25|$|In Denmark, old ballads {{mention a}} closed circle dance which can open into a chain dance. A fresco in Ørslev church in Zealand from about 1400 shows nine people, men and women, dancing in a line. The leader {{and some others}} in the chain carry {{bouquets}} of flowers. In the case of women's dances, there may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who acted as the leader. In Sweden, medieval songs often mentioned dancing. A long chain was formed, with the leader singing the verses and setting the time while the other dancers joined in the chorus.|$|E

25|$|While Ishme-Dagan I {{probably}} was a competent ruler, his brother Yasmah-Adad {{appears to have}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of weak character; something the disappointed father was not above mentioning.

At one point he arranged a political marriage between Yasmah-Adad to Beltum, the princess of his ally in Qatna. Yasmah-Adad already had a leading wife and put Beltum in a secondary position of power. Shamshi-Adad I did not approve and forced his son to keep Beltum in the palace in a leading position.|$|E

25|$|Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasarón (September 7, 1839 – September 30, 1917) was {{a career}} Spanish naval officer who {{commanded}} the restored Kingdom of Spain's Pacific Squadron {{based in the}} Philippines during the Spanish–American War. Considered to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of high ability and experience, he was given what was regarded as an impossible task of defending the Spanish Philippines with antiquated ships and low supplies against the more formidable U.S. Asiatic Squadron. Montojo became known for his defeat at the Battle of Manila Bay (1 May 1898) by U.S. Navy Admiral George Dewey, being a decisive naval battle of the war. After the conflict, the rear admiral was {{held accountable for the}} defeat and was court-martialed, but that was later overturned, though Montojo was still discharged from the Spanish Navy.|$|E

[...] He was [...] "an unlikely character for the lead role in a Federalist attack on Jeffersonian principles."

500|$|According {{to another}} {{view on the}} family's origins, which is championed by historians Camil Mureşanu and Ion-Aurel Pop, Voyk did not migrate from Wallachia, but {{was born in a}} family of Romanian noble knezes from the region of Hátszeg, or Hunyad. They say that Voyk's {{grandfather}} could have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named [...] "Costea", mentioned in a royal charter from 1360, and who fathered a son named Serbe (the name of Voyk's father). According to the charter, Costea and Serbe together established two villages in the region of Hátszeg. Historian Dezső Dümmerth offers a third view of the Hunyadis' ancestry. He said that Voyk was of Romanianized Cuman stock, one of the Wallachian boyars. He attributes Cuman and Tatar ancestry to the Wallachian boyars. Another historian, Miklós Molnár, accepts the Wallachian origin of the family, but also represents a fourth perspective on the origins of the family. He said that they may well have been of Slavic descent. Neither Paul Lendvai nor András Boros-Kazai excluded the possibility of the Hunyadis being of Slavic origin.|$|E
