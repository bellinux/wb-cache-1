5000|$|The name Becel {{originates}} {{from the}} three letter acronym BCL (Blood Cholesterol Lowering). When introduced, the blood cholesterol lowering effect was achieved by modifying the triacylglycerol (TAG) profile of the fat used in the margarine: an increased level of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces the blood cholesterol level. More recently, products were introduced under the [...] "Pro-activ" [...] sub-brand. These products {{are based on the}} effects of plant sterols and sterol esters on blood cholesterol lowering. In recent years the Becel/Flora brand has added cooking oil, pot yogurt and yogurt drinks to the non-margarine products, all of which are designed to help lower blood cholesterol level. This is achieved by a highly increased resorption of <b>beta-sitosterol</b> and other phytosterols which accumulate especially in the intima of blood vessels and may cause arteriosclerotic plaques.

To measure <b>beta-sitosterol</b> content without derivatization, GC-FID was used with 5 -alpha-cholestan- 3 -one as internal standard. To identify terpenoid constituents, GC-MS was used; <b>beta-sitosterol,</b> phytol, lanost- 7 -en- 3 -on, alpha-amyrin, beta-amyrin, and lupeol were identified.

Lipid peroxidation is a process whereby cellular membranes are damaged due to the oxidative deterioration of polyunsaturated lipids, which may lead to cell death and disease in living organisms. Substances such as vitamin E protect cellular membranes against oxidative damage due to their chemical structures. The steroids cholesterol, <b>beta-sitosterol,</b> <b>beta-sitosterol</b> glucoside and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are structurally related to each other. During aging, serum concentrations of DHEA, DHEAS and melatonin decrease, while the concentration of cholesterol tends to increase.

At concentrations lower than the free iron in the reaction mixture, all the steroids investigated decreased lipid peroxidation.

The structures of all the five compounds, isolated {{for the first time}} from this plant were unambiguously established {{on the basis of their}} detailed spectral analysis. The structure of cyclostachine-A (2) was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies and structures of known compounds were confirmed by comparison of their physical and/or chemical data with those reported in the literature, which were in complete agreement. Additionally, the crude extracts as well as the isolated pure compounds were screened for their activity to inhibit TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor-alpha) - induced expression of cell adhesion molecule ICAM- 1 (intercellular adhesion molecule- 1) on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Among all, <b>beta-sitosterol</b> (1) was found to be the most active compound, which was taken for further studies. <b>beta-sitosterol</b> also significantly inhibited the TNFalpha-induced expression of VCAM- 1 and E-selectin, which also play key role in various inflammatory diseases. The functional correlation of cell adhesion molecules inhibition was assessed by cell adhesion assay using human neutrophils. We found that <b>beta-sitosterol</b> significantly blocks the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial monolayer. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of inhibition of cell adhesion molecules, we investigated the status of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and were able to establish that <b>beta-sitosterol</b> significantly blocked the TNFalpha-induced activation of NF-kappaB.

40|$|Mouthpart {{deformation}} in chironomid larvae is {{induced by}} exposure to chemical contaminants and is becoming an established bio-indicator in sediment assessment programmes. However, concentration-response relationships with causal agents have only been established occasionally and with varying success. In this laboratory study, instar II and III larvae were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of lead, mercury and <b>beta-sitosterol.</b> A significant deformation response was induced in the pecten with lead and mercury. Deformation frequencies of the mentum after metal exposures {{were not significantly different}} from the control. Moulting was retarded by both metals and was well correlated with mouthpart deformation. The <b>beta-sitosterol</b> is an endocrine disrupter, which was used to test the hypothetical cause-effect relation between disruption of ecdyson functioning and chironomid deformation. In the present study, exposure to sublethal concentrations of <b>beta-sitosterol</b> did not result in any effect on deformation or moulting. As such, the proposed hypothesis of endocrine disrupters as primary causal agents of chironomid deformation could not be substantiated. Acetone, which was used as a solvent to apply <b>beta-sitosterol</b> caused a significant increase of mentum deformation. The ground filtration paper used as substrate seemed to induce deformities as well. Substrate contamination, acetone and (especially) inbreeding were most probably responsible for the high deformation frequencies in the control conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
