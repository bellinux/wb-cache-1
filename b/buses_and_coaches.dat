5|$|After the 1960s, lack of {{investment}} led to local {{services and the}} station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat of closure. In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and {{been converted into a}} road for the exclusive use of <b>buses</b> <b>and</b> <b>coaches.</b> British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington, and the Aylesbury services would have been taken over by London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1920 the Corporation was {{considering}} the replacement of northern cable tram routes with buses. By the summer of 1921, the number of <b>buses</b> <b>and</b> <b>coaches</b> using The Mound as an interchange was causing concern for the City Magistrates. By May 1921 the department manager was already crediting the buses' contribution to the city's transport system, which at that time also comprised cable and electric trams, for preventing rate relief being necessary. By early 1922 buses had replaced {{a quarter of the}} cable-tram network (approx. 6.2 miles).|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, {{consultations}} {{began on}} another charging scheme {{for motor vehicles}} entering London. Under this new scheme, a daily charge would {{be applied to the}} vehicles responsible for most of London's road traffic emissions, commercial vehicles—such as lorries, <b>buses,</b> <b>and</b> <b>coaches,</b> with diesel engines. Cars were explicitly excluded. The objective of the new scheme is to help London meet its European Union (EU) air pollution obligations—specifically the —as part of the Mayor's programme to make London the greenest city in the world.

25|$|The {{government}} accepted {{these proposals}} and, on 1 October 1935, the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board (NIRTB) {{came into being}} and absorbed <b>buses</b> <b>and</b> <b>coaches</b> from the three railway companies. The NCC handed over 131 buses and 56 lorries together with operating and maintentance staff, the Smithfield bus station in Belfast and other facilities. A joint NCC/NIRTB passenger timetable was issued from 1 October and it was arranged that the NIRTB could continue to use the former NCC bus and lorry facilities at railway stations. However, the hoped for co-operation between road and rail failed to materialise and the new board appeared to be only interested in co-ordinating road transport to better compete with the railways. There were complaints from the public that the NIRTB's rates were higher and its services poorer than those previously provided.|$|E
25|$|For the {{standard}} LH the 41-seat Plaxton coach and 43-seat ECW bus were most widely used; the bus bodies manufactured in Belfast by Alexander for Ulsterbus had 45 seats, East Midland Motor Services' ten 1969 buses {{were the only}} ones with Willowbrook bodies, as built they had 45 seats but with a 3+2 seating arrangement in three rows forward of the rear bench, making room for a pram pen, they were also unusual in carrying no grille badge, which puzzled the author of this sentence when he first came across a seemingly unidentifiable bus as a schoolboy in the mid 1970s. The LHS was produced as both <b>buses</b> <b>and</b> <b>coaches</b> with 26 to 35 seats. The LHL had up to 53 seats as a coach or 55 as a bus. Between 1975 and 1982 Vanplan built eight with delivery van bodies.|$|E
25|$|The loss of {{materiel}} on {{the beaches}} was huge. The British Army left enough equipment behind to fit out about eight to ten divisions. Discarded in France were, among other things, huge supplies of ammunition, 880 field guns, 310 guns of large calibre, some 500 anti-aircraft guns, about 850 anti-tank guns, 11,000 machine guns, nearly 700 tanks, 20,000 motorcycles and 45,000 motor cars and lorries. Army equipment available at home was only just sufficient to equip two divisions. The British Army needed months to re-supply properly and some planned introductions of new equipment were halted while industrial resources concentrated on making good the losses. Officers told troops falling back from Dunkirk to burn or otherwise disable their trucks (so as not to let them benefit the advancing German forces). The shortage of army vehicles after Dunkirk was so severe that the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) was reduced to retrieving and refurbishing obsolete <b>buses</b> <b>and</b> <b>coaches</b> from British scrapyards to press them into use as troop transports. Some of these antique workhorses were still in use {{as late as the}} North African campaign of 1942.|$|E

25|$|There {{was only}} one mass-produced {{derivative}} of the PS1, this was the coach variant with drop-frame extension for a luggage boot. This was coded PS1/1, and {{was a very strong}} seller, forming the major postwar fleet renewals for large UK coach firms such as Southdown Motor Services, Ribble, Wallace Arnold, Grey-Green and Barton Transport. Sales of the PS1 only ended in 1950 although it was nominally replaced by the PS2 on the home market from 1948, this gives an idea of the scale of advance orders for this coach. Many coachbuilers worldwide produced bodies on the Tiger PS, as the model was introduced at the all-time peak in demand for new <b>buses</b> <b>and</b> <b>coaches</b> few operators could get the body of their first choice within an acceptable time. Barton got most of its coaches fitted with Duple bodies but built its own body for its 490 (HVO729), to an American outline with shallow full-depth sliding side glazing. Wallace Arnold bought over a Leeds coachbuilder, Wilks and Meade, in 1942 to get enough bodies reserved for postwar reconstruction. Between 1946 and 1950 Wallace Arnold took 37 PS1, 11 PS2, 34 Bedford OB, 24 AEC Regals, ten Daimler CVD6 and one Guy Arab, a fairly typical sample of coach-buying preferences at the time. Southdown used six coachbuiilders on its all-Tiger coach fleet. Whilst Ribble refitted its later prewar Tiger coaches (which had previously been petrol-engined) with PS1 running units as well as taking PS1/1s.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s the company {{introduced}} a renovated JL heavy and medium duty trucks range with a revised design, new <b>buses</b> <b>and</b> <b>coaches</b> and, in 1964, a S range of medium duty trucks (with Renault and Perkins engines), unveiled at the Paris Motor Show. [...] In January 1961, Saviem {{took control of}} the bus manufacturer Floirat, based at Annonay. That year, Saviem signed a cooperation agreement with Henschel-Werke. In 1962, Pierre Dreyfus decided to expand the European partnerships of Saviem and the company received a large capital amount from the French State for recapitalisation and modernisation. It also got the Limoges factory, which manufactured diesel engines. Between 1963 and 1966, Saviem moved most of its production from the Paris area to Blainville-sur-Orne and Annonay. In 1967, the Blainville-sur-Orne factory produced 26,000 large goods vehicles and the Annonay factory 1,777 buses/coaches. In 1965, Saviem acquired the French heavy equipment manufacturer Richard-Continental in a bid to compete with Caterpillar.|$|E
