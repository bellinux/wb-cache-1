40|$|In 2004 / 05, all European Union {{member states}} were {{required}} to carry out standardised prevalence surveys to establish the baseline prevalence of Salmonella in commercial laying flocks. As part of the survey in Great Britain, additional {{data were collected from}} 380 of the enrolled laying hen holdings to investigate risk factors for Salmonella at farm level. Stratified, simple random sampling was used to select holdings from which dust and <b>boot</b> <b>swab</b> samples were collected and tested for Salmonella using a modification of ISO 6579 : 2002. Using a multivariable logistic model weighted to account for the survey design, several factors significantly associated with Salmonella and Salmonella Enteritidis status were identified.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} antimicrobial resistance among commensal Escherichia coli isolates on household and small-scale chicken farms, common in southern Vietnam, and to investigate the association of antimicrobial resistance with farming practices and antimicrobial usage. Methods: We collected data on farming and antimicrobial usage from 208 chicken farms. E. coli was isolated from <b>boot</b> <b>swab</b> samples using MacConkey agar (MA) and MA with ceftazidime, nalidixic acid or gentamicin. Isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials and for ESBL production. Risk factor analyses were carried out, using logistic regression, at both the bacterial population and farm levels. Results: E. coli resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins was detected on 201 (96. 6 %), 191 (91. 8 %) and 77 (37. 0 %) of the farms, respectively. Of the 895 E. coli isolates, resistance to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins was detected in 178 (19. 9 %), 291 (32. 5 %) and 29 (3. 2 %) of the isolates, respectively. Ciprofloxacin resistance {{was significantly associated with}} quinolone usage (OR =  2. 26) and tetracycline usage (OR =  1. 70). ESBL-producing E. coli were associated with farms containing fish ponds (OR =  4. 82). Conclusions: Household and small farms showed frequent antimicrobial usage associated with a high prevalence of resistance to the most commonly used antimicrobials. Given the weak biocontainment, the high prevalence of resistant E. coli could represent a risk to the environment and to humans...|$|E
40|$|Resistances against {{antibiotics}} {{represent a}} growing challenge for {{both human and}} veterinary medicine around the globe. Plasmid-transmitted beta lactamases play {{a pivotal role in}} the development of resistances against beta-lactam antibiotics in Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterial synthesis of hydrolases with the capability of cleaving the beta lactam ring and thereby enzymatically inactivating beta lactam antibiotics is one of the most common bacterial antibiotic resistance mechanisms. In this context, a subgroup of beta lactameses termed 'extended spectrum beta lactamases' (ESBL) are of particular relevance, as they are capable of dramatically reducing the efficacy even of modern extended-spectrum cephalosporine und monobactame antibiotics. In recent years, increasing evidence of ESBLs have been described worldwide. Studies have reported of ESBL - producing E. coli, and other enterobacteriaceae; in healthy livestock in Europe. inter alia, in healthy broilers. In addition, resistant bacteria have been found in end products and foods such as meat, fish and raw milk. Due to the limited data available on the presence and potential distribution of 'ESBLs/AmpCs' in humans, animals and foods in Germany, the collaborative project RESET was launched, which is financed by assets from the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). In this project, research groups from the fields of veterinary and human medicine have collected and are continuing to collect (during a second promotion period) substantial amounts of data on the dissemination of ESBLs in the food chain. As one aspect of the RESET collaboration, the main focus of the work presented here was the analysis of the detection frequency of ESBL/AmpC - producing E. coli in conventional broiler fattening farms in Germany throughout the entire fattening period. In particular, it was the aim to achieve new insights into the colonization dynamic of the resistant bacteria as well as their distribution in the broiler fattening farm houses. An additional focus was the analysis of a variety of transmission pathways of ESBL/AmpC- producing Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli, from broiler fattening farms to the surrounding environment or vice versa. In initial investigations, the ESBL/AmpC - status of 16 broiler fattening farms was determined using <b>boot</b> <b>swab</b> samples. Of these 16 farms, seven ESBL/AmpC - positive broiler fattening farms were included in the long-term study on the prevalence and transmission of resistant microorganisms which is presented here. To determine the detection frequencies of ESBL/AmpC - producing E. coli in broiler fattening farms during the course of the fattening period, extensive measurements and sample collections from animals, their surroundings, the stable air and exhaust as well as the stable surroundings were carried out in each of the examined broiler fattening farms on three occasions during the fattening period (beginning, middle and end). Moreover, impingement was used to determine the presence of ESBLproducing E. coli and other microorganisms in the stable air and exhaust in order to identify potential emission pathways of ESBL/AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli, from animal farms into the environment. In doing so, the air samples from outside animal housings as well as the floor samples from the direct stable surroundings were collected in dependence of the respective wind direction. In addition, slurry samples were collected directly from the slurry pit and examined for ESBL/AmpC - E. coli. All suspected ESBL/AmpC- producing colonies isolated from MacConkey agar, containing antibiotics, gathered from these samples were identified as E. coli using MALDI-TOF and subsequently confirmed as carriers of an ESBL gene or plasmid-coded AmpC gene using PCR. In addition, selected isolates from the stable surroundings and the stable were analyzed for clonal relation using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). As a first result it should be emphasized that, at every sampling occasion, there was at least one sample from each broiler fattening farm where ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli were identified and their resistance genes could be identified using PCR. Moreover, the resistant microorganisms were regularly found in the stable air, e. g. in dust or litter, as well as on the floor of the stable surroundings, the slurry and the stable air and exhaust. The detection frequencies of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in animals, from each 20 swab samples from individual animals per farm varied between 0 % and 100 %. Nevertheless, the results of our work show that ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli are regularly present in cloacal swabs of clinically healthy broilers as well as their stable surroundings. In addition, high prevalences of the resistant microorganisms could even be found in day-old chicks. Moreover, our results are the first report of a significant increase of the detection frequency of resistant bacteria during the course of the fattening period. This increase in prevalence was shown during the whole fattening period in samples from individual animals as well as in samples from the animal's surroundings. Therefore, apart from the possible entry via positive day-old chicks, the current results demonstrate an influence of the stable environment on the ESBL/AmpC status of a broiler flock. As a further main result, these work strengthen the hypothesis of fecal and aerogenic dissemination from broiler farms into the environment, as PFGE analyses showed clonal matching between different isolates from inside and outside the animal housings. PFGE shows results of restriction profile analyses with 86. 3 % to 100 % clonal matching of isolates from the stables (air and slurry) in comparison to isolates from the stable surroundings. Based on these results, it can be concluded that fecal and aerogenic emission of ESBL/AmpCproducing E. coli from broiler fattening farms through, among others, distribution of contaminated slurry and stable exhaust is highly probable. However, the results of this work do not exclude that there may also be an influx of the resistant microorganisms...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the prevalence, diversity, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and associated risk factors on 341 pig, chicken, and duck farms in Dong Thap province (Mekong Delta, Vietnam). Sampling was stratified by species, district (four categories), and farm size (three categories). Pooled faeces, collected using <b>boot</b> <b>swabs,</b> were tested using ISO 6575 : 2002 (Annex D). Isolates were serogrouped; group B isolates were tested by {{polymerase chain reaction}} to detect S. Typhimurium and (monophasic) serovar 4,[5], 12 :i:- variants. The farm-level adjusted NTS prevalence was 64 · 7 %, 94 · 3 % and 91 · 3 % for chicken, duck and pig farms, respectively. Factors independently associated with NTS were duck farms [odds ratio (OR) 21 · 2], farm with > 50 pigs (OR 11 · 9), pig farm with 5 - 50 pigs (OR 4 · 88) (vs. chickens), and frequent rodent sightings (OR 2 · 3). Both S. Typhimurium and monophasic S. Typhimurium were more common in duck farms. Isolates had a high prevalence of resistance (77 · 6 %) against tetracycline, moderate resistance (20 - 30 %) against chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ampicillin and nalidixic acid, and low resistance (< 5 %) against ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins. Multidrug resistance (resistance against ⩾ 3 classes of antimicrobial) was independently associated with monophasic S. Typhimurium and other group B isolates (excluding S. Typhimurium) and pig farms. The unusually high prevalence of NTS on Mekong Delta farms poses formidable challenges for control...|$|R
40|$|Exclusion of broiler batches, highly colonized with Campylobacter (> 7. 5 log(10) colony-forming units/g), {{from the}} {{fresh poultry meat}} market might {{decrease}} the risk of human campylobacteriosis. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare different sample types (both at the farm and the slaughterhouse) and methods (direct culture, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction [qPCR], propidium monoazide [PMA]-qPCR) applied for the quantification of the Campylobacter colonization level. In addition, the applicability of the lateral flow-based immunoassay, Singlepath((R)) Direct Campy Poultry test (Singlepath((R)) test), was evaluated as a rapid method for the qualitative detection of Campylobacter in highly colonized broiler batches. Campylobacter counts differed significantly between sample types collected at farm level (cecal droppings, feces, <b>boot</b> <b>swabs)</b> and at slaughterhouse level (cecal content, fecal material from crates). Furthermore, comparison of Campylobacter counts obtained by different methods (direct culture, qPCR, PMA-qPCR) in cecal droppings revealed significant differences, although this was not observed for cecal-content samples. Evaluation of the Singlepath((R)) test on cecal droppings and cecal-content samples revealed an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, cecal droppings and cecal content are proposed as the most representative sample types for quantification of Campylobacter colonization level of broilers at farm and slaughterhouse, respectively. Direct culture and qPCR are equally sensitive for quantification of Campylobacter in fresh cecal-content samples. PMA treatment before qPCR inhibits the signal from dead Campylobacter cells. Consequently, when samples are extensively stored and/or transported, qPCR is preferred to direct culture and PMA-qPCR. Furthermore, the Singlepath((R)) test offers a convenient alternative method for rapid detection of Campylobacter in highly colonized broiler batches...|$|R
40|$|Salmonellosis is {{a public}} health concern in both the {{developed}} and developing countries. Although the majority of human non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica (NTS) cases {{are the result of}} foodborne infections or person-to-person transmission, NTS infections may also be acquired by environmental and occupational exposure to animals. While a considerable number of studies have investigated the presence of NTS in farm animals and meat/carcasses, very few studies have investigated the risk of NTS colonization in humans as a result of direct animal exposure. We investigated asymptomatic NTS colonization in 204 backyard chicken farms, 204 farmers and 306 matched individuals not exposed to chicken farming, in southern Vietnam. Pooled chicken faeces, collected using <b>boot</b> or handheld <b>swabs</b> on backyard chicken farms, and rectal swabs from human participants were tested. NTS colonization prevalence was 45. 6 %, 4. 4 % and 2. 6 % for chicken farms, farmers and unexposed individuals, respectively. Our study observed a higher prevalence of NTS colonization among chicken farmers (4. 4 %) compared with age-, sex- and location- matched rural and urban individuals not exposed to chickens (2. 9 % and 2. 0 %). A total of 164 chicken NTS strains and 17 human NTS strains were isolated, and 28 serovars were identified. Salmonella Weltevreden was the predominant serovar in both chickens and humans. NTS isolates showed resistance (20 - 40 %) against tetracycline, chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and ampicillin. Our study reflects the epidemiology of NTS colonization in chickens and humans in the Mekong delta of Vietnam and emphasizes the need of larger, preferably longitudinal studies to study the transmission dynamics of NTS between and within animal and human host populations...|$|R
