5|$|The Assemblies of God has {{released}} statements on various issues not {{addressed in the}} Statement of Fundamental Truths. These position papers are usually written by the Doctrinal Purity Commission, a standing committee of the General Council, which reviews and responds to issues referred to it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Presbytery. Position papers are not official positions of the Assemblies of God unless recommended <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Presbytery {{and approved by the}} General Council. Position statements touch on biblical, theological, and social concerns.|$|E

5|$|In between General Council sessions, {{approximately}} 300 {{elected representatives}} from the various districts and foreign mission areas meet as the General Presbytery. When the General Council is not in session, the General Presbytery acts as the official policy-making body of the Assemblies of God. A 20-member Executive Presbytery, led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Leadership Team, meets bimonthly and functions as the Assemblies of God's board of directors. Executive Presbyters are responsible to the General Presbytery and are ex officio members of that body.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom at present, the {{mainstream}} approach towards representative standing is broad and liberal. The {{focus is on}} whether illegality or some other ground of review can be shown, rather than the applicant's relationship to the illegality complained of. If some unlawfulness can be demonstrated, the courts tend to grant a remedy even where the applicant is not directly affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> decision.|$|E
5|$|Institute Professors are {{initially}} {{nominated by}} leaders representing either a department or school. The {{chair of the}} faculty then consults with the Academic Council and jointly appoints with the president an ad-hoc committee from various departments and non-MIT members to evaluate the qualifications and make a documented recommendation to the president. The final determination is made based upon recommendations from professionals in the nominee's field. The case is then reviewed again by the Academic Council and approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Committee of the MIT Corporation.|$|E

5|$|On 24 October, the IMF {{tentatively}} {{agreed to}} lend €1.58 billion. However the loan had still not been approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Board of the IMF on 13 November. Due to the delay Iceland found itself {{caught in a}} classic catch-22 situation, loans from other countries could not be secured until the IMF program had been approved. The Icelandic government spoke of a $500M (€376M) gap in the funding plans. Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos stated that the Netherlands would oppose the loan unless agreement was reached over deposit insurance for Landsbanki customers in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E

50|$|However, {{it turned}} out that the {{response}} documents signed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> were a tactic used to settle the rebellion.

5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> in the exercise of discretion were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E

By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals won by the athletes representing a nation. (In this context, a nation is an entity represented by a NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.|$|E

5|$|After the Acropolis of Athens was {{surrendered}} by the Ottomans in June 1822, Makriyannis {{was appointed}} Supervisor of Public Order {{in the city}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> authority of Roumeli on 1 January 1823. In that office, he took severe measures aimed at stopping arbitrary oppression of the populace and thievery. In the summer of 1823, he fought alongside Nikitaras {{in the eastern part}} of Central Greece. In October 1823, he led a force of Roumeliots in the Peloponnese, and fought alongside the government of Georgios Kountouriotis against the rebels in the civil war. For his actions during that conflict, he was rewarded with the rank of brigadier, promoted to lieutenant general in August 1824 and full general in late 1824.|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{consists}} of five administrative divisions, {{which are in}} turn divided into 25 districts. For each district, the state government appoints a village headman (known as ketua kampung) for each village. The administrative divisions are inherited from the British administration, which are before administered as province. During the British rule, a Resident was appointed to govern each division and provided with a palace (Istana). The post of the Resident was abolished and replaced with district officers {{for each of the}} district when North Borneo became part of Malaysia. As in the rest of Malaysia, local government comes under the purview of state government. However, ever since the suspension of local government elections {{in the midst of the}} Malayan Emergency, which was much less intense in Sabah than it was in the rest of the country, there have been no local elections. Local authorities have their officials appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> council of the state government.|$|E

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the existence of ambiguities in the day-to-day use of smartphones by Brazilian executives. In this manner, fourteen technological paradoxes were identified from the theoretical reference base adopted. The single representative case study method was then applied, by analysing a Brazilian company in the pharmaceutical sector, which has a policy of providing smartphones to its senior executives. After consolidation {{and analysis of the}} data collected, it was seen that of the fourteen paradoxes obtained, two generated strong ambiguity regarding the use of smartphones <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> in question, namely: continuity vs. asynchronicity and autonomy vs. addiction. Furthermore, three other paradoxes were moderately {{associated with the use of}} smartphones <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> in question, namely freedom vs. enslavement...|$|R
5|$|Taiwan's rapid {{economic}} growth during {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century led to saturation of highways, conventional rail, and air traffic systems in the western transport corridor, which threatened to impede further growth. The idea of a new high-speed rail line arose in the 1970s, and informal planning began in 1980. In 1987 the executive branch of Taiwan's government, the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Transportation to launch a feasibility study for a high-speed rail line in the western Taiwan corridor, which was completed in 1990. The study found that in a comparison of potential solutions to traffic problems in the corridor, a high-speed rail line would offer the highest transit volume, lowest land use, highest energy savings, and least pollution. In July 1990 the Preparation Office of High Speed Rail (POHSR) was established and a route was selected in 1991. Plans for the THSR were subsequently approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Executive</b> Yuan in June 1992 and by Taiwan's legislature, the Legislative Yuan, in 1993.|$|E
