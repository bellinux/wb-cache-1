5|$|Most <b>bovids</b> are diurnal. Social {{activity}} and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk. <b>Bovids</b> typically rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. They have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. <b>Bovids</b> use {{different forms of}} vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. Most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day. While small <b>bovids</b> forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed on high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands. Most <b>bovids</b> are polygynous. Mature <b>bovids</b> mate {{at least once a}} year and smaller species may even mate twice. In some species, neonate <b>bovids</b> remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers; in other species, neonates are followers, accompanying their dams, rather than tending to remain hidden.|$|E
5|$|All <b>bovids</b> {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most <b>bovids</b> exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized <b>bovids.</b> All <b>bovids</b> have four toes on each foot â€“ they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bovids</b> show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male <b>bovids</b> have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most <b>bovids</b> bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E

The age of the fossil <b>bovid</b> teeth was determined using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis {{as part of an effort}} to bracket the age of the hominid tooth. The EPR-derived age of the <b>bovid</b> teeth is (5. 16 {+-} 2. 01) x 10 {sup 5 } years. However, the age estimate reported here is likely an underestimate of the actual age of deposition since evidence of heating was detected in the EPR spectra of the <b>bovid</b> teeth, and the heating may have caused a decrease in the intensity of EPR components on which the age calculation is based...|$|R
5|$|Most <b>bovids</b> {{alternately}} {{feed and}} ruminate throughout the day. While those that feed on concentrates feed and digest in short intervals, the roughage feeders take longer intervals. Only small {{species such as}} the duiker browse {{for a few hours}} during day or night. Feeding habits are related to body size; while small <b>bovids</b> forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed upon high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} diversities of <b>bovids</b> {{occur in}} Africa. The maximum concentration of species {{is in the}} savannas of eastern Africa. Other bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Bovidae includes {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats. Dairy products such as milk, butter, and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle. <b>Bovids</b> also provide leather, meat, and wool.|$|E
5|$|All <b>bovids</b> mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most <b>bovids.</b> As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in <b>bovids,</b> with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all <b>bovids</b> can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, around 10 Mya, the <b>bovids</b> rapidly diversified, {{leading to the}} {{creation}} of 70 new genera. This late Miocene radiation was partly because many <b>bovids</b> became adapted to more open, grassland habitats. The Aepycerotinae first appeared in the late Miocene, and {{no significant difference in the}} sizes of the primitive and modern impala has been noted. Fossils of obivines, a tribe of Caprinae, in Africa date back to the late Miocene. The earliest Hippotragine fossils date back to the late Miocene, and were excavated from sites such as Lothagam and Awash Valley. The first African fossils of Reduncinae date back to 6-7 Mya. Reduncinae and Peleinae probably diverged in the mid-Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>bovids</b> are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small <b>bovids.</b> The time taken for the attainment of sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among <b>bovids.</b> Sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity. The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction within a year or two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} of <b>bovids</b> {{has contributed}} in shifting {{the dependence of}} human beings from hunting and gathering to agriculture. The Bovidae include {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats; all are from Eurasia, and are now found across the world. The other two species are the horse and pig. Other large <b>bovids</b> that have been domesticated but which remain within the ranges of their wild ancestors are the water buffalo (from the Indian water buffalo), domestic yak (from the wild yak), zebu (from the Indian aurochs), gayal (from the gaur) and Bali cattle (from the banteng).|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was utilized to localize five bovine DNA probes previously mapped in cattle, to chromosomes of four additional diverse <b>bovid</b> species. These species were {{selected on the basis of}} proposed chromosomal homologies based on similar banding patterns. Localization of these probes by FISH tested the validity of using interspecific band-based chromosome homologies as assessments of genic homology. All five probes localized to their predicted interspecific homologs, verifying a correlation between banding and genic homology for these loci. Similar FISH techniques were used to hybridize five bovine satellite DNA family probes and one telomeric probe to a distantly related <b>bovid.</b> This expanded our knowledge of <b>bovid</b> comparative chromosomal evolution and organization. Slight differences were noted in hybridization intensity and distribution, which were indicative of interspecific reorganization.

5|$|The middle Miocene {{marked the}} spread of the <b>bovids</b> into China and the Indian subcontinent. According to Vrba, the {{radiation}} of the subfamily Alcelaphinae began {{in the latter part of}} middle Miocene. The Caprinae tribes probably diverged in the early middle Miocene. The Caprini emerged in the middle Miocene, and seem to have been replaced by other <b>bovids</b> and cervids in Eurasia. The earliest fossils of the antilopines are from the middle Miocene, though studies show the existence of the subfamily from the early Miocene. Speciation occurred in the tribe Antilopini during the middle or upper Miocene, mainly in Eurasia. Tribe Neotragini seems to have appeared in Africa by the end of Miocene, and had become widespread by the Pliocene.|$|E
5|$|Excepting some domesticated forms, {{all male}} <b>bovids</b> have horns, {{and in many}} species, females, too, possess horns. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic {{structure}} is a pair of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted, or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Although horns occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species, there are exceptions such as the four-horned antelope and the Jacob sheep. The unique horn structure is the only unambiguous morphological feature of <b>bovids</b> that distinguishes them from other pecorans. A high correlation exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of the individual. For instance, long horns are intended for wrestling and fencing, whereas curved horns are used in ramming. Males with horns directed inwards are monogamous and solitary, while those with horns directed outwards tend to be polygynous. These results were independent of body size.|$|E
5|$|Gestational period varies among <b>bovids</b> - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different <b>bovids</b> have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E

Mathematical post-processing of the spectra employing discriminant analysis provided a useful statistical tool to differentiate tortoiseshell from <b>bovid</b> horn keratin. All keratin standards {{used in this study}} (n 35 Bovidae; n 24 Cheloniidae) were correctly classified with the discriminant analysis.

5000|$|B. latifrons {{reached a}} {{shoulder}} height of 2.5 m {{and may have}} weighed over 2000 kg. It competes with the [...] "giant Africa buffalo" [...] Pelorovis {{for the title of}} largest <b>bovid,</b> and even largest ruminant ever to live, possibly outweighing the extant African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardis). The horns of B. latifrons measured as great as 213 cm from tip to tip, compared with only 66 cm in modern Bison bison. The known dimensions of the species are much larger than any extant <b>bovid,</b> including both extant species of bison â€” the American bison and the European bison. Based on a comparison of limb bones between B. latifrons and B. bison, the mass of the former is estimated to have been 25%50% greater than that of the latter. In fact, B. latifrons is possibly the largest <b>bovid</b> in the fossil record.|$|R
5|$|Most wild <b>bovids</b> {{live for}} 10 to 15 years. Larger species tend to live longer; for instance, American bison can {{live up to}} 25 years and gaur up to 30 years. The mean {{lifespan}} of domesticated individuals is nearly ten years. For example, domesticated goats have an average lifespan of 12 years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bovids</b> have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small <b>bovids</b> such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{techniques}} differ {{amongst the}} bovid families and also {{depend on their}} build. While the hartebeest fight on knees, others usually fight on all fours. Gazelles of various sizes use different methods of combat. Gazelles usually box, and in serious fights may clash and fence, consisting of hard blows from short range. Ibex, goat and sheep males stand upright and clash into each other downwards. Wildebeest use powerful head butting in aggressive clashes. If horns become entangled, the opponents move in a circular manner to unlock them. Muskoxen will ram into each other at high speeds. As a rule, only two <b>bovids</b> of equal build and level of defence engage in a fight, which is intended to determine the superior of the two. Individuals that are evidently inferior to others would rather flee than fight; for example, immature males do not fight with the mature bulls. Generally, <b>bovids</b> direct their attacks on the opponent's head rather than its body. The S-shaped horns, such as those on the impala, have various sections that help in ramming, holding, and stabbing. Serious fights leading to injury are rare.|$|E

5|$|The animal can be host to {{a number}} of {{different}} parasites. In one study, blue wildebeest were found to be hosts to thirteen species of nematode, one trematode, larvae of five oestrid flies, three species of lice, seven ixodid tick species, one mite and the larvae of a tongue worm. Of these, most were more prevalent at some times of the year than others. Generally, the larvae of Gedoelstica and Oestrus occur in the nasal passages and respiratory cavities of the blue wildebeest, and sometimes migrate to the brain. Compared to some other <b>bovids,</b> blue wildebeest are resistant to infestations by several species of tick.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} and both species of black bears {{sometimes}} take large ungulates, such as deer and <b>bovids,</b> mostly {{the young and}} weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on. The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled. Predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.|$|E
5|$|The tiger (Panthera tigris) is {{the largest}} cat species, most {{recognizable}} for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and <b>bovids.</b> They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled {{with the fact that}} they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.|$|E
