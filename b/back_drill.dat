40|$|This MEng (Master of Engineering) {{research}} thesis {{evaluates the}} capabilities {{and limitations of}} line-scan thermography for the non-destructive evaluation of composite structures containing hidden defects. In simple terms, line-scan thermography is a state-of-the-art technique in which a focused line of thermal energy is transmitted into a material. Line-scan thermography has great potential for the rapid and low cost non-destructive inspection of composite structures for aircraft, automobiles and ships. In this project, theoretical research exploring the heat transfer physics was undertaken in conjunction with experimental studies to develop an optimum inspection regime for line-scan thermography. The capability of line-scan thermography to detect impact damage in carbon/epoxy laminates was experimentally investigated in Chapter 3. From the impact side, in all materials, line-sc an thermography overestimated {{the size of the}} impact damage whereas flash thermography underestimated the size. There was a close relationship between the ultrasonic profile and the line-scan thermographic thermal response curve. New experimental data has been produced and analysed for the ability of line-scan thermography to determine the defect as well as the defect size. It was found that line-scan thermography was able to distinguish <b>back</b> <b>drilled</b> holes, but {{it was not possible to}} determine accurate defect sizing due to the depth of the holes from the inspected surface and the limitations associated with the line-scan thermographic apparatus itself. There was excellent correlation between the C-scan ultrasonics intensity curves and the line-scan thermographs as well as excellent correlation with the theoretical results. The relationship between line-scan thermography and foreign body objects were experimentally investigated for carbon/epoxy composites. A major limitation found with line-scan thermography is its limited depth penetration, which is highlighted in the foreign object study using 6 mm and 13 mm diameter Teflon® discs and 13 mm Teflon® strips embedded in carbon/epoxy laminates. Depth penetration allowed only 2 mm resolution for the 13 mm diameter discs and 1. 5 mm resolution for the 6 mm discs in a composite panel. The results of the investigation of stainless steel shim objects in carbon/epoxy laminates reveal that line-scan thermography is capable of determining their presence and size close to the surface. There was also excellent correlation between the ultrasonic response curve and the line-scan thermographic intensity curve. The results of the investigation of thermoplastic film foreign body objects in carbon/epoxy laminates show that at present line-scan thermography does not have the capability to determin e such defects. Experimental results show that line-scan thermography is capable of detecting large voids, <b>back</b> <b>drilled</b> holes, some foreign body objects, and impact damage. However, the ability of line-scan thermography to measure the defect dimensions is dependent on the size and type of damage, the distance from the line source, the depth of the defect, and the type of composite material...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} finding out whether the use of <b>Back</b> Chaining <b>Drills</b> technique in teaching vocabulary can improve cadet’s enthusiasm and cadets’ mastery of IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases. The subjects of this research were 30 cadets of the 3 rd semester of Deck Department of PoliteknikIlmuPelayaran Semarang. The action research was implemented in this research {{and there were two}} cycles. Each cycle consists of planning, acting, observing and reflecting. The data were collected through observation sheet, questionnaire, and test. The data attained from those instruments were analyzed using formula to calculate mean, the improvement of the cadets’ score and questionnaire percentage. The mean score of the first and second cycle are 67. 93 and 76. 6. In the first cycle, though the cadets still confused with the technique introduced but they were happy doing it. By the process, the cadets started to enjoy the activities and asked the researcher to add more phrases to practice. In the second cycle, the cadets were very enthusiastic with the “Back Chaining Drills” activity and they could master more phrases. Hence it can be inferred that there was a big improvement. Cadets’ interest and their attitude about learning SMCP’s in class also improved, while their difficulties in using IMO’s SMCP’s decreased. Thus,it can be concluded that there was improvement of cadets’ practice of IMO SMCP of the 3 rd semester of PoliteknikIlmuPelayaran Semarang by using <b>Back</b> Chaining <b>Drills...</b>|$|R

This testis representative {{of many other}} high-yield tests conducted below the water table in the Pahute Mesa area of the NTS. Since 1976 {{we have been studying}} the movement of test-related radionuclides within a few hundred meters of the explosion cavity. CHESHIRE is the only nuclear test characterized before, immediately after, and for decades following the detonation and provides data on both the prompt and long-term dispersal of radionuclides after an underground nuclear test. For this reason it is a unique field-scale transport experiment. Solid and fluid samples were collected from a <b>drill</b> <b>back</b> hole extending into and through the cavity in order to measure the initial distributions of radionuclides after the detonation. We subsequently pumped and sampled water from the cavity region and from a hydraulically transmissive zone about 400 m higher in the collapse chimney.

40|$|Dual Gradient Drilling is an {{exciting}} technology which promises to solve the current technical hurdles and economic risks of Deepwater Drilling. Several techniques for Dual Gradient Drilling have been proposed to the industry. One such method involves installing a subsea booster pump at the seafloor {{with the aim of}} returning the <b>drilling</b> fluid <b>back</b> to the rig. The pump will manage annular pressures in the wellbore as circulation rates and mud weights vary and will permit early detection of wellbore influxes. Any such pump chosen to achieve this objective will be subjected to very high differential pressures and will be faced with the onerous task of lifting very abrasive and viscous mud slurries from the sea floor <b>back</b> to the <b>drilling</b> rig. This distance in deep water may be well within the range of about 4, 000 ? 12, 000 feet depending on the operating water depth of the rig. Several pump technologies available to the industry were examined. Piston pumps are very efficient and can withstand the high differential pressures encountered in the Mudlift Drilling System. However, their drawbacks are their large size and weight and high initial capital cost and maintenance costs. Centrifugal pumps on the other hand are relatively smaller than piston and diaphragm pumps and are generally less expensive. Disc pumps, with their non-impingement design are able to handle solids and fluids with a high gas volume fraction but, like centrifugal pumps, are generally less efficient than reciprocating pumps. Diaphragm pumps are capable of maintaining a constant rate regardless of pressure fluctuations. They can handle very abrasive solids with limited wear on the pump. They also excel at handling very viscous fluids and they can be modified to handle up to 95 % gas volume fraction. Like piston pumps, they have very high efficiencies. The potential of each of these pump technologies to meet the requirements for the Mudlift Drilling System was examined in this thesis. The benefits and drawbacks of each of these pump technologies were highlighted and modifications {{to meet the demands of}} the mudlift system evaluated...|$|R
50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} a massive drilling machine mounted on a framework {{that is a little}} like a short section of railroad track. At one end of the track, nearest the audience, is a raised frame large enough to hold a person. At the beginning of the performance the drill is positioned {{at the far end of}} the track with its long helical drill bit pointing horizontally forwards. The performer is chained to the frame with her torso in line with the drilling axis. A cover, consisting of translucent paper stretched on a circular frame, is attached to the apparatus in front of the performer, obscuring the centre of her torso. The machine is then started: the drill bit rotates and the machine begins advancing slowly towards the performer. Then the device appears to go out of control and speed up (sometimes with pyrotechnics for added drama). The drill appears to penetrate through the struggling performer, whose legs, shoulders, arms and head remain in full view and whose lower torso is seen in silhouette through the translucent cover. The tip of the drill emerges and rips through the cover, at which point both the forward motion and rotation of the drill bit stop. The cover is removed to show the limp body of the performer seemingly impaled on the end of the drill. The machine then begins to tilt the drilling axis upwards, in the process pulling the performer from her restraints and raising her high into the air. When the drill's axis is vertical the bit begins to rotate again, spinning the performer's limply spreadeagled body around. The drill then stops and lowers the performer back onto the frame, where assistants cover her torso with a blanket and seemingly push the <b>drill</b> <b>back</b> out of her. The performer then appears to revive and steps from the apparatus to take a bow.|$|R
40|$|Although {{a number}} of {{research}} groups have attempted to estimate the physiological demands of rugby league match-play {{in order to provide}} relevant data for the design of specific training programs, all have been subject to {{a number of}} limitations. The two studies that have used time motion analysis (TMA) were published before the introduction of influential rule changes and the findings from this previous research are arguably dated with regard to the contemporary demands encountered by professional rugby league players. Moreover, research is yet to compare contemporary TMA data with training programs presently used with professional rugby league players. In particular, {{it is not clear whether}} current training practices take account of the frequent bouts of very high-intensity activity that are believed to occur during passages of play and which can determine the outcome of a match. The primary aim of the present thesis was therefore to analyse the movement patterns specific to professional rugby league players during match-play (Study 1). A secondary aim was to identify the timing and frequency of the most highly intense periods of play (Study 2). The findings were then used to develop a highly specific training drill that would reflect the most physiologically demanding periods of the game. The physiological costs of this very high intensity activity reflecting the most demanding periods of a game were then examined in a modified drill and comparisons made between the costs of running alone versus running and tackling (Study 3). Furthermore, current training practices were assessed to determine whether they met the physiological demands identified through TMA (Study 4). Study 1 examined the movement patterns and physiological demands of specific positional groups (hit-up forwards, adjustables and outside backs) during competition using time motion analysis (TMA). There were significant (P < 0. 05) differences between the distances covered by the three positional groups and it was found that players covered shorter distances than described in previous research. It was determined that the average work to rest ratio was 1 : 6 for the outside backs and hit-up forwards and 1 : 5 for the adjustables. However, the average work to rest ratios did not reflect the most demanding periods of the game; these included repeated high-intensity efforts interspersed by recovery periods of very short duration. These periods of repeated highintensity work often occurred at crucial phases of the game, where players were either attacking or defending the try-line. The patterns of movement during the repeated highintensity periods of play were different for each of the positional groups. The hit-up forwards generally sprinted short distances before completing a tackle or being tackled. The recovery durations between bouts of high-intensity exercise were generally quite short. The adjustables covered greater distances in the lead-up to the tackle and completed more lateral movements. They also had greater recovery durations between repeated high-intensity efforts than the hit-up forwards and this was reflected in a greater time spent standing, walking and jogging. The outside backs covered greater distances in the lead up to the tackle than both the hit-up forwards and the adjustables. They also had longer recovery durations between repeated high-intensity efforts than the hit-up forwards but spent less time standing, walking and jogging than the adjustables. The patterns of play revealed significant differences between the positional groups, particularly in regards to repeated high-intensity activities. It was concluded that in order to be prepared for the most highly intense periods of match-play professional rugby league players should adopt training that included the highest and lowest work to rest ratios and also included tackling. Study 2 assessed the frequency, duration and nature of repeated high-intensity efforts in rugby league using the TMA data from Study 1. Rugby league players are frequently required to tackle an opponent after sprinting to a contest. Due to the high physiological demands of contact, and its frequency in rugby league, the element of contact is considered to be a key component of match-play. Repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise (HiEx) were examined in the video footage; HiEx described any period of match-play that included three or more sprints and/or tackles with a mean recovery between efforts of less than 20 s. There were a number of significant (P < 0. 05) differences in HiEx between the positional groups. The hit-up forwards (20. 3 ± 1. 5) completed a significantly (P < 0. 05) greater number of HiEx bouts than the outside backs (12. 0 ± 1. 0). In addition, the hit-up forwards (3. 8 ± 0. 8) completed a significantly (P < 0. 05) greater number of efforts within the HiEx bouts compared to the outside backs (3. 2 ± 0. 4) and the adjustables (3. 1 ± 0. 4). The duration of the HiEx bouts were significantly shorter for the outside backs (17. 9 ± 5. 4 s) compared to the hit-up forwards (24. 8 ± 9. 5 s) and the adjustables (21. 4 ± 5. 9 s). The outside backs also had significantly (P < 0. 05) longer recovery periods both within and between HiEx bouts compared to the hit-up forwards and adjustables. The study identified that rugby league players complete large volumes of high-intensity work compared to athletes in other sports. It is concluded that the hit-up forwards in particular should have a significant focus placed on repeated high-intensity efforts during training. Training for all positional groups should reflect the frequency, content and duration of those HiEx bouts identified in the present study. A modified training drill was used in Study 3 to determine the physiological requirements of repeated bouts of high intensity activities and to estimate the energy costs of tackling. A cohort (n = 7) of professional rugby league players completed two test protocols. The initial six minute protocol involved three repeat sets of six sprints interspersed by a rest period of equal time to the exercise duration. The second six minute protocol involved both sprinting and tackling. The subjects were required to drive a tackle bag backwards for two metres in a standing tackle. Heart rate, blood lactate concentration and oxygen uptake data were recorded for the duration of the two protocols. No significant differences (P < 0. 05) in heart rate, blood lactate concentrations and oxygen consumption were identified between the two trials, suggesting that for players required to only complete three or less repeated efforts in a single bout of high-intensity exercise (HiEx) during match-play, a running only drill during training would be sufficient to prepare them for the cardiovascular demands of competition. However, the pattern of changes over time tended to be different between trials for all measures. Further repeat efforts may have shown subsequent increases in the physiological cost of exercise for the tackle protocol compared to the running only protocol. These trends support the position that tackling places significantly greater physiological demands on players as the game progresses and when players are required to perform greater numbers of repeat sets. It is recommended that all positional groups, and especially the hit-up forwards, participate in more extensive repeat sets of six (i. e. greater than four repeat sets) in order to prepare for the most physiologically demanding periods of match-play. Study 4 examined whether selected training drills simulated competition demands. Three in-season training <b>drills</b> (Ups and <b>Backs</b> <b>drill,</b> Grids drill and Game Play drill) were video recorded and compared to match-play data of equal duration from Study 1. It was found that players covered a significantly (P < 0. 05) greater distance in all three training drills than for a match-play period of equal duration (with the exception of the outside backs in the game-play drill). It was also found that players spent a greater percentage of time completing high-intensity activities in all three drills compared to match-play. However, although the game-play drill most closely resembled match-play compared to the other two drills, overall none of the drills closely replicated the characteristics of match-play with regards to the match-play activities and movement patterns. As the findings from Study 3 have shown, there is a strong tendency for fullcontact to increase the physiological cost of an already high-intensity exercise drill, particularly as a function of time. The absence of, for example, tackling in the gameplay drill, may under expose players (particularly the hit-up forwards) to the highest demands of match-play. While injury prevention during training and simulated gameplay is essential and the benefits of avoiding collisions and contacts are clear, there may be value in coaches seeking to add in to game-play additional exercises that increase the physiological cost to that equivalent to the highest demands experienced in a match. This could involve, for example, static exercise against resistance or wrestling. The present series of investigations have collectively shown that professional rugby league players, particularly the hit-up forwards, engage in periods of very high-intensity exercise that often determine the outcome of critical phases of play. The data tend to support the notion that tackling, when combined with sprinting, is particularly demanding and that training may need to better prepare players for the most arduous passages of play...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe Bredasdorp Basin {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{hydrocarbon}} producing blocks within Southern Africa. The E-M field is situated approximate 50 km west from the FA platform and was brought into commission due to the potential hydrocarbons it may hold. If this field is brought up to full producing capability it will extend the lifespan of the refining station in Mosselbay, situated on the south coast of South Africa, by approximately 8 to 10 years. An unexpected pressure drop within the E-M field caused the suite not to perform optimally and thus further analysis was imminent to assess and alleviate the predicament. The first step within the project was to determine what might have cause the pressure drop and thus we had to go <b>back</b> to cores <b>drilled</b> by Soekor now known as Petroleum South Africa, in the early 1980 ’s. Analyses of the cores exposed a high presence of granulation seams. The granulation seams were mainly subjected within sand units within the cores. This was caused by rolling of sand grains over one another rearranging themselves due to pressure exerted through compaction and faulting, creating seal like fractures within the sand. These fractures caused these sand units to compartmentalize and prohibit flow from one on block to the next. With advance inquiry it was discovered that there was a shale unit situated within the reservoir dividing the reservoir into two main compartments. At this point it was determined to use Petrel which is windows based software for 3 D visualization with a user interface based on the Windows Microsoft standards. This is easy as well as user friendly software thus the choice to go with it. The software uses shared earth modeling tool bringing about reservoir disciplines trough common data modelling. This {{is one of the}} best modelling applications in the available and it was for this reason that it was chosen to apply within the given aspects of the project A lack of data was available to model the granulation seams but with the data acquired during the core analyses it was possible to model the shale unit and factor in the influences of the granulation seams to asses the extent of compartmentalization. The core revealed a thick shale layer dividing the reservoir within two sections which was not previously noted. This shale layer act as a buffer/barrier restricting flow from the bottom to the top halve of the reservoir. This layer is thickest at the crest of the 10 km² domal closure and thins toward the confines of the E-M suite. Small incisions, visible within the 3 dimensional models could serve as a guide for possible re-entry points for future drilling. These incisions which were formed through Lowstand and Highstand systems tracts with the rise and fall of the sea level. The Bredasdorp Basin consists mainly of tilting half graben structures that formed through rifting with the break-up of Gondwanaland. The model also revealed that these faults segregate the reservoir further creating bigger compartments. The reservoir is highly compartmentalized which will explain the pressure loss within the E-M suite. The production well was drilled within one of these compartments and when the confining pressure was relieved the pressure dropped and the production decrease. As recommendation, additional wells are required to appraise the E-M structure and determine to what extent the granulation seems has affected fluid flow as well as the degree of sedimentation that could impede fluid flow. There are areas still containing untapped resources thus the recommendation for extra wells. South Afric...|$|R
