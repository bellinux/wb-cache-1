40|$|Bioavailable and bioaccessible {{fractions}} of sediment-associated contaminants are considered as better dose metrics for sediment-quality assessment than total concentrations. The authors applied exhaustive solvent extraction and nondepletive equilibrium sampling techniques to sediment samples collected along the Brisbane River in South East Queensland, Australia, {{which range from}} pristine environments to urban and industry-impacted areas. The wide range of chemicals expected prevents comprehensive chemical analysis, but a battery of cell-based bioassays sheds light on mixture effects of chemicals in relation to various modes of toxic action. Toxic effects were expressed as <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentrations (BEQs) normalized to the organic carbon content of each sediment sample. <b>Bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentrations from exhaustive extraction agreed fairly well with values estimated from polydimethylsiloxane passive sampling extracts via the constant organic carbon to polydimethylsiloxane partition coefficient. Agreement was best for bioassays indicative of photosynthesis inhibition and oxidative stress response and discrepancy within a factor of 3 for the induction of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. For nonspecific cytotoxicity, BEQ from exhaustive extraction were 1 order of magnitude higher than values from equilibrium sampling, possibly because of coextraction of bioactive natural organic matter that led to an overestimation of toxicity in the exhaustive extracts, which suggests that passive sampling is better suited in combination with bioanalytical assessment than exhaustive extraction...|$|E
40|$|In sediments several binding phases {{dictate the}} fate and {{bioavailability}} of organic contaminants. Black carbon (BC) {{has a high}} sorptive capacity for organic contaminants and can limit their bioavailability, while the fraction bound to organic carbon (OC) {{is considered to be}} readily desorbable and bioavailable. We investigated the bioavailability and mixture toxicity of sediment-associated contaminants by combining different extraction techniques with in vitro bioanalytical tools. Sediments from a harbour with high fraction of BC, and sediments from remote, agricultural and urban areas with lower BC were treated with exhaustive solvent extraction, Tenax extraction and passive sampling to estimate total, bioaccessible and bioavailable fractions, respectively. The extracts were characterized with cell-based bioassays that measure dioxin-like activity (AhR-CAFLUX) and the adaptive stress response to oxidative stress (AREc 32). Resulting <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalents,</b> which are effect-scaled concentrations, were applied in an effect-balance model, consistent with a mass balance-partitioning model for single chemicals. Sediments containing BC had most of the bioactivity associated to the BC fraction, while the OC fraction played a role for sediments with lower BC. As effect-based sediment-water distribution ratios demonstrated, most of the bioactivity in the AhR-CAFLUX was attributable to hydrophobic chemicals while more hydrophilic chemicals activated AREc 32, even though <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalents</b> in the aqueous phase remained negligible. This approach can be used to understand the fate and effects of mixtures of diverse organic contaminants in sediments that would not be possible if single chemicals were targeted by chemical analysis; and make informed risk-based decisions concerning the management of contaminated sediments...|$|R
40|$|Chemical Activated LUciferase gene eXpression [CALUX] is a {{reporter}} gene mammalian cell bioassay used for detection and semi-quantitative analyses of dioxin-like compounds. CALUX dose–response curves for 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin [TCDD] are typically smooth and sigmoidal when the dose is portrayed on a logarithmic scale. Non-linear regression models are used to calibrate the CALUX response versus TCDD standards and to convert the sample response into <b>Bioanalytical</b> <b>EQuivalents</b> (BEQs). Several complications may arise in terms of statistical inference, specifically and most important is the uncertainty assessment of the predicted BEQ. This paper presents the use of linear calibration functions based on Box–Cox transformations to overcome the issue of uncertainty assessment. Main issues being addressed are (i) confidence and prediction intervals for the CALUX response, (ii) confidence and prediction intervals for the predicted BEQ-value, and (iii) detection/estimation capabilities for the sigmoid and linearized models. Statistical comparisons between different calculation methods involving inverse prediction, effective concentration ratios (ECR 20 – 50 – 80) and slope ratio were achieved with example datasets {{in order to provide}} guidance for optimizing BEQ determinations and expand assay performance with the recombinant mouse hepatoma CALUX cell line H 1 L 6. 1 c 3. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a {{large group}} of {{persistent}} organic substances spread throughout the world. The most toxic PCBs are those that are dioxin-like (dl-PCBs). Environmental studies on PCBs in Thailand are limited, especially with regards to dl-PCBs. This study {{is one of the first}} in this country that demonstrates contamination of seafood with PCBs and determines the levels of PCBs and total dioxin like activity in mussels, oysters and shrimp, from the Eastern Coast of Thailand. Sixty pooled samples of mussels and twenty-seven pooled samples of oysters were collected from cultivation farms and twenty-one pooled samples of shrimp were collected from fisherman piers. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of 49 PCB congeners was obtained by HRGC-ECD analysis and total dioxin-like activity using the CAFLUX bioassay. Total PCB concentrations varied between three species, ranging between 19 and 1100 ng g(- 1) lipid adjusted weight, and the levels of PCBs in shrimp was three time higher than that in mussels and oysters. With respected to the pattern of PCB congeners, it implied that the source of PCBs exposure in this area could be from the regional contamination. The calculated CAFLUX <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalents</b> (BEQs) values ranged between 0. 8 and 18 pg BEQ g(- 1) lipid adjusted weight, and showed a good relationship with the chemical-derived TEQs. Therefore, the CAFLUX bioassay can be used for effective screening of dioxin-like activity in marine species effectively...|$|R
30|$|Combining {{chemical}} and bioanalytical techniques to characterize water samples shows {{great potential for}} identifying pollutants of potential concern more coherently, as component-based effect assessment can be compared with effect observations in the same sample [55]. Current limitations mostly relate {{to the amount of}} sample required for biological analysis, which typically involves multiple bioassays and enriched samples [1]. To overcome the logistical challenges associated with providing access to hundreds of liters of water samples, a novel, automated-solid phase extraction (LV-SPE) device was developed and tested for organic compound recoveries [60]. Good recoveries were observed for more than 200 compounds exhibiting a wide range of physico-chemical properties. Moreover, the generated extracts proved suitable for biotesting using various in vitro and in vivo bioassays [50], with effect recovery observations similar to those for chemical recovery for LV-SPE [51]. The device was used in various case studies comparing {{chemical and}} bioanalytical findings, to study how much of an observable effect in freshwater might be explained through chemical analysis using a <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentration (BEQ) approach (e.g., [38, 47, 64].|$|E
40|$|Coupling {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) -based equilibrium {{passive sampling}} with chemical and bioassay analysis, we assessed {{aryl hydrocarbon receptor}} (AhR) -mediated activity and contributing chemicals in sediment from Lake Tai Basin, Eastern China. The <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentrations (BEQs) of AhR-active chemicals for the exhaustive (total burden) and PDMS extracts (bioavailable fractions) ranged from 70 % decline in AhR-mediated activity, suggesting the minor contribution by persistent AhR ligands. Targeted analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) showed, however, that these chemicals contributed < 40 % to the overall effect in both exhaustive and PDMS extracts, indicating {{the presence of other}} labile AhR ligands. The concentrations of PAHs and BEQs of the AhR-mediated activity attributed to these chemicals in the exhaustive extracts can be back calculated from those in the PDMS extracts via a general organic carbon-PDMS partition coefficient. Similar quantitative conversion between PDMS and aquatic organisms was also verified for aquatic organisms via the lipid-PDMS partition coefficient. Therefore, our study provided a first insight into the quantitative links between bulk chemical burdens in sediment, chemical bioavailability, bioaccumulation potential and resulting mixture effects, {{as an integral part of}} predictive environmental risk assessment of contaminated sediment.

30|$|Effect-based trigger values (EBT) {{have been}} {{developed}} for many EBMs. EBTs are expressed as <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentrations (BEQ) and can be read across from existing EQS values for single chemicals. EBTs basically define an acceptable level of effect (translated into EBT-BEQ), in close alignment with the WFD protection goals and concentration-based Environmental Quality Standards (EQS), which proved to be useful for interpreting EBM-results in relation to the likelihood to pose harm [28, 29]. Bioassay-specific EBTs were derived by translating individual annual average (AA)-EQS for single dominant chemicals such as estrogens into EBT-BEQs [26, 28, 29], by ecological considerations and application of species sensitivity distributions [30] or by reading across from all existing EQSs using a transparent algorithm that does not require any user assumptions or judgements about the data [29]. The latter EBT-derivation method targets undefined mixtures acting according to a specific MoA. In contrast to EQSs, EBTs consider all chemicals in a mixture contributing to measured effect. Thus, this approach does not require individual guideline values for all mixture components of a mixture. Bioassay-specific EBTs are key for the interpretation of results from water quality assessment, as effects below the corresponding EBT indicate a low likelihood that the chemical mixtures pose harm whilst exceedance implies increasingly clear indications for harm to aquatic life. Importantly, the proposed approach can be applied to any bioassay provided there are sufficient effect data available.|$|E
40|$|The global {{occurrence}} of {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) continuously contributes to their accumulation also in remote {{areas such as the}} Antarctic Ocean. Antarctic fish, which hold high trophic positions but appear to possess low endogenous elimination rates for chemicals, are expected to bioaccumulate POPs with rising anthropogenic pollution. Using a chemical-analytical method, we measured concentrations of PCBs, PBDEs, HCBs, HCH and DDTs and determined toxic <b>equivalents</b> (TEQs) and <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalents</b> (BEQs) in muscle and ovaries of Antarctic icefish caught in the Southern Ocean around Elephant Island. We used two species with different feeding habits and trophic web positions: the planktivorous Champsocephalus gunnari and the piscivorous Chaenocephalus aceratus. Our results revealed higher contaminant levels in ovary than in muscle tissues of both species. Most analytes concentrations and the TEQs (0. 2 - 0. 5) and BEQs (0. 2) were lower as in temperate species. Comparison with literature data points to higher PCB (20 - 22 ng g(- 1) lipid weight (lw)) and DDT (7 19. 5 ng g(- 1) lw) concentrations than those measured in icefish in the 90 's. For the other contaminants, we could not identify temporal trends. We found a higher bioaccumulation of contaminants, particularly HCB and DDTs, in C. aceratus (6. 2 & 19. 5 ng g(- 1) lw, respectively) than in C. gunnari (3. 8 & 7. 0 ng g(- 1) lw, respectively). However, there was no general species-specific accumulation pattern of the different toxicant classes between the two icefish. Thus, the expected link between contaminant burdens of C aceratus and C gunnari and their ecological traits was only weakly supported for these species...|$|R
40|$|Surface waters {{can contain}} a {{diverse range of}} organic pollutants, {{including}} pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds. While bioassays {{have been used for}} water quality monitoring, there is limited knowledge regarding the effects of individual micropollutants and their relationship to the overall mixture effect in water samples. In this study, a battery of in vitro bioassays based on human and fish cell lines and whole organism assays using bacteria, algae, daphnids and fish embryos was assembled for use in water quality monitoring. The selection of bioassays was guided by the principles of adverse outcome pathways in order to cover relevant steps in toxicity pathways known to be triggered by environmental water samples. The effects of 34 water pollutants, which were selected based on hazard quotients, available environmental quality standards and mode of action information, were fingerprinted in the bioassay test battery. There was a relatively good agreement between the experimental results and available literature effect data. The majority of the chemicals were active in the assays indicative of apical effects, while fewer chemicals had a response in the specific reporter gene assays, but these effects were typically triggered at lower concentrations. The single chemical effect data were used to improve published mixture toxicity modeling of water samples from the Danube River. While there was a slight increase in the fraction of the <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalents</b> explained for the Danube River samples, for some endpoints less than 1 % of the observed effect could be explained by the studied chemicals. The new mixture models essentially confirmed previous findings from many studies monitoring water quality using both chemical analysis and bioanalytical tools. In short, our results indicate that many more chemicals contribute to the biological effect than those that are typically quantified by chemical monitoring programs or those regulated by environmental quality standards. This study not only demonstrates the utility of fingerprinting single chemicals for an improved understanding of the biological effect of pollutants, but also highlights the need to apply bioassays for water quality monitoring in order to prevent underestimation of the overall biological effect.

40|$|In {{developing}} {{countries such as}} China, {{there is a strong}} need for simple and rapid bioassays for the determination of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in environmental samples; i. e., flue gas and fly ash from waste incinerators. In this study, we applied the DR-EcoScreen cell (DR-cell) assay to determination of PCDD/Fs in 78 flue gas samples obtained from various waste incinerators in China between 2009 and 2011. The flue gas samples were obtained from four kinds of incinerators, classified into hazardous, medical and municipal-solid waste, and iron ore sintering, and the flue gas extracts were cleaned up using an SPD- 600 automated-sample preparation device for DR-cell assay. The PCDD/Fs values obtained from the DR-cell assay were compared with those obtained from conventional high resolution gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS) analysis. The <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalent</b> (BEQ) values obtained from the DR-cell assay were very closely correlated with the international toxicity equivalent (I-TEQ) values from HRGC-HRMS analysis (r(2) = 0. 98, n = 78), while the BEQ values were 5. 52 -fold higher than the I-TEQ values, as the PCDFs, which account for 80 % of the total I-TEQ value, were overestimated by DR cell-assay. Therefore, we multiplied the BEQ values from the DR-cell assay by a conversion coefficient (0. 181, the reciprocal of 5. 52), and could approximate the TEQ values from the HRGC-HRMS analysis. These results suggest that the DR-cell assay combined with SPD- 600 cleanup provides a promising method for the simple and rapid screening of PCDD/Fs levels in flue gas samples, such as those from various waste incinerators in China.

40|$|Guiana dolphin {{is the top}} {{predator}} of highest toxicological {{concern in}} Brazil and many studies on levels of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxicant (PBT) pollutants have been performed on the species. However, due to high costs of the analyses, only one investigation comprised the determination of dioxins and related compounds (DRCs) in Guiana dolphin tissues. The dioxin responsive-chemically activated luciferase gene expression (DR-CALUX) cell bioassay {{was used in the}} present study for the analyses of hepatic samples from 28 male Guiana dolphins in order to screen estuarine environments for DRCs, comprising three regions (Northeastern, Southeastern, and Southern) and four states [Parana´ (PR), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Espı´rito Santo (ES), and Ceara´ (CE) ] of Brazil. High <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalent</b> (BEQ) concentrations [dioxins (pg BEQ/g lipid) ] were found, varying from 1. 94 to 15. 6 pg BEQ/g. A significant negative correlation between BEQ concentrations and total length was found in Guiana dolphins from Brazil (all analysed dolphins). This pattern also was verified for RJ state, pointing to (1) chemically induced developmental disruption or to (2) increasing efficiency of the detoxifying activity with the growth of the animal. Comparison was performed with literature data and significantly higher BEQ levels were found in Brazilian Guiana dolphins than in those reported for North Sea harbour porpoises. Higher levels were found in Southeastern (the most PBT-contaminated area of the country) than in Southern region. However, it is not possible to affirm that Guiana dolphins are more contaminated by DRCs in SE than in S region, because individuals were lengthier in S than in SE region. Our results seem to have mirrored dolphin exposure to PCBs in Brazil according to the literature. Further studies are required for investigating the hypotheses 1 and 2 mentioned above.

40|$|Stormwater {{harvesting}} {{has become}} an attractive alternative strategy to address the rising demand for urban water supply due to limited water sources and population growth. Nevertheless, urban stormwater is also {{a major source of}} surface water pollution. Runoff from different urban catchments with source contributions from anthropogenic activities and various land uses causes variable contaminant profiles, thus posing a challenging task for environmental monitoring and risk assessment. A thorough understanding of raw stormwater quality is essential to develop appropriate treatment facilities for potential indirect potable reuse of stormwater. While some of the key chemical components have previously been characterized, only scarce data are available on stormwater toxicity. We benchmarked stormwater samples from urban, residential and industrial sites across various Australian capital cities against samples from the entire water cycle, from sewage to drinking water. Six 2 ̆ 7 biological endpoints, targeting groups of chemicals with modes of toxic action of particular relevance for human and environmental health, were investigated: non-specific toxicity (Microtox and combined algae test), the specific modes of action of phytotoxicity (combined algae test), dioxin-like activity (AhR-CAFLUX), and estrogenicity (E-SCREEN), as well as reactive toxicity encompassing genotoxicity (umuC) and oxidative stress (AREc 32). Non-specific toxicity was highly variable across sites. The baseline toxicity equivalent concentrations of the most polluted samples were similar to secondary treated effluent from wastewater treatment plants. Phytotoxicity results correlated well with the measured herbicide concentrations at all sites. High estrogenicity was found in two sampling events and could be related to sewage overflow. Genotoxicity, dioxin-like activity, and oxidative stress response were evident in only three of the samples where the stormwater drain was beside a heavy traffic road, confirming that road runoff is the potential source of contaminants, while the <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentrations (BEQ) of these samples were similar to those of raw sewage. This study demonstrates the benefit of bioanalytical tools for screening-level stormwater quality assessment, forming the basis for the evaluation of future stormwater treatment and reuse schemes.

40|$|Cell-based bioassays are {{becoming}} increasingly popular in water quality assessment. The new generations of reporter-gene assays are very sensitive and effects are often detected in very clean water types such as drinking water and recycled water. For monitoring applications it is therefore imperative to derive trigger values that differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable effect levels. In this proof-of-concept paper, we propose a statistical method to read directly across from chemical guideline values to trigger values without the need to perform in vitro to in vivo extrapolations. The derivation is based on matching effect concentrations with existing chemical guideline values and filtering out appropriate chemicals that are responsive in the given bioassays at concentrations {{in the range of}} the guideline values. To account for the mixture effects of many chemicals acting together in a complex water sample, we propose bioanalytical equivalents that integrate the effects of groups of chemicals with the same mode of action that act in a concentration-additive manner. Statistical distribution methods are proposed to derive a specific effect-based trigger <b>bioanalytical</b> <b>equivalent</b> concentration (EBT-BEQ) for each bioassay of environmental interest that targets receptor-mediated toxicity. Even bioassays that are indicative of the same mode of action have slightly different numeric trigger values due to differences in their inherent sensitivity. The algorithm was applied to 18 cell-based bioassays and 11 provisional effect-based trigger bioanalytical equivalents were derived as an illustrative example using the 349 chemical guideline values protective for human health of the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. We illustrate the applicability using the example of a diverse set of water samples including recycled water. Most recycled water samples were compliant with the proposed triggers while wastewater effluent would not have been compliant with a few. The approach is readily adaptable to any water type and guideline or regulatory framework and can be expanded from the protection goal of human health to environmental protection targets. While this work constitutes a proof of principle, the applicability remains limited at present due to insufficient experimental bioassay data on individual regulated chemicals and the derived effect-based trigger values are of course only provisional. Once the experimental database is expanded and made more robust, the proposed effect-based trigger values may provide guidance in a regulatory context. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
