2500|$|The {{troop train}} {{collided}} head {{on with the}} stationary local train on the up line at 6.49 am. Just over a minute later the second northbound express train ran into the wreckage, having passed the Quintinshill Down Distant signal {{before it could be}} returned to danger. The wreckage also included the goods train in the down loop and the trucks of the empty coal train in the up loop. At 6.53 Tinsley sent the [...] "Obstruction Danger" [...] <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> to both Gretna and Kirkpatrick, stopping all traffic and alerting others to the disaster.|$|E
5000|$|The {{signalman}} at Pouparts Junction (T. P. G. Hillman) then {{offered the}} Coulsdon train forward. He {{should not have}} done this until he had received the [...] "Train out of Section" [...] <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> for the London Bridge train, which Childs denied strongly that he had sent. The enquiry made no definite ruling on this point - {{it was possible that}} Hillman had mistaken another <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> relating to a down train for the [...] "Train out of Section" [...] signal. However, Childs' fifth and fatal mistake then occurred. He pressed the plunger to accept the Coulsdon train, and, as the enquiry ruled, sent the acceptance <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> to Hillman. Hillman cleared his signals, and the Coulsdon train entered the occupied section at approximately 40 mph.|$|E

2500|$|The Gotthardbahn {{employed}} <b>signal</b> <b>bells</b> {{within its}} stations {{and along the}} line to signal any approaching train. An alarm was triggered once a train had left a neighbouring station or block station. These <b>signal</b> <b>bells</b> were partly installed along the line and signalled any construction worker an approaching train. In addition, any railway watchman's house and railroad crossing would be equipped with a <b>signal</b> <b>bell.</b> Southbound trains were signalled by 3 triple chimes, northbound trains by two double chimes. The signalling mechanism at each <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> had to be manually wound up every day by station employees and railway watchmen. Part of the mechanism was a weight having to be raised by help of a pulley. The electric signal triggering the alarm operated a relay, activating the bell's hammer through force of the aforementioned weight. Each <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> within the Gotthard railway's network is marked on the graphic timetable. The railway watchman's house number159 (Casello159) <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> on the Monte Ceneri line between Giubiasco and Rivera-Bironico is shown as an example in the [...] A southbound train departing Giubiasco for Rivera-Bironico would trigger alarms of eleven different <b>signal</b> <b>bells</b> on its 11 kilometres long journey. Around 1980 these <b>signal</b> <b>bells</b> were decommissioned.|$|R

In response, innate immune DNA-sensing pathways launch an antimicrobial type I interferon (IFN) response, which becomes damaging to the host if unregulated or inappropriately activated by self-DNA. This Select highlights recent insights into activation and regulation of innate immune DNA-sensing pathways...|$|R
5000|$|After an interval, {{the train}} will arrive and pass B; {{as it does}} so, B sends [...] "Train Entering Section" [...] on the block bell to C. Then C {{acknowledges}} the <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> and places the block instrument to [...] "Train On Line". As the train passes, he restores his signals to danger, and when {{the whole of the}} train passes B complete with tail lamp attached, B sends the [...] "Train Out Of Section" [...] <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> (2-1) to A and when A acknowledges it, he places his block indicator to [...] "Normal". The block section between A and B is now normal and A can offer B another train, if he has one.|$|E

50|$|Several {{advances}} in the technology of fog signals were made during the 1850s. In 1851, an experimental air fog whistle and reed horn was installed at Beavertail Lighthouse {{at the entrance to}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. At first this sound signal was powered by a horse-operated treadmill and later by an internal combustion steam engine. Around 1851, mechanically rung fog bells were introduced. The striking mechanism was governed by a weight attached to a flywheel, and later internally run by clockworks. The strokes of the fog signals were timed deliberately to afford each signal a unique sound characteristic. The <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> was gradually replaced by three variations of that instrument. The first was an ordinary locomotive whistle, enlarged and modified and blown by steam from a high-pressured tubular boiler. The second was a reed-trumpet, and in 1866 the third variation, a siren-trumpet. Although the fog <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> was still used for warning vessels over short distances, other fog signals started to supersede the smaller <b>bell</b> <b>signal.</b> Bells were also used on buoys; later whistling buoys were invented by J. M. Courtenay and were first in use in 1876. The first gas-lighted buoy was installed in 1882. The gong buoy was invented in 1923.|$|E

50|$|Before Hayes {{could reach}} the signal box, the {{signalman}} at Winwick Quay to the south rang Call attention for an express train from Euston to Blackpool. As the Regulations did not permit him to send the Is Line Clear? <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> until he had received Train Out of Section for the local train, he intended to send the <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> Shunt engine for following train to pass upon acknowledgment of Call attention, i.e. he expected Bloor to switch the local train temporarily to another running line and halt it while the express passed. However, Bloor forgot that the local train was standing at his signals, and {{thought that he had}} failed to clear his block instruments after a preceding train. He gave the reply, Train out of section and cleared his signals.|$|E
50|$|Reversers {{have been}} used in New South Wales {{especially}} to put starting signals to stop. When the signal was put back to stop, the system automatically sent the train on line <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> (two bells) to the station in advance. This equipment would have helped prevent the Hawes Junction rail crash.|$|E
50|$|Dvořák's music {{follows the}} story closely and the {{orchestration}} {{is often used}} to illustrate characters and events: the oboe and bass clarinet are used to depict the misbehaving child and the witch respectively, whilst twelve strokes of a <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> the coming of noon. During the witch's chase, the music alternates between two different time signatures as a further dramatic device.|$|E
5000|$|Ivan Pavlov {{had learned}} that the ringing of the <b>bell</b> <b>signaled</b> [...] "food is on the way" [...] in his {{experiment}} in which dogs were trained to salivate upon hearing a bell ring. This was accomplished by ringing a bell just prior to feeding the dogs. After repeating this procedure for some time {{it was found that}} the dogs would salivate after hearing the bell - without the need for food being presented.|$|R

B may now clear his signals for the train.|$|E
5000|$|The A and B wires of an {{analogue}} {{phone line}} {{appear in a}} structured cabling system usually on the centre pins of the 8P8C connector (pins 4 and 5; the blue/white TIA/EIA-568 pair 1 in Cat5 cables). In most other countries, those two wires are {{all that is needed}} to connect an analogue telephone. In the UK, however, many telephones expect the 25 Hz ring signal on a third wire. But such a 3-wire interface is not the symmetric interface needed for balanced twisted-pair transmission lines, and therefore prone to electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with nearby other wiring. Therefore, the capacitor that separates the <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> from the A/B wires should be located close to the telephone. Any bell wire provided by the master socket is therefore not connected to the structured cabling, and the telephone is plugged at the other end into the structured cabling via a line adapter unit (LAU) / Mod-Tap / Molex that contains the capacitor needed to create the separate <b>bell</b> <b>signal.</b> Different types of LAUs are on the market: ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} the driver of the InterCity train ignoring the stop aspect of the main signal. The driver heard the conductor's [...] "ready" [...] <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> and concentrated on leaving the station by the second. A signal repeater was possibly malfunctioning. Other contributing factors were the bright daylight that prevented the driver from clearly seeing the red signal, and the general [...] "obsession" [...] among InterCity drivers to obey the timetable by the second.|$|E
5000|$|The Abbots Ripton {{signalman}} {{was evidently}} dazed by the events; {{he set his}} signals in both directions to 'danger' but did not (as he should also have done) immediately send the 5-beat 'obstruction danger' <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> to Stukeley, the next signal box south. Instead he tried {{to send a message}} reporting the crash and seeking assistance by the speaking telegraph to Huntingdon station to the south. He prefixed the message with the special 'SP' code indicating top priority but the signalman at Huntingdon did not answer. The Abbots Ripton signalman kept trying to raise Huntingdon, but without success; when the Huntingdon signalman did answer he first refused to accept any message not starting with a code to indicate time sent, and rebuffed subsequent sends with an 'MQ' code - roughly translating as [...] "Go away, I'm busy". Indeed, he was; he was accepting the Leeds express and passing it on to the next signal box. At 6.52, after trying and failing for 8 minutes to pass his message to Huntingdon South, the Abbots Ripton signalman sent the 5-beat 'obstruction danger' <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> to Stukeley.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all bell {{codes are}} {{preceded by a}} single stroke on the bell, {{referred}} to as Call Attention — the main exception being Train Entering Section. The Is Line Clear? <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> describes the train, distinguishing between ordinary and express passenger trains, and various categories of goods train. In some locations, routing information {{is included in the}} bell code, such an ordinary passenger train to be routed to a branch at the signal box in advance would be offered by the bell code 1-3 instead of 3-1. These often vary by location.|$|E

50|$|The {{cars were}} water-powered: a tank {{in the upper}} car was filled with up to 3.5 t {{of water from the}} city stream (Stadtbach). This car, being heavier, then pulled the other one up the slope, after which the water would be drained and the process {{repeated}} with the other car. Up to thirty persons could be transported upwards in this manner. The descent was controlled by an operator on the forward platform on the upper car, who communicated with his colleague in the lower car by means of <b>bell</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R

50|$|Electric bells are {{typically}} designed {{to operate on}} low voltages of from 10 to 24 V AC or DC. Before widespread distribution of electric power, bells were necessarily powered by batteries, either wet-cell or dry-cell type. Bells used in early telephone systems derived current by a magneto generator cranked by the subscriber. In residential applications, a small bell-ringing transformer is usually used to power the doorbell circuit. So that bell circuits {{can be made with}} low-cost wiring methods, <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> circuits are limited in voltage and power rating. Bells for industrial purposes may operate on other, higher, AC or DC voltages to match plant voltages or available standby battery systems.|$|E
5000|$|Frequent {{and oppressive}} fog made the passage hazardous; and also made duty {{at the light}} to be {{considered}} a hardship in an extremely lonely and forbidding place. [...] A fog <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> was installed in 1862. In 1864 it was replaced by a foghorn. In 1875 it was converted to a steam powered fog siren. In 1880 a separate fog building was built for a [...] "duplicate" [...] fog siren. This began a 10 in steam whistle and new building in 1900 (which still exists near water's edge). [...] In 1904, there came a realization that the whistles were [...] "less than effective' and they were replaced by dual diaphones. [...] The horns made living there difficult; fertilized eggs would be destroyed by the sounds.|$|E
