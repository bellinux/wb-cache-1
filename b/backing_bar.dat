40|$|In {{shipbuilding}} {{and many}} other industries, copper weld backing bars are used to draw the heat out of the weld. The problem that some users of these bars encounter is that these bars, on occasion, actually melt in spots and become welded to the weld plates. After this happens a number of times, the <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> becomes so degraded {{that it must be}} either discarded or machined, both of which are very costly and time-consuming actions. To avoid this fusion between the <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> and the weld plate, the weld processes that are used cannot be ones of high beat input. This requirement is very limiting when thick plates are being welded. The plates must be beveled, and more weld passes must be run. These problems are also costly and time consuming. The aim of this project is {{to find a way to}} produce backing bars with nearly the same `chilling` effect but with both a greater resistance to molten metal and resistance to arcing to the <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> itself. A possible solution currently being tested is to coat the copper bars with a thin layer of a ceramic coating. The procedure used was to coat the copper bars with either alumina or spinel by a plasma spraying method...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of post-weld rolling {{and how it}} reduces and eliminates residual stress and distortion are poorly understood. Finite element analysis was applied to two different methods of rolling: rolling the weld bead directly with a single roller and rolling beside the weld bead with a dual flat roller. The models showed that both rolling techniques were able to induce compressive stress into the weld region, which increased with rolling load. The distribution of stress was sensitive to the coefficients of friction between the workpiece and the roller and the <b>backing</b> <b>bar.</b> High friction coefficients concentrated the plastic deformation and compressive stress within {{the centre of the}} weld bead. Distortion can be eliminated by rolling; however, the experiments indicated that this was only achieved when applied to the weld bead directly...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the PhD work of {{investigating}} the Friction Stir Welding process (FSW) with numerical and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling methods. FSW was developed at TWI in 1991. As a relatively new technology it has great advantages in welding aluminium alloys which are difficult to weld with traditional welding processes. The aim of this thesis was the development of new modelling techniques to predict the thermal and deformation behaviour. To achieve this aim, a group of Gleeble experiments was conducted on 6082 and 7449 aluminium alloys, to investigate the material constitutive behaviour under high strainrate, near solidus conditions, which are similar to what the material experiences during the FSW process. By numerically processing the experimental data, new material constitutive constants were found for both alloys and used for the subsequent FSW modelling work. Importantly no significant softening was observed prior to the solidus temperature. One of the main problems with numerical modelling is determining the values of adjustable parameters in the model. Two common adjustable parameters are the heat input and the coefficients that describe the heat loss to the <b>backing</b> <b>bar.</b> To predict these coefficients more efficiently a hybrid model was created which involved linking a conventional numerical model to an ANN model. The ANN was trained using data from the numerical model. Then thermal profiles were abstracted (summarised) and used as inputs; and the adjustable parameters were used as outputs. The trained ANN could then use abstracted thermal profiles from welding experiments to predict the adjustable parameters in the model. The first stage involved developing a simplified FE thermal model which represents a typical welding process. It was used to find the coefficients that describe the heat loss to the <b>backing</b> <b>bar,</b> and the amount of power applied in the model. Five different thermal boundary conditions were studied, including both convective and ones that included the <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> with a contact gap conductance. Three approaches for abstracting the thermal curves and using as inputs to the ANN were compared. In the study, the characteristics of the ANN model, such as the ANN topology and gradient descent method, were evaluated for each boundary condition for understanding of their influences to the prediction. The outcomes of the study showed that the hybrid model technique was able to determine the adjustable parameters in the model effectively, although the accuracy depended on several factors. One of the most significant effects was the complexity of the boundary condition. While a single factor boundary condition (e. g. constant convective heat loss) could be predicted easily, the boundary condition with two factors proved more difficult. The method for inputting the data into the ANN had a significant effect on the hybrid model performance. A small number of inputs could be used for the single factor boundary condition, while two factors boundary conditions needed more inputs. The influences from the characteristics of the ANN model were smaller, but again thermal model with simpler boundary condition required a less complex ANN model to achieve an accurate prediction, while models with more complex boundary conditions would need a more sophisticated ANN model. In the next chapter, the hybrid method was applied to a FSW process model developed for the Flexi-stir FSW machine. This machine has been used to analyse the complex phase changes that occur during FSW with synchrotron radiation. This unique machine had a complex <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> system involving heat transfer from the aluminium alloy workpiece to the copper and steel backing bars. A temperature dependent contact gap conductance which also depends on the material interface type was used. During the investigation, the ANN model topologies (i. e. GFF and MFF) were studied to find the most effective one. Different abstracting methods for the thermal curves were also compared to explore which factors (e. g. the peak temperature in the curve, cooling slope of a curve) were more important to be used as an input. According to close matching between the simulation and experimental thermal profiles, the hybrid model can predict both the power and thermal boundary condition between the workpiece and <b>backing</b> <b>bar.</b> The hybrid model was applied to six different travel speeds, hence six sets of heat input and boundary condition factors were found. A universal set was calculated from the six outcomes and a link was discovered between the accuracy of the temperature predictions and the plunge depth for the welds. Finally a model with a slip contact condition between the tool and workpiece was used to investigate how the material flow behaviour was affected by the slip boundary condition. This work involved aluminium alloys 6082 -T 6 and 7449 -T 7, which have very different mechanical properties. The application of slip boundary condition was found to significantly reduce the strain-rate, compared to a stick condition. The slip condition was applied to the Flexi-stir FSW experiments, and the results indicated that a larger deformation region may form with the slip boundary condition. The thesis successfully demonstrates a new methodology for determining the adjustable parameters in a process model; improved understanding of the effect of slip boundary conditions on the flow behaviour during FSW and insight in to the behaviour of aluminium alloys at temperatures approaching the solidus and high strain-rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{fractures}} observed {{following the}} Northridge earthquake in welded beam-to-column connections {{have been linked}} to a number of different material and manufacturing parameters such as fracture toughness, crack size and yield strength all of which are in general random. In a previous study of a simple sway frame, where randomness of the above variables was considered, fracture of the connections was found to result in the reduction of the frame’s lateral stiffness with an accompanying reduction of the natural frequency of the frame. In this paper, the linear elastic behaviour of a multi degree-of-freedom frame under earthquake loading is examined probabilistically {{as an extension of the}} previous investigation. The results demonstrate that most of the connections fail early on in the seismic event and that fracture probabilities are heavily dependant on the storey on which they are located. Removal of the <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> is found to reduce the failure probability of the connection without, however, being able to prevent fracture when used as a sole measure...|$|E

40|$|This Master Thesis was {{performed}} in terms of robotic three dimensional friction stir welding with T-butt joint. Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid state welding method that achieves the weld temperature by friction of a rotating non-consumable tool with the workpiece. Science and technology fast developing requires for higher seam quality and more complex welding joint geometry like 3 D welds. In order to acquire high productivity, capacity and flexibility with acceptable cost, robotic FSW solution have been proposed. Instead of the standard FSW machine, using a robot to perform complicated welds such as, three-dimensional. In this report, a solution for weld a 3 D T-butt joint, which located in an aluminium cylinder with 1. 5 mm thickness using a robot, was developed. Moreover, two new paths were investigated {{in order to avoid}} the use of two welds to perform this type of joint. The paths were tested on 2 D and on 3 D (with a 5050 curvature radius) geometries. Both paths had good results. What is more, the parameter developing methods of FSW process, which is composed of necessary parameter setting, positional compensation was introduced. Specially,the study demonstrates how complicate geometry can be welded using a robot. Also,it shows that TWT temperature control is able to acquire high quality 3 D welds. In addition, an analysis of the 2 D welding and 3 D welding {{was performed}}, which exposed that, keeping exactly the same welding conditions, higher lateral forces on the tool were found during 3 D welding. Basis on the special case in this paper, when the tool goes like "climbing" the sample, the suffering force of tool decreasing with increasing the height(Z position); nevertheless, when the tool goes like "downhill", the suffering force of tool decreasing with decreasing the height (Z position). What is more, in 2 D weld, increasing the downforce (Fz) results increasing the lateral forces which can be Fx and/or Fy. Finally, the future works suggestions were presented in terms of (1) performing the new paths into a real cylinder, (2) performing tensile test on the paths and comparing it with conventional path which weld twice, (3) researching how the downforce (Fz) influence the Fx and Fy during welding of different 3 D geometries, (4) how the cooling rate of <b>backing</b> <b>bar</b> influence the seam quality when it is use the same welding parameters and (5) the effect of performing welds in the same welding temperature achieved with different combination of the tool rotational speed and downforce on the material propertie...|$|E
