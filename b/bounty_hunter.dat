50|$|The Men in Black are {{analogous}} to the Alien <b>Bounty</b> <b>Hunters</b> employed by the Colonists. The Men in Black were, however, not as reliable as the <b>bounty</b> <b>hunters</b> and though sometimes they were used initially it took the more capable Alien <b>Bounty</b> <b>Hunters</b> to complete difficult tasks. The Syndicate would use the <b>bounty</b> <b>hunters</b> only when absolutely necessary because of {{an increased risk of}} exposure.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, in Canada, Smith and Mulder's car {{runs out}} of gas. Walking the last few miles on foot, they come across the corpse of the electrician, grossly {{decomposed}} and covered in ants.

Jeremiah tells Mulder that the cloned children are drones, workers used to tend the fields, incapable of speaking. After retrieving a gasoline can, Mulder tries {{to take one of}} the female clones with him. However, the <b>Bounty</b> <b>Hunter</b> arrives and chases them. As he corners them in a large bee hive, the <b>Bounty</b> <b>Hunter</b> is crushed and stung repeatedly in a trap set up by the trio.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} in which multiple Alien Bounty Hunters appear involved {{the use of}} motion control, a method in which a motion-control camera on a computerized module is repeatedly run through the same motion while elements are continually added. The shot, according to John Wash, {{was one of the}} few times in the series in which the production crew was able to use motion control and therefore presented a slight challenge. In the filming of the sequence, both a blank plate, for just the set, and lighting elements, that were in the set, were shot before the production crew filmed five different passes, each one with the Alien <b>Bounty</b> <b>Hunter</b> in a different position. The production crew were finally able to clone the <b>Bounty</b> <b>Hunter</b> by blending all the passes together.|$|E

Mulder receives emails containing the doctor's obituary along with two other identical doctors. After interviewing a pro-life priest who had threatened one of the doctors, they are able to use a newspaper advertisement looking for one of the men to track another one, Aaron Baker, to Syracuse, New York.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bounty</b> <b>Hunters</b> are a {{distinct}} {{group from the}} Colonist aliens. Although all Colonist aliens are shape-shifters, the Alien <b>Bounty</b> <b>Hunters</b> readily take the shape of humans and are tasked with policing their plans and tracking down and eliminating any threats. The <b>bounty</b> <b>hunters</b> have green blood that contains a retrovirus which, when exposed to humans, is lethal. The alien blood can burn through most surfaces like an acid, and can kill a normal human if exposed for too long to its noxious fumes. In addition, the alien's blood causes human blood to coagulate into a jelly-like substance, but its effects can be neutralized by extreme cold. The <b>Bounty</b> <b>Hunters,</b> and {{any member of the}} Colonists' race, could also only be killed by piercing a small area {{at the base of the}} neck; the <b>bounty</b> <b>hunters</b> carried a kind of alien stiletto-like weapon to assassinate rogue aliens and to destroy imperfect alien-human hybrids. Once dead, their bodies would rapidly dissolve into a pool of their severely acidic blood, which would eventually evaporate.|$|R
