5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{interpretation}} of the Upanishad is a qualified monism. Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to be teaching a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the dweller in all things, yet also distinct and <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls {{to be of the}} same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively they are distinct.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved that}} the unknown {{radioactive}} source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the Physical Review on May 27, 1940. They did not propose {{a name for the}} element in the paper, but they soon decided on the name neptunium since Neptune is the next planet beyond Uranus in our solar system. McMillan and Abelson's success compared to Nishina and Kimura's near miss {{can be attributed to the}} favorable half-life of 239Np for radiochemical analysis and quick decay of 239U, in contrast to the slower decay of 237U and extremely long half-life of 237Np.|$|E

25|$|But <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> these {{practices}} the Buddha emphasized {{the primacy of}} individual practice and experience. He said that supplication to gods or deities was not necessary.

25|$|The pitch {{itself had}} become slower and slower. Some {{observers}} {{said that it}} was useless to bowlers and batsmen alike. That wasn't true, because some of the batsmen showed <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> doubt that anyone who could really hit the ball could play it away with ease, power, and safety as it rose slowly from the turf.|$|E

The team {{performed}} <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> expectations to win 26-18 against a side including some much more experienced professional players. The Griffins showed great skill and determination while inspired leadership from Bill Drinkwater and Dell Bristow saw the team victorious in an intense battle.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, another {{consortium}} led by Nick Tana made a bid {{for entry}} into the National Soccer League. Perth Glory was subsequently licensed to join the 1996–97 NSL season and on 1 December 1995 the club was officially launched.

25|$|The {{failure to}} {{complete}} this section ended the Midland's hopes of being a serious competitor on routes to Scotland and finally put <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> doubt that Leeds, not Bradford, would be the West Riding's principal city. Midland trains to Scotland therefore continued to call at Leeds before travelling along the Aire Valley to the Settle and Carlisle. From Carlisle they then travelled onwards via either the Glasgow and South Western or Waverley Route. In days gone by the line enjoyed named expresses such as the Thames–Clyde Express and The Waverley.|$|E

25|$|In 1954, {{the year}} after Christie's execution, Rillington Place was renamed Ruston Close, but number 10 {{continued}} in multiple occupation. The three families living there in 1970 refused to move out for the shooting of the 1971 film 10 Rillington Place, which was therefore filmed in the empty number 6. The house and street were demolished later, and the area has changed <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> recognition. Bartle Road, London W11, now approximates the line of Rillington Place, and a small garden occupies the site where No. 10 once stood.|$|E
25|$|In humans a {{relationship}} between lung cancer and radon {{has been shown to}} exist (<b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> reasonable doubt) for exposures of 100 WLM and above. By using the data from several studies it has been possible to show that an increased risk can be caused by a dose as low as 15 to 20 WLM. Sadly these studies have been difficult as the random errors in the data are very large. It is likely that the miners are also subject to other effects which can harm their lungs while at work (for example dust and diesel fumes).|$|E

During his first two years at Wanstead, he established the existence of the phenomenon of aberration <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> doubt, and this also enabled him to formulate a set of rules that would allow the calculation of the effect on any given star at a specified date.|$|E

25|$|The rectorate was {{an attempt}} to see {{something}} in the movement that had come to power, <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.|$|E
25|$|The lands ravaged and {{depopulated}} by {{the civil}} war were filled up by arriving Turks who colonised the land through a mixture of conquest and trade. The result was that Byzantium's power was undermined <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> recovery — {{two hundred years ago}} Byzantium could rely on the people living in the lands of Anatolia, Greece, Macedonia and several large islands like Cyprus and Crete. Now the population under its control was limited to the few remaining cities in Byzantine possession, namely Thessalonica and Constantinople and the surrounding countryside, and the Despotate of the Morea. The immigration of Turks would be decisive in the survival of the Empire as it gave her most dire enemy, the Ottomans, a new power base, not in Asia but now in Europe.|$|E
25|$|William Henry Scotton (15 January 1856 in Nottingham, England – 9 July 1893 in St John's Wood, London, England) was a cricketer {{who played}} for Nottinghamshire and England. Scotton played his first match at Lord's for Sixteen Colts of England against the Marylebone Cricket Club on 11 and 12 May 1874, scoring on that {{occasion}} 19 and 0. He was engaged as a groundman by the MCC in that year and in 1875, and after an engagement at Kennington Oval returned {{to the service of}} the MCC, of whose ground staff he was a member {{at the time of his}} death. His powers were rather slow to ripen, and he had been playing for several years before he obtained anything like a first-rate position. At one period of his career, however, and more particularly during the seasons of 1884 and 1886, he was <b>beyond</b> <b>all</b> question the best professional left-handed batsman in England.|$|E

50|$|Focus is {{relative}} to spatial depth. Selective focus in photography is {{usually associated with}} depth of field. A pinhole camera generates an image of infinite relative focus, from a point just outside the camera opening out to infinity. Lenses focus more selectively so that, for objects near the lens, the distance between lens and sensor or film is increased and is shortened for more distant objects, to a point <b>beyond</b> which <b>all</b> is in focus. In telephoto lenses this point may be tens or hundreds of metres from the camera. Wide-angle lenses distinguish differences in depth only up to a short distance, <b>beyond</b> which <b>all</b> is in focus.|$|R
