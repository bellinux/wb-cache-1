The {{hypothesis}} {{of this paper}} is that industrial transformation in the Danish construction sector needs in the future to focus on integrating <b>building</b> <b>services</b> technologies into the buildings. This can be illustrated by analysing historical developments in <b>building</b> <b>services</b> usage, exploring design strategies for the effective integration of <b>building</b> <b>services,</b> and by developing new industrialised solutions for <b>building</b> <b>services.</b> The paper is based on the current Danish situation, and is based on linking research on <b>building</b> <b>services,</b> user needs, <b>building</b> design and new industrial processes...|$|R

25|$|In 1980, Fidel Castro instigated {{a wave of}} {{emigration}} from Cuba to the United States using the harbor town of Mariel for debarkation. The thousands of refugees were eventually distributed to military installations in several states (Fort Chaffee, AR, Fort McCoy, WI, Fort Indiantown Gap, PA) and Puerto Rico to await permanent resettlement. The Immigration and Naturalization Service and Border Patrol were understaffed to provide civilian law enforcement officers needed to maintain order within the installations. The Federal Protective Service, then administratively placed under the General Service Administration’s Public <b>Building</b> <b>Service,</b> was among several federal authorities asked to provide additional on-site officers {{for the duration of}} the event.

In 1949, Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, which consolidated real property functions within the newly created General Services Administration. The FPS force, known at the time as the United States Special Police, came under the supervision of the Protection Division of the Public <b>Building</b> <b>Service</b> (PBS). In 1971, the Administrator of GSA signed an order formally establishing the Federal Protective Force, later known as FPS, and the Civil Service Commission authorized the special classification title of Federal Protective Officer (FPO).|$|E

40|$|It is {{essential}} for quantity surveyors to improve their knowledge in <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost management to avoid financial loss in a construction project. The need of mechanical and electrical quantity surveyor in construction industry is vital for clients to have a proper cost management of <b>building</b> <b>services.</b> The objective {{of this research is}} to examine the level of involvement of quantity surveyors in the cost management of <b>building</b> <b>services.</b> It investigates the nature of quantity surveyors’ knowledge gap in <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost management and identifies the measures to bridge the knowledge gap in <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost managements. The research methods used are questionnaires survey among quantity surveyors and semi structured interviews among quantity surveyors and <b>building</b> <b>services</b> engineers, who are randomly selected from those having at least 10 years of experience in construction industry. Four crucial gaps were identified as the barriers which hinder quantity surveyors to manage <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost management. The main gap is the omission of <b>building</b> <b>services</b> in the scope of work of quantity surveyors which lead to the work being passed to the <b>building</b> <b>services</b> engineers. Traditionally, the quantity surveyors are not involved in <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost management. Therefore, quantity surveyors faced difficulty in understanding and interpreting mechanical and electrical components during measurement due to the non-availability of complete drawing. Furthermore, quantity surveyors are not well-skilled to manage <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost management and seldom included in the scope of works. Hence, it is recommended that <b>building</b> <b>services</b> training and Quantity Surveyor <b>Building</b> <b>Services</b> Programme {{should be included in the}} program syllabus and curriculum so as to enhance the knowledge of quantity surveyor and increase their involvement in the field. Quantity surveyors should be responsible and play their roles in controlling the cost of a project. They must have a thorough knowledge in <b>building</b> <b>services</b> work other than building works for them to venture into a wider scope of works...|$|R
40|$|Purpose– The survey {{reported}} here {{is intended to}} obtain {{an understanding of the}} general public's perception about <b>building</b> <b>services</b> and <b>building</b> <b>services</b> practitioners in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach– Targeting a sampling error of within ± 1 per cent at a confidence level of 95 per cent, a team of six surveyors conducted face‐to‐face interviews with 751 laypersons at places around 11 residential estates. Findings– Over 90 per cent of the general public know the presence of various <b>building</b> <b>services</b> installations in <b>buildings</b> and 12 per cent know that <b>building</b> <b>services</b> is the collective name of such installations. The general public are satisfied with the operability and reliability of <b>building</b> <b>services</b> installations but are just marginally satisfied with their performance at higher levels, such as energy conservation and indoor air quality control. Research limitations/implications– A paucity of teenagers know about <b>building</b> <b>services,</b> which is a concern to the future development of both the <b>building</b> <b>services</b> profession and the facilities management (FM) industry in Hong Kong. Future work may investigate the situation in other regimes with a similar FM setting and study on how the profession is perceived for buildings with restricted access to the general public. Operation and maintenance personnel of the FM offices, who are approached by most people when problems with <b>building</b> <b>services</b> installations arise, are the key on the perceived image of <b>building</b> <b>services</b> professionals. Originality/value– In addition to informing higher educational institutes the need to reinforcing promotion of <b>building</b> <b>services</b> engineering to school leavers, the findings can help professional institutions in formulating how the social status of <b>building</b> <b>services</b> engineers may be raised.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of cost estimates for construction projects {{is not an}} easy job, because construction projects are subject to risks and uncertainties, particularly at the inception stage, when very limited information about the project is available. However, the cost estimates prepared at this stage are usually the most important to the client. Nowadays, the costs for <b>building</b> <b>services</b> installations contribute a significant share of the total construction cost of building projects. Thus the accuracy of the <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost estimates {{plays an important role in}} the total building construction project cost estimates. Traditionally, <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost estimates are prepared by a deterministic single-figure (most likely) approach. This approach is often cost-ineffective and reactionary in nature. The risk management process (RMP) provides a logical consistent framework in identifying the risk factors affecting costs and in making allowances for risks in cost estimation. A survey was conducted to find out the current <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost estimation practices and to obtain an insight into the understanding, use and application of RMP in preparing <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost estimates within the <b>building</b> <b>services</b> industry. The results of the survey have suggested that the traditional deterministic cost estimation method is still being adopted by the majority of <b>building</b> <b>services</b> engineers in preparing cost estimates. Also, RMP has not been widely adopted by the <b>building</b> <b>services</b> industry in Hong Kong. From the analysis of <b>building</b> <b>services</b> firms and engineers with regard to the critical success factors for implementation of risk management, the survey reflects that the potential of implementing RMP for <b>building</b> <b>services</b> cost estimation is high. <b>Building</b> <b>services,</b> cost, estimating, risk, uncertainty,...|$|R
