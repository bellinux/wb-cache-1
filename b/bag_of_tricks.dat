A rich vocabulary of chords including sixth and thirteenth chords, ninth and add nine chords, and suspensions, show up in rhythm parts and solos. Free use of syncopations, chord anticipations (arriving at a chord change before the other players, often by an eighth-note) and crosspicking (repeating a three eighth-note pattern so that an accent falls variously on the upbeat or downbeat) are also in his <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> <b>tricks.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1798, Drury Lane {{suspended}} its {{tradition of}} staging an annual Christmas pantomime, {{which meant that}} Grimaldi had to seek work elsewhere during the festive period. The following year, {{with the help of}} his father-in-law, he joined the company at Sadler's Wells, where he played roles in several Charles Dibdin plays. Grimaldi made a big impression, especially in Dibdin's Easter 1800 pantomime, Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World, based on Robert Paltock's 1751 novel. For this elaborate production, which featured two Clowns (Dubois and Grimaldi), Dibdin introduced new costume designs. Clown's costume was [...] "garishly colourful ... patterned with large diamonds and circles, and fringed with tassels and ruffs," [...] instead of the tatty servant's outfit that had been used for a century. The production was a hit, and the new costume design was copied by others in London. Despite Dubois' [...] "endless <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> <b>tricks</b> [...] vast array of skills", his performance appeared artificial, in contrast to Grimaldi, who was better able to [...] "draw the audience into believing the essential comedic qualities" [...] of Clown.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the film was initially mixed. Some critics who were not usually favorable towards science fiction, such as Barry Norman of the BBC's Film series, were positive about the film's merits. Others, however, were not; reviews by Variety, Sight and Sound, Vincent Canby and Leonard Maltin were mixed or negative. (Maltin, however, reassessed the film upon {{the release of the}} Director's Cut and gave Alien a positive review.) A review by Time Out said the film was an [...] "empty <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> <b>tricks</b> whose production values and expensive trickery cannot disguise imaginative poverty". In a 1980 episode of Sneak Previews discussing science fiction films of the 1950s and 1970s, critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were critical of Alien. Ebert called it [...] "basically just an intergalactic haunted house thriller set inside a spaceship" [...] and one of several science fiction pictures that were [...] "real disappointments" [...] compared to Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and , though he did compliment the early scene of the Nostromo crew exploring the alien planet as showing [...] "real imagination". However, the film later made it onto Ebert's Great Movies list, where he gave it four stars and said [...] "Ridley Scott's 1979 movie is a great original." ...|$|E
500|$|Post {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the greatest albums of 1995 and the 1990s in general. It ranked highly in the end of year polls of French and German music magazines, including Les Inrockuptibles, Magic and Spex. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the record was also featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the year and the best albums of the decade. In Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll of 1995, the album placed at number seven. British magazines Mojo, Mixmag, Melody Maker, Select and The Face coincided on including Post in their end of year lists. Vibe included the album in its 1999 list of the 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century. Slant considered it the second best album of the decade in a 2011 list, only behind Björk's next release, Homogenic, writing it: [...] "is [...] most scatterbrained work to date, but it's tied together flawlessly by the singer's singular whimsicality". In 2003, Pitchfork listed it as the 20th best album of the decade, with William Morris writing, [...] "few artists on this list could rival [...] in terms of innovation, vision, talent, and high-yield experimentation, and Post was the record to establish this. In a 2012 article, Paste considered Post to be the sixty-fourth best album of the decade, with Ryan Reed stating: [...] "no Björk album is as weird (or weirdly wonderful) as 1995's Post, a dizzying whirlwind of sonic textures and stylistic shifts that demonstrates every facet of her ever-expanding <b>bag</b> <b>of</b> <b>tricks.</b> [...] Björk clearly aimed to demonstrate the meaninglessness of genre boundaries. She succeeded." [...] The British avant-garde music magazine The Wire included the album in its 2007 list of the 50 Records of the Year.|$|E

Stephen Holden from The New York Times, in his review of Houston's Radio City Music Hall concert on July 20, 1993, praised her attitude as a singer, writing, [...] "Whitney Houston is one of the few contemporary pop stars of whom it might be said: the voice suffices.

Attempts to combat this habit as a major health hazard have taken multitudinal directions, but the medical community has not been able to cope with this problem.
