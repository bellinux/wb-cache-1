2500|$|Reading about Grandin renewed Gerson Saines' [...] "energy, {{motivation}} and spirit" [...] {{in coping with}} her son's condition. [...] "Temple's story brought me hope and (her mother)'s story gave me direction and purpose," [...] Gerson Saines said in a later interview. [...] "Parents {{of a child with}} autism everywhere need to hear it, functionally and spiritually. I knew this story had to be told and given my access as a talent representative in the entertainment industry, I felt it was my responsibility to make that happen." [...] Through Grandin's agent, Gerson Saines asked to meet Grandin for lunch. [...] "She came in wearing her cowgirl shirt—-in her very Temple way, in her very Temple walk. I realized that there were people staring at her, and in a different lifetime I might have been one of them, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of was, 'I can't believe how lucky I am to be here. This woman's my hero.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Dick {{stared at}} the old hunter and {{likewise}} sniffed. I followed their lead, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> smell was the thick, piney odor of the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] {{she said}} (and I {{knew she was}} nodding her head sagaciously); I {{looked out at the}} room window, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see was a man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|E
60|$|It was my very thought! I did {{not sleep}} {{a single moment}} that night. <b>But,</b> after <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not recede.|$|R
60|$|I {{stopped the}} night-work, <b>but</b> this was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do for these neighbors.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> {{notwithstanding}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say {{to encourage}} him, Harry felt so bad, {{that nothing would}} do, but a rush to a neighboring bar, where we both gulped down a glass of ginger-pop; after which we felt better.|$|R
60|$|The {{magistrate}} complimented {{the woman}} on her muscular powers, and the court-room laughed; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see was a boy {{on the threshold of}} life, passionately crawling to muddy death, and there was no laughter in it.|$|E
6000|$|Colohan strode close, big and formidable. [...] "If {{you mean}} me, you're a liar," [...] he declared. [...] "An' don't say it!" [...] Coffee was plainly intimidated, and Colohan turned to Neale. [...] "Boss, I swear I wasn't {{in on this}} deal. Lately I guessed it was all wrong. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was obey orders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{stayed at}} Basoko for five days, partly at Dr. Grossule's request, [...] and partly in the {{endeavour}} {{to learn something}} of the operations [...] {{going on in the}} interior. Three canoe-loads of prisoners arrived, all [...] heavily loaded with chains. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn was that they were [...] sent in by Lieutenant Baron von Otter, who had been sent to the [...] promontory lying between the mouth of the Aruwimi and the Congo to [...] enforce the Labour Ordinances.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had been}} to the play With my pearl of a Peri - <b>But,</b> for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say, She {{declared}} she was weary, That [...] "the place was so crowded and hot, and she couldn't abide that Dundreary." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ada told me {{next day}} that Lord Bangley had condescended to express to her his great {{approval}} of my appearance and manner. I curtsied low when Ada told me, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say was, [...] "that {{the feeling was}} by no means reciprocal." ...|$|R
60|$|With the {{exception}} of this last <b>I</b> knew them <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not remember that {{they had all been}} Tynesiders.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{make use}} of {{was all that was}} valuable: I had enough to eat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me? If I killed more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed more corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them but for fuel, and that I had no {{occasion}} for but to dress my food.|$|E
6000|$|... "The one that, ages ago, one {{day when}} you and Van were here, we had the joke about. You {{produced}} it, in sport, as a 'fine' for something, {{and put it on}} that table; after which, before I knew what you were about, before I could run after you, you had gone off and ridiculously left it. Of course the next minute--and again before I could turn round--Harold had pounced on it, and I tried in vain to recover it from him. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get him to do--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{make use}} of, {{was all that}} was valuable: I had enough to eat, and to supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me?

60|$|And they {{heaved a}} mighty breath, every soul on board but me, As they saw her nose again {{pointing}} handsome out to sea; <b>But</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of, {{in the darkness}} and the cold, Was just that I was leaving home and my folks were growing old.|$|R
60|$|It {{was strange}} {{to be reduced}} to such {{indirect}} evidence on such a point as that; <b>but</b> it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get, and <b>I</b> had to be content with it.|$|R
60|$|Stroeve stopped {{again and}} mopped his face. I kept quite still. I {{believed}} him now, and <b>I</b> was astounded. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> the same <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not understand.|$|R
6000|$|... "A week later. I am already losing {{count of}} days, but days matter nothing. I have been busy, so busy that I {{have not even}} had time to write. After I had {{finished}} my story so far, Saleh's slave woman took me to Abdullah's house. I {{found that he was}} in a state of high fever, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was to recommend that a wet rag should be applied, and freshly wetted every quarter of an hour; that his head should be kept similarly enveloped, in wet bandages; and that his hands should be dipped in water very frequently.|$|E
60|$|The {{first time}} that I saw her was one autumn morning as I rode to town in a horse-car. It was early, and my only fellow-passenger was a crusty old gentleman, who sat in a corner, reading his paper; so when the car stopped, I glanced out to see who came next, hoping {{it would be a}} pleasanter person. No one {{appeared}} for a minute, and the car stood still, while both driver and conductor looked in the same direction without a sign of impatience. I looked also, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see was a little girl running across the park, as girls of twelve or thirteen seldom run nowadays, if any one can see them.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a day or}} two I {{have sat}} close and wrought hard at the HISTORY, and two more {{chapters}} are all but done. About thirty pages should go by this mail, which is not what should be, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> overtake. Will any one ever read it? I fancy not; people don't read history for reading, but for education and display - and who desires education in the history of Samoa, with no population, no past, no future, or the exploits of Mataafa, Malietoa, and Consul Knappe? [...] Colkitto and Galasp are a trifle to it. Well, it can't be helped, and it must be done, and, better or worse, it's capital fun. There are two to whom I have not been kind - German Consul Becker and English Captain Hand, R.N.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't overdo it, dear; that's <b>all.</b> <b>But,</b> Frank, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not rest}} if I {{went to bed}} without {{speaking}} to you. You made me unhappy to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} put a single right or really consoling thought into her head," [...] said she to herself; [...] "for {{as to the}} reading, she did not attend to that. <b>But</b> after <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have done it. I must be better myself before I try to improve other people; {{and it is not}} what I deserve to be allowed to be any comfort at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That shows a very Christian {{disposition}} on your part. And {{then there}} was Sir Harry. <b>I</b> understood it <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not hinder it. But {{it had to be}} done, hadn't it?--And now there will be an end of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|As my lord's death {{began to}} be daily the {{discourse}} of the family, I thought {{that he might be}} more reconciled if I entered into the arguments again, pro and con, which we had together before. I did so, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say was no satisfaction, till I importuned him on my knees, with a flood of tears. [...] "Madam," [...] said he, [...] "what would you have me do?" [...] "Do, my lord," [...] said I, [...] "only be so tender to my years and circumstances as to alter your will, or, at least, add a codicil to it; I desire nothing more, for I declare I had rather be a beggar, than live under my child's jurisdiction." [...] To this he agreed with some reluctance, and he added a codicil to his will.|$|E
6000|$|... "On the Sunday, after church, {{they went}} to Mr. Carr's. Though my advice was set at {{defiance}} in this way, I determined to persevere in keeping a stricter watch over my niece than ever. I felt that the maintaining the credit and reputation of the family rested with me, and I determined that I would try my best to uphold our good name. It is some little comfort to me, after all that has happened, to remember that I did my utmost {{to carry out this}} resolution. The blame of our dishonor lies not at my door. I disliked and distrusted Mr. Carr from the very first; and I tried hard to make others as suspicious of him as I was. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say, and all I could do, availed nothing against the wicked cunning of my niece. Watch and restrain her as I might, she was sure--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{might turn}} Methodist at any moment," [...] said Miss Cornelia. [...] "They {{tell me they}} went to the Methodist Church at Lowbridge quite as often as to the Presbyterian. I haven't caught them at it here yet, but I would not approve of taking Mrs. Jamieson into the Sunday School. Yet we must not offend them. We are losing too many people, by death or bad temper. Mrs. Alec Davis has left the church, no one knows why. She told the {{managers}} that she would never pay another cent to Mr. Meredith's salary. Of course, most people say that the children offended her, but somehow I don't think so. I tried to pump Faith, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get out of her was that Mrs. Davis had come, seemingly in high good humour, to see her father, and had left in an awful rage, calling them all 'varmints!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Rachel, dear, I did {{not mean}} it to have been so sudden or before them <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> indeed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help it," [...] {{she said in her}} gentle, imploring voice, [...] "if you only saw that poor dear child's neck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wet {{through to}} the skin, and starving!" [...] he declared. [...] "I thought I'd find {{something}} at Ketton, <b>but</b> it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to get Gibson, at the George, to lend me a horse. Give me a glass of wine, Jennings. I'll change my clothes--I expect you've kept them aired." ...|$|R
60|$|I made {{an effort}} to put {{something}} into the dear girl's hand as <b>I</b> spoke, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> the strength <b>I</b> <b>could</b> properly apply was not equal to the purpose. So tightly did she keep her little fingers compressed, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not succeed without a downright effort at force.|$|R
60|$|I was {{not sure}} the fish tired quickly, for I was so excited I had no thought of time, {{but it did not}} seem very long before I had him within fifty yards, {{sweeping}} in wide half-circles back of the boat. Occasionally I saw a broad, bright-green flash. When I was sure he was slowing up I put on the other drag and drew him closer. Then in the clear water we saw a strange, wild, graceful fish, the like of which we had never beheld. He was long, slender, yet singularly round and muscular. His color appeared to be blue, green, silver crossed by bars. His tail was big like that of a tuna, and his head sharper, more wolfish than a barracuda. He had a long, low, straight dorsal fin. We watched him swimming slowly to and fro beside the boat, and we speculated upon his species. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> decide was that I had a rare specimen for my collection.|$|E
60|$|Among all {{the sights}} of the docks, the noble truck-horses {{are not the}} least {{striking}} to a stranger. They are large and powerful brutes, with such sleek and glossy coats, that they look as if brushed and put on by a valet every morning. They march with a slow and stately step, lifting their ponderous hoofs like royal Siam elephants. Thou shalt not lay stripes upon these Roman citizens; for their docility is such, they are guided without rein or lash; they go or come, halt or march on, at a whisper. So grave, dignified, gentlemanly, and courteous did these fine truck-horses look--so full of calm intelligence and sagacity, that often I endeavored to get into conversation with them, as they stood in contemplative attitudes while their loads were preparing. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get from them was the mere recognition of a friendly neigh; though I would stake much upon it that, could I have spoken in their language, I would have derived from them {{a good deal of}} valuable information touching the docks, where they passed the whole of their dignified lives.|$|E
6000|$|Brackton {{set down}} the lantern and, pushing Slone outside, said: [...] "Jest a minnit, son," [...] and then he closed the door. [...] "Joel's been on my hands since the flood cut him off from home," [...] said Brackton. [...] "An' he's been some trial. But nobody else would have done nothin' for him, so I had to. I reckon I felt sorry for him. He cried like a baby thet had lost its mother. Then he gets wild-lookin' an' raved around. When I wasn't busy I {{kept an eye on}} him. But some of the time I couldn't, an' he stole drinks, which made him wuss. An' when I seen he was tryin' to sneak one of my guns, I up an' gets suspicious. Once he said, 'My dad's hosses are goin' to starve, an' I'm goin' to kill somebody!' He was out of his head an' dangerous. Wal, I was worried some, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was lock up my guns. Last night I caught him confabin' with some men out in the dark, behind the store. They all skedaddled except Joel, but I {{recognized}} Cordts. I didn't like this, nuther. Joel was surly an' ugly. An' when one of the riders called him he said: 'Thet boat NEVER DRIFTED OFF. Fer the night of the flood I went down there myself an' tied the ropes. They never come untied. Somebody cut them--jest before the flood--to make sure my dad's hosses couldn't be crossed. Somebody figgered the river an' the flood. An' if my dad's hosses starve I'm goin' to kill somebody!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then her {{thoughts}} went to Harry, to whom, indeed, {{during the last}} few years they had gone oftener than she would have admitted to herself. [...] "He is very faithful and kind and good, and I suppose one of these days I shall have to give in. He will not expect much, <b>but</b> he deserves <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give him." ...|$|R
5000|$|It's {{beginning}} to look like love, damn it. The kind of thing you read about in books, imagine that. I just don't get it, I guess I'm a little stupid. <b>But</b> by <b>all</b> means, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be wrong... The song was succeeded as Swedish representative in the 1969 contest by Tommy Körberg, singing [...] "Judy, min vän".|$|R
60|$|Desirous {{of being}} enlightened {{in regard to}} the meaning of this {{peculiar}} diversion, I turned inquiringly to Kory-Kory: that learned Typee immediately proceeded to explain the whole matter thoroughly. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> comprehend from what he said was, that the leaping figures before me were bereaved widows, whose partners had been slain in battle many moons previously; and who, at every festival, gave public evidence in this manner of their calamities. It was evident that Kory-Kory considered this an all-sufficient reason for so indecorous a custom; but I must say that it did not satisfy me as to its propriety.|$|R
