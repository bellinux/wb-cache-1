40|$|Buildings are {{evolving}} in height, construction materials, use, and compartmental composition at staggering pace. The {{tall buildings}} of today are {{a completely different}} entity {{to that of a}} decade ago with the propensity for change even greater in the immediate future. The advancements in structural engineering have arisen to make possible the increase in height, size and complexity. Forensic analyses of tall building fires have indicated that the needs of modern tall buildings are beyond the scope of applicability of current fire safety codes and engineering practices. The ever increasing heights combined with the limited number of vertical escape routes results in these two components becoming coupled. The considerable time that occupants spend within the stairwells means that for any fire strategy to be successful stairwells must remain smoke and heat free and the entire building structurally sound. Without adequate protection the number and width of stairwells is irrelevant, as smoke-logged stairwells are unusable and the Fire Safety Strategy is therefore void. Reported failure rates for stairwell smoke control systems are extremely high, this implies that safe stairwell tenability levels are currently not guaranteed, thus the cornerstone of contemporary tall building fire safety design may not be valid. This research project investigates current smoke control methods used for the protection of stairs in tall buildings through the review of literature and theory for the methodologies. In understanding the design assumption and actual stresses smoke control systems are subjected to, a novel concept for smoke control will be presented, investigated and developed. It is intended that this work will become a proof of concept, or otherwise for the novel smoke control system. Several conceptual smoke control systems were developed around the following principles; localised solution to minimise under or over pressurisation of the stairwell, performance be independent of fire size, perform under extreme environmental conditions and be effective when protecting a fully open door. Three concepts were investigated using CFD modelling, these being: - Concept 1 - vertical perimeter vents to the opening resulting in converging flow field - Concept 2 - concept 1 with the additional horizontal vent - Concept 3 – concept 2 with <b>baffle</b> <b>chamber</b> The preliminary modelling predicted that Concept 3 would provide the most robust solution. The provision of baffles provided stability to the vent flow which contained an area of high pressure within the <b>baffle</b> <b>chamber,</b> relatively to areas adjacent to the <b>baffle</b> <b>chamber,</b> this encouraged smoke flow away from the chamber. It appeared that the effectiveness of the system was a function of baffle flow and pressure load caused by wind and fire characteristics, the larger the pressure load across the door the greater the vent velocity required to limit or prevent smoke flow through the opening. Full-scale experiments were undertaken to prove in principle that the proposed baffle smoke control system can limit the passage of smoke through an opening under generated pressure loads. The experiments did demonstrate in principle the baffle smoke control system could be effective in limiting smoke flow through an open door under the pressure loads tested...|$|E
40|$|Phase 1 A of the Radiative Divertor Program (RDP) is now {{installed}} in the DIII-D tokamak located at General Atomics. This hardware was added to enhance both the Divertor and Advanced Tokamak research elements of the DIII-D program. This installation consists of a divertor baffle enveloping a cryocondensation pump at the upper outer divertor target of DIII-D. The divertor baffle consists of two toroidally continuous Inconel 625 water-cooled rings and a toroidal array of discontinuous radiatively-cooled plates. The water-cooled rings are each comprised of four quadrants, mechanically formed, chem. -milled, and resistance and TIG welded Inconel 625 panels. The supports attaching the panels to the vessel wall are designed to accommodate the differential thermal expansion between the rings and vessel during bake and to react the electromagnetic loads induced during disruptions. They are made from either Inconel 625 or Inconel 718 depending on the stress levels predicted in Finite Element Analysis. Gas seals are designed to limit the leakage from the <b>baffle</b> <b>chamber</b> back to the core plasma to 2, 500 {ell}/s and incorporate plasma sprayed alumina to minimize currents flowing through them. The bulk of the water-cooled ring fabrication was performed by a vendor, however, the final machining of penetrations in the conical ring for diagnostic access was performed in-house using a unique machining configuration. This configuration, and the machining of the diagnostic cutouts is described. Graphite tiles were machined from ATJ graphite to form a smooth plasma-facing surface.

Momentum separators are also referred to as impingement separators, <b>baffle</b> <b>chambers,</b> and knock-out chambers. Type of Technology: Removal of PM by gravitational settling and inertial collection. The particles are separated from the moving gas stream by providing a sharp change in direction of gas flow so that momentum carries the particles across the gas stream lines and into a hopper (EPA, 1982; Avallone, 1996). Applicable Pollutants: Momentum separators are used to control larger sized PM, primarily PM greater than 10 micrometers (µm) (PM 10) in aerodynamic diameter. Achievable Emission Limits/Reductions: The collection efficiency of a momentum separator varies as a function of particle size and the momentum separator’s design. Momentum separator efficiency generally increases with (1) increased particle size and/or density; (2) increased gas stream velocity; and (3) number of turns, baffles, or other sharp direction changes to gas flow. EPA (1982) presents a fractional collection efficiency curve for a momentum separator controlling flyash from a.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Transient {{computational}} fluid dynamic modeling {{in laboratory}} frame of reference was used to investigate baffled tube ram accelerator operating characteristics in inert and reactive mixtures. The minimum entrance Mach number that allowed supersonic projectile transit through a baffled tube filled with inert gas and the thrust generated in reactive flow were examined. The primary parameters considered were chamber-to-projectile diameter ratio, projectile geometry, baffle thickness, baffle spacing and baffle geometry. Axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations used a dynamic mesh for a projectile moving at constant Mach (ranging from 1. 8 to 5. 1) through stationary baffles. The maximum baffle thickness and minimum baffle spacing at velocities near the minimum allowable entrance Mach number were both found to be ~ 53 % of the projectile diameter. Further reducing the baffle spacing resulted in the projectile pushing a normal shockwave ahead of it like in a jet engine unstart. It was also found that thicker baffles and closer baffle spacing increased the projectile drag coefficient. Reactive flow phenomena were investigated by first establishing the combustion on the projectile in a smooth bore tube before it entered the baffled-tube section. A key finding from premixed methane and oxygen propellant simulations was that aftward-slanted baffles generated higher thrust than when the baffles were normal to the projectile or forward-slanted. This increase in thrust was associated with more complete propellant combustion in the annular <b>baffle</b> <b>chambers</b> around the tail and base sections of the axisymmetric projectile, as well as immediately behind it. It was also determined that residence time of the propellant during combustion process {{in the vicinity of}} the projectile at any given baffle, influences the overall thrust production. As the projectile Mach increases, both the propellant residence time and overall thrust level decrease...|$|R

40|$|At present, the {{manufacturing}} of musical instruments still strongly {{relies on the}} tacit knowledge of experienced handcrafts while is commonly based on standard machining or casting techniques. This limits the musician-tailoredness to {{a small group of}} players, while others take compromises by employing stock parts. The present article describes a new methodology for the design and production of woodwind instruments mouthpieces. By embracing digital modeling and manufacturing, this methodology encompasses four phases, which can be cut short when necessary. The aim of the presented methodology is to link the geometry of the mouthpiece to tone properties. Based on 3 D printing, the inside geometry can be altered to complex and reproducible detail to obtain the desired acoustic features - eventually leading to mouthpiece geometries tailored to the player’s sound and playability requirements. The results of aerodynamic investigations together with the subjective experience of saxophone players have been used to design mouthpieces with modified inside geometries of both <b>baffle</b> and <b>chamber.</b> Prototypes have been produced at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) using several 3 D printing technologies and different materials. Both professional and amateur saxophone players tested these at the Royal Conservatoire of The Hague and at the North Sea Jazz festival (Rotterdam 2012). Based on the judgment of the players, specific geometrical features were revealed to emphasize specific tone characteristics. A number of professional players are actively performing with our mouthpieces. The application and further development of the methodology will lead to a better empirical basis to reason about acoustics and playability, and can be applied to other instruments as well.

40|$|The {{development}} of improved performance {{models for the}} Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) is an important, ongoing program at NASA MSFC. These models allow prediction of overall system performance, as well as analysis of run-time anomalies which might adversely affect engine performance or safety. Due {{to the complexity of}} the flow fields associated with the SSME, NASA has increasingly turned to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques as modeling tools. An important component of the SSME system is the fuel preburner, which consists of a cylindrical chamber with a plate containing 264 coaxial injector elements at one end. A fuel rich mixture of gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen is injected and combusted in the chamber. This process preheats the hydrogen fuel before it enters the main combustion chamber, powers the hydrogen turbo-pump, and provides a heat dump for nozzle cooling. Issues of interest include the temperature and pressure fields at the turbine inlet and the thermal compatibility between the preburner chamber and injector plate. Performance anomalies can occur due to incomplete combustion, blocked injector ports, etc. The performance model should include the capability to simulate the effects of these anomalies. The current approach to the numerical simulation of the SSME fuel preburner flow field is to use a global model based on the MSFC sponsored FNDS code. This code does not have the capabilities of modeling several aspects of the problem such as detailed modeling of the coaxial injectors. Therefore, an effort has been initiated to develop a detailed simulation of the preburner coaxial injectors and provide gas phase boundary conditions just downstream of the injector face as input to the FDNS code. This simulation should include three-dimensional geometric effects such as proximity of injectors to <b>baffles</b> and <b>chamber</b> walls and interaction between injectors. This report describes an investigation into the numerical simulation of GH 2 /LOX coaxial injectors. The following sections will discuss the physical aspects of injectors, the CFD code employed, and preliminary results of a simulation of a single coaxial injector for which experimental data is available. It is hoped that this work will lay the foundation for the {{development of}} a unique and useful tool to support the SSME program...|$|R

The ROCCID program, written in Fortran 77, provides a standardized methodology using {{state of the}} art codes and procedures for the analysis of a liquid rocket engine combustor's steady state combustion performance and combustion stability. The ROCCID is currently capable of analyzing mixed element injector patterns containing impinging like doublet or unlike triplet, showerhead, shear coaxial and swirl coaxial elements as long as only one element type exists in each injector core, baffle, or barrier zone. Real propellant properties of oxygen, hydrogen, methane, propane, and RP- 1 are included in ROCCID. The properties of other propellants can be easily added. The analysis models in ROCCID can account for the influences of acoustic cavities, helmholtz resonators, and radial thrust <b>chamber</b> <b>baffles</b> on combustion stability. ROCCID also contains the logic to interactively create a combustor design which meets input performance and stability goals.
