5|$|Sega AM2's {{first attempt}} in the genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival, but gained renown {{with the release}} of Virtua Fighter for the same {{platform}} the same year. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>motion</b> as seen in other fighting games. With only three buttons, it was easier to learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, having six and five buttons respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio.|$|E

40|$|Coverage path {{planning}} is {{the determination of}} a path that a robot must take in order to pass over each point in an environment. Applications include vacuuming, floor scrubbing, and inspection. We developed the boustrophedon cellular decomposition, which is an exact cellular decomposition approach, {{for the purposes of}} coverage. Each cell in the boustrophedon is covered with simple <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>motions.</b> Once each cell is covered, then the entire environment is covered. Therefore, coverage is reduced to finding an exhaustive path through a graph which represents the adjacency relationships of the cells in the boustrophedon decomposition.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new algorithm to cover an unknown space with a homogeneous team of circular mobile robots. Our approach {{is based on a}} single robot cover-age algorithm, a boustrophedon approach, which di-vides the target two-dimensional space into regions called cells, each of which can be covered with sim-ple <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>motions.</b> Single robot coverage is then achieved by ensuring that the robot visits each cell. The new multi-robot coverage algorithm uses the same planar cell-based approach as the single robot approach, but also prescribes the methods by which multiple robots cover a cell, teams are allocated among cells, and sub-teams of robots share information in a minimalistic manner. The advantage of this method is that planning occurs in a two dimensional configura-tion space for a team of n robots, bypassing the need to plan in a 2 n dimensional configuration space. The approach is semi-decentralized: robot teams cover the space independent of each other, but robots within a team communicate state and share information...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{greatest}} challenges in microrobotic is to handle individually a large number of objects in a short time, for applications such as cell sorting and assembly of microcomponents. This ability to handle a large number of microobjects {{is directly related to the}} size of the microrobot. This paper proposes a theoretical study of the size of a magnetic microrobot maximizing its capacity of displacement. It demonstrates that there is an optimal size can be obtained, due to a trade-off between the inertial and the viscous effects. Analyticalexpressions of the optimal size and the related frequency of motion are derived from a simplified model to highlight the influence of the geometrical and the physical parameters of the magnetic manipulation system such as the viscosity of the liquid and the size of the workspace. A numerical simulation validates the analytical analysis and demonstrates a high displacement capacity of the microrobot (around 100 <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>motions</b> per second for a robot of around 20 µm in water) ...|$|R

Moving the {{eccentric}} arm back and forth lowered and raised the top of the main link. This motion was translated by the bellcrank into <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>motion</b> of the radius rod. The angle of the yoke controlled the relative motion, and therefore the cutoff; tilting the yoke backwards reversed the motion of the radius rod.|$|E

40|$|During {{development}} of the vertebrate neuroepithelium, the nucleus in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) moves from the apex toward the base {{and returns to the}} apex (called interkinetic nuclear migration) at which point the cell divides. The fate of the resulting daughter cells is thought to depend on the sampling by the moving nucleus of a spatial concentration profile of the cytoplasmic Notch intracellular domain (NICD). However, the nucleus executes complex stochastic motions including random waiting <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>motions,</b> which can expose the nucleus to randomly varying levels of cytoplasmic NICD. How nuclear position can determine daughter cell fate despite the stochastic nature of nuclear migration is not clear. Here we derived a mathematical model for reaction, diffusion, and nuclear accumulation of NICD in NPCs during interkinetic nuclear migration (INM). Using experimentally measured trajectory-dependent probabilities of nuclear turning, nuclear waiting times and average nuclear speeds in NPCs in the developing zebrafish retina, we performed stochastic simulations to compute the nuclear trajectory-dependent probabilities of NPC differentiation. Comparison with experimentally measured nuclear NICD concentrations and trajectory-dependent probabilities of differentiation allowed estimation of the NICD cytoplasmic gradient. Spatially polarized production of NICD, rapid NICD cytoplasmic consumption and the time-averaging effect of nuclear import/export kinetics are sufficient to explain the experimentally observed differentiation probabilities. Our computational studies lend quantitative support to the feasibility of the nuclear concentration-sensing mechanism for NPC fate determination in zebrafish retina...|$|R
