50|$|Exposure to estrogens (xenoestrogens) may be also easily {{assessed}} in fish, reptiles or birds by measuring their vitellogenin (VTG) plasma levels. An example is that {{expression of the}} egg yolk precursor protein vitellogenin can be measured by the E-SCREEN test in juvenile brown trout. Usually, vitellogenin is only produced by female fish, because it is estrogen-dependent. Nevertheless, the synthesis of this protein in males and young fish can also occur, as xenoestrogens can also affect the hepatic receptors and activate it. Hence, a frequently used <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to estrogen active substances in the environment is the measurement of vitellogenin levels in male and juvenile trout.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background This article {{describes}} the data mining analysis <b>of</b> a clinical <b>exposure</b> study <b>of</b> 3585 adult smokers and 1077 nonsmokers. The analysis focused on developing models for four <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> potential harm (BOPH) : {{white blood cell count}} (WBC), 24 h urine 8 -epi-prostaglandin F 2 Î± (EPI 8), 24 h urine 11 -dehydro-thromboxane B 2 (DEH 11), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Methods Random Forest was used for initial variable selection and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline was used for developing the final statistical models Results The analysis resulted in the generation of models that predict each of the BOPH as function of selected variables from the smokers and nonsmokers. The statistically significant variables in the models were: platelet count, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, race and <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to cigarette smoke for WBC (R-squared = 0. 29); creatinine clearance, liver enzymes, weight, vitamin use and <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> for EPI 8 (R-squared = 0. 41); creatinine clearance, urine creatinine excretion, liver enzymes, use of Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, vitamins and <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> for DEH 11 (R-squared = 0. 29); and triglycerides, weight, age, sex, alcohol consumption and <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> for HDL (R-squared = 0. 39). Conclusions Levels of WBC, EPI 8, DEH 11 and HDL were statistically associated with <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to cigarette smoking and demographics and life style factors.

50|$|Another {{method to}} assess {{chlorfenvinphos}} exposure is {{to measure the}} activity of cholinesterases in the blood. Two pools of cholinesterases exist in the blood: acetylcholinesterase in erythrocytes and pseudocholinesterase in plasma. The acetylcholinesterase in erythrocytes {{is identical to the}} acetylcholinesterase found in neuromuscular tissue. The function of plasma pseudocholinesterase is unknown, but its activity {{is considered to be a}} more sensitive biomarker for organophosphate exposure than erythrocyte cholinesterase activity. The inhibition of the individual cholinesterases or the inhibition of their combined activity can be used as a marker of exposure. However, cholinesterase inhibition is caused by all anticholinesterase compounds and is therefore not a specific biomarker for chlorfenvinphos. In addition, the activity of cholinesterases in the blood varies in populations and there are no studies which have measured a correlation between chlorfenvinphos exposure and cholinesterase inhibition. There have been suggestions that chlorfenvinphos or its metabolites would be a better <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> than its cholinesterase activity inhibition.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{biomarkers}} {{in monitoring}} aquatic environments is nowadays a common practice, fish and bivalves being mostly chosen as target-species. Since {{it is often}} difficult to estimate the possible adverse effects due to contamination on selected ecosystems, a multi-species strategy should be adopted. In this context, we applied the biomarker approach to the Mediterranean crab Carcinus aestuarii, which could provide different and/or additional information with respect to fish and bivalves. In this work we evaluated the possible use of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, measured in different crab tissues (gills and hemolymph), as <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to neurotoxic compounds. Crabs were exposed for 96 h to various sublethal concentrations of Chlorpyrifos (CP). A significant inhibition of AChE activity was shown from 5 mg CP/L in the hemolymph and at 15 mg CP/L in gills. These preliminary results suggest that measurement of AChE activity is a useful <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to neurotoxic compounds in C. aestuarii...|$|E

40|$|Biomarkers {{indicate}} the status or condition {{of a specific}} biological property. In principle, biomarkers are generally classified into three categories: <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> effect, and <b>biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> susceptibility 1, 2, 3. <b>Biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> indicate that the organism is or has been exposed to a specific class of xenobiotics or environmental conditions. <b>Biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> effect are indicative of alterations in molecular and cellular processes of an organism {{as a result of}} a xenobiotic or environmental <b>exposure.</b> <b>Biomarkers</b> <b>of</b> susceptibility reflect the risk for which an organism may acquire an altered physiological condition.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of metallothioneins (MT) in fish as <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to mercury has been questioned. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating {{the relationship between}} external levels of exposure, mercury accumulation and MT content, assessing species and tissue specificities. Two ecologically different fish species â Dicentrarchus labrax and Liza aurata â were surveyed in an estuary historically affected by mercury discharges. Total mercury (T-Hg) and MT content were determined in gills, blood, liver, kidney, muscle and brain. All tissues reflected differences in T-Hg accumulation in both species, although D. labrax accumulated higher levels. Regarding MT, D. labrax revealed a depletion in brain MT content and an incapacity to induce MT synthesis in all the other tissues, whereas L. aurata showed the ability to increase MT in liver and muscle. Tissue-specificities were exhibited in the MT inducing potential and in the susceptibility to MT decrease. L. aurata results presented muscle as the most responsive tissue. None of the investigated tissues displayed significant correlations between T-Hg and MT levels. Overall, the applicability of MT content in fish tissues as <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to mercury was uncertain, reporting limitations in reflecting the metal exposure levels and the subsequent accumulation extent...|$|E

The following biomarkers were chosen: total haemocyte count and lysozyme activity in cell-free haemolymph as immunomarkers, acetylcholinesterase activity in gills as a <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to neurotoxic compounds, vitellogenin-like protein levels in both digestive gland and cell-free haemolymph as a <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to estrogenic compounds, and survival-in-air widely used to evaluate general stress conditions in clams.

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether the NMP metabolite N-methylsuccinimide (MSI) in plasma and urine can be used as a <b>biomarker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to NMP. METHODS: Six healthy subjects were exposed to 10, 25, and 50 mg NMP/m 3 in an exposure chamber for 8 h. The air levels were monitored by XAD- 7 solid sorbent sampling, and analysed by gas chromatography (GC). Plasma and urine were sampled for two days following the exposure, and the levels of MSI were analysed by GC with mass spectrometric detection. RESULTS: The concentration of MSI in plasma and urine rose during the exposure, and reached a peak at about 4 h after the end of the exposure. The concentration then decayed according to a one-compartment model with a half-time of approximately 8 h. About 1 % of the inhaled NMP was excreted in urine as MSI. There were very close correlations between the NMP air levels and, on the one hand, the MSI concentrations in plasma collected at the end of exposure (r = 0. 98), or the urinary MSI concentration collected during the last 2 h of exposure (r = 0. 96), on the other.
