40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the addition of <b>bismuth</b> <b>subcarbonate</b> with different concentrations regarding the rheological properties of an experimental epoxy-based root canal sealer. Materials and Methods: Endodontic sealers were prepared with epoxy resin-based sealer with <b>bismuth</b> <b>subcarbonate</b> additions of 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 %, 100 %, and 120 %. Flow, film thickness, working time, setting time, dimensional change, sorption, solubility, and cytotoxicity were studied according to the ISO standards. Data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA, and Tukey multiple comparisons were used, with a significance level of 5 %. Results: The flow, working time, water sorption, and solubility significantly decreased and the film thickness and dimensional change increased with higher filler particle addition. There were no statistically significant differences for setting time and cytotoxicity between the filler particle proportions. Conclusion: Experimental resin-based sealer with <b>bismuth</b> <b>subcarbonate</b> addition up to 40 % can be an alternative for root canal sealer...|$|E

40|$|The {{dispersion}} of the linear and nonlinear optical susceptibilities of <b>bismuth</b> <b>subcarbonate</b> Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 are calculated using density functional theory (DFT). We have employed the state-of-art all-electron full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method. Calculations are performed within the recently modified Becke Johnson potential (mBJ) {{to obtain the}} self consistency conditions. The calculated linear optical susceptibilities exhibit a considerable anisotropy which is useful for second harmonic generation (SHG) and optical parametric oscillation (OPO). The calculated absorption coefficient show good agreement with the available experimental data. The values of calculated uniaxial anisotropy delta epsilon = - 0. 168 and the birefringence Delta n(0) = 0. 166 indicate considerable anisotropy. The calculated SHG of the dominant component vertical bar chi((2)) (322) (omega) vertical bar is about d(32) = 5. 3 pm/V at lambda = 1064 nm (1. 165 eV) which is in excellent agreement with the available experimental data (d(32) = 5. 49 pm/V) obtained using pulsed Nd:YAG laser at wavelength lambda = 1064 nm (10 ns, 3 mj 10 kHz). To analyze {{the origin of the}} high SHG of <b>bismuth</b> <b>subcarbonate</b> Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 we have correlated the features of vertical bar chi((2)) (322) (omega) vertical bar spectra with the features of epsilon(2) (omega) spectra as a function of omega/ 2 and omega...|$|E

Among {{the components of the}} cement, sodium tetraborate presented the greatest antimicrobial activity, both in type and diameter of the halo and ring of inhibition. Sealer powder, rosin, and eugenol presented similar activity, with no effect on P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. Among these, only eugenol had an effect on E. coli.

These Bi(2) O(3) and (BiO) (2) CO(3) nanotubes exhibited excellent Cr(VI) -removal capacity. Bi(2) O(3) nanotubes, with a maximum Cr(VI) -removal capacity of 79 mg g(- 1), possessed high removal ability in a wide range of pH values (3 - 11). Moreover, Bi(2) O(3) and (BiO) (2) CO(3) nanotubes also displayed highly efficient photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation. This work not only demonstrates a new and facile route for the fabrication of Bi(2) O(3) and (BiO) (2) CO(3) nanotubes, but also provides new promising adsorbents for the removal of heavy-metal ions and potential photocatalysts for environmental remediation...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} X-ray {{diffraction}} data of Huang et al. we have optimized the atomic positions by minimization {{of the forces}} (1 mRy/au) using Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA). From the relaxed geometry the electronic structure and the chemical bonding are determined. We have employed the full potential linear augmented plane wave (FPLAPW) method as embodied in the WIEN 2 k code. In {{order to get a}} better estimate of the energy gap we have used the modified Becke-Johnson potential (mBJ) exchange-correlation potential. Our calculations show that the conduction band minimum (CBM) is situated at the centre of the Brillouin zone (BZ) and the valence band maximum (VBM) is located between W and T symmetry points of the BZ, indicating that <b>bismuth</b> <b>subcarbonate</b> is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap of about 0. 8 eV. The electrons effective mass ratio (m(e) (*) /me) around G point are calculated. The partial density of states and the electronic charge density distribution shows that there exists a strong covalent bond between C and O atoms. Our calculated bond lengths and angles show very good agreement with the experimental data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserve...|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{economic}} and abundant bismuth-containing semiconductors have been attracted large attention for diverse applications, {{especially in the}} area of energy conversion and environmental treatment [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The <b>bismuth</b> <b>subcarbonate</b> (Bi 2 O 2 CO 3) {{is one of the most}} interesting semiconductor with a large bang gap of 3.3  eV. It belongs to the layered Aurivillius-related oxide family, consisting of Bi 2 O 2 2 + layers sandwiched between two slabs of CO 3 2 − layers [22]. However, the use of Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 in light harvesting applications is very limited because it can absorb only UV light. To overcome this drawback, several 3 D hierarchical Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 architectures composed of nanosheets, nanoplates and microspheres have been developed [23, 24]. The coupling of Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 with other materials to construct heterojunctions has also been shown as an advantages approach to improve the visible light responsive activity and to facilitate the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Different low band gap semiconductors and polymers have been used to improve the photocatalytic activity of Bi 2 O 2 CO 3. Liu et al. constructed hierarchical graphene–Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 composites which exhibit a significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic performance [25]. Good visible light photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of Rhodamine B was reported by Zhang et al. for n–n heterostructured Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 /Bi 2 WO 6 [26]. Zhou’s group reported that PANI decorated Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 nanosheets exhibited a four to half times better photocatalytic activity for degradation of Rhodamine B in comparison to Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 nanosheets under visible light illumination [27]. Recently, p–n heterojunction Ag 2 O/Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 photocatalysts was shown to manifest an excellent visible light activity for degradation of MB and methyl orange [28].|$|E
40|$|Although other {{investigators}} {{have attempted to}} demonstrate that histamine has the power of producing acute ulcers when injected locally into the stomach wall, our experiments show clearly {{that this is a}} very inconstant finding for, of six instances, we were only able to obtain a small healed mucosal ulcer in one. Even when dilute acid (0. 3 per cent hydrochloric acid) was fed to these animals they did not develop ulcers or erosions. It has also been stated that histamine, given subcutaneously, may produce ulcers secondarily to oversecretion of acid, especially when at the same time histamine has been injected into the stomach wall. We have been unable to confirm this observation. In our series of experiments on dogs which were observed over a varying period of time ranging from 4 to 95 days we utilized other substances in addition to histamine. After establishing controls, sterile water, normal saline, 50 per cent glucose, skimmed milk, whole milk, omnadin, lipiodol, <b>bismuth</b> <b>subcarbonate,</b> pituitrin (S.), activin, histamine, adrenalin and insulin were injected into the muscular coat of the stomach and it was found that such procedures rarely produced any definite changes in the stomach mucosa even when supplemented by the feeding of dilute hydrochloric acid (0. 3 per cent hydrochloric acid). We were able to demonstrate conclusively that the trauma involved in our operative procedure could not in itself account for any of the pathological findings. We were also able to show that the pressure due to the injected materials did not produce erosions or ulcerations. The injections of acids produced varying results. Diluted acid (0. 3 per cent) injected into the stomach wall gave almost uniformly negative results but when combined with the feeding of acid of equal strength erosions were occasionally produced. Our results with 0. 5 per cent hydrochloric add were also inconstant. The 1 per cent hydrochloric acid produced, in many instances, definite ulcerations even when not accompanied by the feeding of acid...|$|E
