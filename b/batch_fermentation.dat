In fed-batch fermentations, where 600 µg. mL– 1 linoleic acid was added into the culture after exponential growth, a rapid but short con-version period occurred. Thus, both actively growing and non-growing cultures were able to effec-tively form CLA. However, the production rates per cell were significantly higher in growing cultures.

The approach uses a sliding window to capture the present statistical properties of filtering and mass-balance residuals. In order to avoid divergence of the nonlinear monitor filter, the maximum likelihood states and parameters are periodically estimated. The maximum likelihood parameters are used to update the kinetic parameter values of the monitor filter. If the occurrence of a fault is detected, alternative faulty model structures are evaluated statistically through the use of log-likelihood function values and χ 2 detection tests.
