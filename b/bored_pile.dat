50|$|During the {{construction}} of the Verbindungsbahn section underneath tracks 1 through 3 of the Hauptbahnhof, no more than one main line track was scheduled to be taken out of service at any time. For this reason, a makeshift platform was constructed at the north-westerly track 1a, and the excavation pit was split lengthwise into two lateral pieces. Construction was done utilizing the cut-and-cover top-down method, where the outer shell was made up of a 28-metre-deep <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> wall, on top of which the roof structure of the tunnel was built. The tracks and platforms where then reconstructed on this tunnel roof by May 1974, which meant the complete resumption of main line traffic. Underneath the roof structure, space was then excavated from the top down, and the inner shell was constructed, consisting of a floor and inner walls, which carried the roofs of up to three internal levels. On the topmost internal level, an underground parking garage with 120 spaces was built, which doubled as a civilian shelter, secure against airborne agents, such as poison gas, and nuclear attack, with a capacity for 4,500 persons. The inner shell was completed at the end of 1975.|$|E
50|$|When the {{planning}} application for Phase 4 was submitted, {{it was expected}} that construction would commence in July or August 2007. Construction of Phase 3 commenced in July 2007. Bachy Soletanche Ltd, who received the £1.5 million contract, commenced work on the site by installing a deep contiguous piled wall around the site. The 220 m perimeter wall consists of 241 contiguous piles, which were chosen by project design consultant WSP. The piles are 750 mm in diameter. The piles will hold back the ground that consists of a few metres of fill, then a 3 m to 5 m thick sand layer which becomes weathered sandstone further down. Because the bedrock slopes from 2 m to 14 m down across the site, the piles must be up to 17.5 m deep. As excavation on the site commenced, the company installed 70 ground anchors to the wall. Each of the anchors are 15 m long and 178 mm diameter. These are for temporary support of the wall whilst the basement is being constructed. When construction is completed, they will remain. Some of the piles were drilled using a cased Large Diameter Auger (LDA) rotary bored piling method, while other parts of the wall were drilled using the Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) method. Alongside the contiguous piled wall, Bachy Soletanche Ltd also constructed ten 1200 mm diameter LDA plunge column piles and fourteen 750 mm diameter bearing piles.Ten plunge columns were installed on the site for the main access ramp. These consisted of large, steel H-section columns surrounded by pea gravel within their pile casings. Bachy Soletanche installed a basic <b>bored</b> <b>pile</b> with casing and then used its special plunge column rig to achieve the 5 mm accuracy needed for the positioning of the I section steel columns.

40|$|The {{development}} of limit-state design codes for large-diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> requires a careful calibration of design methods in use. Both capacity and serviceability requirements must be satisfied in limit state design. Due to various source of uncertainty in subsurface conditions, construction effects, errors in obtaining soil or rock properties, and imperfection of prediction models, the estimated capacity and settlement values from various design methods vary widely {{and the corresponding}} reliability levels are not clearly known. This study aims to evaluate the performance of design methods for predicting the capacity and settlement of large-diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles.</b> A database of load tests on large-diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> in Hong Kong is collected and {{used as the basis}} for performance evaluation. To facilitate the design for the ultimate limit states, six pile-capacity prediction methods for <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> founded in soils and four methods for piles socketed in rocks are evaluated. The capability of these design methods to estimate individual resistance components and the total capacity is separately evaluated. Construction effects, particularly the use of permanent liners, pile-shaft grouting, and time delay between the end of pile excavation and concreting, are explicitly considered. Several empirical correlations are established {{based on the results of}} pile-load tests in the database. The performance of these empirical correlations is also evaluated. To facilitate design for the serviceability limit states, which is an important area under research, four pile settlement analysis methods for <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> founded in soils and three methods for <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> socketed in rocks are evaluated.

Generally, the design for side shear resistance (often called skin friction) of large diameter <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> (drilled caissons or shafts) in saprolites involves considerable uncertainty and design parameters must usually be verified by field tests. In this paper, 28 full-scale load tests on large diameter machine <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> constructed in various saprolitic soils were reviewed in detail, in particular the degree of mobilization of side shear resistance using a mobilization rating factor. The diameter of these floating piles ranges from 1. 0 m to 1. 5 m and the depth from 22 m to 75 m. The authors were heavily involved in the recent construction and testing of 12 of these <b>piles.</b> For <b>bored</b> <b>piles</b> constructed under water, 90 % ultimate side shear resistance was mobilized at an average local pile displacement of 1. 9 % of the pile diameter with a 95 % confidence range of 0. 9 % to 3. 0 %.
