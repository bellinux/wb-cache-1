50|$|Southern bog lemmings {{are found}} in eastern North America, from {{southern}} Quebec and Manitoba in Canada to western Minnesota, to southwestern Kansas, and east to the Atlantic coast of the United States. This species {{is more common in}} deciduous and mixed coniferous -deciduous forests.

Northern range extensions are recorded for the pygmy shrew, arctic shrew, muskrat, heather vole, northern <b>bog</b> <b>lemming</b> and wood frog. A southern range {{extension of the}} arctic ground squirrel is noted following its being observed {{for the first time}} in Manitoba. Observation of a great blue heron at Churchill, far from its usual range in southern Manitoba, is also recorded. The number of species of small mammals on two-hectare quadrats in marsh, prairie, shrub, and savanna along the grassland-coniferous forest transition in southern Mani-toba was 1. 8 to 3. 0 times greater than in beach-meadow, tundra, shrub, and open-forest quadrats along the coniferous forest-tundra transition of northern Manitoba, while the total population was 1. 8 to 3. 4 times greater.

40|$|Of {{approximately}} 81 {{species of}} mammals present in Nebraska today, 55 {{occur in the}} Sand Hills, with an additional three species that are associated only with the Niobrara River. Nebraska {{as a whole is}} truly a crossroads for mammals because two-thirds of the species reach their distributional limits in the state (Jones, 1964). Most of these mammals are widespread species or are specific to the grasslands as a whole and are not affected by this sandy zone. Jones (1964) wrote that “only a few mammals are restricted to this area. Mostly it serves to filter western species moving east and, in part, eastern species moving west, although some of the latter have passed through the area along the riparian [river] community bordering the Platte River. ” On the other hand, the Sand Hills appear to be a barrier to the distribution of some mammals. The eastern woodrat is a southern species that during a warmer, wetter time moved north. Today an isolated population occurs only along the Niobrara River in central Nebraska. Another mammal, the olive-backed pocket mouse, is found north of the Niobrara River in Cherry County and in the Panhandle, but evidently it does not inhabit the Sand Hills. The Sand Hills, with their extraordinary variety of habitats from dune top to interdunal wetland and river bank, provide habitats for many different types of mammals. The drier upland Sand Hills have an abundance of plains pocket gophers, plains pocket mice, Ord’s kangaroo rats, prairie voles, and deer mice. Wet areas are characterized by the masked shrew, jumping mouse, meadow vole, and muskrat. The open areas, such as ridge tops and blowouts, tend to be the best microhabitat for kangaroo rats, which are bipedal and fast-moving; the dense grass microhabitat is favored by voles, which are quadrapedal and slow moving. Typically, kangaroo rats are from western, drier habitats, and voles are from eastern, moister habitats. In the Sand Hills, however, these two mammals occur together because of the mosaic of sand and grass (Lemen and Freeman, 1986).
