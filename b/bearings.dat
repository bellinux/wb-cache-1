5|$|Silicon nitride <b>bearings</b> {{are both}} full ceramic <b>bearings</b> and ceramic hybrid <b>bearings</b> with balls in {{ceramics}} and races in steel. Silicon nitride ceramics have good shock resistance {{compared to other}} ceramics. Therefore, ball <b>bearings</b> made of silicon nitride ceramic are used in performance <b>bearings.</b> A representative example is use of silicon nitride <b>bearings</b> in the main engines of the NASA's Space Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball <b>bearings</b> are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with {{lubrication}} starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal <b>bearings.</b> Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball <b>bearings</b> {{can be found in}} high end automotive <b>bearings,</b> industrial <b>bearings,</b> wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride <b>bearings</b> are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.|$|E

40|$|To improve {{hydrodynamic}} journal <b>bearing</b> steady-state {{and dynamic}} performance, a new <b>bearing</b> concept, the wave journal <b>bearing,</b> was {{developed at the}} author's lab. This concept features a waved inner <b>bearing</b> diameter. Compared to other alternative <b>bearing</b> geometries used to improve <b>bearing</b> performance such as spiral or herring-bone grooves, steps, etc., the wave <b>bearing's</b> design is relatively simple and allows the shaft to rotate in either direction. A three-wave <b>bearing</b> operating with a compressible lubricant, i. e., gas is analyzed using a numerical code. Its performance is compared to a plain (truly) circular <b>bearing</b> over {{a broad range of}} <b>bearing</b> working parameters, e. g., <b>bearing</b> numbers from 0. 01 to 100...|$|R
40|$|The analysis, design, {{and testing}} of the hybrid boost <b>bearing</b> are discussed. The hybrid boost <b>bearing</b> {{consists}} of a fluid film <b>bearing</b> coupled in parallel with a rolling element <b>bearing.</b> This coupling arrangement makes use of the inherent advantages of both the fluid film and rolling element <b>bearing</b> {{and at the same}} time minimizes their disadvantages and limitations. The analytical optimization studies that lead to the final fluid film <b>bearing</b> design are reported. The <b>bearing</b> consisted of a centrifugally-pressurized planar fluid film thrust <b>bearing</b> with oil feed through the shaft center. An analysis of the test ball <b>bearing</b> is also presented. The experimental determination of the hybrid <b>bearing</b> characteristics obtained on the basis of individual <b>bearing</b> component tests and a combined hybrid <b>bearing</b> assembly is discussed and compared to the analytically determined performance characteristics...|$|R
5|$|However, the Imme {{began to}} develop problems, {{especially}} with the single-sided crankshaft <b>bearings</b> and the freewheel for the kick starter. Riedel corrected the problem beginning with the Model D version, which had a conventional crankshaft with two <b>bearings.</b> However, the profit from sales {{was not enough to}} cover the warranty expenses, and, by the end of 1950, Riedel AG went bankrupt with debts of 1.25millionDeutschmark.|$|E

5|$|Space is also crisscrossed with {{continuum}} fluxes, coordinate pairs {{that allow}} instantaneous travel between them without consuming fuel. Travel via fluxes cuts down significantly on fuel costs and travel time, though it causes {{all but the}} most accomplished navigators to lose their <b>bearings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{fluid film}} of the <b>bearing</b> is air that flows through the <b>bearing</b> itself to the <b>bearing</b> surface. The design of the air <b>bearing</b> is such that, {{although}} the air constantly escapes from the <b>bearing</b> gap, the pressure between {{the faces of the}} <b>bearing</b> is enough to support the working loads.|$|R
40|$|A resilient-pad gas thrust <b>bearing</b> {{that does}} not contain any {{elastomers}} in the <b>bearing</b> assembly is described and analyzed.

40|$|The {{resultant}} force {{acting on the}} moving part of the ceramic aerostatic linear <b>bearing</b> is measured highly accurately as the inertial force of the moving part of the <b>bearing</b> {{by means of the}} levitation mass method (LMM). The measurement results of the ceramic aerostatic linear <b>bearing</b> and metal aerostatic linear <b>bearing</b> of different mass are compared. The regression equation of the ceramic aerostatic linear <b>bearing</b> and metal aerostatic linear <b>bearing</b> are calculated. The ceramic linear <b>bearing</b> and metal linear <b>bearing</b> have extremely small frictional force...|$|R
5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to the axle <b>bearings</b> and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller <b>bearings</b> and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel trailing truck, rocking grate, hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{version of}} the Baldwin, Lyn - looking {{externally}} similar to the 1898 original, but employing several advanced steam technologies, including roller <b>bearings,</b> welded tanks, Lempor exhaust system, and a high-pressure boiler - was completed in 2017. Its first public steaming took place on 8 July 2017 at Alan Keef Ltd. Lyn was delivered to Woody Bay in September 2017, and first ran there on 28 September.|$|E
5|$|First, the {{assigned}} herald develops a written description based on {{consultation with the}} petitioner. The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design. The Fraser Herald, serving as the CHA's principal artist, must review the design. At all stages the documents {{must be approved by}} both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a drawing of the armorial <b>bearings</b> and the accompanying legal text and explanation of the symbolism of the <b>bearings.</b> Under Canadian bilingualism laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.|$|E
5000|$|A plain <b>bearing</b> (in railroading {{sometimes}} called a solid <b>bearing)</b> is the simplest type of <b>bearing,</b> comprising just a <b>bearing</b> surface and no rolling elements. Therefore, the [...] (i.e., {{the part of}} the shaft in contact with the <b>bearing)</b> slides over the <b>bearing</b> surface. The simplest example of a plain <b>bearing</b> is a shaft rotating in a hole. A simple linear <b>bearing</b> can be a pair of flat surfaces designed to allow motion; e.g., a drawer and the slides it rests on or the ways on the bed of a lathe.|$|R

5|$|In 1735 Harrison {{built his}} first chronometer, which he {{steadily}} improved {{on over the}} next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, {{including the use of}} <b>bearings</b> to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main <b>bearings.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1861, {{the flag}} of the Kingdom of Sardinia was {{declared}} {{the flag of}} the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. This Italian tricolour, with the armorial <b>bearings</b> of the former Royal House of Savoy was the first national flag and lasted in that form for 85 years until the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946.|$|E

5|$|The Gale of January 1976 on 2 January, brought {{winds of}} around 90mph (140km/h) which almost {{destroyed}} the telescope. The towers bowed, {{and one of}} the <b>bearings</b> connecting the dish to the towers slipped. After an expensive repair, diagonal bracing girders were added to the towers to prevent this happening again.|$|E
5|$|The {{caissons}} {{are required}} to turn with the wheel {{in order to remain}} level. Whilst the weight of the caissons on the <b>bearings</b> is generally sufficient to rotate them, a gearing mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two smaller ones ensures that they turn at precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced.|$|E
40|$|Jig {{prevents}} indentation of <b>bearing</b> balls by {{hard contact}} with edges of inner <b>bearing</b> rings during assembly. Jig is retaining ring which includes fingers that separates balls and pushes them against outer <b>bearing</b> {{and out of}} contact with inner <b>bearing</b> rings. Eliminates need for ball-retaining tabs on <b>bearing</b> cage...|$|R
50|$|A {{composite}} <b>bearing</b> is used {{to maintain}} separation and control friction between two moving parts. The distinguishing characteristic of a composite <b>bearing</b> is that the <b>bearing</b> is made {{from a combination of}} materials such as a resin reinforced with fibre and this may also include friction reducing lubricants and ingredients. A composite <b>bearing</b> is not simply a PTFE <b>bearing</b> in a carrier of another material, this is a PTFE <b>bearing</b> in a carrier. The plain composite <b>bearing</b> can be lighter than a rolling element <b>bearing</b> but this is not always a feature as some composites are extremely dense which results in lower porosity. Another distinctive feature of the composite <b>bearing</b> is its lightweight design - it can be one-tenth the weight of the traditional rolling element <b>bearing.</b> No heavy metals are used in its manufacture.|$|R

5|$|The high melting point, {{hardness}} and {{corrosion resistance}} of iridium and its alloys determine {{most of its}} applications. Iridium and especially iridium–platinum alloys or osmium–iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored spinnerets, through which a plastic polymer melt is extruded to form fibers, such as rayon. Osmium–iridium is used for compass <b>bearings</b> and for balances.|$|E
50|$|A cross-bolted <b>bearing</b> is a <b>bearing,</b> {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} main <b>bearing</b> of a piston engine. Most <b>bearing</b> caps are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the <b>bearing</b> journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted <b>bearing</b> has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the <b>bearing</b> cap from each side.|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given of an antifriction <b>bearing</b> and a {{process by which}} its fatigue life may be extended. The method involves a rotating shaft supported by a fluid <b>bearing</b> and a rolling element <b>bearing</b> coupled in series. Each <b>bearing</b> turns {{at a fraction of}} the rotational speed of the shaft. The fluid <b>bearing</b> is preferably conical, thereby providing thrust and radial load support in a single <b>bearing</b> structure...|$|R
40|$|A gas {{lubricated}} <b>bearing</b> {{model is}} derived which {{is appropriate for}} a very small <b>bearing</b> face separation by including velocity slip boundary conditions and centrifugal inertia effects. The <b>bearing</b> dynamics are examined when an external harmonic force is imposed on the <b>bearing</b> due to <b>bearing</b> begin situated within a larger complex dynamical system. A compressible Reynolds equation is formulated for the gas film which is coupled to the <b>bearing</b> structure through an axial force balance where the rotor and stator correspond to spring-mass-damper systems. Surface slip boundary conditions are derived on the <b>bearing</b> faces, characterised by the slip length parameter. The coupled <b>bearing</b> system is analysed using a stroboscopic map solver with the modified Reynolds equation and structural equations solved simultaneously. For a sufficiently large forcing amplitude a apping motion of the <b>bearing</b> faces is induced when the rotor and stator are in close proximity. The minimum <b>bearing</b> gap over the time period of the external forcing is examined {{for a range of}} <b>bearing</b> parameters...|$|R
