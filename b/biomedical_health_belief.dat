40|$|This study explores how {{the health}} {{competence}} of Latina immigrant mothers living in rural Iowa {{is influenced by}} their social, cultural and human capitals. By exploring {{the role of women}} 2 ̆ 7 s informal networks in disseminating knowledge and practices related to maintaining family health, this study sheds light on the role of cultural values, gendered knowledge and social cohesion in enhancing health competence of Latina immigrant mothers. This study draws a purposive sample from Rural Families Speak about Health (RFSH), a multi-state study that examines the physical and mental health of ethnically diverse rural families with low incomes and young children. A focus group and in depth-interviews were conducted with eight Latina mothers. Findings suggest that Latina immigrant mothers incorporate both traditional and <b>biomedical</b> <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> as they devise ways to provide health care for their families within a context that restricts their access to formal health care. Translational and local ties positively affect Latina immigrant mothers 2 ̆ 7 sense of self-efficacy by providing them with information and resources of <b>biomedical</b> and traditional <b>health</b> care. Latina immigrant mothers make collective decisions regarding health through consultation with their networks. Many of the mothers look inward to relatives for health information. While informal local networks can be a source of health information, these networks are few and often weak. Recommendations include insights on how to mobilize Latina immigrant mothers 2 ̆ 7 social, human and cultural capitals in order to enhance their agency within the U.

40|$|Researchers {{have sought}} to explain nonadherence to {{standard}} medical regimens by investigating a variety of sociodemographic variables, and, less often, by exploring variations between the health perspectives and life circumstances of the individual. While divergence between lay and professional perspectives on the etiology and treatment of chronic diseases, such as noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, may possibly account for the documented low rates of adherence to <b>biomedical</b> recommendations, <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and activities are best understood as connected to an individual's personal history and circumstances. In order to evaluate the relationship between causal explanation of NIDDM and adherence, ethnographic interviews were conducted among 51 older (65 +) women with diabetes and their physicians. We chose to investigate adherence to dietary recommendations because it {{represents one of the}} most challenging lifestyle modifications and is particularly important to maintaining glycemic control. The interviews involved ethnomedical and food frequency intake questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Results reveal a stronger association between dietary adherence and etiological perspectives on diabetes than any sociodemographic factors, including ethnicity, education and income or other <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> factors. Informants suggested five categories that they believed were responsible for the onset of their NIDDM; poor past dietary practices (n= 22); familial tendency to have diabetes (n= 10); improper bodily functioning (n= 10); personal risk factors (n= 6); and currently being overweight (n= 3). Analyses indicated that those who implicate former dietary practices, currently being overweight, or having improper bodily functions were more likely to follow a standard recommended diet for individuals with diabetes. These findings also highlight the attempt by individuals with NIDDM to create 'stories' of meaning of their diabetes by linking their current management strategies for NIDDM with past practices and history.

40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2005. ENGLISH ABSTRACT:The purpose if {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of a HIV/AIDS health promotion approach derived from the <b>Health</b> <b>Belief</b> Model (Becker and Maiman, 1975). The <b>Health</b> <b>Belief</b> Model is one of the conceptual models used to explain health compliance behaviour. According to the model an individual=s readiness to take action and engage in health - related behaviour (safe sex in the case of the present study) relative to a particular health condition (HIV/AIDS in the case of the present study) is a function of three factors. The first factor relates to the individual=s beliefs or perceptions of his/her likelihood of susceptibility to an illness as well as their perception of the severity of the consequences of having the illness. The second factor is the perceived benefit of action in contrast to the barrier to acting. The third factor relates to access to cues for action, that is cues that trigger appropriate health behaviour. The study was motivated by the observation that the incidence of HIV/AIDS in South Africa continues to rise despite heightened educational efforts undertaken in the workplace. The research question was two-fold: Firstly, the study was to determine whether there would be significant differences in HIV/AIDS <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and <b>health</b> behaviour between participants receiving a traditional HIV/AIDS workshop and those receiving a cognitive restructuring workshop based on the <b>Health</b> <b>Belief</b> Model. Secondly, the study was to determine whether there was a significant relationship between HIV/AIDS <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and HIV/AIDS <b>health</b> behaviour To test hypotheses relating to differences in <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and <b>health</b> behaviour as well as the relationship between <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and <b>health</b> behaviour, 78 employees in a government department were divided into two groups. One group, the control group, took part in a structured, lecture-type HIV/AIDS health promotion workshop. The other group, the experimental group, took part in an unstructured workshop designed to examine commonly held beliefs about HIV/AIDS. Prior to participation in the workshops, both groups completed the researcher designed AIDS <b>Health</b> <b>Beliefs</b> Questionnaire and AIDS Health Behaviour Questionnaires. Both groups then completed the same questionnaires one month after participating in the workshops and their pre-workshop and post-workshop responses were compared using t-tests. The relationship between <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and <b>health</b> behaviour was examined using the Pearson r -correlation test. There were no significant differences in <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and <b>health</b> behaviour between the two groups at pre- and post-workshop conditions. Only the control group females showed a significant difference in <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> at post-workshop assessment. There was an overall change in <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> at post-workshop assessment for the entire population. There were no significant differences in <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and <b>health</b> behaviour between the control group and the experimental group. There was no significant relationship between <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and <b>health</b> behaviour. Significant relationships were observed among the variables of the <b>Health</b> <b>Belief</b> Model. None of the <b>health</b> <b>Belief</b> Model variables predicted health behaviour. It was concluded that beliefs restructuring workshops had no effect on AIDS health behaviour. This study failed to show that positive <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> result in positive health behaviour.

The Hea 1 th Belief Model (HBM) was applied in this study. Beliefs were based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the components of HBM identified included the perception that the guideline diets were unappetizing, perceived inconvenience and social influence, perceived cost and benefits, and perceived ability and willingness to change diet and exercise habits. The assessments done on the adolescents included anthropometric measurements, dietary recalls, activity recalls, venipuncture, step test and questionnaires administered to the adolescents and their parents by trained interviewers. <b>Health</b> <b>beliefs</b> were measured in separate questionnaire administered to the adolescents, and their mothers and fathers. Principal component analysis was done to identify factors underlying the <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> items, for the adolescents and their parents, in this study. The hypothesized relationships among adolescent <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> and parental <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> were tested using Pearson's product moment correlation and multiple regression. Certain components of the HBM, including perceived cost and benefits, and barriers such as inconvenience and perception that the guideline diets were unappetizing did not contribute in predicting behavioral changes among the adolescents. Perceived ability and willingness to change seemed to have had an influence but did not appear influence but did not appear consistently for all aspects of dietary changes. This suggests that the adolescents may not be sure about their <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> or that it is not considered as a priority. This was an exploratory study and it focused on all different aspects of the Dietary Guidelines.

40|$|Aims: Changing {{behaviour}} {{to reduce}} stroke risk {{is a difficult}} prospect made particularly complex because of psychological factors. This study examined predictors of intentions and behaviours to reduce stroke risk {{in a sample of}} at-risk individuals, seeking to find how knowledge and <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> influenced both intention and actual behaviour to reduce stroke risk. Methods: A repeated measures design was used to assess behavioural intentions at time 1 (T 1) and subsequent behaviour (T 2). One hundred and twenty six respondents completed an online survey at T 1, and behavioural follow-up data were collected from approximately 70 participants 1 month later. Predictors were stroke knowledge, demographic variables, and beliefs about stroke that were derived from an expanded <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> model. Dependent measures were: exercise and weight loss, and intention to engage in these behaviours to reduce stroke risk. Findings: Multiple hierarchical regression analyses showed that, for exercise and weight loss respectively, different <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> predicted intention to control stroke risk. The most important exercise-related <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> were benefits, susceptibility, and self-efficacy; for weight loss, the most important beliefs were barriers, and to a lesser degree, susceptibility and subjective norm. Conclusions: <b>Health</b> <b>beliefs</b> may {{play an important role in}} stroke prevention, particularly beliefs about susceptibility because these emerged for both behaviours. Stroke education and prevention programmes that selectively target the <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> relevant to specific behaviours may prove most efficacious. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 350 students of health and medical department of universities in Busan from June 3, 2013 to June 21, 2013, {{and a total of}} 350 questionnaires were researched. Among them 337 responses were used after 13 unfaithful responses were excluded. The effects of oral <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> on use of dental service of students of health and medical department of universities were examined and analyzed to provide basic data which can be used to expand understanding about oral <b>health</b> <b>belief,</b> to promote changes in behaviors regarding oral health and to improve oral health of the public. Collected data was analyzed through SPSS (Statistical Packages for Social Science 15. 0. SPSS Inc. USA). For verification of differences of oral <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> depending on general matters and oral health behavior, t-test and ANOVA analysis were conducted, and for examination of the effects of oral <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> on use of medical service, logistic regression and regression analysis were conducted. The study results suggest that those who had higher sensitivity among oral <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> variables had higher probability of needing dental treatment and seeing the dentist immediately. And those who showed higher sensitivity and importance had higher frequency of seeing the dentist for six months. Future studies need to be conducted on the methods to change oral <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> for sustainable an...|$|R
40|$|Background: In the United States, Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of death for both men and women. According to National Vital Statistics Report (2009), heart disease was the number one killer in the United States and it can be prevented. The primary purpose of this study was to {{determine}} knowledge and <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> about CVD among selected undergraduate university students and find out the potential risk of developing CVD in this population. The secondary purpose was to assess the relationship between knowledge, <b>health</b> <b>beliefs,</b> and personal risks; the tertiary purpose was to determine the factors that predict the relationship between demographic variables and cardiovascular risk factors among these students. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, and correlational survey design was used in this quantitative study. An existing knowledge and <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> instrument was adapted with the permission from the authors. In the 2012 Spring semester, over 600 undergraduates from Foundation of Human Health, First Aid and CPR, Medical Terminology, Math, History, and Geography classes at a mid-western university were surveyed to access knowledge and <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> about CVD. The <b>Health</b> <b>Belief</b> Model provided the theoretical framework for this study. Results: Demographic data provided descriptive overview of the participants in this study. Majority of the participants were whites, lived off campus, and were domestic students. Results from data analysis revealed that overall knowledge about cardiovascular disease was low among these university students. Individual <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> such as perceived susceptibility, severity, and barriers regarding CVD were low; however perceived benefits of preventing CVD were found high. Most of the undergraduate university students were at potential risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Smoking and stress causing CVD were lesser known among undergraduate university students. Time to cook healthy meals and unaffordability of buying healthy foods were significant barriers in protecting cardiovascular health among university students. There was a positive statistically significant correlation between CVD knowledge, knowledge subtypes, and <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> subscales. Correlations between knowledge and <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> were weaker while comparing to correlation between CVD knowledge and knowledge subtypes. Race/ethnicity, age, family history, international/national, live on/off campus, and number of health classes were the better predictors of cardiovascular knowledge, while perceived barrier was the strongest predictor of <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> about CVD among undergraduate university students...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Health</b> <b>beliefs</b> {{significantly}} affect <b>health</b> promoting self-care behaviors. The most important model designed based on <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> is the <b>Health</b> <b>Belief</b> Model. This {{study examined the}} association between <b>health</b> <b>belief</b> model constructs and demographic factors with behaviors in elderly. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed on 465 elders referring to Tehran's cultural centers recruited with a multi-stage sampling method. Study instruments were questionnaires regarding demographic information, <b>health</b> <b>beliefs,</b> self-efficacy and health-promoting self-care behaviors. Data analysis was performed using SPSS- 22 software by Independent T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation and Multiple linear regression. Results: The mean (±SD) age of subjects was 68. 24 ± 6. 12 years and the mean of general self-care score was 1. 79 ± 0. 36. Gender (P= 0. 011), economy (P< 0. 001), education level (P< 0. 001) and age (P= 0. 008) {{were significantly associated with}} self-care behaviors. Regression analysis showed that perceived barriers, self-efficacy and perceived severity were determinants of behavior (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it is essential to pay special attention to self-efficacy, perceived severity and perceived barriers to design health education for elderly...|$|R

Osteoporosis is major public health concern affecting millions {{of older adults}} worldwide. A systematic review was carried out to identify the most common osteoporosis <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> in adult {{men and women from}} descriptive and intervention studies. The Osteoporosis <b>Health</b> <b>Belief</b> Scale (OHBS) and Osteoporosis Self-efficacy Scale (OSES) evaluate osteoporosis <b>health</b> <b>beliefs,</b> including perceived susceptibility and seriousness, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy of calcium and exercise, and health motivation, and their relationship to preventive health behaviours. A comprehensive search of studies that included OHBS and OSES subscale scores as outcomes was performed. Fifty full-text articles for citations were reviewed based on inclusion criteria. Twenty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. Greater perceived seriousness, benefits, self-efficacy, health motivation, and fewer barriers were the most common health-belief subscales in men and women. Few studies were interventions (n = 6) and addressed osteoporosis <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> in men (n = 8). Taking <b>health</b> <b>beliefs</b> into consideration when planning and conducting education interventions may be useful in both research and practice for osteoporosis prevention and management; however, more research in this area is needed. 1...|$|R
