5000|$|Nesciothemis farinosa [...] - Black-tailed Dancer, Black-tailed False-skimmer, <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Skimmer,</b> Common Blacktail (not to be {{confused}} with the Eurasian species Orthetrum cancellatum which shares some of these common names).|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer</b> is {{abundant}} throughout its range {{and is one}} of the most commonly seen dragonflies in Europe. It holds a stable population and has no known major threats.|$|E
50|$|The {{various species}} which inhabit the Cardiff Bay Wetlands {{exist in a}} dynamic food web. Very small creatures such as midge larvae and worms live in the mud {{underneath}} the wetlands. These are eaten by several bird species such as snipe. Other insects also use this transition zone between water and land to spend various phases of their lives - dragonflies live in the aquatic zone as larvae and adults. Sometimes <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmers</b> can be observed hunting their territories in the reen part of the reserve.|$|R
50|$|Common {{names for}} this species include Eastern Blacktail, <b>Black-tailed</b> <b>Skimmer</b> (not to be {{confused}} with the European and Asian species of the same name, Orthetrum cancellatum), Black-tailed Dancer, Black-tailed False-skimmer and Common Blacktail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer,</b> Orthetrum cancellatum, is a {{dragonfly}} of Europe and Asia. It occurs {{nearly all}} of Europe except northern UK and Scandinavia; to the east, the range extends to Kashmir and Mongolia.|$|E
50|$|This {{site has}} three lakes in former gravel pits, {{and it also}} has areas of {{grassland}} and scrub. There are diverse bird species, and flora such as rageed-robin, brooklime, common spotted orchid and creeping jenny. Dragonflies include the brown hawker and <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} lakes and three small pools frequented by dragonflies. The emperor dragonfly, migrant hawker, <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer</b> and red-eyed {{damselfly}} are amongst other breeding species. Freshwater molluscs are represented and the site is the only known one in Gloucestershire for the tiny 'pea mussel'.|$|E
50|$|Amongst the {{dragonfly}} fauna of {{the site}} are the fenland hairy dragonfly (Brachytron pratense), the <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer</b> (Orthetrum cancellatum), the ruddy darter (Symtetrum sanguineum), and the migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta). The site also hosts a diversity of beetle and fly species, and the profile of invertebrates found at the ponds {{is found to be}} related to ponds of south and south-east England.|$|E
50|$|The keeled skimmer, Orthetrum coerulescens, is {{a species}} of European dragonfly. This species resembles the <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer</b> but is slimmer and the male has no black tip. Females and {{immature}} males lack the black abdominal pattern. The pterostigma is orange and the thorax usually bears pale stripes.It breeds mainly in peat bogs and flies (in the UK) from June to September.|$|E
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, large red damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, small red-eyed damselfly, azure damselfly, common blue damselfly, blue-tailed damselfly, migrant hawker, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor dragonfly, four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer,</b> keeled skimmer, common darter, ruddy darter, common hawker, Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|E
50|$|Another {{species of}} note, {{found in the}} wet flushed areas, is the nationally {{uncommon}} keeled skimmer dragonfly (Orthetrum coerulescens). This is a species of southern wet heathlands whose larvae develop in the wet mud of base-enriched flushes or bog pools. The valley is particularly rich in Odonata species: dragonflies recorded include the emperor (Anax imperator), golden-ringed (Cordulegaster boltonii), broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), southern hawker (Aeshna cyanea), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer</b> (Orthetrum cancellatum), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), and black darter (Sympetrum danae); damselflies include the large red (Pyrrhosoma nymphula), azure (Coenagrion puella), emerald (Lestes sponsa), common blue (Enallagma cyathigerum), blue-tailed (Ischnura elegans), scarce blue-tailed (Ischnura pumilio), and beautiful demoiselle (Calopteryx virgo).|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{supports}} {{large numbers}} of fly, snail, spider and beetle species. Damselflies found here include the emerald, azure, large red, red-eyed, variable and common blue; together with dragonflies such as the southern and brown hawkers, emperor, hairy dragonfly and <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer.</b> The Lepidoptera fauna is very rich also, especially the moths, with over 1000 species. The nationally rare reed leopard moth is common at the site. Other local moths include cream-bordered green pea, yellow-legged clearwing and emperor. China-mark moths such as the small, brown and ringed are also seen here. Local butterflies include the green hairstreak, brown argus, speckled wood and brimstone. There are a range of freshwater and land snails including the Red Data Book species Desmoulin's whorl snail.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer</b> is {{a fairly}} large {{dragonfly}} (the length of 44-50 mm, 29-35 mm abdomen, rear wing 35-41 mm.) with relatively broad, flattened abdomen, but not as broad as to chaser species. With age, adult males develop extensive blue pruinescence on their abdomen, offset by yellow lateral patches. The middle lobe of the pronotum is large and notched in the middle. The chest is yellow or yellowish-brown. The abdomen {{is more or less}} flattened. The base of the hind wings without a dark opaque spots. The pterostigma is dark brown or black. On the front wings pterostigma 2-3 mm long. Anal appendages black. The females and immature males are a deep yellow color, with wavy black lines dorsally on their abdomen. Males and females have the costal vein (the leading edge of the wing) yellow or black.|$|E
40|$|The dragonflies (Odonata: Anisoptera) are large, {{intermediate}} {{to small}} size, having different colours and variable morphological characters. They also carry ornamental and environmental indicator values. The first recorded, {{the collection of}} 318 dragonflies was made during May-July 2011 from district Lower Dir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Among them 11 species of dragonflies were identified belonging to 3 families. The golden-ringed, Cordulegaster brevistigma brevistigma Selys is belonging to family Cordulegasteridae and Clubtails, Onychogomphus bistrigatus Selys is belonging to family Gomophidaed. The spine-legged redbolt, Rhodothemis rufa (Rambur); <b>black-tailed</b> <b>skimmer,</b> Orthetrum cancellatum Linnaeus; blue or black-percher, Diplacodes lefebvrei (Ramber); ground-skimmer, Diplacodes trivialis Rambur; common red-skimmer, Orthetrum pruinosum neglectum (Rambur); triangle-skimmer, Orthetrum triangulare triangulare (Selys); common-skimmer, Sympetrum decoloratum Selys; slender-skimmer, Orthetrum Sabina (Drury) and wandering-glider or global-skimmer, Pantala flavescens (Fabricius) are belonging to family Libellulidae. It is concluded {{that there is a}} diversity to explain dragonfly fauna from district Lower Dir. ...|$|E
