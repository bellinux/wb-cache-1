50|$|These {{bearings}} {{make use}} of both ceramic <b>balls</b> and <b>race.</b> These bearings are impervious to corrosion and rarely require lubrication if at all. Due to the stiffness and hardness of the <b>balls</b> and <b>race</b> these bearings are noisy at high speeds. The stiffness of the ceramic makes these bearings brittle and liable to crack under load or impact. Because both <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> are of similar hardness wear can lead to chipping at high speeds of both the <b>balls</b> and the <b>race</b> this can cause sparking.|$|R

50|$|A {{particularly}} common kind of {{rolling-element bearing}} is the ball bearing. The bearing has {{inner and outer}} <b>races</b> between which <b>balls</b> roll. Each <b>race</b> features a groove usually shaped so the ball fits slightly loose. Thus, in principle, the <b>ball</b> contacts each <b>race</b> across a very narrow area. However, a load on an infinitely small point would cause infinitely high contact pressure. In practice, the ball deforms (flattens) slightly where it contacts each race much as a tire flattens where it contacts the road. The race also yields slightly where each ball presses against it. Thus, the contact between <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> is of finite size and has finite pressure. Note also that the deformed <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> do not roll entirely smoothly because {{different parts of the}} ball are moving at different speeds as it rolls. Thus, there are opposing forces and sliding motions at each ball/race contact. Overall, these cause bearing drag.|$|R

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to develop replacement bearings for the Rocketdyne Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) high pressure oxidizer turbopumps (HPOTPs). The replacement bearings consisted of standard <b>balls</b> and <b>races</b> with a special Battelle Self-Lubricating Insert Configuration (BASIC) retainer. The BASIC retainer consists of a phosphor bronze housing with inserts consisting of a polytetrafluoretheylene (PTFE) and bronze compound. The PTFE contacts the balls and the land guiding surface on the outer race. A PTFE transfer film is formed on <b>balls</b> and <b>races,</b> which lubricates the critical interfaces. The BASIC retainer is a one-to-one replacement for the current Armalon retainer, but has superior lubricating properties and is stronger over the broad temperature range anticipated for the HPOTP bearings.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{an analytical}} and experimental {{investigation into the}} dynamics of an automatic dynamic balancer (ADB) designed to quench vibration in eccentric rotors. This fundamentally nonlinear device incorporates several balancing masses that are free to rotate in a circumferentially mounted <b>ball</b> <b>race.</b> An earlier study into the steady state and transient response of the device with two balls is extended {{to the case of}} an arbitrary number of balls. Using bifurcation analysis allied to numerical simulation of a fully nonlinear model, the question is addressed of whether increasing the number of balls is advantageous. It is found that it is never possible to perfectly balance the device at rotation speeds comparable with or below the first natural, bending frequency of the rotor. When considering practical implementation of the device, a modification is suggested where individual balls are contained in separate arcs of the <b>ball</b> <b>race,</b> with rigid partitions separating each arc. Simulation results for a partitioned ADB are compared with those from an experimental rig. Close qualitative and quantitative match is found between the theory and the experiment, confirming that for sub-resonant rotation speeds, the ADB at best makes no difference to the imbalance, and can make things substantially worse. Further related configurations worthy of experimental and numerical investigation are proposed. © 2007 The Royal Society...|$|R

Comparing results of Optimization with original sample, the friction torque of ball that bears maximum load reduces by 10. 20 %. This method provides a reference for conducting further scientific researches on wear of wire <b>race</b> <b>ball</b> bearing...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of ball bearings, the bearing has inner and outer races {{and a set of}} <b>balls.</b> Each <b>race</b> is a ring with a groove where the balls rest. The groove is usually shaped so the ball is a {{slightly}} loose fit in the groove. Thus, in principle, the <b>ball</b> contacts each <b>race</b> at a single point. However, a load on an infinitely small point would cause infinitely high contact pressure. In practice, the ball deforms (flattens) slightly where it contacts each race, much as a tire flattens where it touches the road. The race also dents slightly where each ball presses on it. Thus, the contact between <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> is of finite size and has finite pressure. Note also that the deformed <b>ball</b> and <b>race</b> do not roll entirely smoothly because different parts of the ball are moving at different speeds as it rolls. Thus, there are opposing forces and sliding motions at each ball/race contact. Overall, these cause bearing drag. [...] "V" [...] groove raceways distribute the load evenly over the balls as they travel on four points of contact, creating a straight line rolling effect and decreasing the amount of friction created by a full contact round groove design.|$|R
