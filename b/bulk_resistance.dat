As shown in many studies, <b>bulk</b> canopy <b>resistance</b> is an especially important factor in the application of the P-M model. In this study, the authors used the Noilhan and Planton (N-P) approach and the Jacobs and De Bruin (J-D) approach to express the <b>bulk</b> canopy <b>resistance.</b> The P-M model was applied to a maize field using the two approaches in an arid area of northwest China and evaluated on the basis of measured half-hourly values from the eddy covariance system. The results indicate that the N-P approach slightly underestimates the <b>bulk</b> canopy <b>resistance,</b> while the J-D approach overestimates it. Over the entire maize growing season, the N-P approach yielded a more consistent estimate of <b>bulk</b> canopy <b>resistance</b> than did the J-D approach. Correspondingly, the P-M model with J-D <b>bulk</b> canopy <b>resistance</b> slightly underestimated the latent heat flux throughout the maize growing season, but overestimated the latent heat flux during the dry season as compared to the N-P approach results. The good fit between the simulated latent heat flux estimated by the P-M model using the N-P approach and the data measured at half-hour time steps demonstrates that the application of this approach is reasonable in relatively homogenous maize fields that are not drought-stressed. Further research to improve the performance of P-M model to simulate evapotranspiration in the cropped fields is discussed...|$|R

Commonly, resistivity (also known as <b>bulk</b> <b>resistance,</b> specific electrical resistance, or volume resistivity) is in units of Ω·m, which is more completely stated in units of Ω·m2/m (Ω·area/length).

When two metal electrical contacts touch, the actual metal-to-metal contact area is {{small compared to}} the total contact-to-contact area physically touching. In electrical contact theory, the relatively small area where electrical current flows between two contacts is called the a-spot where [...] "a" [...] stands for asperity.

If there is metal-to-metal contact between electrical contacts, then the electrical contact resistance (as opposed to the <b>bulk</b> <b>resistance</b> of the contact metal) is mostly due to constriction of the current through a very small area, the a-spot. Contact force or pressure increases the size of the a-spot which decreases the constriction resistance and the electrical contact resistance.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the electrical and thermal contact resistance in metal foam-graphite assemblies considered {{for use in}} next generation air-cooled fuel cells as replacements of currently available water-cooled ones. Their successful application requires minimization of thermal and electrical contact resistance between components. The current study investigates the evolution of both resistances with increasing compressive force between metallic foam and graphite plates. Reducing these contact resistances through compressive force instead of brazing significantly reduces the manufacturing cost. Our results show that both electrical and thermal resistances monotonically decrease with increasing compressive force when moving from no compressive force to a slight one about 100 N (corresponding to a compressive stress of 0. 01 MPa). Interestingly, compared with the thermal contact resistance, the electrical contact resistance shows more sensitivity to compressive force within this range of force. Furthermore, it has been noted that increases in compressive force beyond 300 N (i. e. 0. 03 MPa) decrease the resistances only marginally. Electrical contact resistance was found to govern the total resistance of the metal foam-graphite assembly since electric <b>bulk</b> <b>resistances</b> are several orders of magnitude lower.
