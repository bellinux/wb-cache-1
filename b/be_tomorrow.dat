He was, in fact, {{considered}} {{in the light of}} a standing joke, for few of his weather predictions were ever fulfilled. Mr. Elisha Wright, who labored under the impression that he was a local wit, used to say that nobody in Avonlea ever thought of looking in the Charlottetown dailies for weather probabilities. No; they just asked Uncle Abe what it was going to <b>be</b> <b>tomorrow</b> and expected the opposite. Nothing daunted, Uncle Abe kept on prophesying.|$|E
60|$|Nobody knows, and I {{dare say}} Goldsmith’s buoyant temper kept no account {{of all the}} pains which he endured during the early period of his {{literary}} career. Should any man of letters in our day have to bear up against such, Heaven grant he may {{come out of the}} period of misfortune with such a pure kind heart as that which Goldsmith obstinately bore in his breast. The insults to which he had to submit are shocking to read of—slander, contumely, vulgar satire, brutal malignity perverting his commonest motives and actions: he had his share of these, and one’s anger is roused at reading of them, as it is at seeing a woman insulted or a child assaulted, at the notion that a creature so very gentle and weak, and full of love, should have had to suffer so. And he had worse than insult to undergo—to own to fault, and deprecate the anger of ruffians. There is a letter of his extant to one Griffiths, a bookseller, in which poor Goldsmith is forced to confess that certain books sent by Griffiths {{are in the hands of}} a friend from whom Goldsmith had been forced to borrow money. “He was wild, sir,” Johnson said, speaking of Goldsmith to Boswell, with his great, wise benevolence and noble mercifulness of heart, “Dr. Goldsmith was wild, sir; but he is so no more.” Ah! if we pity the good and weak man who suffers undeservedly, let us deal very gently with him from whom misery extorts not only tears, but shame; let us think humbly and charitably of the human nature that suffers so sadly and falls so low. Whose turn may it <b>be</b> <b>tomorrow?</b> What weak heart, confident before trial, may not succumb under temptation invincible? Cover the good man who has been vanquished—cover his face and pass on.|$|E

50|$|This <b>is</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>was</b> {{a seminal}} {{collaborative}} art exhibition that {{opened at the}} Whitechapel Art Gallery on August 9, 1956 and featured 12 exhibits within the show that featured collaborations between a variety of architects, painters, sculptors, and other artists. While each using their own style, they built pieces that represented their version of contemporary art. The result of the twelve groups was the attempt to evoke a variety of external environment through theories that were inspired by communications guru Marshall McLuhan, as well as symbols of pop culture. This <b>is</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>was</b> nearly {{two years in the}} making, after architect and art critic Theo Crosby {{came up with the idea}} of mounting a large scale collaborative show at Whitechapel Gallery. By 1955 the participants were roughly divided into two camps; Constructivist, and the Independent Group, known for their meetings at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London with some overlap between the two groups. The 12 exhibits were each produced separately and were independent of each other. After This <b>is</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> opened nearly a thousand people a day saw the exhibit. The catalogue for the exhibit, designed by Independent member and graphic designer Edward Wright cost five shillings, a high price for 1956, sold out and had to be reprinted. This <b>is</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>is</b> considered to be the forerunner of the British Pop Art movement.|$|R
