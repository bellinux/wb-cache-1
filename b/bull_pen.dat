2500|$|When allowed {{outside its}} pen, the bull {{typically}} {{was kept in}} a halter connected by a strap snapped into the ring in his nose for ease of control. In the <b>bull</b> <b>pen,</b> {{the use of a}} ring connected by a cable to a fixed point was recommended as a means of controlling and securing the bull while allowing a degree of movement by the subject bull. [...] If the pen was strong enough, the bull could be turned loose, and if needed, placed in a stanchion. Farmers who lacked an assistant, or a bull staff, {{had no choice but to}} adopt other means. [...] Some farmers elected to move their bulls by tying a rope to the ring and tying the other end of the rope to a farm tractor, providing both motive power and a degree of protection from the angry bull. [...] The efficacy of this technique is doubtful, and may depend on the size of the tractor and of the bull; one authority has [...] "seen a bull lift the front end of a tractor like a toy". [...] Others used dogs and horses. [...] Not all farmers could afford specially designed and manufactured bull handling products, which were not readily available until the 1980s. [...] The experimental improvisation of techniques for bull handling, as in many aspects of family farming, was a common practice.|$|E

5000|$|The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) is a {{union of}} wage workers which was formed in Chicago in 1905 by militant unionists and their {{supporters}} due to anger over the conservatism, philosophy, and craft-based structure of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Throughout {{the early part of}} the Twentieth century the philosophy and tactics of the Industrial Workers of the World were frequently in direct conflict with those of the American Federation of Labor (forerunner of the AFL-CIO) concerning the best ways to organize workers, and how to best improve the society in which they toiled. The AFL had one guiding principle—"pure and simple trade unionism", often summarized with the slogan [...] "a fair day's pay for a fair day's work." [...] The IWW embraced two guiding principles, fighting like the AFL for better wages, hours, and conditions, but also promoting an eventual, permanent solution to the problems of strikes, injunctions, <b>bull</b> <b>pens,</b> and union scabbing.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} competition effects on ADG in the feedlot of 1, 882 Hereford bulls representing 8 birth years from a selection experiment. Each year, 8 feedlot pens {{were used to}} feed bulls in groups, with 2 pens nested {{within each of the}} 4 selection lines. Gains were recorded for up to 8 periods of 28 d. Models for analyses included pen effects (fixed or random), fixed effects such as year and line, and random direct genetic, competition genetic (and in some analyses competition environmental), and environmental effects. Each pen mate as a competitor affected the records of all others in the pen. All lines traced to common foundation animals, so the numerator relationships among and within pens were the bases for separating direct and competition genetic effects and pen effects. For this population and pen conditions (average of 30 <b>bulls</b> per <b>pen),</b> the major results were 1) competition genetic effects seemed present for the first 28 -d period but not for the following 7 periods; 2) models with pens considered as fixed effects could not separate variances and covariance due to direct and competition genetic effects; 3) models without competition effects had large estimates of the variance component due to pen effects for gain through 8 periods; and 4) models with genetic and environmental competition effects accounted for nearly all of the variance traditionally attributed to pen effects (even though estimates of the competition variance component were small, the estimates of pen variance were near zero) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of replacing dry ground corn with crude glycerol on intake, apparent digestibility, performance, and carcass characteristics of finishing beef bulls. A completely randomized block design experiment with 25 d for adaptation and 100 d for data collection was conducted, in which 3, 640 Nellore bulls (367 ± 36. 8 kg; 18 ± 3 mo) were blocked by body weight and assigned to 20 <b>pens.</b> <b>Bulls</b> were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: 0, 5, 10, and 15 % (dry matter basis) of crude glycerol in the diet. Initially, 20 bulls were slaughtered to serve as a reference to estimate initial empty body weight, which allowed for carcass gain calculation. Bulls were weighed at the beginning, at two-thirds, and at the end of the experiment for performance calculations. Carcass measurements were obtained by ultrasound. Fecal output was estimated using indigestible neutral detergent fiber as an internal marker. Data were analyzed using the mixed procedures in SAS 9. 2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Intake of dry matter, organic matter, and neutral detergent fiber decreased linearly (P 0. 05) intakes of crude protein, non-fiber carbohydrates, and total digestible nutrients. Digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and total digestible nutrients increased quadratically (P 0. 05). These results suggest that crude glycerol may be included in finishing beef diets at levels up to 15 % without impairing performance and carcass characteristics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we extend and unify {{the results of}} [Rivin, Ann. of Math. 143 (1996) ] and [Rivin, Ann. of Math. 139 (1994) ]. As a consequence, the results of [Rivin, Ann. of Math. 143 (1996) ] are {{generalized}} from the framework of ideal polyhedra in H 3 to that of singular Euclidean structures on surfaces, possibly with {{an infinite number of}} singularities (by contrast, the results of [Rivin, Ann. of Math. 143 (1996) ] can be viewed as applying to the case of non-singular structures on the disk, with a finite number of distinguished points). This leads to a fairly complete understanding of the moduli space of such Euclidean structures and thus, by the results of [Penner, Comm. Math. Phys. 113 (1987) 299 – 339; Epstein, Penner, J. Differential Geom. 27 (1988) 67 – 80; Näätänen, <b>Penner,</b> <b>Bull.</b> London Math. Soc. 6 (1991) 568 – 574] the author [Rivin, Ann. of Math. 139 (1994); Rivin, in: Lecture Notes in Pure and Appl. Math., Vol.   156, 1994], and others, further insights into the geometry and topology of the Riemann moduli space. The basic objects studied are the canonical Delaunay triangulations associated to the aforementioned Euclidean structures. The basic tools, in addition to the results of [Rivin, Ann. of Math. 139 (1994) ] and combinatorial geometry are methods of combinatorial optimization—linear programming and network flow analysis; hence the results mentioned above are not only effective but also efficient. Some applications of these methods to three-dimensional topology are also given (to prove a result of Casson's) ...|$|R
5000|$|Born in Kingston, Thomas first {{recorded}} as a deejay at Tuff Gong studios in 1982, initially {{working under the}} name Junior Kong, named after his father. His debut single was [...] "Pink Eye". He worked with GT and then his own Love Bunch sound system and then recorded for King Tubby's Firehouse label, now singing in a similar style to Tenor Saw. The early King Kong recordings for Tubby were over early digital rhythms, and included songs such as [...] "AIDS" [...] and [...] "Babylon", and established him as a popular artist. His first album release was split with another of Tubby's singers, Anthony Red Rose, with Two Big <b>Bull</b> Inna One <b>Pen</b> issued on Firehouse. During 1986 and 1987, Kong recorded for several of Jamaica's top producers, including Prince Jammy, with whom he enjoyed his biggest hits with [...] "Trouble Again" [...] (the title track from his Jammy-produced debut album proper) and [...] "Legal We Legal", Black Scorpio, Harry J, Errol Thompson, Ossie Hibbert, Bunny Lee, and Prince Jazzbo. While many of his songs were typical in content of the era, several of his songs had political and cultural themes. He released several albums during this period before relocating first to New York, and then to Canada in the late 1980s, where he released material occasionally on his Conscious Music label. The death of Tenor Saw in 1988 prompted King Kong to release [...] "He Was a Friend" [...] as a tribute, and in 1989 he relocated to England and recorded with Mafia & Fluxy and Gussie P in the early 1990s. He began recording more regularly again in the 2000s.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate commercial feedlot growth performance factors that contribute to the variation in DP of bulls and heifers. Feedlot growth-performance data involving 878 <b>pens</b> of <b>bulls</b> and 784 <b>pens</b> of heifers were used to develop models for predicting Dressing Percentage (DP, 100 * hot carcass weight/ final slaughter weight). Dressing percentage was similar for bulls and heifers, averaging 61. 7 ? 0. 9 %. Final Slaughter Weight (FSW, kg) explained 92 % of the variation in Empty Body Weight (EBW, kg= 15. 941 + 0. 877 FSW; r = 0. 921) and 89 % of the variation in hot carcass weight (HCW, kg= 27. 827 + 0. 554 FSW; r = 0. 893). However, FSW, alone, explained much less (r = 0. 10) of the variation in DP. Digestive tract fill averaged 11. 4 % with a range of 7. 8 to 15. 6 %. Dressing percentage of bulls and heifers was inversely associated with DMI (DP = 68. 061 -. 874 DMI, kg; r = 0. 32). Initial weight of cattle when entering the feedlot (IW, kg) was a better single predictor of DP than DMI, explaining 46 % of the variation. However, IW was also a good predictor of DMI (r = 0. 66) : DMI = 4. 6346 +. 01422 IW. Based on stepwise regression analysis, factors that best described variation in DP were IW, FSW and DMI: DP = 62. 277 - 0. 0131 IW+ 0. 00920 FSW- 0. 212 DMI (r = 0. 49). However, because of the close association between IW and DMI (lack 2 of independence), the contribution of DMI to the prediction was small. Removing DMI from the equation, the model becomes: DP = 61. 857 - 0. 148 IW + 0. 00759 FSW (r = 0. 48). We conclude that the effect of gender on DP 2 is small and nonappreciable. Initial weight and FSW are useful linear predictors of DP, explaining 48 % of the variation. Dressing percentage decreases with increasing IW. For a given IW, DP increases with increasing FSW...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} low-protein (LP) diets and rumen-protected CLA on DMI, ADG, carcass traits, and {{health status of}} double-muscled Piemontese young bulls were investigated. Forty-eight bull calves (BW = 237 +/- 24 kg) were divided in 4 groups and housed in 12 fully slatted <b>pens.</b> <b>Bulls</b> were fed 2 diets differing in CP density [high-protein (HP) diet: CP = 145 g/kg of DM; LP diet: CP = 108 g/kg of DM] and top-dressed with 80 g/d of rumen-protected CLA or 65 g/d of {{hydrogenated}} soybean oil. Orts were collected weekly and feed intake was estimated on a pen basis, with 3 replicated pens for each treatment. Each bull was weighed monthly and examined for alterations of the locomotion system by using the locomotion score as an index of lameness and by {{counting the number of}} swollen joints. Carcass quality traits were measured at slaughter, after a feeding period of 332 d. Compared with HP, LP reduced ADG only during the first 4 mo of the trial (1. 30 vs. 1. 53 kg/d, P = 0. 003). However, because of compensatory growth, over the whole trial, no significant effects attributable to CP or to additive were found on final BW (668 kg), ADG (1. 19 kg/d), DMI (8. 50 or 86 g/d per kg of BW(0. 75)), dressing percentage (67. 3 %), carcass conformation (5. 2 points), and carcass fat covering (1. 87 points). Feed efficiency was affected by a CP x additive interaction (P = 0. 030), with CLA improving feed efficiency when added to the LP diets, whereas feed efficiency was reduced with the HP diets. The addition of both LP and CLA reduced the number of bulls presenting swollen joints (P = 0. 001), and LP improved the locomotion score (P = 0. 021) compared with HP. It was concluded that 10. 8 g/kg of CP density in the diet is sufficient for double-muscled Piemontese bulls. The reduction in CP density from 145 to 108 g/kg of DM, in addition to reducing the feeding cost, allows a strong reduction in N consumption without negative consequences on growth performance and carcass traits...|$|R
