5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E

The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E

Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> the anatomy of the eye.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also {{is possible}} that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this would <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> his baptism in 597, which is {{in accord with the}} tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E

Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford.

5|$|The {{book also}} has a {{practical}} dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{case for}} computational chemistry is the gas-phase chemistry, {{in which a}} substance is treated {{as if it was}} a gas to eliminate the necessity of taking interactions between molecules in account.

For example, the molecular orbital levels indicate dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. One property dubnium pentachloride is expected to show is its increased (compared to its tantalum analog) covalence: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Towards {{developing}} {{a theory of}} systematic biases about strate-gies, I analyze strategic implications of a particular bias: wishful thinking about the strategies. Considering canonical state spaces for strategic uncer-tainty, I identify a player as a wishful thinker at a state if she hopes to enjoy the highest payoff that <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> her information about the others' strategies at that state. I develop a straightforward elimination process that characterizes the strategy profiles that <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> wishful thinking, mutual knowledge of wishful thinking, and so on. Every pure-strategy Nash equilibrium <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> common knowledge of wishful thinking. For generic two-person games, I further show that the pure Nash equilibrium strategies are the only strategies that <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> common knowl-edge of wishful thinking, providing an unusual epistemic characterization for equilibrium strategies. 1...|$|R
