25|$|Quatinga Velho is a Brazilian {{village in}} the Quatinga {{district}} of the Mogi das Cruzes municipality, which is becoming well-known because of the basic income-project which is taking place there. The project started 2008 and is organized by the non-profit organization ReCivitas. The funding {{has so far been}} based entirely on private donations. In June 2011 83 people in the village got 30 Brazilian reals per person and month. The organization hopes that all people in the village will eventually get the <b>basic</b> <b>income,</b> and also that similar projects will get going in other villages in and outside Brazil. The organizers are currently building a social bank, so that the <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> in the future can be financed through investments rather than donations. The idea is that the bank will operate as an investment bank, but the profit will go to <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> instead of a dividend to shareholders and managers. One plan is to use some of the first revenue to support the <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> project in Otjivero, Namibia, and then to initiate similar projects in different parts of Brazil.|$|E
25|$|A <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> (or {{negative}} income tax) is {{a system}} of social security that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on frugally. It is argued that recipients of the <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> would have considerably more bargaining power when negotiating a wage with an employer as {{there would be no}} risk of destitution for not taking the employment. As a result, the jobseeker could spend more time looking for a more appropriate or satisfying job, or they could wait until a higher-paying job appeared. Alternatively, they could spend more time increasing their skills in university, which would make them more suitable for higher-paying jobs, as well as provide numerous other benefits. Experiments on <b>Basic</b> <b>Income</b> and NIT in Canada and the USA show that people spent more time studying while the program was running.|$|E

25|$|<b>Basic</b> <b>income</b> {{has been}} {{discussed}} in modern Brazil {{at least since the}} 1980s. In 2001 a law was introduced by Senator Eduardo Suplicy of the Brazilian Workers Party which mandated the progressive institution of such a welfare system. By this move Brazil became the first country in the world to pass such a law. Suplicy had previously introduced a bill to create a Negative Income Tax, but that bill failed to pass. The new bill called for a national and universal <b>basic</b> <b>income</b> to be instituted, beginning with those most in need. The bill was approved by the Senate in 2002 and by the Chamber of Deputies in 2003. President Lula da Silva signed it into law in 2004, and according to the bill it is the president's responsibility to gradually implement the reform. Since then Brazil has started to implement the bill through the Bolsa Família-program, which was a centerpiece of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's social policy, and is reputed to {{have played a role in}} his victory in the Brazilian presidential election, 2006.|$|E

40|$|A proper {{allocation}} of tasks between the central budget and local budgets {{represents one of}} main problems in optimal utilization of financial resources.

40|$|The {{existing}} cost-benefit methods {{addressed to}} the developing countries {{are based on the}} premises of a growth strategy or its variants. They are, therefore, unsuitable to evaluate projects {{in the context of a}} basic needs strategy. This thesis attempts to formulate a methodology suitable to analyse the impact of projects on basic needs fulfilment. A pre-requisite for the application of the methodology - basic needs analysis - is the identification of a basic needs basket and the corresponding <b>basic</b> needs <b>income.</b> Analysis of projects then involves the construction of a goods balance sheet and an income balance sheet. " The goods balance sheet highlights the effect of projects on the social stock of basic goods. Social value of inputs and outputs is derived from the market prices using goods-specific and use-specific conversion factors. The value of the conversion factors varies from 0 to 1, the extreme values representing luxuries and essentials respectively.), Product mix considerations are thus taken into account in the'goods balance sheet.; (The effects on <b>basic</b> needs <b>income</b> resulting from projects are measured by the income balance sheet. J -=ý Income changes above the basic needs level are given a social weight of 0, whereas changes at or below this level are attributed a weight of 1. Thus, income distributional considerations are directly incorporated into the analysis. Opportunity costs of funds and resources are based on the forgone basic needs benefits from their alternative uses. Aggregation of costs and benefits over time is carried out without resorting to discounting. At the final stage, the two balance sheets are aggregated using weights which reflect the relative priority given to the objectives of basic goods production and <b>basic</b> needs <b>income</b> generation. The usefulness of the methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a forest land use problem in the tropics...|$|R

Persons liable for tax were lightly affected by the change, because income tax liability was still balanced by the tax credit received, although higher rate tax payers paid an additional 25% tax on the amount of the dividend actually received (net), as against 20% before the change.|$|R
40|$|Conference on Financing Global AgingThe {{question}} assigned {{is whether}} {{an aging population}} should be financed by governments or markets? The broad answer {{is that we need}} both government provided benefits and supplementary private pensions. Each has its place. That is not the debate. The debate centers on whether to cut back on the existing Social Security program and to replace it with private accounts. I think that is a bad idea. It is a bad idea because it shifts the nature of <b>basic</b> retirement <b>income</b> from a defined benefit to a defined contribution plan, which puts people’s <b>basic</b> retirement <b>income</b> at risk. Moreover, “privatizing ” will not, in and of itself, improve the financing of the system or raise the return on Social Security contributions.
