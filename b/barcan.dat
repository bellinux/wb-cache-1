50|$|The <b>Barcan</b> formula has {{generated}} some controversy because—in terms of possible world semantics—it implies that all objects which exist in any possible world (accessible {{to the actual}} world) exist in the actual world, i.e. that domains cannot grow when one moves to accessible worlds.

The three articles are published under Marcus' maiden name: Ruth C. <b>Barcan.</b> The widely discussed <b>Barcan</b> formula is introduced as an axiom in QML. The papers of 1946 and 1947, were the first systems of quantified modal logic, which extended some propositional modal systems of Clarence Irving Lewis to first and second order; a major accomplishment in the development of 20th century logic. Lewis gives Marcus special recognition in his [...] "Notes on the Logic of Intension", originally printed in Structure, Method, and Meaning: Essays in Honor of Henry M. Sheffer (New York, 1951). Here Lewis recognizes <b>Barcan</b> Marcus as the first logician to extend propositional logic as a higher order intensional logic.|$|E

5000|$|Ruth <b>Barcan</b> Marcus (August 2, 1921 [...] - [...] February 19, 2012) was an American {{philosopher and}} logician who {{developed}} the <b>Barcan</b> formula.

Timothy Williamson, the Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford University, sums up his celebration of Professor Marcus's career by stating that many of her [...] "main ideas are not just original, and clever, and beautiful, and fascinating, and influential, and way ahead of their time, but actually — I believe — true." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ruth <b>Barcan</b> Marcus {{proposed}} the {{view in the}} philosophy of language according to which proper names are what Marcus termed mere [...] "tags". ("Modalities and Intensional Languages" [...] (Synthese, 1961) and elsewhere). These [...] "tags" [...] are used to refer to an object, which is the bearer of the name. The meaning of the name is regarded as exhausted by this referential function. This view contrasts for example with late Bertrand Russell's description theory of proper names as well as John Searle's cluster description theory of names which prevailed at the time. This view of proper names (presented in 1962 with Quine as commentator) has been identified by Quentin Smith with the theory of reference given in Saul Kripke's Naming and Necessity.

5000|$|In modal logic, the {{necessity}} of identity is the thesis that for every object x and object y, if x and y are the same object, {{it is necessary that}} x and y are the same object. The thesis is best known for its association with Saul Kripke, who published it in 1971, although it was first derived by the logician Ruth <b>Barcan</b> Marcus in 1947, and later, in simplified form, by W.V.O. Quine in 1953 ...|$|E
5000|$|Truth-value {{semantics}} (also {{commonly referred}} to as substitutional quantification) was advocated by Ruth <b>Barcan</b> Marcus for modal logics in the early 1960s and later championed by Dunn, Belnap, and Leblanc for standard first-order logic. James Garson has given some results in the areas of adequacy for intensional logics outfitted with such a semantics. The truth conditions for quantified formulas are given purely in terms of truth with no appeal to domains whatsoever (and hence its name truth-value semantics).|$|E

5000|$|An {{informal}} {{argument against}} the plausibility of the <b>Barcan</b> formula would be {{the interpretation of the}} predicate Fx as [...] "x is a machine that can tap all the energy locked in the waves of the Atlantic Ocean in a practical and efficient way".

However, it is not obvious that this implies that there exists a machine that possibly could tap the energy of the Atlantic.|$|E
5000|$|Saul Kripke defended direct {{reference}} theory {{when applied}} to proper names. Kripke claims that proper names {{do not have any}} [...] "senses" [...] at all, because senses only offer contingent facts about things. Ruth <b>Barcan</b> Marcus advanced a theory of direct reference for proper names at a symposium in which Quine and Kripke were participants: published in Synthese, 1961 with Discussion in Synthese 1962. She called directly referring proper names [...] "tags". Kripke urged such a theory in 1971 and thereafter. He called such directly referring proper names [...] "rigid designators".|$|E

We discover that the names designate the same thing. The traditional view, since Kant, has been that statements or propositions that are necessarily true are a priori. But in the end of the sixties Saul Kripke and Ruth <b>Barcan</b> Marcus offered proof for the necessary truth of identity statements. Here is the Kripke's version (Kripke 1971): ...|$|E

5000|$|Derrida's philosophic work is {{especially}} controversial among American and British academics, {{as when the}} University of Cambridge awarded him an honorary doctorate, despite opposition from among the Cambridge philosophy faculty and analytical philosophers worldwide. In opposing the decision, philosophers including Barry Smith, W. V. O.

50|$|Kripke {{delivered}} the John Locke lectures in philosophy at Oxford in 1973. Titled Reference and Existence, {{they are in}} many respects a continuation of Naming and Necessity, {{and deal with the}} subjects of fictional names and perceptual error. They have recently been published by Oxford University Press. Quentin Smith has claimed that some of the ideas in Naming & Necessity were first presented (at least in part) by Ruth <b>Barcan</b> Marcus. Kripke is alleged to have misunderstood Marcus' ideas during a 1969 lecture which he attended (based on the questions he asked), and later arrived at similar conclusions. Marcus, however, has refused to publish the verbatim transcript of the lecture. Smith's view is controversial, and several well-known scholars (for example, Stephen Neale and Scott Soames) have subsequently offered detailed responses arguing that his account is mistaken.|$|E
5000|$|Frege's Puzzle has {{received}} {{a great deal of}} attention since the attacks on the descriptivist theory of names mounted in the 1970s and 1980s by philosophers such as Keith Donnellan, Saul Kripke, Ruth <b>Barcan</b> Marcus, Hilary Putnam, and David Kaplan. [...] In the wake of these attacks on descriptivism, many philosophers embraced the Millian or direct-reference view of proper names, according to which the meaning of a name is simply its referent. As noted above, this Millian view has the result that (1) and (2) express the same proposition. Similarly, the embedded sentences 'Hesperus is visible in the evening' and 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' from (3) and (5) express the same proposition. It therefore looks like (3) and (5) cannot differ in truth value since they attribute belief in one and the same proposition.|$|E

50|$|In a 1995 paper, philosopher Quentin Smith {{argued that}} key {{concepts}} in Kripke's new theory of reference had originated {{from the work}} of Ruth <b>Barcan</b> Marcus more than a decade earlier. Smith identified six significant ideas to the New Theory that he claimed Marcus had developed: (1) The idea that proper names are direct references, which don't consist of contained definitions. (2) While one can single out a single thing by a description, this description is not equivalent with a proper name of this thing. (3) The modal argument that proper names are directly referential, and not disguised descriptions. (4) A formal modal logic proof of the necessity of identity. (5) The concept of a rigid designator, though the actual name of the concept was coined by Kripke.(6) The idea of a posteriori identity. Smith proceeded to argue that Kripke failed to understand Marcus' theory at the time, yet later adopted many of its key conceptual themes in his New Theory of Reference.|$|E
