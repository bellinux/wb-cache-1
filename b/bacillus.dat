5|$|A {{study of}} 32 {{basidiomycete}} mushrooms showed that Mutinus elegans {{was the only}} species to show antibiotic (both antibacterial and antifungal) activity against all six microorganisms tested, namely, the human pathogenic bacteris <b>Bacillus</b> cereus, <b>Bacillus</b> subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and the yeast Candida albicans.|$|E
5|$|Turck feeds dogs <b>Bacillus</b> coli and {{produces}} ulcers.|$|E
5|$|All {{commonly}} used research strains of E. coli belong to group A and are derived mainly from Clifton's K-12 strain (λ⁺ F⁺; O16) {{and to a}} lesser degree from d'Herelle's <b>Bacillus</b> coli strain (B strain)(O7).|$|E
5|$|Beauveria bassiana (Hyphomycetes) is a {{pathogenic}} fungus that infects a {{wide range}} of insect species, including the Colorado potato beetle. It has shown to be particularly effective as a biological pesticide for L. decemlineata when used in combination with the bacterium <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner <b>bacillus</b> could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's <b>bacillus</b> would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Leucopaxillus giganteus {{contains}} a bioactive compound named clitocine that has antibiotic activity against {{a number of}} bacteria that are pathogenic to humans, such as <b>Bacillus</b> cereus and <b>Bacillus</b> subtilis; an earlier (1945) study showed antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhi, and Brucea abortus. Clitocine {{has also been shown}} to promote apoptosis (cell death) in human cervical cancer cells in vitro (HeLa). The mycelia of L.giganteus, when grown in liquid culture, has been shown to produce phenols and flavonoids that have antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Modified bases {{also occur}} in DNA. The {{first of these}} {{recognised}} was 5-methylcytosine which {{was found in the}} genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 1925. The complete replacement of cytosine by 5-glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in T even phages (T2, T4 and T6) was observed in 1953 In the genomes of Xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage Xp12 and halovirus FH the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by 5-methylcytosine. 6N-methyadenine was discovered to be present in DNA in 1955. N6-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in 1975. 7-methylguanine was described in 1976. N4-methylcytosine in DNA was described in 1983. In 1985 5-hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the Rhizobium phages RL38JI and N17. α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the Delftia phage ΦW-14 and the <b>Bacillus</b> phage SP10. α-glutamythymidine is found in the <b>Bacillus</b> phage SP01 and 5-dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the <b>Bacillus</b> phage SP15.|$|E
5|$|Small commercially reared parasitoidal wasps, Trichogramma ostriniae, provide {{limited and}} erratic {{control of the}} European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis), a serious pest. Careful {{formulations}} of the bacterium <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis are more effective.|$|E
5|$|The only {{available}} vaccine as of 2011 is <b>Bacillus</b> Calmette-Guérin (BCG). In children it decreases {{the risk of}} getting the infection by 20% {{and the risk of}} infection turning into disease by nearly 60%.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium <b>Bacillus</b> anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} Spanish {{research}} study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mushrooms, Rhodotus palmatus was one of 204 species screened against a panel of human clinical pathogens and laboratory control strains. Using a standard laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, the mushroom was shown to have moderate antibacterial activity against <b>Bacillus</b> subtilis, and weak antifungal activity against both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators and most other beneficial insects.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and {{only a small percentage}} of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus agathosmus is edible, but {{considered}} bland. A {{study of}} the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: oxalic, citric, malic, quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and <b>Bacillus</b> subtilis; it also inhibits {{the growth of the}} yeast Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, UPLB {{announced}} that the Leucinodes orbonalis-resistant <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis (Bt) eggplant variety {{that it had been}} developing with Cornell University and Mahyco was ready for commercialization. On 17 February 2011, Filipino and Indian Greenpeace activists trespassed UPLB's Bay research farm and uprooted two Bt eggplants and more than 100 non-genetically modified eggplants. The National Academy of Science and Technology and ranking UPLB officials condemned the incident, and have taken legal action.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, an S-layer of rigidly arrayed protein {{molecules}} {{covers the}} outside of the cell. This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a macromolecular diffusion barrier. S-layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions, but are known to act as virulence factors in Campylobacter and contain surface enzymes in <b>Bacillus</b> stearothermophilus.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening {{those at}} high risk, {{early detection and}} treatment of cases, and vaccination with the <b>bacillus</b> Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment {{requires the use of}} multiple antibiotics {{over a long period of}} time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|$|E
5|$|To develop {{resistance}} to RNAi, the {{western corn rootworm}} would {{have to change the}} genetic sequence of its Snf7 gene at multiple sites. Combining multiple strategies, such as engineering the protein Cry, derived from a bacterium called <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis (Bt), and RNAi in one plant delay the onset of resistance.|$|E
5|$|Uracil is {{not usually}} found in DNA, {{occurring}} only as a breakdown product of cytosine. However, in several bacteriophages, <b>Bacillus</b> subtilis bacteriophages PBS1 and PBS2 and Yersinia bacteriophage piR1-37, thymine {{has been replaced by}} uracil. Another phage - Staphylococcal phage S6 - has been identified with a genome where thymine has been replaced by uracil.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{insecticides}} can {{be effective}} if application is targeted towards the vulnerable early-instar larvae. Two strains of the bacterium <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis produce toxins which kill the larvae. Other forms of pest control, through non-pesticidal management are available. Feeding can be inhibited by applying antifeedants, such as fungicides or products derived from Neem (Azadirachta indica), but these may have negative effects on the plants as well. The steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and these chemicals are strongly repellent to L. decemlineata.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as <b>Bacillus,</b> Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter can make up to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E
5|$|Farmers have widely adopted <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis (Bt) cotton {{since its}} first trial in Sindh {{province}} in 2002. It is now used in 95% of the area. The Punjab Seed Council has approved {{the use of}} 18 Bt cotton and non-Bt varieties for cultivation. These are: 12 BT varieties FH-114, CIM-598, SITARA-009, A-one, BH-167, MIAD-852, CIM-573, SLH-317, TARZAN-1, NS-141, IR-NIBGE-3, MNH-886, and six non-BT varieties NIBGE −115, FH-941, FH-942, IR-1524, Ali Akbar-802 and NEELAM-121. In Sindh province, local Sindh varieties of cotton are also grown in about 40% of the area. They are generally planted from April to July, and harvested during August–December.|$|E
5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20–88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological control has had limited success, so most preventative methods rely {{on the use of}} agrichemicals. Genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express the cry protein from <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis, which is toxic to lepidopteran species including the Maruca.|$|E
5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are widely distributed among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocorynin—a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone. This pigment, when in alkaline solution, turns a dark violet, similar in color to the fruit bodies of the fungus. Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the widely distributed food spoilage organism <b>Bacillus</b> stearothermophilus; however, it has no effect on the growth on Gram-negative bacteria, nor does it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E
5|$|The egg {{parasite}} Trichogramma {{is frequently}} released inundatively to control harmful moths. Similarly, <b>Bacillus</b> thuringiensis and other microbial insecticides {{are used in}} large enough quantities for a rapid effect. Recommended release rates for Trichogramma in vegetable or field crops range from 5,000 to 200,000 per acre (1 to 50 per square metre) per week according {{to the level of}} pest infestation. Similarly, nematodes that kill insects (that are entomopathogenic) are released at rates of millions and even billions per acre for control of certain soil-dwelling insect pests.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria such as <b>Bacillus</b> pasteurii, <b>Bacillus</b> pseudofirmus, <b>Bacillus</b> cohnii, Sporosarcina pasteuri, and Arthrobacter crystallopoietes {{increase}} the compression strength of concrete through their biomass. Not all bacteria {{increase the}} strength of concrete significantly with their biomass. <b>Bacillus</b> sp. CT-5. can reduce corrosion of reinforcement in reinforced concrete by up to four times. Sporosarcina pasteurii reduces water and chloride permeability. B. pasteurii increases resistance to acid. <b>Bacillus</b> pasteurii and B. sphaericuscan induce calcium carbonate precipitation in the surface of cracks, adding compression strength.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{inhibits}} Actinomucor elegans, Aspergillus niger, Bacterium linens, <b>Bacillus</b> megaterium, <b>Bacillus</b> subtilis, Brevibacterium erythrogenes, Candida utilis, Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus niveus, Saccharomyces mandshuricus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in concentrations above 10g/L.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} a large genus with nested genera is the <b>Bacillus</b> genus, in which the genera Paenibacillus and Brevibacillus are nested clades. There is {{insufficient}} genomic data at present to fully and effectively correct taxonomic errors in <b>Bacillus.</b>|$|E
25|$|BamHI, a {{nuclease}} enzyme from <b>Bacillus</b> amyloliquefaciens..|$|E
25|$|After {{numerous}} attempts {{he was able}} to incubate the bacteria in coagulated blood serum at 37 degrees Celsius. He then inoculated laboratory rabbits with the bacteria and observed that they died while exhibiting symptoms of tuberculosis, proving that the <b>bacillus,</b> which he named tuberculosis <b>bacillus,</b> was in fact the cause of tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Clostridium botulinum {{is a large}} {{anaerobic}} Gram-positive <b>bacillus</b> {{that forms}} subterminal endospores.|$|E

25|$|In 1882, Pasteur {{sent his}} {{assistant}} Louis Thuillier to southern France {{because of an}} epizootic of swine erysipelas. Thuillier identified the <b>bacillus</b> that caused the disease in March 1883. Pasteur and Thuillier increased the bacillus's virulence after passing it through pigeons. Then they passed the <b>bacillus</b> through rabbits, weakening it and obtaining a vaccine. Pasteur and Thuillier incorrectly described the bacterium as a figure-eight shape. Roux described the bacterium as stick-shaped in 1884.|$|E
