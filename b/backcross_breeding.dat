The donor C 107 strain lacks 1 Ax 1 but contains the HMW-GS pairs 1 Dx 2 + 1 Dy 12 and 1 Bx 7 + 1 By 9.

40|$|Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an {{important}} export crop in Kyrgyzstan {{since the end of}} the 20 th century. Kyrgyzstan produces about 70, 000 t of common beans per year, which provides jobs to 76 % of the population in the Talas region. Information about genetic diversity of common beans helps to select appropriate genetic material to be used for breeding programs. Accessions originating from both Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools, including the main Kyrgyz common bean market types were analyzed using simple sequence repeats (SSR) and qualitative morphological traits. The similarity matrices generated from the molecular and morphological data were well correlated (r = 0. 49 **). The cluster analysis of both data sets grouped the accessions according to their gene pools of origin, where Mesoamerican accessions were more diverse than Andean accessions. Both SSR and qualitative morphological markers were suitable for assigning cultivars to their gene pools of origin. Furthermore, information about traits of interest for Kyrgyz farmers has been gained. We found that Bean common mosaic virus strain NL 6 and anthracnose affect this crop and reduce its grain yield significantly in Kyrgyzstan. The susceptible Kyrgyz cultivars Ryabaya, Kytayanka and Lopatka were included as recurrent parents in a <b>backcrossing</b> <b>breeding</b> scheme for introducing host plant resistance to these diseases from donor cultivars.

This {{is one of the first}} studies in rice developing stable and high-yielding varieties combining both drought and submergence tolerance in a high yielding variety background through marker-assisted <b>backcrossing</b> <b>breeding</b> successfully released as varieties for cultivation by farmers. In the present study, we observed improved performance of selected NILs over Swarna and Swarna-Sub 1 under drought and submergence but we are yet to evaluate the lines under varying incidences of subsequent submergence and drought in the same season and observe plants adaptation. Even after affected by submergence under which duration of varieties increases by 10 – 12 [*]days, the developed NILs showed an average of 10 [*]days earlier flowering than Swarna-Sub 1. This will allow the timely planting of second season crop hence enhancing sustainable productivity. The yield improvement across three different backgrounds, TDK-Sub 1 (Dixit et al. 2017), IR 64 -Sub 1 (data not published) and Swarna-Sub 1 (present study) possessing both QTLs combining drought (DTYs) and submergence (Sub 1) clearly indicates that the drought and submergence tolerance can be efficiently combined even though both have different molecular and physiological regulatory mechanisms. QTLs on grain yield under drought has been reported to effect water-uptake, stomatal conductance, canopy temperature, transpiration and root growth at depth (Henry et al. 2014, 2015) whereas the physiological evidence for the submergence tolerance points towards the proper balance between the production and consumption of plant assimilates (Singh et al. 2014; Kretzschmar et al. 2015), fast coleoptile elongation, expansin genes expression, and lower cell division and peroxidase activity (Magneschi and Perrata 2009). “The development and release of three drought-submergence tolerant varieties (CR dhan 801, Bahuguni dhan- 1 and Bahuguni dhan- 2) for cultivation in rainfed lowland areas of India and Nepal are successful examples of contribution of use of genomic tools to improve yield under drought and submergence”.|$|R

30|$|While MAGIC populations offer {{a number}} of {{advantages}} for the extraction of new alleles, additional breeding approaches should be considered depending on breeding objectives. For introducing simple traits, marker assisted backcrossing (MABC) has been widely used to improve a single genotype by adding a favourable donor allele. In the case of complex traits, however, MABC becomes complicated as multiple donor alleles have to be introgressed to obtain the desired phenotype. Marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) is an improvement over MABC. Essentially, MARS involves marker-aided selection (MAS) of lines followed by inter-mating to derive recombined lines carrying multiple donor alleles of interest. Phenotypic recurrent selection with no MAS {{has been used as}} an alternate approach, although this could be a time-consuming process. For both MAGIC and MARS, careful selection of parental lines is important to capture multiple favourable traits. Unlike multi-allelic MARS, the selection of MAGIC parents is not guided by known QTLs but by their phenotypes. This increases the potential of capturing novel QTLs with small phenotypic variance and QTL combinations to enhance the improvement of complex traits. An insightful review of different <b>backcrossing</b> and <b>breeding</b> approaches is provided by Ribaut and Ragot (2007).|$|R

30|$|The {{introduction}} of marker-assisted breeding in agriculture has provided new opportunities towards the introgression of identified trait associated genes/QTLs in several popular rice varieties (Dixit et al. 2017; Shamsudin et al. 2016). The grain yield advantage over Swarna and Swarna-Sub 1 under RS drought stress and submergence, of those NILs possessing earlier identified major and consistent-effect QTLs, qDTY 1.1 (Vikram et al. 2011; Ghimire et al. 2012; Sandhu et al. 2014), qDTY 2.1 (Venuprasad et al. 2009; Sandhu et al. 2014), qDTY 3.1 (Dixit et al. 2014; Venuprasad et al. 2009) and Sub 1 (Neeraja et al. 2007) {{in the current}} marker-assisted <b>backcrossing</b> <b>breeding</b> programs indicates the suitability of these loci in improving drought-submergence tolerance in the Swarna background. In addition, the selected NILs showed significant grain yield advantage under NS as the selection for grain yield under both NS and RS was made across generation advancement. IR 96322 - 34 - 223 -B- 1 - 1 - 1 showed grain yield advantage of 2 to 54 % under NS (Table 3) and 1 to 17 % under moderate to severe drought stress (Table 4) over the combined mean across seasons and locations. IR 94391 - 131 - 358 - 19 -B- 1 - 1 - 1 showed grain yield advantage of 5 to 19 % under NS (Table 3) and 8 to 24 % under moderate to severe drought stress (Table 4) over the combined mean across seasons and locations. Similarly, IR 94391 - 131 - 358 - 19 -B- 1 - 1 - 1 showed grain yield improvement of 3 to 48 % under NS (Table 3) and 4 to 38 % under moderate to severe drought stress (Table 4) over the combined means across seasons and locations. The improvement of 0.8 to 1.0 [*]t[*]ha−[*] 1 in the yield of pyramided lines in different backgrounds as reported earlier (Vandana, IR 64, MTU 1010, TDK 1, and MRQ 74) (Kumar et al. 2014; Sandhu and Kumar 2017) {{as well as in}} the current study validates the success of QTL introgression in improving grain yield and tolerance to multiple stresses. The developed NILs were previously shown to perform well across different severity/intensity of drought and in regions with different conditions/ soil types (Singh et al. 2017). Some of the selected NILs showed early days to flowering than Swarna under NS (data not shown) and this may have resulted from the linkages of the qDTYs with earliness (Vikram et al. 2016). The plant height of most of the selected NILs were similar to the PHT of Swarna under NS but higher under RS (data not shown), this may be due to their increased ability to produce more biomass under RS. The linkage has been successfully broken and semi-dwarf, medium duration NILs in Swarna background have been developed.|$|R

Our objective was to determine if a <b>backcross</b> <b>breeding</b> approach with the aid of molecular markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to CBB in a donor parent could be used to attain higher levels of resistance to CBB in pinto bean. QTL conditioning CBB resistance from the donor parent XAN 159 were introgressed into the recurrent parent ‘Chase’ using classical <b>backcross</b> <b>breeding</b> and intermittent marker-assisted selection. ‘Chase’ pinto bean is moderately resistant and the breeding line XAN 159 is highly resistant to Xanthomonas campestris.

Pseudo-backcrossing is commonly used in perennial plants, including grape (Molnár et al. 2007), eucalyptus (Kullan et al. 2012), poplar (Novaes et al. 2009) and oil palm (Montoya et al. 2014).

30|$|The {{adverse effects}} of climate change such as drought and heat are {{becoming}} a major threat to sustainable rice production and productivity (IPCC et al., 2007). In recent years, El Niño-induced drought has become a common phenomenon across many countries of Asia and there is already a clear prediction that El Niño-induced drought will {{have a significant effect on}} overall rice stocks in 2016 (Mohanty, 2015). In order to mitigate drought, there have been increased efforts to breed drought-tolerant rice varieties by both conventional and molecular breeding approaches (Kumar et al. 2014). Several major-effect QTLs for GY under drought have been identified for both upland and lowland conditions (Kumar et al. 2014). These QTLs have been successfully used in marker-assisted <b>backcross</b> (MABC) <b>breeding</b> programs to improve the drought tolerance of widely adopted popular but drought-susceptible rice varieties such as IR 64, Swarna, MR 219 and MRQ 74 (Swamy et al. 2013; Swamy et al. 2014; Noraziyah et al. 2016 a; Noraziyah et al. 2016 b). However, qDTYs have different synergistic effects in different genetic backgrounds and meta-analysis of the major qDTYs has shown that few hotspot QTL regions are repeatedly being identified. To gain an economic yield advantage of at least 500  kg ha− 1, a minimum of two to three qDTYs have to be pyramided in elite genetic backgrounds (Swamy and Kumar, 2012); thus, exploration of genetic resources and the identification of several new qDTYs by association mapping is one of the most promising approaches.|$|R
30|$|BPH {{has been}} one of the {{important}} factors constraining rice yield. As the area of cultivated hybrid rice varieties gradually expands around the world, their resistance to BPH is attracting increasing attention by rice researchers (Hasan et al. 2015). Numerous BPH resistance genes have been introduced and pyramided into elite rice varieties, which has resulted in strongly improved capacity of rice to endure damage caused by BPH (Myint et al. 2012; Qiu et al. 2012; Wan et al. 2013; Suh et al. 2011). With the adaptation of BPH to resistant varieties and the evolution of a new biotype of BPH (Fujita et al. 2013), different BPH resistance genes still need to be pyramided into multiple elite hybrid rice varieties to overcome these problems. In the present study, through molecular-marker assisted <b>backcross</b> (MAB) <b>breeding,</b> we successfully transferred two BPH-resistance genes, Bph 14 and Bph 15, into an elite restorer line Huahui 938 to obtain three improved lines, which showed enhanced resistance to BPH compared with the controls. When these NILs were crossed with the CMS line with the same BPH resistance genes, the hybrids (homozygous genotype with resistance loci) were resistant against BPH. Some derived hybrids had higher yield and more desirable rice qualities and agronomic performance compared with the controls. Therefore, it is possible to develop hybrid rice with high BPH resistance and excellent agronomic performance in the future and to solve the problem of hybrid rice being susceptible to BPH (Horgan and Crisol 2013).|$|R

Application of molecular breeding is considered as a feasible method to improve soybean rust resistance and minimize the adverse effects from overuse fungicides in this country. In this study, we have successfully applied molecular markers in a <b>backcross</b> <b>breeding</b> program to introgress the Rpp 5 gene of SBR resistance into HL 203, an elite Vietnamese soybean variety, from two donor lines of DT 2000 and Stuart 99084 B- 28. The plants in BC 4 F 1 generation had maximum contribution from the recurrent parents and retained SBR resistance gene. </span...|$|E
40|$|Genome editing, or {{genome editing}} with {{engineered}} nucleases, is a technology that, using engineered nucleases, allows site-specific single-base mutations or the insertion, deletion or replacement of DNA sequences {{in a specific}} site in the genome of an organism. Genome editing {{is based on the}} induction of double strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA in the locus of interest to introduce mutations in that locus. In fact, after DSB induction, the damage will be repaired by processes (the non-homologous end joining and/or the homology-directed repair), that occur naturally in the cells and during which mutations may occur. DSBs can be induced by different nucleases, all capable of specifically recognising a locus in the genome. The most promising is the CRISPR/Cas system, for ease of designing nucleases with sequence specificity and for the fact that it can be used in nearly every organism. In the CRISPR/Cas 9 system, the recognition of the DNA sequence to be modified is operated by an RNA sequence. After successful DNA DSB, the cell proceeds with the repair of DNA. Generally, the cell uses non-homologous end joining, which produces substitutions, insertions and deletions of nucleotides in the damaged DNA site, and usually leads to loss of function of the target gene. When using this mode, the genome editing can be considered a biological site-specific mutagenesis, different from the mutagenesis induced by physical or chemical agents which randomly induce mutations through the entire genome. On the contrary, when homologydirected repair is involved, genome editing can be considered a predetermined biological mutagenesis that modifies or corrects the target gene in the sense determined by the investigator. Applying genome editing to plants requires also ancillary technologies, according to the species and cell types. First, in vitro culture techniques, especially protoplast cultures, might be necessary for the production of cells that can be subjected to the nuclease treatment. Then, transformation vectors (Agrobacterium, viruses or biolistic methods) are needed to enable the transfer of the components required for genome editing to the plant cell. The vectors may be stable or transient; in the latter case, both the possible cytotoxicity of constitutively expressed nucleases and the production of transgenic plants would be avoided. Concerning the first results obtained using this technology, mutations in target genes of cultivated plants were obtained mostly through non-homologous end joining for traits related to morphology, quality and to the resistance to pathogens and herbicides, in both herbaceous and woody species. Results were also reported exploiting the homology-directed repair. Overall, the genome editing technology proved suitable to introduce precise and predictable gene mutations directly into elite cultivars, reducing the duration of traditional crossing and <b>backcrossing</b> <b>breeding,</b> with the possibility to modi fy more than one genes per experiment. Although many advances in genome editing technology have been achieved in recent years, some technical problems remain to be solved, including the need for increasing the efficiency of the system, the production of off-target mutations, the influence of chromatin structure on the editing efficiency, the possible side effects on genes lying close to target genes and the efficiency of the technology in polyploid species (where many copies of target genes occur). In conclusion, the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as the most important tool for the future of genetics because of its simplicity, versatility and efficiency. It will {{have a major impact on}} both basic and applied research and will be used to produce cultivars with improved disease resistance, with a higher nutritional value, and able to survive climate changes, more suitable as bioenergy crops, producing useful chemicals and biomolecule...|$|R
40|$|The legume pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{divesting}} pests of pigeon pea. And it is an important biotic constraint to pigeon pea production worldwide. In recent years, development of Helicoverpa armigera populations resistant to insecticides has further hampered the control of measures. Therefore, identification and utilization of cultivars resistant to tolerant to Helicoverpa armigera would have a number of advantages, particularly for a relatively low value crop such as pigeon pea. Resistant/susceptible cultivars would provide an equitable, environmentally sound and sustainable pest management tool. High levels of resistance to pod borer have been reported in wild relatives and some of the cultivars of pigeon pea. The pod wall surface and their exudates play a major role in host selection process of inset herbivores. Based on this objective, in the present investigation, inheritance of resistance to pod borer in parents (Cajanus cajan) and their F 1, F 2, BC 1 and BC 2 generations have been studied. Single dominant gene was observed in F 2 and backcross generations. This can be incorporated in the adapted cultivar by the simple <b>backcross</b> method of <b>breeding...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{inherited}} skeletal abnormality of {{the rabbit}} {{in which the}} lower segment of the foreleg was permanently curved has been described in the preceding paper (1). This curious condition developed {{during the period of}} active bony growth and the bowing was well defined as early as at 6 weeks of age. The convexity of the curvature was directed inward toward the body and the paws assumed a flipper or seal-like position. From the results of physical and x-ray examinations {{it was found that the}} distal epiphyseal cartilage of the ulna was the site primarily affected and changes elsewhere appeared to be secondary to or have resulted from the ulnar lesion. The progressive development of the ulnar lesion up to 2 to 3 months of age was followed by comparatively rapid regression of it with healing at 3 to 4 months of age. The deformity was noted in the early days of the rabbit colony long studied in The Rockefeller Institute. It was first observed in the offspring of pure bred Beveren rabbits and almost at the same time in certain families of pure bred Belgian and French Silver rabbits. The familial character of its distribution was noted again after several years when another example was observed in the progeny of recently purchased pure bred Dutch rabbits. That the abnormality had in fact an hereditary basis was soon evident and the results of breeding tests showed that all offspring of affected parents likewise developed the deformity (1). The results of further studies on the genetic aspects of the abnormality as obtained from F 1, F~, and <b>backcross</b> test <b>breeding</b> experiments are described in the present report. It also contains the observations made at postmortem examination and the results of the microscopic study of representative organs and tissues, particularly those of the foreleg bones. Pathological Findings The postmortem examination of the rabbits with hereditary foreleg bowing deformity revealed nothing of note other than the lesion of the distal epiphysi...|$|R
