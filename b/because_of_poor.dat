5|$|Growing up in Ohio, Gillom {{played for}} Brown on the {{football}} team at Massillon Washington High School, where he excelled as an end, linebacker and punter. In Gillom's three seasons between 1938 and 1940, Massillon won all of its games and captured two High School Football National Championships. Gillom followed Brown to Ohio State University in 1941, playing on the school's freshman football team before dropping out <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> grades. He then entered the U.S. Army and served for three years in World War II. Upon his discharge, Gillom enrolled at the University of Nevada, Reno to finish his college career. He led the country in scoring in 1946 but left the school after the season, again <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> grades.|$|E

5|$|Because he {{was unable}} to afford {{university}} tuition, Truman had thought of going to the costless United States Military Academy at West Point, but he was refused an appointment <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> eyesight. He enlisted in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillery battery and attaining the rank of corporal. At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness). The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E
5|$|No {{members of}} the general public were {{permitted}} on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> weather.|$|E

The French forces were unable {{to respond to the}} British fire <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the <b>poor</b> state <b>of</b> their gunpowder.

Memphis and Louisville were the most promising cities, with Heisley selecting Memphis because it offered a better deal and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> local executive leadership in Louisville. The choice would still have to be studied by a five-member NBA group before permission was granted from the league. The team's final game at GM Place was a 95–100 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 14; the team's final game as a Vancouver-based franchise was a road 95–81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Fobney Lock and the {{associated}} water treatment works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At County Lock the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. This narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as Brewery Gut. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> visibility {{and the difficulty of}} boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime traffic lights. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's The Oracle shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 series allowed {{each team}} {{to make use}} of a 19-man active roster. Exceptions were made in two cases that allowed teams' active rosters to expand to 21players, both times for the same reason. Two games during the season had to be {{postponed}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> weather. Both games involved teams meeting for the first time during the season; make-up games were scheduled {{at the start of the}} return series between the teams, and this resulted in two four-game series. In both cases, the teams had a 19-man roster for the make-up game, and an expanded 21-man roster for the originally scheduled series.|$|E

It opened in 1851 after several false starts, followed by branch lines to Rye Harbour in 1854, Dungeness in 1881 and New Romney in 1884. The line struggled to be profitable and it seemed likely that it would close following the Beeching Report. All the branch lines were closed by 1967 but the main line was kept open <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> road connections in the area. Services are currently being provided by Southern.|$|E

5|$|At West Point, {{he was an}} {{energetic}} and ambitious cadet, deeply interested in the teachings of Dennis Hart Mahan and the theoretical strategic principles of Antoine-Henri Jomini. His closest friends were aristocratic Southerners such as James Stuart, Dabney Maury, Cadmus Wilcox, and A. P. Hill. These associations gave McClellan what he {{considered to be an}} appreciation of the Southern mind and an understanding of the political and military implications of the sectional differences in the United States that led to the Civil War. He graduated in 1846, second in his class of 59 cadets, losing the top position to Charles Seaforth Stewart only <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> drawing skills. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War a {{large number}} of {{concrete}} pillboxes were built as part of the GHQ Line - Blue to defend against an expected German invasion; many of these are still visible {{along the banks of the}} canal. They were generally built close to road and rail bridges, which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles. After the war the Transport Act of 1947 transferred control of the canal to the British Transport Commission, but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the Avoncliff Aqueduct.

The area has quik clay, so the bridge needed piling. At Røra, a spur was originally planned to Hylla, but this was discarded late in the planning phase. At Hellem in Inderøy the right-of-way had to be moved <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> soil mechanics. There were similar issues north of the Lunnan Tunnel, forcing the tunnel to be extended and a supporting being built. Construction of the tunnel was performed by 40 men {{during the winter of}} 1904 and 1905. It cost NOK90,179 and took 23.9 man-hours per meter to build.|$|E
5|$|Gillom {{fought in}} the European Theatre of World War II and participated in the Battle of the Bulge {{near the end of}} the war. He was {{discharged}} after three years of service, having earned three Bronze Star Medals. By that time, Brown had become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Brown wanted Gillom on the team, but changed his approach after signing fullback Marion Motley in 1946. Motley, a black star who played in high school for Massillon rival Canton, joined the Browns from the University of Nevada, Reno, where former Canton coach Jim Aiken was head coach. As compensation for drawing Motley away, Brown arranged for Gillom to go to Nevada for the 1946 season. Gillom led the nation in punting at Nevada that year, but left the school in December <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>poor</b> grades.|$|E
