40|$|A {{control system}} for {{achieving}} high-speed torque for a joint of a robot includes {{a printed circuit}} board assembly (PCBA) having a collocated joint processor and high-speed communication bus. The PCBA may also include a power inverter module (PIM) and local sensor conditioning electronics (SCE) for processing sensor data from one or more motor position sensors. Torque control of a motor of the joint is provided via the PCBA as a high-speed torque loop. Each joint processor may be embedded within or collocated with the robotic joint being controlled. Collocation of the joint processor, PIM, and high-speed bus may increase noise immunity of the control system, and the localized processing of sensor data from the joint motor at the joint level may minimize <b>bus</b> <b>cabling</b> to and from each control node. The joint processor may include a field programmable gate array (FPGA) ...|$|E
40|$|The cost {{of several}} circuit {{configurations}} for large (5 MW) array fields were investigated {{to assess the}} relative costs {{of high and low}} voltage configurations. Three source circuit NOC voltages were evaluated: 400 V (ungrounded), 800 V (+ or 400 V center grounded), and 2000 V (+ or - 1000 V center grounded). Four source circuit configurations were considered {{for each of the three}} NOC voltages. The configurations correspond to source circuit currents of 15, 30, 45, and 60 amperes, respectively. Conceptual layouts for 5 MW building blocks for each of the above configurations were developed. The designs were optimized to minimize BOS electrical and structural costs. Only the BOS electrical costs were evaluated. The designs were broken down into the following elements for cost: (1) basic source circuit intermodule wiring, bypass diodes and associated hardware, source circuit to J-Box wiring, etc; (2) J-Box blocking diodes, varistors, heat sinks, and housing; (3) disconnects source circuit disconnects, fuses, and housing; (4) <b>bus</b> <b>cabling</b> J-Box to PCU interface wiring, and trenching; (5) interface bus bar, group disconnects, and fuses; and (6) fault detection shunts, signal wire, electronics, and alarm. It is concluded that high voltage low current circuits are not economical, at higher currents high and low voltage circuit costs approach each other, high voltage circuits are not likely to offer near term advantage, and development work/manufacturer stimulation is needed to develop low cost high voltage hardware...|$|E

50|$|Stubs for RTs, the BC, or BMs, are {{generally}} {{connected to the}} bus through coupling boxes, which may provide a single or multiple stub connections. These provide the required shielding (≥ 75 percent) and, for transformer coupled stubs, contain the coupling transformers and isolation resistors. They have two external connectors through which the bus feeds, and one or more external connectors to which the stub or stubs connect. These stub connectors should not be terminated with matching resistors, but left open circuit when not used, with blanking caps where necessary. One of the bus connectors may be terminated where the bus coupler is physically {{at the end of}} the <b>bus</b> <b>cable,</b> i.e. it is not normally considered essential to have a length of <b>bus</b> <b>cable</b> between the last bus coupler and the termination resistor.|$|R

50|$|IBM {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} I/O channel on the Model 85 and Model 195: the 2880 block multiplexer channel. The channel allowed a device to suspend a channel program, pending the completion of an I/O operation and thus to free the channel for use by another device. These channels could support either standard 1.5 MB/second connections or, with the 2-byte interface feature, 3 MB/second; the later used one tag <b>cable</b> and two <b>bus</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R

The network can support up to 5 repeaters (10 when used for redundant networks). The repeaters do not utilize network node numbers and are available in copper or fiber optic choices.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{standard that}} {{was derived from}} the Shugart Associates System Interface (SASI) and formally adopted in 1986 by ANSI. SCSI-1 features an 8-bit parallel bus (with parity), running asynchronously at 3.5 MB/s, or 5 MB/s in synchronous mode, and a maximum <b>bus</b> <b>cable</b> length of 6 meters (just under 20 feet—compared to the 18 inch (0.45 meter) limit of the ATA interface).

50|$|However, whilst {{there has}} been some {{research}} into its use, there {{do not appear to be}} any existing or impending implementations of it on production aircraft, either as new build or upgrades. This may be related to the susceptibility of these additional high-speed transmissions to the specific routeing of the 1553 <b>bus</b> <b>cables,</b> and the exact placement of the couplers, BC, and RTs on different aircraft of a fleet, which may make it difficult to specify, in advance of an upgrade, precisely what additional capacity might be provided.|$|R

The importance is to minimize the cable length to avoid an communications problem on the bus.|$|R
40|$|The main {{building}} block and readout {{unit of the}} planned CDF Run IIb silicon detector is a "stave," a highly integrated mechanical, thermal, and electrical structure. One of its characteristic features is a copper-on-Kapton flexible cable for power, high voltage, data transmission, and control signals that is placed directly below the silicon microstrip sensors. The dense packaging makes deadtime-less operation of the stave a challenge since coupling of <b>bus</b> <b>cable</b> activity into the silicon sensors must be suppressed efficiently. The stave design features relevant for deadtime-less operation are discussed. The electrical performance achieved with stave prototypes is presented...|$|R
50|$|This {{standard}} was introduced c. 1997 and featured a low-voltage differential (LVD) bus. For this reason ultra-2 is {{sometimes referred to}} as LVD SCSI. LVD's greater resistance to noise allowed a maximum <b>bus</b> <b>cable</b> length of 12 meters. At the same time, the data transfer rate was increased to 80 MB/s. Mixing earlier single-ended devices (SE) and Ultra-2 devices on the same bus is possible but connecting only a single SE device forces the whole bus to single-ended mode with all its limitations, including transfer speed. Ultra-2 SCSI actually had a relatively short lifespan, as it was soon superseded by Ultra-3 (Ultra-160) SCSI.|$|R
40|$|Current cabling {{systems in}} cars {{are about to}} be, {{completely}} or partially, replaced by a cabling technology called flexible flat cables, FFCs. This new technology requires tools that can assist engineers in the design process of the cable layouts. The aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} software demonstrator of a concept tool for this purpose. The task is divided into three problem areas. Topology modeling, optimization and visualization. An editor is to be implemented which handles creation and modification of topologies which represents FFC harnesses. The optimization is performed using global and local routing. The global routing handles optimization on topology level, defining net paths in the topology. Local routing handles the exact net placement on each <b>bus</b> <b>cable.</b> Finally, the local routing solutions should be graphically presented to the user. The topology modeling requirement was implemented as a graph layouteditor. Global routing is performed using graph search techniques and local routing is based on VLSI channel routing methods. Visualization is implemented for the local routing solutions using the SVG format. The developed application handles most of the requirements. The editor has support for an XML netlist which is used for specifying connectors and nets used in the topology. Global routing and local routing can be performed on the topology. Prerouting of nets can be performed on both global and local level. Support for assigning specific cables, from a library, to <b>bus</b> <b>cables</b> is possible...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{ambiguous}} situation arises {{with the}} connectors used for USB, FireWire (IEEE-1394), HDMI, and Thunderbolt serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors {{reveals that the}} contact [...] "pins" [...] are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the plug connector {{as if it were}} a connector pin. By this convention, the connectors on serial <b>bus</b> <b>cables</b> are [...] "male plugs", and the corresponding connectors on equipment are [...] "female jacks".|$|R

The high voltage is produced {{for each of the}} 10, 080 photomultiplier tubes of the detector individually, by the same number of active bases with on-board Greinacher voltage multipliers. The full VME-based HV controller system, which addresses each base via <b>bus</b> <b>cables</b> once per second, is miniaturized and fits into a single VME crate. The main advantages of this approach are the low heat dissipation, the considerably reduced amount of cabling and cost, as well as the high stability and low noise of the system. (orig.)

40|$|The {{different}} LHC main bus bar splice components (<b>bus</b> bar <b>cable,</b> splice U-piece and wedge and bus bar stabilizer) {{are subjected}} to different heat treatments (HTs) during bus bar assembly and splice soldering. The influence of soldering HTs on the RRR of the LHC main <b>bus</b> bar <b>cable</b> strands has been determined. The RRR of several splice U-pieces and wedges dismounted from the LHC has been measured. A correlation between the Vickers hardness and the RRR of the high purity Cu profiles has been established. All U-pieces tested that were produced before 2009 have a RRR> 200, while the RRR of all wedges and of U-pieces of 2009 production have a much lower RRR.

5000|$|Control {{units were}} {{connected}} to the channels with [...] "bus and tag" [...] <b>cable</b> pairs. The <b>bus</b> <b>cables</b> carried the address and data information and the tag cables identified what data was on the bus. The general configuration of a channel was to connect the devices in a chain, like this: Mainframe—Control Unit X—Control Unit Y—Control Unit Z.

For example, control unit X might capture addresses 40-4F, control unit Y: C0-DF, and control unit Z: 80-9F. Capture ranges {{had to be a}} multiple of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 devices and be aligned on appropriate boundaries. Each control unit in turn had one or more devices attached to it.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{voltage control}} of distributed dc power systems. DC power {{systems have been}} discussed {{as a result of}} the introduction of renewable, small-scale power generation units. Also, telecommunication power systems featuring UPS properties might benefit from a broader introduction of dc power systems. Droop control is utilized to distribute the load between the source converters. In order to make the loading of the source converters equal, in per unit, the voltage control algorithm for each converter has to be designed to act similar. The dc side capacitor of each converter, needed for filtering, is also determined as a consequence. The root locus is investigated for varying dc bus impedance. It is found that the risk of entering converter over-modulation is a stronger limitation than stability, at least for reasonable dc <b>bus</b> <b>cable</b> parameters. The stationary and dynamic properties during load variations are also investigated...|$|R
50|$|In {{local area}} {{networks}} where bus topology is used, each node {{is connected to}} a single cable, by the help of interface connectors. This central cable is {{the backbone of the}} network and is known as the bus (thus the name.) A signal from the source travels in both directions to all machines connected on the <b>bus</b> <b>cable</b> until it finds the intended recipient. If the machine address does not match the intended address for the data, the machine ignores the data. Alternatively, if the data matches the machine address, the data is accepted. Because the bus topology consists of only one wire, it is rather inexpensive to implement when compared to other topologies. However, the low cost of implementing the technology is offset by the high cost of managing the network. Additionally, because only one cable is utilized, it can be the single point of failure. In this topology data being transferred may be accessed by any workstation.|$|R
