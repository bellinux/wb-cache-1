5|$|In {{its early}} years, Caversham was heavily industrialised, but also {{contained}} {{a large number}} of residential properties. The population included {{a large number of}} skilled tradespeople and craftspeople, and <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small industries abounded. Local industries {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century included a brickworks, a gasworks, breweries, a smithy, milliners, several bakeries, a tannery, a bootmakers, and Rutherford's Wax Vesta match factory at Forbury Corner. In 1900, the South Road-David Street-Forbury Corner area was home to over 50 businesses.|$|E
5|$|When a Purkinje cell axon enters one of {{the deep}} nuclei, it {{branches}} {{to make contact with}} <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small nuclear cells, but the total number of cells contacted is only about 35 (in cats). Conversely, a single deep nuclear cell receives input from approximately 860 Purkinje cells (again in cats).|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the age and}} {{location}} of the Golubac Fortress, it is <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> well-preserved. Its placement {{at the head of}} the Iron Gate gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic. It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the fortress is further indicated by the attention it received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E

50|$|The Doeberl Cup is {{an annual}} chess tournament held in Canberra, Australia. It {{has been held}} every year since 1963 and is the longest running weekend chess event in Australia.

5|$|While early incense seals {{were made}} of wood or stone, the Chinese {{gradually}} introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, {{to allow for the}} changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts. Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage {{was caused by the}} initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E

It orbits {{very close to}} its host star, <b>and</b> is <b>both</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> more massive than Jupiter. Due to the extreme heat it receives from its star, the dayside temperature is predicted to be 2730 K.|$|R
25|$|In Italy towers {{are almost}} always free {{standing}} and the position is often dictated by the landform of the site, rather than aesthetics.

The overall crime rate in Lake Charles is 67% higher than the national average.|$|E
25|$|Romanesque churches {{generally}} {{have a single}} portal centrally placed on the west front, the focus of decoration for {{the facade of the}} building. Some churches such as Saint-Étienne, Caen, (11th century) and Pisa Cathedral (late 12th century) had three western portals, in the manner of Early Christian basilicas. Many churches, <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small, had lateral entrances that were commonly used by worshippers.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, Peña Nieto {{announced}} {{an end to}} Pemex's monopoly, inviting in <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small private companies to {{the oil and gas}} industry. He said that in early 2015, more than 100 blocks would be auctioned for development. The government believes that changing technology will allow additional drilling in mature fields, such as those near Tampico, as well as larger fields likely offshore. This decision has received international coverage.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the next}} several decades, factories, <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small, would dot the area landscape. What had mainly been an {{agricultural}} and ranching area would get replaced {{with a variety of}} manufacturing industries. Moreland operated from 1917 to 1937. Aerospace supplier Menasco Manufacturing Company would later purchase the property. Menasco's Burbank landing gear factory closed in 1994 due to slow commercial and military orders, affecting 310 people. Within months of Moreland's arrival, Community Manufacturing Company, a $3 million tractor company, arrived in Burbank.|$|E

25|$|It was {{introduced}} to British gardens in 1736. In the UK, it is encountered frequently in gardens <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small, {{as well as some}} parks, and is most common in the eastern areas of the country. It is sometimes employed as a hedge, but is considered inferior for this usage compared to Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock); it is not well adapted to the UK climate and as a consequence often has a poorly developed, forked and sinuous trunk there. In Germany, it is the most frequently seen hemlock in cultivation, and is also used in forestry.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} was immediately dismantled {{to make way}} for something larger. Construction on the Basilica began in 1921 after Father Baker unveiled plans at a parish council meeting to build a shrine in homage to the Blessed Mother. Because of Baker's influence in the community and well-known charitable reputation across the nation, he was able to get sufficient financial support to begin construction quickly. Baker solicited support for his project, and thousands from across the nation contributed funding <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small, mostly through a direct-mail fundraising club. Designed by Emile Ulrich, the basilica was constructed at a cost of $3.2 million, but the project was completed without the parish incurring any debt.|$|E
25|$|As smaller {{pulmonary}} emboli tend {{to lodge}} in more peripheral areas without collateral circulation {{they are more}} likely to cause lung infarction and small effusions (both of which are painful), but not hypoxia, dyspnea or hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia. Larger PEs, which tend to lodge centrally, typically cause dyspnea, hypoxia, low blood pressure, fast heart rate and fainting, but are often painless because there is no lung infarction due to collateral circulation. The classic presentation for PE with pleuritic pain, dyspnea and tachycardia is likely caused by a large fragmented embolism causing <b>both</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> small PEs. Thus, small PEs are often missed because they cause pleuritic pain alone without any other findings and large PEs often missed because they are painless and mimic other conditions often causing ECG changes and small rises in troponin and BNP levels.|$|E
