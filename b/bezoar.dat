5|$|One dodo was {{reportedly}} sent {{as far as}} Nagasaki, Japan in 1647, but it was long unknown whether it arrived. Contemporary documents first published in 2014 proved the story, and showed that it had arrived alive. It was meant as a gift, and, despite its rarity, was considered of equal value to a white deer and a <b>bezoar</b> stone. It is the last recorded live dodo in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{purchasing}} specimens, many geologists {{visited her}} to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification. Henry De la Beche and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme, and he, Mary, and sometimes Mary's brother Joseph, went fossil-hunting together. De la Beche and Anning {{kept in touch}} as {{he became one of}} Britain's leading geologists. William Buckland, who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning. It was to him she made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as <b>bezoar</b> stones, were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects coprolites. In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and Richard Owen visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.|$|E
5|$|Anning {{searched for}} fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, {{particularly}} {{during the winter months}} when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations {{played a key role in}} the discovery that coprolites, known as <b>bezoar</b> stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.|$|E
40|$|Most gastric <b>bezoars</b> can {{be treated}} with {{endoscopic}} fragmentation combined with or without cola dissolution, whereas laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery is generally inevitable for small intestinal <b>bezoars</b> because they cause small bowel obstruction. Therefore, early diagnosis and management of gastric <b>bezoars</b> are necessary to prevent bezoar-induced ileus. To investigate the incidence of overlooked gastric <b>bezoars</b> during the initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy, we retrospectively reviewed the cases of 27 patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal <b>bezoars.</b> The <b>bezoars</b> were diagnosed using esophagogastroduodenoscopy (n= 25), abdominal ultrasonography (n= 1), and barium follow-through examination (n= 1). <b>Bezoars</b> were overlooked in 9 / 25 patients (36. 0 %) during the initial endoscopy examination because the <b>bezoars</b> were covered with debris in the stomach. Of the 9 patients, 8 had concomitant gastric ulcers, and the other patient had gastric lymphoma. Although a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed before the second-look endoscopy in 8 of the 9 patients, the <b>bezoars</b> were mistaken as food debris on CT findings and were overlooked in these patients. In conclusion, gastric <b>bezoars</b> may not be discovered during the initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy and CT scan. In cases with debris in the stomach, second-look endoscopy is essential to detect <b>bezoars...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background. <b>Bezoars</b> {{are well}} {{established}} entities causing gastrointestinal obstructions. Depending on the prominent constituent of these <b>bezoars,</b> {{the latter are}} divided into four subtypes: pharmacobezoars, lactobezoars, trichobezoars, and phytobezoars. Less frequently reported types of <b>bezoars</b> are reported including those formed secondary to nasogastric tube feeding with casein-based formulas. Case Presentation. A 69 -year-old male presented following cardiac arrest postmyocardial infarction. Patient sustained anoxic brain injury after resuscitation, rendering him ventilator dependant along with nasogastric tube feeding, initially. Dislodging of the nasogastric tube at one time rendered it difficult to reinsert it, with investigation showing the presence of calcified material within the distal oesophagus, mainly composed of casein-based products secondary to enteral feeding. Conclusion. <b>Bezoars</b> are well known to cause gastrointestinal obstructions due to their indigestible characteristics within the alimentary tract. More rare causes of <b>bezoars</b> include those formed from casein-based feeding formulas administered to patients with sustained enteral feeding. Esophageal obstruction, secondary to casein-based <b>bezoars,</b> occurs due to multiple risk factors, especially in those necessitating intensive care. Approach in such scenarios requires a multiteam approach...|$|R
25|$|In 1575, French surgeon Ambroise Paré {{described}} an experiment {{to test the}} properties of the <b>bezoar</b> stone.

It happened that a cook at King's court was caught stealing fine silver cutlery and was sentenced to death by hanging. The cook agreed to be poisoned instead. Ambroise Paré then used the <b>bezoar</b> stone to no great avail, as the cook died in agony seven hours after taking poison. Paré had proved that the <b>bezoar</b> stone could not cure all poisons, contrary to popular belief at the time.|$|E

40|$|Small bowel {{obstruction}} {{is rarely}} caused by <b>bezoars</b> concretions formed from undigested foreign {{material in the}} gastrointestinal tract. An important cause of <b>bezoars</b> is phytobezoars, formed from vegetables or fruits. A four-year-old boy presented to our emergency department with symptoms of acute intestinal obstruction. Upright plain abdominal radiography revealed multiple air fluid levels. Ultrasound showed no abnormalities, and because of worsening symptoms computed tomography of abdomen was performed. It showed intraluminal obstruction of the terminal ileum. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a phytobezoar consisting of undigested rhubarb. The mass was milked through the large bowel and out the anus.

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} the clinical characteristics {{of patients with}} gastric or intestinal <b>bezoars</b> recently treated in our hospital. METHODS: In this study, a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients with gastrointestinal <b>bezoars,</b> who were treated at the Samsun Education and Research Hospital between January 2006 and March 2011, was conducted. Data on demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, history of risk factors, diagnostic procedures, localization of <b>bezoars,</b> treatment interventions, and postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were collected and evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-two patients [26 (61. 9 %) males and 16 (31. 1 %) females] with a mean 1; SD (range) age of 55. 8 1; 10. 5 (37 - 74) years were enrolled in this study. Thirty-six patients (85. 7 %) had one or more predisposing risk factors for gastrointestinal <b>bezoars.</b> The most common predisposing risk factor was a history of previous gastric surgery which was identified in 18 patients (42. 8 %). Twenty three patients (54. 8 %) had multiple predisposing risk factors. Phytobezoars were identified in all patients except one who had a trichobezoar in the stomach. Non-operative endoscopic fragmentation was performed either initially or after unsuccessful medical treatment in 14 patients with gastric <b>bezoars</b> and was completely successful in 10 patients (71. 5 %). Surgery was the most frequent treatment method in our study, which was required in 28 patients (66. 7 %).

40|$|<b>Bezoars</b> {{are foreign}} bodies in the form of round balls {{typically}} found in the alimentary tract, in the area of the stomach. They are created from residual material, e. g. from accidentally swallowed objects (buttons, coins) or some medicines {{as well as}} hair and vegetable fibres. <b>Bezoars</b> increase in size as the result of accumulation of undigested food wastes and are unable {{to pass through the}} subsequent alimentary tack sections. <b>Bezoars</b> mostly cause nonspecific abdominal pain.
