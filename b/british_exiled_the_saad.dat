50|$|The French and Indian War was the North American {{theater of}} the Seven Years' War, lasting from 1754 to 1763. There was intense {{fighting}} between the troops of British America and the French inhabitants of Acadia, a colony of New France located {{in what is now}} the Canadian Maritime provinces and the U.S. state of Maine. In 1755 <b>the</b> <b>British</b> forcibly <b>exiled</b> <b>the</b> French-speaking Acadians; approximately 11,500 were exiled in total. Most of <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> Acadians who managed to survive traveled to Louisiana, where their descendants are known as Cajuns. Other refugees returned to France or resettled in Baltimore. Ships boarded with 913 Acadian refugees arrived in Baltimore in November 1755. Shunned by a Francophobic population, the Acadians had to rely upon themselves to better their own conditions. Drawing on their experiences as fishers, many Acadian men became sailor and longshoremen.|$|R

5000|$|The French Rite {{is intimately}} {{linked to the}} birth of Freemasonry in France and was founded in France in 1786. [...] <b>British</b> <b>exiles</b> brought <b>the</b> Modern rite to France and this was little by little passed onto the French Rite. Though this hybrid form is no longer known as the French Rite, it {{sometimes}} takes that name to distinguish it from the Scottish Rites from which it was initially formed. In order to guarantee that French Freemasonry would have a national dimension, the Grand Orient de France organised the standardisation of [...] "Modern" [...] hexagonal (or French, from the perceived shape of the country) rites from 1782 onwards, and in 1785 the model was fixed for the first three degrees in a [...] "blue lodge", which showed a strong English influence in contrast to the Scottish Rites. However, it was only in 1801 that the Grand Orient de France printed the rules of this rite under the title Régulateur du Maçon, containing several additions and amendments to the former version, which had circulated from lodge to lodge in discrete manuscript form. The Rite underwent several further reforms, and in 1858 the [...] "Murat French Rite" [...] (returning to the foundations of the Constitutions of Anderson without making lasting change to the rite) was imposed.|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on {{interpretation}} of poetry of Czech authors in <b>British</b> <b>exile</b> during World War II. While examining individual collections, the poems are viewed {{in the context of}} simultaneous domestic poetry in the 30 ?s and 40 ?s of the 20 th century. The main aim of the thesis is to catch the experience of a lyrical subject in <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> background. Another important part of this thesis is also a chapter which is dealing with cultural background in <b>British</b> <b>exile,</b> since this element, understandably, influenced the life of Czechoslovakian emigrants and our artists. Contemporary anthologies which were published in <b>British</b> <b>exile</b> during World War II are analysed in this chapter, as well. Another topic which is mentioned briefly in the thesis is the historical context which is closely connected with the later artists? departure and their works...|$|R

50|$|In April-May 1941, Greece was {{overrun by}} German forces, {{and the country}} was {{occupied}} by the Germans, the Italians and the Bulgarians. Soon, resistance movements began to emerge, the principal one being the National Liberation Front (Greek: Εθνικό Απελευθερωτικό Μέτωπο, Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo, EAM). On 9 September, the National Republican Greek League was founded with funding from <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> proclaiming <b>the</b> <b>exiled</b> and completely unaware Plastiras as its president. On the same day however, Pyromaglou left for Greece as Plastiras' representative. After arriving in Athens on September 23, he quickly established contact with officers and politicians. Napoleon Zervas then convinced him to join EDES, which was promptly reformed in October, with Pyromaglou as its General Secretary, {{at the head of}} a five-man Executive Committee.|$|R

5|$|Hoping {{to extend}} the Continental System and choke off British trade with the European mainland, Napoleon invaded Iberia and {{declared}} his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The Peninsular War lasted six years, featured extensive guerrilla warfare, and ended in victory for the Allies. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia. Unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, the Russians routinely violated the Continental System and enticed Napoleon into another war. The French launched a major invasion of Russia {{in the summer of}} 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the collapse of the Grand Army and the destruction of Russian cities, and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. The Allies then invaded France and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was <b>exiled</b> to <b>the</b> island of Elba near Rome and the Bourbons were restored to power. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>exiled</b> him to <b>the</b> remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: A new superantigen-adsorbing device (SAAD) was developed, and its {{characteristics}} and efficacy in septic animals were evaluated. Methods: <b>The</b> <b>SAAD</b> was prepared by stepwise chemical modification of a polystyrene-based composite fiber reinforced with polypropylene. Adsorption affinities for several factors and the biological effect of superantigen (SAg) removal were measured in vitro. Also, superantigen-infused rabbits {{were treated with}} <b>SAAD,</b> and <b>the</b> efficacy was evaluated in vivo. Results: When <b>the</b> <b>SAAD</b> was evaluated {{for its ability to}} adsorb SAg in human plasma (1 ng/mL each), the adsorption rates were 74 %, 76 % and 85 % for staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B and C, respectively, and 80 % and 72 % for toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A, respectively. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>SAAD</b> showed some affinity towards other molecules, such as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, R 2 -microglobulin, and vancomycin. Residual activities in whole blood samples containing TSST 1 (1 ng/mL) after incubation with <b>the</b> <b>SAAD</b> were 125 pg/mL for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production, and 359 pg/mL for interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) production (the initial activities: 194 pg/mL for TNF-α production, and 1029 pg/mL for IL- 8 production). When TSST- 1 /lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -infused rabbits were subjected to extracorporeal blood purification with a SAAD column, 50 % of the animals survived for a 14 -day period after the infusion. In contrast, all control animals died within 3 days after the infusion. Conclusion: These results indicate that the SAg-adsorbing device may be useful in treating SAg-related diseases...|$|R
5000|$|During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Lala Chunnamal {{emerged as}} one of the wealthiest men in Delhi, having astutely read which way the wind was blowing, and made a vast fortune {{supplying}} provisions to the British. He had also refused a request for a loan from Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar himself. Having refused the Emperor, he had left the city overnight after having previously sent much of his wealth out of the city secretly. After the hostilities ended, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> ordered <b>the</b> <b>exile</b> (forcible removal) of all Muslims from the city of Delhi. At this time, Lala Chunnamal made another fortune by purchasing the properties of the departing nobility at throwaway prices.
