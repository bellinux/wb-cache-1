5000|$|The {{origin of}} the term poutine is unclear, {{but it might be}} a <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> [...] "pudding"; râpé, -e is French for [...] "grated". Therefore, poutine râpée could be {{literally}} translated as [...] "grated pudding".|$|R
50|$|A dell is {{a wooded}} valley. In the Dutch language, the word deel means, among other things, the {{workspace}} in a farmer's barn. The use of dell in this song {{may be a}} <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> this term.|$|R
5000|$|Mam'zelle Nitouche can loosely be {{translated}} as Little Miss Hypocrite; {{the title is}} derived from the French expression [...] "sainte nitouche" [...] (literally [...] "(female) Saint Wouldn't-Touch-It") for a female hypocrite. Mam'zelle is a graphic form or <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> [...] "mademoiselle", French for [...] "miss".|$|R
5000|$|Dutch {{refers to}} a <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> the word [...] "Deutsch", the German word for [...] "German". It {{is not related to}} the Dutch people or language. It {{originated}} in the First World War, as Navy blockades made the import (and export) of movies impossible. The German movie scene was part of the expressionist movement, which used the Dutch angle extensively.|$|R
5000|$|... == Origin == Where {{the name}} Hartjesdag comes from is not clear. Probably it has arisen in the Middle Ages. It is {{suspected}} that the name is a <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> 'hertjesdag' (Deer Day). This was a festival where in the forests around Haarlem deer (herten) hunting could {{be done by the}} ordinary people, which was normally reserved for nobility. The deer were then taken to Amsterdam and roasted in the streets.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{during the}} reign of King Rama II, nearby areas (including Thalang, now known as Phuket) were {{occupied}} by the Burmese and so many people fled to Kraphu Nga. In 1824 when Siamese troops defeated the Burmese and the challengers were expelled, King Rama III renamed the major area adjacent to the bay phang-nga. This <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> Malay pangan offers vivid indication that the entire region was likely populated by Orang Asli or other aboriginal people. In 1933 the town was promoted to provincial status.|$|R
5000|$|Phang Nga is {{the modern}} Thai {{transliteration}} of the Malay word pangan, literally 'heathen, pagan, primitive people,' or as proper nounal, Pangan {{in reference to}} a generalised tribe or people typically inhabiting jungle areas of the Malay Peninsula [...] and it's offshore islands. Historically, in 1824 when Siamese troops defeated the Burmese and the challengers were expelled, King Rama III renamed a major area adjacent to the bay phang-nga.

5000|$|In April 2011 during {{push for}} {{gambling}} reform initiated by Wilkie, News Limited media reported allegations {{by a former}} Duntroon army cadet that in 1983 Wilkie had forced junior cadets to salute to Adolf Hitler on the 50th anniversary of the latter's rise to power. In response, Wilkie {{said he had been}} [...] "involved in <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> teenage army cadets" [...] at Duntroon during the 1980s and apologised for this [...] "inappropriate behaviour" [...] but could not recall the specific incident alleged. With regard to the allegation and its publication, he accused pro-Pokies advocates of running a smear campaign against him.|$|R
5000|$|Max inexpicably turned heel at {{the request}} of NZWPW owner Martin Stirling, with no {{explanation}} provided to fans, and began to tag with [...] "Silencer" [...] Jon Miracle forming the T-Phullas, a different take on the original name of the previous Taranaki-based stable - due in part to Stirling's dislike of the term [...] "Naki" [...] as he felt it was a <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> a maori placename.

2500|$|Sergei Haminov (Raskopoulos) is Russia's Rubik's Cube champion. He {{appears in}} {{numerous}} adverts endorsing products {{and says to}} [...] "put it in your hole".

5000|$|Other Dark Gods {{mentioned}} in the series include The Insider - a parody of the Lovecraft short story [...] "The Outsider", and C'hulagen (likely a portmanteau of Cthulhu and hooligan, or just a <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> collagen), {{both of which are}} {{mentioned in}} Equal Rites. The computer game Discworld Noir features a parody of Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos, named Nylonathetep, the Laddering Horror. Tshup Aklathep, Infernal Star Toad with a Million Young, who according to Victor Tugelbend tortures his victims to death by showing them pictures of his grandchildren until their brains implode, is an amalgam reference to Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, and Tsathoggua, often described as [...] "toad-like".|$|R

40|$|I created Subtextual Phenomenology {{during my}} time as a PhD {{candidate}} at LaTrobe University, Australia. It is a radical methodology in that its methods are informed by Husserl's later work in Transcendental Phenomenology. I argue that this approach is authentic phenomenology, and {{that much of the}} popular 'Existential Phenomenology', in current use by qualitative researchers, is a <b>bastardisation</b> <b>of</b> Husserl's phenomenological terminology and thesis. I contend that the confusion around original phenomenology is partly a result of Heidegger's misinterpretation of Husserl's work, as well as its context of twentieth century modernism. The paper will defend these claims, set out the process of Subtextual Phenomenology, and illustrate it with samples of research to which it has been applied.
