5|$|Eureka has <b>been</b> <b>read</b> in many ways, in {{part because}} Poe's sincerity in the work is questionable. It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe {{said it was not}} his goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} regarded by the Privy Council as criminal, and possibly treasonous, {{to disclose the}} oath administered to Privy Counsellors as they take office. However, the oath was officially made public by the Blair Government in a written parliamentary answer in 1998, as follows. It had also <b>been</b> <b>read</b> out in full in the House of Lords during debate by Lord Rankeillour on 21 December 1932.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, no {{relevant}} information {{is found in}} the contemporary Greek Linear B records. The latter, dealing only with administrative issues of the Mycenaean palaces, are of limited value concerning the political developments of the late Bronze Age era. Moreover, although the title of the Mycenaean kings, the wanax, has <b>been</b> <b>read</b> several times in the Linear B texts, no correspondent personal names have been found.|$|E
5|$|The {{story has}} <b>been</b> <b>read</b> as an {{analysis}} of race relations, not {{between black and white}} but within the black community, exploring its own color and class prejudices. The main character dreams of becoming white but ultimately seems to accept being black and the full history of African Americans in the United States. The ending of the story, however, has been called ambiguous and leaves several questions unanswered.|$|E
5|$|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Struggle {{with the}} Steam Turbine) is a 1918 comic novel by the German author Alfred Döblin. Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often {{delusional}} {{struggle of the}} eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and its refusal to psychologize its characters, {{as well as in}} its vivid evocations of Berlin as a modern metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has <b>been</b> <b>read</b> as a precursor to Döblin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E
25|$|As {{a part of}} {{the morning}} or {{afternoon}} prayer services on certain days of the week or holidays, a section of the Pentateuch <b>is</b> <b>read</b> from a Torah scroll. On Shabbat (Saturday) mornings, a weekly section (known as a Sedra or parashah) <b>is</b> <b>read,</b> selected so that the entire Pentateuch <b>is</b> <b>read</b> consecutively each year. On Saturday afternoons, Mondays, and Thursdays, the beginning of the following Saturday's portion <b>is</b> <b>read.</b> On Jewish holidays, Rosh Chodesh, and fast days, special sections connected to the day <b>are</b> <b>read.</b>|$|R

5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent {{only a small portion}} of the total issue. The sharp increase in the number of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has <b>been</b> <b>read</b> as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 {{the synagogue}} began {{granting}} women some pulpit honors, giving the Sisterhood President gelila, and in 1966 granting married couples hagbaha and gelila (the honors of lifting and re-wrapping the Torah {{after it has}} <b>been</b> <b>read).</b> In the 1970s, women became {{more involved in the}} synagogue's political and religious activities: in 1972, the first woman was elected to the board of trustees, and in 1975, the congregation began calling women to the Torah and counting women in the minyan, the latter just two years after the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly voted nine to four in favor of this innovation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the move away from figurative {{painting}} to impressionism and abstraction, continued the decline of portrait painting. The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in {{the twentieth century}} were the four members of the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland. Of their number Francis Cadell (1883–1937), emerged as a significant painter of still lives and single figure compositions, particularly with interior backdrops, before moving closer to abstraction. Of the next significant movement, known as The Edinburgh School, Cecile Walton (1891–1956) referenced classical forms, particularly in her ironic self-portrait Romance (1920), which draws on Titian's Venus of Urbino and Manet's Olympia. Her close friend Dorothy Johnstone's portraits, such as the young girl in September Sunlight (1916), made use of interior natural light. The work of James Cowie (1886–1956), who painted a number of girls in interior settings, is similar in theme to that of Johnstone, but had a more distant and elegiac feel that can be seen in Falling Leaves (1934), which has <b>been</b> <b>read</b> as a commentary as a commentary on the transition from childhood to adolescence.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the wider}} Operation Barclay, Mincemeat {{was based on the}} 1939 Trout memo, written by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division, and his {{personal}} assistant, Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming. With the approval of the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the plan began with transporting the body to the southern coast of Spain by submarine, and releasing it close to shore. It was picked up the following morning by a Spanish fisherman. The nominally neutral Spanish government shared copies of the documents with the , the German military intelligence organisation, before returning the originals to the British. Forensic examination showed they had <b>been</b> <b>read,</b> and decrypts of German messages showed the Germans fell for the ruse. Reinforcements were shifted to Greece and Sardinia both before and during the invasion of Sicily; Sicily received none.|$|E
5|$|The above {{procedures}} {{are not sufficient}} to cause an Act of Tynwald to come into full force of law. By ancient custom, an Act did not come into force until it had been promulgated at an open-air sitting of the Tynwald, historically held on Tynwald Hill at St John's on St John's Day (24 June), but, since {{the adoption of the}} Gregorian calendar in 1753, on 5 July (or on the following Monday if 5 July is a Saturday or Sunday). Promulgation originally consisted of the reading of the Act in English and Manx; but after 1865 the reading of the title of the Act and a summary of each section was sufficient. This was reduced in 1895 to the titles and a memorandum of the object and purport of the Act, and since 1988 only the short title and a summary of the long title have <b>been</b> <b>read.</b>|$|E
5|$|Heinlein {{draws an}} analogy between the human {{society in the}} novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be {{vigilant}} against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers {{have suggested that the}} Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has <b>been</b> <b>read</b> as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, of being patriotic to one's people, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to people in communist countries, invokes the trope of a return to the frontier. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of Starship Troopers, of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.|$|E
50|$|The Typica may <b>be</b> <b>read</b> {{publicly}} in the church, {{or it may}} <b>be</b> <b>read</b> privately at home. Often in missions, {{where there}} is no priest permanently assigned to serve the parish, the Typica will <b>be</b> <b>read</b> on Sundays in place of the Liturgy.|$|R

25|$|RFID offers {{advantages}} over manual systems {{or use of}} bar codes. The tag can <b>be</b> <b>read</b> if passed near a reader, {{even if it is}} covered by the object or not visible. The tag can <b>be</b> <b>read</b> inside a case, carton, box or other container, and unlike barcodes, RFID tags can <b>be</b> <b>read</b> hundreds at a time. Bar codes can only <b>be</b> <b>read</b> one at a time using current devices.|$|R

25|$|Written in {{a journalistic}} style and derived from actual events, Tjerita Oeij Se has <b>been</b> <b>read</b> as a {{condemnation}} of interethnic marriages between ethnic Chinese women and non-Chinese {{men as well}} as reinforcement (or, alternatively, critique) of traditional Chinese values. The novel was quickly adapted to stage and spawned both a retelling in 1922 and a 2000 reprint.|$|E
25|$|Best {{known of}} the late Greek historians to modern readers is Plutarch of Chaeronea, who died about AD 119.

25|$|Urmuz's {{biography}} {{between his}} high school eccentricity and his public suicide remains largely mysterious, {{and some of the}} sympathetic accounts have been described as purposefully deceptive. The abstruse imagery of his work has produced a large corpus of diverging interpretations. He has notably <b>been</b> <b>read</b> as a satirist of public life in the 1910s, an unlikely conservative and nostalgic, or an emotionally distant esotericist.|$|E
25|$|Malfatti {{published}} in Italian {{and his work}} may not have <b>been</b> <b>read</b> {{by many in the}} original. It was popularised for a wider readership in French by Joseph Diaz Gergonne in the first volume of his Annales (1810/11), with further discussion in the second and tenth. However, this advertisement most likely acted as a filter, as Gergonne only stated the circle-tangency problem, not the area-maximizing one.|$|E
