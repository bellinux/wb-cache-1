500|$|In 1910, the Austria-Hungary Naval Technical Committee {{initiated}} {{the design and}} development of a [...] coastal torpedo boat, specifying {{that it should be}} capable of sustaining [...] for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the Strait of Otranto, where the Adriatic Sea meets the Ionian Sea, would be blockaded by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the Austro-Hungarian Navy (...) base at the Bocche di Cattaro (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. Steam turbine power was selected for propulsion, because diesels with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run turbo-electric boats. Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing <b>boatbuilder,</b> Ganz & Danubius, reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group. The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz & Danubius' main shipyard at Fiume.|$|E

In 1876 Robertson, at the age of 25, teamed up with Daniel Kerr to form 'Robertson & Kerr, Boat Builders and Carpenters'. [...] The initial boats built in their small workshop were modest 'clinker' craft and fishing skiffs, but they also carried out repairs, hired and stored boats, laid moorings and even earned money from fishing.
