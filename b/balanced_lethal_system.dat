40|$|Crested newts {{exhibit a}} <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>system</b> which causes {{development}} to abort in 50 % of tailbud em-bryos. The main features of arrested embryos are described, {{shown to be}} constant {{in a range of}} culture conditions and found to be unchanged by parabiosis or extirpation of the central nervous system or heart. Two categories of abortive embryos can be dis-tinguished in some spawnings. A corresponding seg-regation of an easily identified marker chromosome confirms previous reports that chromosome 1 carries the recessive lethal factors. The marker chromosome is tentatively associated with the blistered form of abortive embryo. Two possible modes of origin for the <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>system</b> are discussed, either from ancestral autosomes or from sex chromosomes. The latter is favoured because it involves fewer assumptions. The subsequent evolution of the system should inevitably lead to progressively earlier embryonic mortality by an accumulation of multiple recessive lethal factors on each chromosome variant.

40|$|Balanced lethal {{systems are}} more than {{biological}} curiosities: as theory predicts, they should quickly be eliminated through the joint forces of recombination and selection. That such systems might become fixed in natural populations poses a challenge to evolutionary theory. Here we address {{the case of a}} <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>system</b> fixed in crested newts and related species, which makes 50 % of offspring die early in development. All adults are heteromorphic for chromosome pair 1. The two homologues (1 A and 1 B) have different recessive deleterious alleles fixed on a nonrecombining segment, so that heterozygotes are viable, while homozygotes are lethal. Given such a strong segregation load, how could autosomes stop recombining? We propose a role for a sex-chromosome turnover from pair 1 (putative ancestral sex chromosome) to pair 4 (currently active sex chromosome). Accordingly, 1 A and 1 B represent two variants (Y(A) and Y(B)) of the Y chromosome from an ancestral male-heterogametic system. We formalize a scenario in which turnovers are driven by sex ratio selection stemming from gene-environment interactions on sex determination. Individual-based simulations show that a <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>system</b> can be fixed with significant likelihood, provided the masculinizing allele on chromosome 4 appears after the elimination of the feminizing allele on chromosome 1. Our study illustrates how strikingly maladaptive traits might evolve through natural selection...|$|E

40|$|The {{permanent}} translocation heterozygote, Rhoeo spathacea shows {{a characteristic}} ring of all chromosomes at metaphase-I of male meiosis. Elimination of bivalent formation completely due to extreme heterozygosity poses a special problem for reductional division at meiosis-I where the maternal and the paternal sets {{need to be}} separated to different poles. Unlike bivalent meiosis, the functions of SC formation, pairing and recombination required for reductional segregation have to be fulfilled by only telomeres which are the only areas of contact among the chromosomes in the ring. The participation of telomeres in these events assumes significance {{in view of the}} <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> gene <b>system</b> imposed by translocation heterozygosity, and the particular requirement that only alternate chromosomes segregated to the same pole results in fertile pollen.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that more prominent immune responses are induced to antigens expressed from multicopy plasmids in {{live attenuated vaccine}} vector strains of Vibrio cholerae than to antigens expressed from single-copy genes on the V. cholerae chromosome. Here, we report {{the construction of a}} ΔglnA derivative of V. cholerae vaccine strain Peru 2. This mutant strain, Peru 2 ΔglnA, is unable to grow on medium that does not contain glutamine; this growth deficiency is complemented by pKEK 71 -NotI, a plasmid containing a complete copy of the Salmonella typhimurium glnA gene, or by pTIC 5, a derivative of pKEK 71 -NotI containing a 1. 8 -kbp fragment that directs expression of CtxB with a 12 -amino-acid epitope of the serine-rich Entamoeba histolytica protein fused to the amino terminus. Strain Peru 2 ΔglnA(pTIC 5) produced 10 -fold more SREHP- 12 -CtxB in supernatants than did ETR 3, a Peru 2 -derivative strain containing the same fragment inserted on the chromosome. To assess immune responses to antigens expressed by this <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>system</b> in vivo, we inoculated germfree mice on days 0, 14, 28, and 42 with Peru 2 ΔglnA, Peru 2 ΔglnA(pKEK 71 -NotI), Peru 2 (pTIC 5), Peru 2 ΔglnA(pTIC 5), or ETR 3. All V. cholerae strains were recoverable from stool for 8 to 12 days after primary inoculation, including Peru 2 ΔglnA; strains containing plasmids continued to harbor pKEK 71 -NotI or pTIC 5 for 8 to 10 days after primary inoculation. Animals were sacrificed on day 56, and serum, stool and biliary samples were analyzed for immune responses. Vibriocidal antibody responses, reflective of in vivo colonization, were equivalent in all groups of animals. However, specific anti-CtxB immune responses in serum (P ≤ 0. 05) and bile (P ≤ 0. 001) were significantly higher in animals that received Peru 2 ΔglnA(pTIC 5) than in those that received ETR 3, confirming the advantage of higher-level antigen expression in vivo.

40|$|DNA markers {{linked to}} the {{determinants}} of mating type in the oomycete, Phytophthora infestans, were identified and used to address the genetic basis of heterothallism in this normally diploid fungus. Thirteen loci {{linked to the}} A 1 and A 2 mating types were initially identified by bulked segregant analysis using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs) and subsequently scored in three crosses as RAPD markers, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), single-strand conformational polymorphisms (SSCP), cleaved amplified polymorphisms (CAPS), or allele-specific polymerase chain reaction markers (AS-PCR). All DNA markers mapped to a single region, consistent with a single locus determining both mating types. Long-range restriction mapping also demonstrated the linkage of the markers to one region and delimited the mating type locus to a 100 -kb region. The interval containing the mating type locus displayed non-Mendelian segregation as {{only two of the}} four expected genotypes were detected in progeny. This is consistent with a <b>system</b> of <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> loci near the mating type locus.

40|$|IEM 101, a Vibrio cholerae O 1 El Tor Ogawa strain {{naturally}} {{deficient in}} CTXΦ, was previously selected as a live cholera vaccine candidate. To {{make a better}} and safer vaccine that can induce protective immunity against both the bacteria and cholera toxin (CT), a new vaccine candidate, IEM 108, was constructed by introducing a ctxB gene and an El Tor-derived rstR gene into IEM 101. The ctxB gene codes for the protective antigen CTB subunit, and the rstR gene mediates phage immunity. The stable expression of the two genes was managed by a chromosome-plasmid <b>lethal</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>system</b> based on the housekeeping gene thyA. Immunization studies indicate that IEM 108 generates good immune responses against both the bacteria and CT. After a single-dose intraintestinal vaccination with 109 CFU of IEM 108, both anti-CTB immunoglobulin G and vibriocidal antibodies were detected in the immunized-rabbit sera. However, only vibriocidal antibodies are detected in rabbits immunized with IEM 101. In addition, IEM 108 but not IEM 101 conferred full protection against the challenges of four wild-type toxigenic strains of V. cholerae O 1 and 4 μg of CT protein in a rabbit model. By introducing the rstR gene, the frequency of conjugative transfer of a recombinant El Tor-derived RS 2 suicidal plasmid to IEM 108 was decreased 100 -fold compared to that for IEM 101. This indicated that the El Tor-derived rstR cloned in IEM 108 was fully functional and could effectively inhibit the El Tor-derived CTXΦ from infecting IEM 108. Our results demonstrate that IEM 108 is an efficient and safe live oral cholera vaccine candidate that induces antibacterial and antitoxic immunity and CTXΦ phage immunity...|$|R
40|$|Prefertilization {{mechanisms}} influencing selfing {{rates are}} thought to be absent in conifers. Outcrossing in conifers is promoted via an embryo-lethal system, but the genetic mechanism is poorly understood. This study is the first experimental profile of the genetic mechanism promoting outcrossing in conifers. Molecular dissection of a Pinus taeda L. selfed pedigree detected a chromosomal region identified as PtTX 3020 -RPtest 9. Within this region, a semilethal factor was tightly linked (r = 0. 0076) to a polymorphic expressed sequence tag (EST). The linkage group flanking the lethal factor showed strong heterozygote advantage. Using genotypic frequencies for the linkage group, three hypotheses about the semilethal factor could be tested: (1) the presence of a <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>system,</b> i. e., a lethal factor present in each of the two marker intervals; (2) gametic selection operative prior to fertilization; and (3) a stage-specific lethal factor. Selection acted via the embryo-lethal system. No support for a genetic mechanism operating prior to fertilization was found. The semilethal factor exerted no effect after embryo maturity. The genetic mechanism promoting outcrossing in P. taeda L. appears to have a balancing selection system due to either pseudo-overdominance or true overdominance...|$|E
40|$|In a marked-inversion <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>system</b> of {{the second}} {{chromosome}} of Drosophila melanogaster, mutations were accumulated under minimum pressure of natural selection in 1000 individual lines that originated essentially from two individuals. After about 300 generations, the specific activities of alcohol dehydrogenase of 69 randomly selected individual lines were measured with replications using four replicated vials (on 2 days—two replications per day) by observing the reduction of NAD+ to NADH at 340 nm. Total soluble protein {{as the basis of}} standardization of enzyme activity was measured by the Lowry method for each vial. A control experiment was made immediately after the establishment of 20 individual lines from a single genotype. A significant increase in genetic variance was observed among the mutation-accumulating lines but was not detected in the control experiment. The statistical analysis of the data {{on the basis of the}} one-band/one-gene hypothesis suggests that many mutations controlling the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase occurred in regions different from the alcohol dehydrogenase locus itself, mainly in the noncoding DNA. Furthermore, it is suggested that transposon-like elements are related to the induction of these changes in alcohol dehydrogenase specific activities. Additional experimental evidence supporting this conclusion is also given...|$|E

ToxC-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) was detectable in animals orally immunized with either BRD 847 or KR 21. However, after intravenous immunization, IgG was detected only in BRD 847 -immunized animals. Measurement of immunoglobin types IgG 1 and IgG 2 a suggests that a Th 1 cellular response is prominent after immunizations with either system. ToxC-specific IgA was detected in fecal and vaginal samples of animals immunized orally and intravenously with BRD 847, while those immunized with KR 21 failed to show fecal or vaginal IgA responses.

40|$|Gene {{drive systems}} provide novel {{opportunities}} for insect population suppression by driving genes that confer a fitness cost into pest or disease vector populations; however regulatory issues arise when genes {{are capable of}} spreading across international borders. Gene drive systems displaying threshold properties provide a solution since they can be confined to local populations and eliminated through dilution with wild-types. We propose a novel, threshold-dependent gene drive system, Medusa, capable of inducing a local and reversible population crash. Medusa consists of four components - two on the X chromosome, and two on the Y chromosome. A maternally-expressed, X-linked toxin and a zygotically-expressed, Y-linked antidote results in suppression of the female population and selection {{for the presence of}} the transgene-bearing Y because only male offspring of Medusa-bearing females are protected from the effects of the toxin. At the same time, the combination of a zygotically-expressed, Y-linked toxin and a zygotically-expressed, X-linked antidote selects for the transgene-bearing X {{in the presence of the}} transgene-bearing Y. Together these chromosomes create a <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>system</b> that spreads while selecting against females when present above a certain threshold frequency. Simple population dynamic models show that an all-male release of Medusa males, carried out over six generations, is expected to induce a population crash within 12 generations for modest release sizes on the order of the wild population size. Re-invasion of non-transgenic insects into a suppressed population can result in a population rebound; however this can be prevented through regular releases of modest numbers of Medusa males. Finally, we outline how Medusa could be engineered with currently available molecular tools...|$|E

A set of 35 lethal strains was chosen for the analysis. Although the dosage was relatively low, a large number of multiple-break events were observed. The fraction of lethals associated with rearrangements was found to be 0. 76. Currently most X- and γ-ray dosages used for mutagenesis in C. elegans are 6000 – 8000 r. From our data we conservatively estimated that 43 % of rearrangements induced with 8000 r would be accompanied by additional chromosome breaks in the genome. With 1500 r the value was 5 %. —The 35 lethals studied were derived from 875 screened F 1 's. Among these lethals there were (1) at least two unc- 36 duplications, (2) at least four translocations, (3) at least six deficiencies of chromosome V (these delete about 90 % of the unc- 60 to unc- 42 region) and (4) several unanalyzed rearrangements. Thus, it is possible to recover desired rearrangements at reasonable rates with a dose of only 1500 r. —We suggest that the levels of ionizing radiation employed in most published C. elegans studies are excessive and efforts should be made to use reduced levels in the future...|$|R
40|$|Background Essential {{genes are}} {{critical}} {{for the development of}} all organisms and are associated with many human diseases. These genes have been a difficult category to study prior to the availability of <b>balanced</b> <b>lethal</b> strains. Despite the power of targeted mutagenesis, there are limitations in identifying mutations in essential genes. In this paper, we describe the identification of coding regions for essential genes mutated using forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans. The lethal mutations described here were isolated and maintained by a wild-type allele on a rescuing duplication. Results We applied whole genome sequencing to identify the causative molecular lesion resulting in lethality in existing C. elegans mutant strains. These strains are balanced and can be easily maintained for subsequent characterization. Our method can be effectively used to analyze mutations in a large number of essential genes. We describe here the identification of 64 essential genes in a region of chromosome I covered by the duplication sDp 2. Of these, 42 are nonsense mutations, six are splice signal mutations, one deletion, and 15 are non-synonymous mutations. Many of the essential genes in this region function in cell cycle, transcriptional regulation, and RNA processing. Conclusions The essential genes identified here are represented by mutant strains, many of which have more than one mutant allele. The genetic resource can be utilized to further our understanding of essential gene function and will be applicable to the study of C. elegans development, conserved cellular function, and ultimately lead to improved human health...|$|R
