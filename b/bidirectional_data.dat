PD-aware devices implement a flexible power management scheme by interfacing with the power source through a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>data</b> channel and requesting {{a certain level of}} electrical power, variable up to 5A and 20V depending on supported profile.

5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} <b>bidirectional</b> <b>data</b> communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E

For mice and keyboards with dual-protocol support, an adaptor that contains no logic circuitry may be used: the hardware in the USB keyboard or mouse is designed to detect whether it is connected to a USB or PS/2 port, and communicate using the appropriate protocol. Converters also exist that connect PS/2 keyboards and mice (usually one of each) to a USB port.

Field tests were conducted using a tethered balloon system to position the folding mirror. A spectroradiometer was designed and built specifically for this investigation. The spectroradiometer had an angular field of view of twenty-four minutes in one axis and ten minutes in the other axis. The radiometer was capable of detecting energies in small bandwidths throughout the electromagnetic spectrum from 0. 3 microns to 3. 0 microns. <b>Bidirectional</b> reflectance <b>data</b> and variations in the data with source angles were obtained for Saint Augustine grass, Bermuda grass, and a black alluvium soil from the Mississippi River delta...|$|R

The scope of the project includes an initial literature survey to have a brief overview of current wireless systems and standards. We then characterize the wireless channel, including path loss for different environments, random log-normal shadowing due to signal attenuation, and the flat and frequencyselective properties of multipath fading. Next we examine the fundamental capacity limits of wireless channels and the characteristics of the capacityachieving transmission strategies. Thus, our focus will be on practical digital modulation techniques and their performance under wireless channel impairments, including flat and frequency selective fading mostly for AWGN channel.

40|$|A hyperspectral <b>bidirectional</b> {{reflectance}} <b>data</b> set {{of grass}} lawn and watercress canopies acquired under controlled laboratory {{conditions at the}} JRC European Goniometric Facility, at Ispra, Italy was analyzed with respect to basic physical reflectance mechanisms and factors influencing reflectance anisotropy. By normalizing reflectance data with the nadir reflectance as a reference, a strong influence of reflectance intensity on observed reflectance anisotropy is demonstrated for both vegetation canopies. This is explained by multiple scattering effects inside vegetation canopies {{as a function of}} canopy spectral absorbance characteristics. Two quantities based on canopy reflectances are utilized for characterizing the spectrally variable dynamics of BRDF effects: the anisotropy factor (ANIF) which is simply a normalization with nadir reflectance, and the anisotropy index (ANIX) defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum reflectance values in the principal plane (or defined azimuth plane) per spectral band. Using these two quantities, the study revealed that the basic physical reflectance mechanisms described by Kimes (1983) for broad spectral bands are extendable to hyperspectral <b>bidirectional</b> reflectance <b>data.</b> In addition, the influences of canopy geometry and multiple scattering on BRDF are clearly demonstrated for the erectophile grass lawn and the planophile watercress canopy. since multiple scattering effects and canopy geometry are dominant factors regulating BRDF effects, vegetation canopy architecture parameters such as the leaf area index might be derived from hyper-spectral BRDF data.

50|$|Differences exist, as well, in {{the nature}} of the {{connection}}s. An MPLS connection (LSP) is unidirectional—allowing data to flow in only one direction between two endpoints. Establishing two-way communications between endpoints requires a pair of LSPs to be established.
