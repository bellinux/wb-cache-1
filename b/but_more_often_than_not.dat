5|$|The crusaders' {{march through}} Anatolia was {{thereafter}} unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything {{he left behind}} in his army's flight. It {{was the middle of}} summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died. Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not,</b> the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the Cilician Gates, Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the Euphrates; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by Thoros of Edessa, a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his Greek Orthodox religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated. Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the County of Edessa, the first of the crusader states.|$|E
25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction {{in terms of her}} work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, {{there has to be a}} nonfictional element, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not</b> the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, just as she had been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} officially {{named the}} camp Elliott Combat Base, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not</b> {{it was simply}} known as the Rockpile. The location seemed vulnerable {{to many of the}} soldiers that defended it due to its location in the center of an open valley, along a river, with elephant grass growing much closer to the perimeter of the base than most other camps located throughout northern South Vietnam. Once inside the barbed wire boundary, the congested and disorganized layout of the base area was immediately noticeable. Tents, low bunkers, and trenches commingled across the camp in no particular order or arrangement. The three largest tents at the Rockpile all possessed dirt floors with canvas sides and served as a kitchen, a mess hall, and a first-aid station. The dining tent had no chairs or tables, but instead long planks were positioned slightly over waist high so soldiers could stand and eat.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{there has}} been a swing from the sexually liberal end of the Industrial Revolution to the chaste values of the early Victorian period. This was then {{followed}} by a new puritanism from the late Victorian era to the mid-1900s. This important transformation often colors discussion of sexual behavior in the later 20th century. World War I began a return to sexual freedom and indulgence, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not,</b> the appearance of conforming to the earlier moral values of abstinence before marriage was retained. With the conclusion of World War II, the societal importance of abstinence declined. The advent of the first oral contraceptive pill and widely available antibiotics suppressed many consequences of wide and free sexual behavior, while social morals were also changing. By the 1970s, abandonment of premarital chastity was no longer taboo in the majority of western societies, and the reverse became true. Some cultural groups continued to place a value on the moral purity of an abstainer, but abstinence was caught up in a wider reevaluation of moral values.|$|E
25|$|Considering Modernism {{inclined}} {{urban planning}} to treat buildings and developments as isolated, unrelated {{parts of the}} overall urban ecosystems created fragmented, isolated, and homogeneous urban landscapes (Goodchild, 1990). One of the greater problems with Modernist-style of planning was the disregard of resident or public opinion, which resulted in planning being forced upon the majority by a minority consisting of affluent professionals with little to no knowledge of real 'urban' problems characteristic of post-Second World War urban environments: slums, overcrowding, deteriorated infrastructure, pollution and disease, among others (Irving 1993). These were precisely the 'urban ills' Modernism was meant to 'solve', <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not,</b> the types of 'comprehensive', 'one size fits all' approaches to planning made things worse., and residents began to show interest in becoming involved in decisions which had once been solely entrusted to professionals of the built environment. Advocacy planning and participatory models of planning emerged in the 1960s to counter these traditional elitist and technocratic approaches to urban planning (Irving 1993; Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007). Furthermore, {{an assessment of the}} 'ills' of Modernism among planners during the 1960s, fuelled development of a participatory model that aimed to expand the range of participants in urban interventions (Hatuka & D'Hooghe 2007, 21).|$|E
500|$|One {{point of}} dispute was the {{calculation}} of Malay equity. Although officially, as of 1992, the Malays controlled 18% of the economy, some dismissed this figure as misleading. It was argued that as in reality, much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies, therefore it belonged to Malaysians as a whole. The practice of awarding public works contracts mainly to Bumiputras was argued to be stifling Malay competency by providing little incentive to improve. Many Bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted their jobs to others, who were in some cases Chinese; [...] "Ali Baba" [...] arrangements with [...] "the Malay [...] using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied the non-Malay, then accepting a fee to be the front-man while the non-Malay [...] ran the business," [...] were prevalent. Some suggested that the NEP [...] "might have worked, if the Malay had actually wanted to learn the ropes. <b>But</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not,</b> {{he just wanted to}} be rich." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} reception to {{the album}} was generally favourable. Based on 40 reviews, review aggregate website Metacritic reported a rating of 78 out of 100. There were mixed comments about the ballads; two reviewers noted a disparity between {{the energy of the}} ballads to different songs. Drowned in Sound commented that, [...] "ballads remain a strong suit, particularly the easy grace of the title track, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not</b> sit awkwardly next to the more toothsome numbers and feel under-produced by comparison" [...] with similar comments from AllMusic who said, [...] "Made in the Darks main weakness might be its ballads, but that may just be in comparison to its many energetic moments, which are so addictive that it feels like a forced come-down whenever the band slows things down." [...] However, The Observer gave a positive evaluation of the ballads; [...] "Hot Chip have had a happy way with a subliminal power ballad. And Made in the Dark can boast four of the best." [...] Pitchfork rated the album as 7/10 with a mixed review, describing it as a [...] "patchy, turbulent record" [...] due to the use of many different individual components and also said that it was a [...] "good record but not a great one".

2500|$|His only social outlet was the Royal Society Club, {{whose members}} dined {{together}} before weekly meetings.

As his biographer, George Wilson, comments, [...] "As to Cavendish's religion, he was nothing at all."

2500|$|Preliminary and Supplementary Sketches (Einzelskizzen) ‚Äì before {{beginning}} the composition proper, Wagner usually made some preliminary sketches to work on. Needless to say, he added supplementary sketches to these throughout the compositional process. These sketches are sometimes {{little more than}} fragmentary phrases jotted down on scraps of paper; {{but they can also}} be quite lengthy and elaborate sections of music written on several staves. Sometimes they are labelled (e.g. [...] "Fafner", [...] "Waldvogel"). Unlike the preliminary sketches for his earlier operas, however, which were usually settings of lines of text, the sketches for the Ring operas were generally worked out independently of the text; vocal sketches do survive, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not</b> even these are without text. It is highly unlikely that all Wagner's sketches have come down to us, and of course not everything need have been sketched - some of the music for the preliminary drafts may have been composed from scratch as it was required - but the [...] "cleaner" [...] a passage in a draft is, {{the more likely it is}} that it was preceded by a sketch.|$|E
2500|$|I made a {{whole series}} of studies to prepare this portrait. Drawings and washes in china ink. I {{analysed}} the architecture of the head in monumentally sized enlargements, two or three times the natural size, I made a certain number of drawings of the hands, I studied the organisation and the overall effect, volumes and the relations of the formal elements between themselves. Finally, I reduced the colour to a harmony of blacks and greys supported by some flashes of light red which set up a contrast, at once breaking with and supporting the interplay of harmonious colour relations. Nayral came regularly to the studio, I worked directly on him, naturally, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> <b>not</b> the work consisted in friendly conversation, in walks in the garden, during which I studied him, watching what was his natural way of walking and what were his usual gestures, above all arming my memory with essential characteristics, trying to isolate his true likeness from the accumulation of details and picturesque superfluities which always interfere with the permanent reality of a being. The portrait was executed without turning to the model, it was finished some weeks before the Automne and I decided to show it... if the jury would be willing to accept it, as I was not yet a member.

40|$|Three pigeons {{were given}} {{extensive}} training on three-key simultaneous matching problems using geometric-form and hue stimuli.

Matching during the test stimuli occurred less <b>often</b> <b>than</b> during the later stages of the acquisition phase, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> would occur if no transfer had taken place.

On each trial, one of two simuli was presented on the center key, and two other stimuli, different from those used on the center key, were displayed on the side keys. When the problem shift was introduced, correct responding was impaired, but remained considerably above chance level and quickly recovered in following sessions.
