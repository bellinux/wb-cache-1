5|$|As {{little as}} 15lb (7kg) of {{uranium-235}} {{can be used}} to make an atomic bomb. The first nuclear bomb used in war, Little Boy, relied on uranium fission, but the very first nuclear explosive (the Gadget used at Trinity) and the <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> destroyed Nagasaki (Fat Man) were both plutonium bombs.|$|E
5|$|A {{calutron}} is a {{mass spectrometer}} originally designed {{and used for}} separating the isotopes of uranium. It was developed by Ernest Lawrence during the Manhattan Project and was based on his earlier invention, the cyclotron. Its name was derived from California University Cyclotron, in tribute to Lawrence's institution, the University of California, where it was invented. Calutrons {{were used in the}} industrial-scale Y-12 uranium enrichment plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The enriched uranium produced was used in the Little Boy atomic <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> was detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|After Leonard I. Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} the Little Boy design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were inserted into the <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> was used in the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E

5|$|After {{putting on}} the crown, Finn becomes {{corrupted}} by its power, going mad. He attacks the Destiny Gang—who his family owed a debt as established in the previous episode—and put out the fires that they started, but his uncontrolled power causes the mutagenic <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> Simon stopped to explode, destroying the surrounding area. Jake, however, falls into a mutagenic puddle and is mutated into a creature similar to the Lich, which attacks Finn.|$|E
5|$|Artemis {{is finally}} granted the ransom. The gold is sent in, and Artemis asks Holly for a wish: to cure his mother's insanity— {{she has been}} living in her bedroom, driven mad by the loss of her husband. Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold. The LEP decides to send in a 'blue rinse' – a {{biological}} <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> kills all organic life— to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and his comrades with sleeping pills.|$|E
5|$|Chemists at the Los Alamos Laboratory {{developed}} {{methods of}} purifying uranium and plutonium, the latter a metal that only existed in microscopic quantities when Project Y began. Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an aqueous homogeneous reactor, the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also researched the Super, a hydrogen <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> would use a fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane {{was bombed}} and sunk in a German air raid on Liverpool {{during the night}} of 7/8 May 1941. She {{was struck by a}} <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> passed through the hull and detonated {{underneath}} her. The explosion blew a large hole in her bottom and flooded her engine room and oil tanks. The ship's structure was badly damaged enough that her stern began to sag downwards and Hurricane was moved to Bidston Dock lest she sink and block traffic in the harbour. No one was killed in the attack, although a few crewmen received minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|On 19 March 1945, while moored at Kure, Kaiyō was {{attacked}} by an American carrier aircraft from Task Force 58. She {{was hit in the}} port engine room by a <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> started fires and caused some flooding. The ship started to list and was moved into shallow water near Etajima Island lest she sink. On 20 April she was assigned to serve as a target ship for kamikaze crews. Kaiyō resumed her pilot training duties a month later and hit a mine on 18 July with only minor damage.|$|E

5|$|The loss of Taihō and Shōkaku left Zuikaku {{to recover}} the Division's few {{remaining}} aircraft after their heavy losses (only 102 aircraft remained aboard the seven surviving carriers by the evening) and the 1st Mobile Fleet continued its withdrawal towards Okinawa. The Americans did not spot the Japanese carriers until {{the afternoon of the}} following day and launched a large airstrike that only succeeded in hitting Zuikaku with a single <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> started a fire in the hangar.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, several sailors {{received}} medals {{for their}} conduct and actions under fire. Lieutenant Commander Samuel G. Fuqua, the ship's damage control officer, earned the Medal of Honor for his cool-headedness while quelling fires and getting survivors off the wrecked battleship. Posthumous awards of the Medal of Honor {{also went to}} two high-ranking officers who were on board the battleship when it was destroyed, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first flag officer killed in the Pacific war, and Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh, who reached the bridge and was attempting to defend his ship when the <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> hit the onboard ammunition magazines destroyed it. Arizona was awarded one battle star for her service in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Amagis keel {{was laid}} down by Mitsubishi in Nagasaki, on 1 October 1942. She was {{launched}} on 15 October 1943 and completed on 10 August 1944. The ship was transferred {{among a number of}} ports on the Inland Sea until she arrived in Kure in February 1945 and was ordered to be camouflaged. Her intended air group, Air Group 601, was committed to the Battle of Iwo Jima about that same time. Amagi was briefly refitted from 10 to 24 February. On 19 March, the ship was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and lightly damaged by one <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> struck the edge of the flight deck. On 13 April, the ship was permanently moored at an island in Kure harbor and extensively camouflaged.|$|E

5|$|During the U.S. Navy carrier {{air attack}} on Kure on 24 July 1945, Settsu was {{attacked}} by 30 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters near Etajima. She was struck by one <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> killed two men and wounded another two; five near misses started a serious leak in the starboard engine room. Captain Masanano Ofuji decided to run his ship aground on Etajima to prevent her from sinking. All of Settsus 25mm guns were subsequently removed and the ship {{was used as a}} floating barracks. Four days later, the ship was again attacked by carrier aircraft that hit her twice more with bombs. She was abandoned the next day. Settsu was stricken from the navy list on 20 November and her hulk was raised in June 1946 and towed to Kure where scrapping was completed in August 1947.|$|E
5|$|Extensive but {{superficial}} {{damage was}} caused by an IRA <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> exploded close to a snack bar at approximately 1:10pm on 10 September 1973, injuring eight people. A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the area just before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward confessed to the bombing and was convicted of this and other crimes despite the evidence against her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years later}} {{after the events}} of , Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her clones lead the assault to attack Umbrella HQ, located in Tokyo, slaying the entire branch except for Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who escapes in a {{tiltrotor}} plane and detonates a <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> leaves a massive sinkhole. The real Alice boarded beforehand and attempts to execute Wesker, only for him to injects her with an Anti-Virus to remove her superhuman abilities. Wesker is revealed to have used the T-Virus to gain his own superhuman abilities and prepares to kill Alice, before the autopilot crashes the plane into the mountains and only Alice survives.|$|E

5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> blew out the front of Nussbaum's house, while {{he and his wife}} were {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of his congregation blamed it on Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups from using the synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the intent was to put an end to the interracial meetings that Nussbaum held there.|$|E
5|$|In September 1973 a shopping-bag {{bomb was}} detonated by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) at {{the offices of}} the Prudential Assurance Company on Oxford Street, {{injuring}} six people. A second bomb was detonated by the IRA on the street by Selfridges in December 1974, injuring three people and causing £1.5 million worth of damage. Oxford Street was again targeted by the IRA in August 1975; an undiscovered <b>bomb</b> <b>that</b> had been booby trapped exploded without any injuries. The IRA also detonated a bomb at the John Lewis department store on Oxford Street in December 1992 along with another in nearby Cavendish Square, injuring four.|$|E
