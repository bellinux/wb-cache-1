50|$|With {{heavy use}} over the years, the Great Lawn, which {{received}} eight baseball diamonds {{constructed in the}} 1950s, had <b>badly</b> compacted <b>soil.</b> Advocates argue this compaction was aggravated by its use for outdoor concerts once the Sheep Meadow had been restored in 1979. Eroded topsoil that washed into Turtle Pond resulted in eutrophication that turned it to algal soup each summer. In October 1995 the Central Park Conservancy took up the joint project of rehabilitating fifty-five acres of the lawn and its surroundings, with improved tilefield drainage and sprinkler systems, and completely draining, re-excavating and reconfiguring Turtle Pond, which had received its official name change in 1987, having been known until then as Belvedere Lake.|$|R

The proving grounds were established in 1947 and in 1953 expanded to 33 304 ha (333km2), making it the biggest Soviet military polygon in Estonia. Still, the Soviet Army damaged only about 10% of the proving grounds' territory, leaving the rest intact.

30|$|However, {{application}} of biochar could sometimes negatively affect plant growth as observed by Kishimoto and Sugiura (1985) in yields of soybeans and maize with an addition of 5 Mg charcoal ha- 1 and 15 Mg ha- 1, respectively. Asai et al. (2009) observed that in nutrient poor soils in Laos, {{application of}} lumber mill waste biochar decreased the rice grain yield. Decreases in {{growth has been}} attributed to decreased N availability due to high C:N ratio in biochar (Lehmann et al. 2003; Rondon et al. 2007), or to the increased soil pH (Tryon 1948; Kishimoto and Sugiura 1985). Rubber plant is generally considered as a relatively insensitive species to pH, but the preferred soil pH ranges from 4.0 to 6.5 (Blackley 1997; Krishnakumar and Potty 1993; Priyadarshan 2003). Bolton (1964) considered the rubber plant as a “calciphobe”, growing <b>badly</b> in <b>soils</b> with pH 6.5 and over. Application of biochar could increase soil pH to levels greater than 6.5 immediately after application and lasts at least 1 pH unit higher than the native soil pH value even after several months (Dharmakeerthi et al. 2010; Uzoma et al. 2011; Van Zwieten et al. 2010; Chan et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|The basic {{ecology of}} well-researched {{earthworm}} species, such as Lumbricus terrestris, remains relatively unknown. In order {{to contribute to}} the limited body of knowledge, the present work aimed to investigate if specific behaviours could be detected between an adult and the cocoons it produced by comparison with a non-parental adult and cocoons. Modified Evans’ boxes (0. 8 × 0. 2 × 0. 008 m) with recently mated adults allowed observation of their habits under what was essentially a 2 -D system. Experimental manipulation (at 81 days) involved four treatments: (1) L. terrestris removal (LtRm); (2) L. terrestris replacement (LtRp), where individuals were replaced by others; (3) control, with no manipulation and (4) L. terrestris removal control (CLtRm) where individuals were removed and then reintroduced in the same box, to account for any effects of the removal method. Burrowing patterns of adults and later, hatchlings, were recorded throughout the duration of the experiment (191 days). Cocoon production across treatments did not differ significantly (p> 0. 05) and averaged 26 ± 6. 4 cocoons worm− 1 over a 26 week period. In the LtRm treatment mean cocoon production was 12. 6 ± 2. 7 cocoons worm− 1 over 11 weeks. Forty one percent of cocoons were deposited in the upper 0. 05 m of the <b>soil</b> profile. <b>Cocoons</b> below that depth were found deposited in side burrows (1 – 4 cm in length) and were coated with earthworm casts. Hatchling number and survival rate did not differ significantly across treatments (p> 0. 05) with means±s. d. of 2 ± 2. 2 and 62 ± 29 %, respectively. Hatchling mass in the LtRm treatment (0. 4 ± 0. 38 g), was found to be significantly greater (p< 0. 01) than that of all other treatments (0. 12 ± 0. 12 g). In this experimental set up, the presence of parental earthworms and other con-specifics had no significant effect on cocoon viability and hatchling survival, however, results indicated a negative effect of adult presence on hatchling growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{maintaining}} and improving soil fertility m the Tropics and sub-tropics {{has never been}} greater. But {{it needs to be}} done without recourse to expensive inorganic fertilisers. So, the publication of 'Soil management: Compost production and use in Tropical and Subtropical environments' is timely. Teaching farmers how to recycle waste organic materials as sources of crop nutrients must be the key to putting agriculture on a more sustainable basis, and that is what this new publication sets out to do. The reader is asked to think of the compost heap as a living structure composed of millions of organisms: these are essential for turning organic wastes into valuable compost. The part each species plays and how it can be encouraged is well documented. Useful figures and photos illustrate every aspect of the process. There are comprehensive lists of the best materials to use, and suggestions for augmenting them if something is in short supply, such as night soil. Different compost making systems from around the world are discussed, from the Chinese High Temperature Stack through various heaps, and pits to the Mazibuko Trench system suitable for <b>badly</b> eroded <b>soils.</b> Finally there are suggestions for training and teaching extension staff and farmers. The manual is written in simple English without detracting from the science of the process. There should, therefore, be no problem for people whose first language is not English in understanding and learning from the manual.

40|$|The {{greater part}} of the work deals with the effects {{produced}} by reduction of the oxygen pressure in the atmosphere surrounding seeds kept in germinative conditions. This was studied with the view to the establishment of correlations between the value of the minimum oxygen pressure necessary for germination and 1) the nature of the food reserve or 2) the extent of aeration of the soil of the usual habitat. After the trial of several forms of apparatus the 'continuous-current. method was adapted to the needs of this problem. Atmospheres with reduced oxygen pressures were obtained by introducing oxygen, produced electrolytically, into a stram of nitrogen supplied from a cylinder. The seeds used in the investigations combined some of the following characteristics:- 1) Presence of absence of endosperm. 2) Carbohydrate or oil as food-reserve. 3) Soil of habitat usually stiff and poorly-aerated or light and well aerated. The results indicate that high minimum oxygen values may be expected for seeds storing oils and usually growing in well- aerated soils whilst low minima are connected with the storage of carbohydrates and the usual occurrence in <b>badly</b> aerated <b>soils.</b> Whilst working on the above it was found necessary to sterilize the seeds. The method recommended by Wilson (A. J. B. 1915) was used; but bleaching powder is a strong oxidizing agent and its action upon seed reserves might affect the rate of germination of seeds sterilized in this way. Accordingly a section of the paper embodies attempts made to solve this problem and to determine whether a solution of the specified strength is capable of any action upon the oils stored in seeds. The results indicate a slight stimulatory effect upon the rate of germination of seeds storing oils after sterilization for short periods of time and that such a solution does net react with some classes of oils found stored, in seeds. <p...|$|R

30|$|Cabbage {{plants were}} {{assessed}} for pest infestation {{before and after}} heading, while the wrapper leaves were monitored regularly for symptoms of pest damage. Five randomly selected plants were tagged on each plot, and visible signs of damage and occurrence of insect pest larvae were assessed and data presented as number of larvae per plant (mean[*]±[*]SD). Cabbage plants were identified as infested based on observation of diamondback moth, looper and webworm larvae or their damage, and reported as number of infested plants per treatment (mean[*]±[*]SD). Diamondback moth (P. xylostella) is an important cabbage pest with average development time of 25 – 30  days from egg to pupal stage depending on weather conditions, and a complete cycle of 17 – 51  days from egg to adult. The annual number of generations varies from four in cold climates to 12 in warm climates. Diamondback moth was assessed on wrapper leaves and identified as small round holes, scratches or skeleton damage on leaves with partially damaged epidermis that gives cabbage leaves a windowpane appearance. An adult female cabbage Looper (T. ni) moth lays from 300 to 600 eggs pale yellow and round eggs in 10 – 12  days adult lifespan that hatch in 3 – 10  days, with a more rapid pupal stage in warmer temperatures. The occurrence of webworm larvae and plant damage was identified as leaves held together with silk. Each female cabbage webworm (H. undalis) lays about 75 – 250 eggs singly or in groups of 2 – 3 on the inner tissues of host plants. The hatching larvae bore into stems of growing points, weaving webs into which they place their frass. Webworm pupates in <b>soil</b> within webbed <b>cocoons</b> that include <b>soil</b> particles as a generation develops in about 4 – 5  weeks at 27  °C, with short-lived adults and the potential to complete 7 – 8 generations annually.|$|R
40|$|We report here on interpopulation {{differences}} in life history parameters in L. rubellus collected from acidic, calcareous, and Sr-rich but Ca-poor soils. Size-at-maturity, fecundity and cocoon Ca status were determined for field-collected adult earthworms, maintained {{in their native}} soils under laboratory conditions for 18 weeks. After this time the wet weight of adults and cocoon production were significantly greater in earthworms indigenous to the calcareous soil. There were no interpopulation {{differences in}} cocoon Ca concentration despite a 28 -fold range in soil Ca concentration. However, adults indigenous to the acidic <b>soil</b> produced larger <b>cocoons</b> with a significantly higher Ca content than both other populations. We suggest that adult populations native to low Ca soils may be stressed and allocate disproportionately more assimilated energy to counteract the effects of stress, thus leaving less for reproduction. Secondly, F 1 offspring from the three populations were reciprocally transferred to each soil type so that differentiation between genetic adaptation and individual acclimation to the hypoavailability of environmental Ca could be determined. Von Bertalanffy growth curves were fitted to time series weight values over 48 weeks. There were no significant interpopulation differences in final weight despite the contrasting soil cation status. However, earthworms held in the calcareous soil reached this weight significantly faster than the corresponding populations held in Sr-rich soil, which also took twice as long to develop into subadults. We suggest that populations from Ca-poor soils were phenotypically plastic and able to tolerate a Ca-poor environment by means of efficient Ca-uptake mechanisms. However, when presented with Ca-rich soil, earthworms native to Ca-poor soil may simply have downregulated their efficient Ca acquisition mechanism and performed {{as well as the}} population indigenous to Ca-rich soil. Conversely, earthworms from a Ca-rich soil may be genetically limited in their ability to physiologically adjust in a Ca-poor environment and, therefore, performed worse than when in their own soil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The common compost {{earthworm}} Eisenia fetida {{was used}} for toxicity testing of mercury, in a well-characterized agricultural soil obtained from a local field (Ås, Norway). Groups of five or ten clitellate earthworms were exposed to various concentrations of mercury in soil, added {{in the form of}} mercuric chloride (HgCl 2) in distilled water. The effects on survival, burrowing behaviour, reproduction, growth, and glutathione levels were recorded. Very low mercury concentration (0. 22 mg/kg <b>soil)</b> significantly stimulated <b>cocoon</b> production after two weeks, but higher concentrations reduced it after four weeks (EC 50 for reproduction was approximately 7. 4 mg Hg/kg soil). Protein and glutathione (non-protein thiols) were analyzed by standard spectrophotometric methods. Earthworms exposed to mercury (22 to 740 mg Hg/kg soil for four weeks) experienced a threefold increase in glutathione levels from background levels of approximately 0. 62 µmol/g earthworm wet weight. Pre-exposure to mercury (22 mg/kg soil for one week) strongly increased survival in a subsequent standard test carried out one week after the pre-treatment. Differences in cocoon production and growth between pre-exposed and non pre-exposed worms were smaller, though statistically significant. Glutathione levels were similar in preexposed and non pre-exposed earthworms, suggesting that increased glutathione levels did not cause the increased survival in pre-exposed animals. Internal concentrations of mercury were determined in both pre-exposed and non pre-exposed earthworms, and followed a one site binding hyperbola. This reached a maximum around 740 mg Hg/kg soil, corresponding to the internal concentrations 139 + 9 and 165 + 16 µg Hg/g earthworm wet weight in two independent experiments. The shape of the accumulation curves resembled the shape of the curves for glutathione concentrations plotted against mercury concentrations in soil, suggesting that glutathione levels in earthworms are closely related to internal concentrations of mercury. Therefore, glutathione levels may be a useful biomarker for mercury exposure...|$|R
30|$|Hence, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in vermicomposting technology which has emerged as a new biotechnological tool for recycling of different kind of organic wastes through the action of earthworms (Wu et al. 2014, Lim et al. 2016). Both MSW compost (MSWC) and vermicompost have many advantages when compared to inorganic fertilizers which <b>badly</b> affect the <b>soil’s</b> physico-chemical and microbial properties (Srivastava et al. 2016). Agricultural utilization of MSW compost/vermicompost (VC) ameliorates the soil’s nutrient profile, texture, water holding capacity, buffering capacity, soil microbial response, etc. (Weber et al. 2014, Bouzaiane et al. 2014). MSWC/VC has good organic matter content, nitrogen, phosphorus, and humic substances which are important for maintaining the soil quality (Hargreaves et al. 2008). Moreover, it improves the activity of different soil enzymes such as dehydrogenase, urease, phosphatase, protease, phosphodiesterase, arylsulphatase, etc. (Perucci 1990, Bhattacharyya et al. 2003). According to Sim and Wu (2010), it has been demonstrated that through vermicomposting, MSW could be sustainably transformed into an organic fertilizer known as vermicompost that provides great benefits to the agricultural soil and plants. Atiyeh et al. (2001) studied the effect of earthworm-processed pig manure on germination, growth, and yield response of Lycopersicon esculentum under greenhouse environment. Plants were grown in the standard potting medium amended with various ratios (0 – 100 %) of pig manure vermicompost (VC). Germination rates were increased significantly by 20 – 40 % in the VC amended soil than the control. Similarly, tomato seedlings grown in 50 % VC had greater number of leaves and biomass in comparison to control. However, a sharp decline in growth, number of leaves, and biomass was noticed in 100 % vermicompost and the largest marketable yield was noticed in 20 % pig manure vermicompost.|$|R
40|$|As Matas de Galeria do bioma Cerrado possuem peculiaridades fisionômicas e florísticas que permitem separá-las em dois subtipos: "não-inundável", quando em solos bem drenados; e "inundável", o subtipo menos estudado, em solos mal drenados. O presente trabalho objetivou caracterizar estrutural e floristicamente dois trechos inundáveis das matas dos córregos Acampamento (15 ° 35 'S; 48 ° 10 'W) e Riacho Fundo (15 ° 55 'S; 48 ° 02 'W) no Distrito Federal (DF). Para isso foi alocada em cada Mata uma grade de 160 × 50 m (0, 8 ha), composta por 40 parcelas de 10 × 20 m (200 m²). Todos os indivíduos com diâmetro a 1, 30 m da altura do solo (DAP > 3, 0 cm) foram amostrados, incluindo aqueles mortos ainda em pé. Foram amostrados 6. 078 indivíduos, sendo 3. 030 no trecho do Acampamento (33 famílias, 49 gêneros e 60 espécies) e 3. 048 no Riacho Fundo (30 famílias, 41 gêneros, 53 espécies). A área basal e a diversidade (H') calculada para os trechos foram de 47, 96 m²/ha e 2, 99 nats/ind. (Acampamento), e 41, 28 m²/ha e 2, 84 nats/ind. (Riacho Fundo), respectivamente. Se comparados com matas anteriormente estudadas no DF os valores de diversidade são baixos, estando na mesma {{magnitude}} indicada para as Matas de Brejo (Higrófilas) do sudeste brasileiro.

In each forest it was allocated a grid of 160 × 50 m (0. 8 ha), composed by 40 plots of 10 × 20 m (200 m²). All the individuals with DBH > 3. 0 cm were surveyed, including the standing dead plants. It was sampled 6, 078 individuals, being 3, 030 in the swamped portion of Acampamento stream (33 families, 49 genera and 60 species) and 3, 048 in the Riacho Fund portion (30 families, 41 genera, 53 species). The basal area (dominance) and the diversity (H') for the studied portions were 47. 96 m²/ha and 2. 99 nats/ind. (Acampamento) and 41. 28 m²/ha and 2. 84 nats/ind. (Riacho Fundo), respectively.

However the classification accomplished by TWINSPAN generated two distinct groups, each one linked {{to one of the}} portions studied (Acampamento and Riacho Fundo). These results reinforce previous indications that distinct gallery forests in Distrito Federal, or even similar portions on that, show different floristic patches. This variation are related to the hydrographic basin in which the gallery forest is inserted, and the soil drainage...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of floods on the territory of South Bohemia was chosen as a topic of a thesis for several fundamental reasons. One main reason {{is the significance of}} the landscape and reflect on its values. The landscape is a set of individually occurring scenic features and extensive landscape structures, in which have individual natural compounds their irreplaceable function. Besides landscapes, the floods have a different environmental impact. Since 1997, the occurrence of floods has unexpectedly increased, and therefore the issue is getting more and more attention. Currently, the so-called environmental security is a hot topic, the evidence {{can be seen in the}} increase in professional publications and it also gets into the school curricula. Although the thesis focuses on the territory of South Bohemia, the results can be applied for the entire Czech Republic. The final survey includes a total of eight municipalities with extended powers, where interviews were conducted with the employees of the Department of the Environment, the Crisis Management,the Regional Hygiene Station of the South Bohemia, the Vltava River Basin and selected agricultural companies. This thesis titled "The environmental impact of floods in the South Bohemia" aims to evaluate the changes caused by the floods in the affected areas in the South Bohemia a reserach questiion follows: What are the effects of floods in terms of environmental impact in the South Bohemian Region? To achieve the set objectives the method of literature research was used, by which the basic information necessary to understand the issue was described. The method of qualitative research was also used; the reasearch was based on structured interviews with experts in the field. Afterwards, the information were logically organized and evaluated. The thesis is divided into two general parts. The first is a theoretical part, which describes the flood and its categories and its causes. It also explains the factors affecting the flood, the impacts on habitat and the flood retention capacity and its increase. It also describes and compares the largest floods in the Czech Republic since the 19 th century, the basic law governing the issue of water and floods, flood protection organization in the Czech Republic and last but not least, the environmental security and the definition of the duties of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute. The second part describes the effects of floods in terms of the {{environmental impacts}} and describes its recourse. The nature needs some changes in order to be varied. That may come in the form of floods, even though after the water decrease its tremendous power and devastating effects can be seen. Based on research, it was found that there are long-term impacts on the landscape and environment but they are not so crucial. Water takes everything that comes its way, but the landscape itself can handle water very well. Drops of water soak into the ground or flow into the watercourse. The consequences of flooding depend on how much is the soil able to absorb water and how much time it would take. Unfortunately, this nature´s ability is distorted mostly by people and their actions. The water soil soaking is spoiled by buildings, <b>badly</b> tilled <b>soil,</b> inadequate food planting and destroyed hedgerows that serve as a hiding place for the animals. Maybe if the greatest importance was not emphasized on protecting people and their health, people would care more about the landscape and would be grateful for what nature offers and provides. The fundamentals of this work are solutions that would improve the environmental situation. The care should be taken not only to individual preventive measures, but to prevent floods and minimize their consequences. The starting point is to increase the retention, since the landscape has a short-term water retention problem...|$|R
