5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew the <b>backgrounds</b> in pencil, {{starting}} with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. The <b>backgrounds</b> were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The <b>backgrounds</b> were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn't mix with the <b>backgrounds.</b> Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some <b>backgrounds</b> based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of the <b>backgrounds</b> and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E

5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's <b>backgrounds</b> by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the <b>backgrounds</b> are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic.|$|E

5|$|Production on {{the game}} started at the {{beginning}} of 2001 with a team of only four programmers. Since Resident Evil was one of Capcom's first titles developed for the GameCube, the development team had to study the system's performance during the first stages of development. Initially, the team considered the possibility of creating the game's environments with computer graphic animation, but then realized that this approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics. As a result, the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre-rendered <b>backgrounds</b> like the Resident Evil games for the PlayStation. Despite this, the camera is more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles. The <b>backgrounds</b> also make use of particle effects and full motion video layers to simulate effects such as rushing water or swaying tree branches. Causing fear to the player was a high priority, and many of the game's <b>backgrounds</b> were designed to have a high contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly.|$|E

30|$|Moving {{objects such}} as humans or {{vehicles}} are often the focus of image sequence analysis. The segmentation of moving objects is the first key problem which can be formulated as a <b>background</b> subtraction. In that sense, the <b>background</b> scene is modeled. Object pixels are segmented when they {{are found to be}} different from the <b>background</b> model. A common <b>background</b> subtraction framework contains <b>background</b> modeling, joint background/foreground classification, and <b>background</b> model updating. Survey on <b>background</b> subtraction techniques can be found in [1]. Sobral and Vacavant [2] presented a recent review and evaluation of 29 <b>background</b> subtraction methods. <b>Background</b> subtraction techniques can be categorized based on the ways to model the <b>background</b> scene. For instance, the <b>background</b> scene can be characterized in terms of statistical parameters. Bouwmans [3] presented a survey on statistical <b>background</b> modeling. Alternatively, the <b>background</b> model is represented as a bag of visual words—intensities or colors sampled over a short image sequence. Texture-based methods model the <b>background</b> scene by analyzing the relationship between the neighboring pixels.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Moving object {{detection}} and segmentation {{is a fundamental}} technology for video applications. <b>Background</b> subtraction is a basic component step for this task: given a frame in the video sequence, a moving object can be detected by spotting {{the parts of the}} frame that do not fit the <b>background</b> model. Therefore, a high performance <b>background</b> modeling and <b>background</b> updating algorithm is crucial for <b>background</b> subtraction. We work with a fixed camera in a stationary scene and a simple non-statistical <b>background</b> model is utilized, therefore we formulate the problem of <b>background</b> subtraction as the problem of <b>background</b> updating. This paper proposes a novel and efficient <b>background</b> updating algorithm based on the logic AND and XOR relationship of the change information in difference frames. Key-Words: <b>background</b> subtraction (BS), <b>background</b> modeling, <b>background</b> updating (BU), dynamic thresholding, logic relationship. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland {{and a lot of}} new designs and <b>backgrounds</b> had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The <b>backgrounds</b> were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked him to make the voice older and crazier.|$|E

Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments. The <b>Backgrounds</b> department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts.
