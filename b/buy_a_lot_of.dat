6000|$|... "Now, you've got to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> grub, an' then we'll {{have so much}} {{to carry}} that a team will be needed to haul 'em. I know where we can get a boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{thought you}} {{would just like to}} cheat me into <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> your trash," [...] {{finished}} the restaurant proprietor. [...] "Well, you can't do anything of the kind, and you can take that for your impudence!" ...|$|R
60|$|The one {{outstanding}} {{fact was}} that people were <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things they had no use for, merely because they felt they were getting them cheaply and that their money would be devoted to a good cause.|$|R

It doesn't seem reasonable, after that, to credit him with trying to prevent their sale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] a facetious {{neighbor}} said to me, [...] "it {{would be}} cheaper {{for you to}} <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Apollinaris water,--at wholesale rates, of course,--and let your men open so many bottles a day and empty them into your tank.

5000|$|The [...] "free lunch" [...] {{refers to}} the once-common {{tradition}} of saloons in the United States providing a [...] "free" [...] lunch to patrons who had purchased at least one drink. Many foods on offer were high in salt (e.g., ham, cheese, and salted crackers), so those who ate them ended up <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> beer.

5000|$|Mira Sparks - Colie's aunt. She is {{overweight}} and very kind. She makes cards that are {{for people that}} have lost their loved ones. She <b>buys</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sugared cereal and enjoys eating the tuna salad at Last Chance. Mira is also friends with Morgan and Isabel. She lives with Norman and Colie and has a cat named Cat Norman (named after Norman).|$|R
6000|$|... "Mary," [...] said Albert, {{after another}} short pause, [...] "I {{have got a}} hundred dollars and my axe,--and this right arm. I am {{thinking}} <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> land, about <b>a</b> mile beyond Kater's corner. If I will do it, and build a small house of one room there, will you come and be my wife? It {{will have to be}} a log house at first." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dismissing Mrs. Potts from my mind, which, to {{tell the}} truth, {{seemed to have no}} room for her shadowy and {{hypothetical}} entity, I fell to examining the chest. Oh! it was lovely. In two minutes the clock was deposed and that chest became the sultana in my seraglio of beauteous things. The clock had only been the light love of an hour. Here was the eternal queen, that is, unless there existed a still better chest somewhere else, and I should happen to find it. Meanwhile, whatever price that old slave-dealer Potts wanted for it, must be paid to him even if I had to overdraw my somewhat slender account. Seraglios, of whatever sort, it must be remembered, are expensive luxuries of the rich indeed, though, if of antiques, they can be sold again, which cannot be said of the human kind for who wants to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> antique frumps? ...|$|E
6000|$|Our next {{letter to}} Howells is, in the main, pure foolery, {{but we get}} [...] in it a hint {{what was to become}} in time one of Mask Twain's [...] strongest interests, the matter of copyright. He had both a [...] {{personal}} and general interest in the subject. His own books were [...] constantly pirated in Canada, and the rights of foreign authors were [...] not respected in America. We have already seen how he had drawn a [...] petition which Holmes, Lowell, Longfellow, and others were to sign, [...] and while nothing had come of this plan he had never ceased to [...] formulate others. Yet he hesitated when he found that the proposed [...] protection was likely to work a hardship to readers of the poorer [...] class. Once he wrote: [...] "My notions have mightily changed lately.... I can <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the copyright classics, in paper, at from three [...] to thirty cents apiece. These things must find their way into the [...] very kitchens and hovels of the country..... And even if the treaty [...] will kill Canadian piracy, and thus save me an average of $5,000 a [...] year, I am down on it anyway, and I'd like cussed well to write an [...] article opposing the treaty." ...|$|E
60|$|Frank, however, was firm, {{for he was}} going, not for {{the sake}} of making money, but of finding {{adventure}} and excitement. He went down every day to the wharf and superintended the loading of the scows, {{and at the end of}} ten days he resumed his boatman's clothes and took his place on one of the scows. Hiram accompanied him, with eight negroes, two for each flat. A tug took them in tow, and they started up the river. Mr. Willcox was to follow by a steamer next day, and would arrive at Omaha some time before them, and have time to choose and <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> land for his store, and to have all in readiness for their arrival. Frank had purchased a strong, serviceable horse for his own riding, and a pony for his baggage, together with blankets and other necessaries for the journey. His mining outfit he decided to get at Sacramento, as, although the cost would be considerable, he did not wish to encumber himself with it on his journey across the plains. The rifle and revolver had been presented him by Mr. Willcox, and he determined to practise steadily with both on his voyage up the river, as his life might depend on his proficiency with his weapons.|$|E
5000|$|Dominic Bellissimo (Frank and Teressa's son) told The New Yorker {{reporter}} Calvin Trillin in 1980: [...] "It was Friday {{night in}} the bar and since people were <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> drinks {{he wanted to do}} something nice for them at midnight when the mostly Catholic patrons would be able to eat meat again." [...] He stated that it was his mother, Teressa, {{who came up with the}} idea of chicken wings.|$|R

Greece is also planning on <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> 4th generation aircraft once it recovers from the current economic crisis.|$|R
50|$|During a house search, {{a junkie}} named René Wehrli (Manuel Löwensberg) {{falls out of}} the window. Strähl gets {{suspended}} from police service. Moreover, René and his girlfriend Carol “Caro” Hertig (Johanna Bantzer) blackmail Strähl for smart money. The drug addict couple <b>buys</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> articles in <b>a</b> kiosk, and Strähl {{has to pay for}} them (René also fills out a “Toto”-ticket (sports betting) there, and Strähl positively influences him doing it). Despite that, René doesn’t want to take back his inculpatory statement - René demands a huge amount of heroin from Strähl.|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} over to-day to the weekly fair at Attegrat. I was also there last Monday, but had no space to give to its {{description}} in my last letter. A more amusing sight I have seldom or never seen. Some two or three thousand people must have been present. The fair or market, as I suppose it should be called, is held upon a flat rocky slope {{on the other side}} of the village, and this is packed so close that one moves about among the squatting and standing groups with difficulty. At one end is the cattle-fair. The number each grazier brings into market is not large (seldom over two or three), and there they stand in little quiet groups surrounded by their master and several of his friends, and submitting to be felt, pinched, and examined as well as the best-behaved English cow would do. Here, too, are the donkeys, sturdy little beasts, not much bigger than a Newfoundland dog, but which will carry nearly as great a weight as a mule. I wonder our Transport Corps does not <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> them for carrying commissariat stores. They will take two bags each, that is 150 pounds’ weight, and require no saddles, for the bags are merely laid upon their broad little backs and strapped there with a few strips of hide; they require no grain, and very little hay, and cost only five or six dollars. Any number of them might be purchased. These, like the oxen, stand very quietly, and appear perfectly indifferent as to any possible change in their ownership. They not unfrequently have young ones by their side, little round rough beasts with disproportionately-long ears and shaggy coats. The goats appear to take matters with less indifference. Their masters endeavour to keep them in little circles, with their heads towards the centre; but they are continually trying to escape from this arrangement, and to make a bolt for it. They keep up a constant bleating as a protest against the whole proceeding. Near to them is the grain-market. Here are men and women with their grain-bags, made of skins of goats sewn up, and with only an opening at the neck. They sit about everywhere, while the buyers walk about among them and inspect the samples with a gravity and intentness which would do no discredit to Mark-lane. Their purchases probably will not exceed two or three pounds’ weight, but they are as careful over the matter as a brewer would be who was going to make a bid for a ship’s cargo. The grain is almost entirely barley, and splendid barley too. There are beside, however, a variety of other grain, of which I do not know the names. The natives distil a spirit from their barley, which is said to be something between gin and hollands in flavour. I have not yet tasted any. Very thick is the throng round a Parsee belonging to the commissariat, who is buying up all he can get for Government at a dollar for nineteen pounds. Near him is another little crowd: here another commissariat employé is similarly engaged in buying up ghee—that is, clarified or boiled butter—for the native troops. It does not look very nice, and what does not make the sight the pleasanter is, that the women, when they have emptied the jars into the commissariat casks, invariably wipe them out with their hands, and then plaster the remainder upon their heads. An Abyssinian does not consider himself properly dressed unless his hair is shining with oil, not put on or rubbed on, but plastered on, and running down his neck as the sun melts it. The idea is not, according to our notions, pleasant, but it is a matter of taste. When an Abyssinian really wants to make a great effect he uses butter, not ghee, and puts it on until his head is as white as that of a London footman. Then he is conscious that he has indeed done it, and walks with a dignity befitting his appearance. There were several swells of the period so got up at the market, and as they stood under the shelter of their straw umbrellas—for the sun would melt it and destroy the whole effect—I could not but wonder at and admire the different forms which human vanity takes.|$|E

50|$|Carrotmob is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} based in San Francisco, California. It uses buycotts (a form of consumer activism where <b>a</b> community <b>buys</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> goods from one company in a small time period) to reward a business's commitment to making socially responsible changes to the business. Carrotmob also refers to a global movement of community organizers who use the Carrotmob tactic of consumer activism {{as a way to}} help change businesses in their communities. In a Carrotmob buycott, businesses compete to be the most socially responsible business, and then a network of consumers spends money to support the winner.|$|R
50|$|The third, the “mid-quarter convention,” {{assumes that}} all {{property}} placed into service, or disposed of, during any {{quarter of a}} taxable year was placed into service, or disposed of, at the midpoint of that quarter. (§ 168(d)(4)(C)) Section 168(d)(3) tells a taxpayer when {{it is appropriate to}} use the mid-quarter convention. Specifically, if <b>a</b> taxpayer <b>buys</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> depreciable assets {{in the last three months}} of the taxable year, the taxpayer will in some cases be forced to use the mid-quarter convention, resulting in an even smaller depreciation deduction in the first year as compared to the half-year convention.|$|R

He then puts on a bland [...] "rational consumer" [...] outfit to mock the contest, but is stunned to learn that he won (mainly because Kelly and others voted for him out of surety he'd lose, Ryan wanted to shake things up a la his support for Ralph Nader, and Creed says it was [...] "the best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen".|$|R

5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4 stars stating [...] "Some jazz improvisers believe that {{appealing}} to R&B and pop fans is beneath them, but Houston Person {{never had that}} elitist mentality. The big-toned tenor titan was always a communicator; though he has first-rate chops and can easily sail through difficult bop changes, Person doesn't value pyrotechnics over feeling and emotion. Consequently, albums like Chocomotive have managed to reach a lot of R&B and pop fans who don't necessarily <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> jazz".|$|E

From this viewpoint, {{it is important to}} find the optimal division between in-house and in-the-cloud computations.

Akira uses this money to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> chocolate candies, and places it into the suitcase with Yuki's dead body and favorite stuffed bunny. Akira and Saki then take the Tokyo Monorail to an open field near Haneda Airport's runway and bury the suitcase containing Yuki in a hand-dug grave.

50|$|The role of {{analytical}} CRM {{systems is}} to analyze customer data collected through multiple sources, and present {{it so that}} business managers can make more informed decisions. Analytical CRM systems use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and pattern recognition to analyze the customer data. These analytics help improve customer service by finding small problems which can be solved, perhaps, by marketing to different parts of a consumer audience differently. For example, through the analysis of <b>a</b> customer base's <b>buying</b> behavior, <b>a</b> company might see that this customer base has not been <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> products recently. After scanning through this data, the company might think to market to this subset of consumers differently, in order to best communicate how this company's products might benefit this group specifically.|$|R
