25|$|It {{took more}} than a century for {{business}} intelligence to become a separate scientific process embraced by entrepreneurs and develop the methods it offers nowadays. In its initial form, this analytic concept was laid down by IBM researcher Hans Peter Luhn in his 1958 IBM Journal article titled ‘A Business Intelligence System'. Luhn is also known as the inventor of Key Word in Context (KWIC) indexing, whose work marked the efforts to make <b>business</b> <b>statistics</b> more understandable for non-expert users.|$|E

40|$|<b>Business</b> cycle <b>statistics</b> differ widely across countries, {{especially}} for trade-related variables. Part of these variations {{relates to the}} size of the economies and to their distance from each other. This paper asks whether a three-country model is able to display the marked diversity of <b>business</b> cycle <b>statistics</b> observed across countries. The model is calibrated to two specific examples with Canada and Switzerland. Our findings are that most of the diversity of the business cycle can be accounted for by size and distance, and that trade is not a strong channel of diffusion of cycles.

This research was aimed at exploring these challenges in the execution of the Gauteng Department of Labour’s provincial office merger with regard to the implementation of the Labour Market Information and <b>Statistics</b> <b>business</b> unit. Using a qualitative approach and qualitative interviews, the factors that lead to the lack of strategic leadership in the Labour Market Information and <b>Statistics</b> <b>business</b> unit were investigated.

These results in managers in the unit not to being able to play their strategic leadership role, as planning, communication and strategic understanding affected the implementation of the unit’s strateg...|$|R
