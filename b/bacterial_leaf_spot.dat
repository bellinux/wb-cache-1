40|$|Abstract: Systemic {{acquired}} resistance (SAR) is a plant self-defense mechanism {{against a}} broad-range of pathogens and insect pests. Among chemical SAR triggers, plant and bacterial volatiles are promising candidates {{for use in}} pest management, as these volatiles are highly effective, inexpensive, and can be employed at relatively low concentrations compared with agrochemicals. However, such volatiles have some drawbacks, including the high evaporation rate of these compounds after application in the open field, their negative effects on plant growth, and their inconsistent levels of effectiveness. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of volatile organic compound (VOC) -mediated induced resistance against both the <b>bacterial</b> angular <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> pathogen, Pseudononas syringae pv. lachrymans, and the sucking insect aphid, Myzus persicae, in the open field.

50|$|In South Africa, {{the most}} {{troublesome}} diseases are powdery mildew and soft brown scale. The plants {{are prone to}} root rots and viruses if on poorly drained soil or if carried over to a second year. Therefore, farmers favor biennial plantings. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (Xanthomonas spp.) occurs in Queensland. A strain of tobacco mosaic virus may affect plants in India.

50|$|Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatora is a {{bacterium}} that causes <b>bacterial</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (BLS) on peppers and tomatoes. It is a gram-negative and rod-shaped. It causes symptoms throughout the above-ground {{portion of the}} plant including leaf spots, fruit spots and stem cankers.

40|$|Organic {{strawberry}} production {{suffers from}} high yield losses caused by numerous {{fungal and bacterial}} diseases. Two {{of the most important}} diseases are the grey mould disease caused by Botrytis cinerea Pers. (teleomorph Botryotinia fuckeliana), and the <b>bacterial</b> angular <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> disease caused by Xanthomonas fragariae (Kennedy & King). Beside cultivation methods and organic plant protection measures, the development of resistant cultivars seems to be the most promising strategy in order to improve the productivity in organic strawberry cultivation. Therefore, we established resistance tests to determine resistant and susceptible strawberry cultivars and breeding selections. In a first run, 40 different cultivars and selections were tested for their susceptibility towards B. cinerea by artificial inoculation of fruits and leaves and evaluation of the disease symptoms. Plants of 40 cultivars were tested for susceptibility to X. fragariae by artificial inoculation in the greenhouse. In a diallel crossing approach, 12 commonly cultivated strawberry cultivars have been crossed reciprocally and propagated in a field trial. Important characteristics of the progeny such as ripening time, yield, morphological traits and occurrence of diseases have been evaluated for a period of two consecutive years and lead to the determination of general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining abilities. Together with the results of the resistance tests we identified a set of genotypes that show resistant characteristics towards B. cinerea and might be suitable for use in organic cultivation systems. Furthermore, they can be used for targeted breeding experiments in the future...|$|R
40|$|Strawberry <b>bacterial</b> angular <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (ALS) disease, {{caused by}} Xanthomonas fragariae has become {{increasingly}} problematic in the strawberry agro-industry. ALS causes small angular water-soaked lesions to develop on the abaxial leaf surface. Studies reported optimum temperature conditions for X. fragariae are 20 °C and the pathogen suffers mortality above 32 °C. However, at the nursery stage, disease symptoms have been observed under high temperature conditions. In the present study, results showed X. fragariae transmission was via infected maternal plants, precipitation, and sprinkler irrigation systems. Systemic infections were detected using X. fragariae specific primers 245 A/B and 295 A/B, where 300 -bp and 615 -bp were respectively amplified. During the nursery stage (from May to August), the pathogen was PCR detected only in maternal plants, but not in soil or irrigation water through the nursery stage. During the cultivation period, from September to March, the pathogen was detected in maternal plants, progeny, and soil, but not in water. Additionally, un-infected plants, when planted with infected plants were positive for X. fragariae via PCR at the late cultivation stage. Chemical control for X. fragariae with oxolinic acid showed 87 % control effects against the disease during the nursery period, in contrast to validamycin-A, which exhibited increased efficacy against the disease during the cultivation stage (control effect 95 %).

40|$|In Quebec, <b>bacterial</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> {{of lettuce}} was {{observed}} {{for the first}} time in 1994. Since this first mention, the disease has been observed each year and the severity varied with environmental conditions. Little information was available on this disease because until recently it was only sporadically observed around the world following the first mention in 1918. In this project, we found that two groups of Xanthomonas caused the <b>bacterial</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> of lettuce according to the BIOLOG profiles. From the results of strain characterization, a semi-selective medium has been developed to detect and quantify X. campestris pv. vitians. This medium is made of maltose, tryptone, methyl green, phosphate salts, amoxicillin, cephalothin, cycloheximide and trace elements. It allowed us to carry out studies on the ecology of the pathogen and on the disease epidemiology. The effect of weather conditions on bacterial population size and the <b>bacterial</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> development has been studied. Weather parameters influencing the bacterial population were the number of hours with temperature higher than 28 °C, the number of hours with wind velocity lower than 1 km per hour, the number of hours with relative humidity lower than 45 % and the minimum relative humidity. The weather parameters that significantly discriminated between disease increase categories were the mean solar radiation, the number of hours with relative humidity higher than 90 %, the mean relative humidity and the maximum temperature. Looking at the relationship between X. campestris pv. vitians population size and host plant development, it was shown that both bacterial population size and disease severity increased with leaf age. Mathematical models were developed to show these relationships. This information will be useful in disease management to decide when to apply bactericides and when to harvest.
