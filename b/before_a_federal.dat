5|$|Other {{inquiries}} obtained similar {{testimony from}} witnesses, including {{the taxi driver}} who now stated that the activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated {{that there was a}} short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>Federal</b> grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview.|$|E
5|$|The case {{began when}} the {{investigation}} of an automobile accident during Mateen Cleaves's 1996 recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the Wolverine basketball program {{dating back to the}} 1980s. Several Michigan basketball players were implicated {{over the next few years}} and by 1999 some were called <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> grand jury. Four eventual professional basketball playersChris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullockwere discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin, but eventually confessed to taking loans from Martin. He was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by the National Basketball Association after performing public service.|$|E

5|$|A {{grand jury}} indicted Paul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart on November 5, 2008, on federal charges of {{threatening}} {{to kill and}} inflict bodily harm upon a major presidential candidate, conspiracy, interstate unlawful transportation of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation of a firearm {{with the intent to}} commit a felony, transporting a short-barreled shotgun across state lines without a license and unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun. Cowart was also charged with damaging religious property and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. On November 6, Schlesselman and Cowart pleaded not guilty <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> magistrate in Memphis, Tennessee. The two were placed into federal custody without bail. The charges carry a maximum punishment of 50 years in prison and $540,000 in fines.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E
5|$|The case {{began when}} the {{investigation}} of an automobile rollover accident during Mateen Cleaves' 1996 Michigan Wolverines recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the team.

Four eventual professional basketball players (Chris Webber, Maurice Taylor, Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock) were discovered to have borrowed a total of $616,000 from Martin. During the investigation, Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin. Eventually he confessed to having accepted some of the money he was charged with having borrowed. For his perjury during a federal grand jury investigation, he was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by National Basketball Association after performing public service.|$|E

5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E

25|$|The project {{not only}} accused Clinton of {{financial}} and sexual indiscretions (some later verified, others not), but also gave root to conspiracist notions that the Clintons {{collaborated with the}} CIA to run a drug smuggling operation out {{of the town of}} Mena, Arkansas and that Clinton had arranged for the murder of White House aide Vince Foster as part of a coverup of the Whitewater scandal. The possibility that money from the project had been given to former Clinton associate David Hale, a witness in the Whitewater investigation, led to the appointment of Michael J. Shaheen as a special investigator. Shaheen subpoenaed Scaife, who testified <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> grand jury in the matter.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 2005, The Washington Post {{reported}} that Miller could face criminal contempt charges, {{which could have}} extended her jail time six months beyond the four months then anticipated. The Post also suggested that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was particularly interested in hearing Miller's version of her encounter with Libby. Filings by Fitzgerald reportedly alleged that Miller's defiance of the court constituted a crime. On September 29, 2005, after spending 85 days in jail, Miller was released following a telephone call with Libby. He had reconfirmed the release of confidentiality. Under oath, Miller was questioned by Fitzgerald <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> grand jury the following day, September 30, 2005, but was not relieved of contempt charges until after testifying again on October 12, 2005.|$|E

25|$|Changes {{in section}} 404 {{jurisdiction}} would diminish use of one tool {{used by many}} states to control activities affecting wetlands. In recent years, most states have used CWA section 401 water quality certification programs in addition to or in lieu of specific regulatory statutes. Section 401 requires that <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> permit or license is issued, states must certify that the project complies with water quality standards. That authority effectively gives states a veto power on the federal permit {{or the ability to}} require conditions that become part of a permit. State water quality certification has been used by a number of states to control activities affecting wetlands without having to independently establish state permitting and enforcement programs. However, if federal jurisdiction does not exist and no section 404 or other federal permit is required, section 401 certification also is not required and so is not available as a tool for the state to evaluate the proposed activity.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{agencies}} such as the TPA make a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) for property they own that is not leased to third parties. Such entities pay property taxes on property leased to third parties. By 2009, the City estimated that the TPA owed $37 million in unpaid PILT for all its properties. The PILT was based on the assessed value as calculated by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation, which assesses all property for the province of Ontario. The City and the TPA presented their case <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> dispute advisory panel. On January 26, 2009, the Dispute Advisory Panel recommended that TPA pay PILT for the airport on a per passenger basis of 80 cents per passenger. This amount was based on various considerations including similar payments made by other airports, which make the payments based on passenger numbers. At the time of the ruling, Pearson International Airport paid 94 cents per passenger. On February 10, 2009, the City applied for a judicial review to the Federal Court of Canada.|$|E
25|$|When the TPA was formed, all {{financial}} {{agreements with}} the City of Toronto and the Toronto Harbour Commission were severed. The TPA announced that it wanted to be exempt from making property tax payments to the City of Toronto, which ceased to provide a subsidy to the TPA. Agencies of the Government of Canada do not pay property taxes per se, but instead some negotiated amount to account for municipal services. For the period from 1999 until 2008, the TPA did not make payments in lieu of property tax to the City of Toronto on the Island Airport {{in a dispute over}} the amount of the payment. By 2009, the City estimated that the TPA owed $37 million in unpaid payments in lieu of property tax (PILT). The PILT payments were based on the assessed value as calculated by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation, which assesses all property for the province of Ontario. The City and the TPA presented their case <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> dispute resolution process. On January 26, 2009, the Dispute Advisory Panel recommended an amount of $5 million that the TPA must pay. This value was based on similar payments made by other airports, which make the payments based on passenger numbers. Pearson Airport {{at the time of the}} ruling paid 94 cents per passenger. The ruling by the panel works out to 80 cents per passenger. On February 10, 2009, the City applied for a judicial review to the Federal Court of Canada.|$|E

500|$|Less than a {{week after}} Martin backed out of his plea agreement, several former players were subpoenaed to testify before grand juries. [...] In August 2000, Traylor and Bullock, by this time {{professional}} basketball players in the NBA and Italy respectively, were confirmed to have taken payments from Martin. Many of the payments came after the 1997 banning of Martin from contact with the team and the firing of Steve Fisher. [...] The two players cooperated with federal authorities and admitted to receiving money. Traylor, Bullock, Webber, Rose and Taylor all testified before the grand jury. [...] Fisher, the current San Diego State University coach, testified <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> grand jury investigating Martin. Also testifying were former Michigan assistants Perry Watson, Brian Dutcher and Scott Perry. Martin and Watson had been close friends when Watson was head coach at Detroit Southwestern High School, with Martin often sitting on the bench along with assistant coaches. Perry, who had arranged Cleaves' recruiting trip, had known Martin since 1977 and coached under Fisher from 19931997. Many players and observers believed Martin was Watson's uncle, leading to Martin's schoolyard nickname of [...] "Uncle Ed." [...] Martin and Watson had a falling-out in the early 1990s, shortly after Watson joined the Michigan staff. Webber's father also gave sealed testimony before the grand jury.|$|E
500|$|Owners {{and players}} met again on October 18–20 for 30 hours of talks over three days. [...] They met <b>before</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> mediator, George Cohen—the {{director}} of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Cohen tried unsuccessfully to resolve the 2011 NFL lockout. At {{the conclusion of the}} meetings, the sides remained split on the revenue split and the structure of the salary cap. [...] The league proposed a 50–50 split of BRI, and the players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50% of BRI to a maximum of 53%, depending on the league's revenues. Gilbert told the players to trust that the salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted the 50–50 proposal. Hunter responded, [...] "I can't trust your gut. I got to trust my own gut." [...] Silver and San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt told reporters that the players refused to negotiate after the 50–50 proposal. Fisher told the press [...] "that you guys were lied to" [...] by the owners. Hunter said the owners told them, [...] "Take it or leave it." [...] Cohen decided that there was [...] "no useful purpose" [...] to continue mediation. Tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues, allowing a one-time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against the salary cap, granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and prorate the impact to the salary cap over multiple years, and a mid-level exception of $5 million.|$|E
