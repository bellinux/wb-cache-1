The key idea of 3 D <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> detection is the 3 D Change Detection using 3 D point cloud obtained from aerial images through Structure from motion (SFM) techniques. The approach of <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> detection discussed in this paper not only uses the height changes of 3 D feature of scene but also utilizes the image's shape and texture feature. Therefore, this method fully combines the 2 D and 3 D information {{of the real world}} to detect the <b>building</b> <b>damage.</b> The results, tested through field study, demonstrate that this method is feasible and effective in <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> detection.

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{approach}} of <b>building</b> <b>damaged</b> detection is proposed using high resolution remote sensing images and 3 D GIS-Model data. Traditional <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> detection method considers to detect <b>damaged</b> <b>building</b> due to earthquake, but {{little attention has been}} paid to analyze various <b>building</b> <b>damaged</b> types(e. g., trivial damaged, severely damaged and totally collapsed.) Therefore, we want to detect the different <b>building</b> <b>damaged</b> type using 2 D and 3 D feature of scenes because the real world we live in is a 3 D space. The proposed method generalizes that the image geometric correction method firstly corrects the post-disasters remote sensing image using the 3 D GIS model or RPC parameters, then detects the different <b>building</b> <b>damaged</b> types using the change of the height and area between the pre- and post-disasters and the texture feature of post-disasters. The results, evaluated on a selected study site of the Beichuan earthquake ruins, Sichuan, show that this method is feasible and effective in <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> detection.

50|$|In September 2011, Hurricane Irene posed {{a threat}} {{for most of}} the east coast of the US and {{affected}} many colleges more severely because it occurred right {{at the start of the}} Fall semester. This presented additional obstacles for campus officials trying to move students into dorms. A few of the universities affected by the storm include University of North Carolina-Wilmington in Wilmington, NC; East Carolina University in Greenville, NC; Virginia Wesleyan College in Norfolk/Virginia Beach, VA; City University of New York (CUNY); and the University of Connecticut. Universities experienced varying degrees of damage. While some dealt with minor damage like downed trees and power lines, others dealt with leaking roofs, power outages, flooding and <b>building</b> <b>damages.</b> East Carolina University was one of the schools that had to not only recover from campus damage but also flooding in surrounding neighborhoods that made traveling to campus a hazard for faculty and students. Although damage to the campus was not severe, universities have to be aware of surrounding neighborhoods that are vulnerable to severe flooding and can halt campus operations. The flooding in various parts of Greenville, NC aided in East Carolina University being shut down for several days. This is not the first time East Carolina University has been affected by a hurricane, in September 1999, Hurricane Floyd also struck North Carolina, causing extensive damage and flooding to Greenville, NC.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Remote sensing {{technology}} is effective {{to grasp the}} damage distributions from various natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. After the 2007 Niigata-ken Chuetsu-oki, Japan earthquake, aerial images were taken in the stricken area by several air survey companies in Japan. Airborne remote sensing is more suitable to collect detailed damage distribution because it provides higher resolution images than satellite remote sensing does. The post-event image taken by a digital aerial camera (DMC) is employed in this study to detect <b>building</b> <b>damages.</b> Although the accuracy of visual damage inspection is good enough, {{it takes time to}} perform for the whole areas that are subjected to severe ground motion. Therefore, in this study, the automated technique is proposed to extract <b>building</b> <b>damages.</b> The proposed technique is expected to contribute for the damage assessment at an early stage after the occurrence of an earthquake. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Visual {{interpretation}} of optical satellite images {{is widely used}} to detect <b>building</b> <b>damages</b> after recent earthquakes in the world. However, since optical satellites images are acquired from the vertical direction, they can observe only roofs of buildings. <b>Building</b> <b>damages</b> such as mid-story collapse are often overlooked because the upper surfaces of buildings do not change so much. This paper proposes the method to detect this kind of building collapses from the change in building heights, estimated from the shadow lengths measured before and after an earthquake. Boumerdes city, Algeria, is selected {{as a case study}} site where many buildings were collapsed in the 2003 Boumerdes Earthquake. Two QuickBird images, taken before and two days after the earthquake, were employed for analysis. Base on the measurement of shadow lengths, some mid-story collapses were successfully detected, which could not be detected by visual interpretation. Although a limitation still remains in measuring shadow lengths in densely build-up or highly vegetated areas, the proposed method can help to reduce omission errors, which may be associated in visual damage {{interpretation of}} vertical satellite/aerial images...|$|E
40|$|Early {{earthquake}} {{damage assessment}} {{systems have been}} installed by national government and many local municipalities in Japan, especially, after the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake. The estimation method of <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> included in the existing assessment systems mostly uses the fragility curves constructed based on the <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> data of past earthquakes in Japan and calculates the <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> ratios of a stricken area. However, the useful estimation method of <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> for the assessment systems is estimates the damage levels of all buildings individually in the damaged area. In this paper, the method of earthquake <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> estimation in Japan is developed, employing one of the seismic design methods of structures, the limit strength method. This calculation method is simpler than the time history response analysis, and the spectral characteristics of seismic ground motion and the natural period of a building can be considered because the earthquake response spectrum is used as an input ground motion in this method. In order that the yield base-shear coefficient reflects the conditions of present buildings, identification of the coefficient is conducted by using the <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> survey data and the strong ground motion records from the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake. This estimation method may be conveniently used as the method of estimating <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> individually throughout a stricken city in a short time...|$|R

40|$|For rescue {{management}} after natural desasters {{in urban}} areas, information about severe <b>building</b> <b>damages</b> is very important. The <b>building</b> <b>damages</b> could be detected automatically {{by means of}} image analysis. As final goal, the information could directly flow to a GIS-based desaster management system. An object-oriented spectral segmentation (software "eCogniton"), based on previous explicit knowledge, is used to classify facade elements. This is more robust against shadows and foreground objects than approaches based on primary point and line segmentation. Between the found elements, represented e. g. by their central point or line, geometric relations can be examined. The results {{can be used for}} several purposes: Assuming that an intact facade has some geometric properties like flatness and rect-angularity, one single oblique image can already be rectified, and scattered deviations from the constraints can be determined. With a couple of images, the elements found in each of them can be matched to give identical points for a general threedimensional reconstruction of the scene. Using such coarse object structures promises to be more robust in finding suitable initial values than using image edges and corners, which may be used to refine the first result. Furthermore, if applied to endangered areas, some parameters can be derived that are of interest for robustness assessment, like relative window size and distance.

Historical records are normalized to estimate <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> and fatalities had events occurred under the societal conditions of 2008 / 09. There are relationships between normalized <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean dipole phenomena, but there is no discernable evidence that the normalized data are being influenced by climatic change due to the emission of greenhouse gases. The 2009 Black Saturday fires rank second in terms of normalized fatalities and fourth in terms of normalized <b>building</b> <b>damage.</b> The public safety concern is that, of the 10 years with the highest normalized <b>building</b> <b>damage,</b> the 2008 / 09 bushfire season ranks third, behind the 1925 / 26 and 1938 / 39 seasons, in terms of the ratio of normalized fatalities to <b>building</b> <b>damage.</b> A feature of the <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> in the 2009 Black Saturday fires {{in some of the most}} affected towns—Marysville and Kinglake—is the large proportion of buildings destroyed either within bushland or at very small distances from it (, 10 m).

40|$|To gain an {{estimate}} of the <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> induced by potentially hazardous events, an engineering methodology based on physical modelling is presented. The method allows the qualitative assessment of the possible overall <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> level derived from the initial damage to discrete structural members. For this, damage curves were derived for various construction types that establish the gradual <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> level in dependence of a structural member damage index. Based on the damage level of structural members subjected to an extreme event, the <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> curves were derived using the iterative load factor method applied to various construction types. To calculate the respective remaining capacity, the initial structural member damage was modeled by modifying the material characteristics in each respective FE model accordingly. The form of the damage curves was validated on detailed and sophisticated hydrocode simulations as well as on experimental results. Compared to other methodologies used today, which establish a <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> level based on empirical data, the method presented here has the advantage that the individual member damages leading to the total <b>building</b> <b>damage</b> are identified and comprehensively calculated during the evaluation process, such that potentially applicable structural enhancement measures can be planned in a targeted and efficient manner...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Droughts can induce {{important}} <b>building</b> <b>damages</b> due to shrinking {{and swelling}} of soils, leading to costs {{as large as}} for floods in some regions. Previous studies have fo-cused on damage data analysis, geological or constructional aspects. Here, a study investigating the climatic aspects of soil subsidence damage is presented for the first time. We develop a simple model to examine if the meteorology has a considerable impact on the interannual variability of dam-ages from soil subsidence in France. We find that the model is capable of reproducing yearly drought-induced <b>building</b> <b>damages</b> for the time period 1989 – 2002, thus suggesting a strong meteorological influence. Furthermore, our results re-veal a doubling of damages in these years compared to 1961 – 1990, mainly {{as a consequence of}} increasing temperatures. This indicates a link to climate change. We also apply the model to the extreme summer of 2003, which caused a fur-ther increase in damage by a factor four, according to a pre-liminary damage estimate. The simulation result for that year shows strong damage underestimation, pointing to additional sources of vulnerability. Damage data suggest a higher sen-sitivity to soil subsidence of regions first affected by drought in the 2003 summer, possibly {{due to a lack of}} preparedness and adaptation. This is of strong concern in the context of cli-mate change, as densely populated regions in Central Europe and North America are expected to become newly affected by drought in the future...|$|E

The real-time crowd-sourcing of crisis information provided direct support to key humanitarian actors on the ground including Search and Rescue teams. In addition to its use as a knowledge base for rescue operations, the spatial distribution of geolocated SMS messages could represent an interesting early indicator on the distribution and on the intensity of building damage. This work explores {{the relationship between the}} spatial patterns of SMS messages and building damage. The latter correspond to the detailed damage assessments of individual buildings conducted on post-earthquake airborne photos. The interaction between SMS messages and building damage is studied by analyzing the spatial structure of the corresponding bivariate patterns. This is performed through the implementation of cross Ripley¿s K-function which is suitable for characterizing the spatial structure of a bivariate pattern, and more precisely the spatial relationship between two types of points located in the same study area. The results show a strong attraction between the patterns exhibited by SMS messages and <b>building</b> <b>damages.</b> They also prove that the distributions of SMS messages and <b>building</b> <b>damages</b> are not spatially independent. The interactions identified between the two patterns suggest that the geolocated SMS can be used as early indicators of the spatial distribution of building damage. Accordingly a statistical model has been developed allowing to map the distribution of building damage from the geolocated SMS. The preliminary results will be presented and discussed. JRC. DG.
