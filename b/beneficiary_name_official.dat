30|$|The HC’s {{descriptive}} and spatial information is organised in a property- centred base, thus search {{can be done}} either by the property’s National Cadastre Code Number (KAEK) which is unique to each property, the address or the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R
50|$|If a <b>beneficiary</b> is <b>named,</b> the {{segregated}} fund investment may {{be exempt from}} probate and executor’s fees and pass directly to the <b>beneficiary.</b> If the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is a family member (such as a spouse, child, or parent), the investment may also be secure from creditors in case of bankruptcy. These protections apply to both registered and non-registered investments.|$|R
5000|$|The National Visa Center {{adds the}} <b>beneficiary's</b> <b>name</b> to a queue of people {{awaiting}} immigrant visas. After a wait time (that varies {{based on the}} category), the beneficiary is granted a visa number. Note that IR visas {{are not subject to}} numerical limits, whereas F visas are, but both go through the NVC.|$|R
5000|$|If a {{testator}} leaves {{property in}} a will to several beneficiaries [...] "jointly" [...] {{and one or}} more of those <b>named</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> dies before the will takes effect, then the survivors of those <b>named</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> will inherit the whole property on a joint tenancy basis. But if these <b>named</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> had been bequeathed the property on a tenancy in common basis, but died before the will took effect, then those beneficiaries' heirs would in turn inherit their share immediately (the <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> being deceased).|$|R
50|$|A 1997 {{study by}} O'Laoire {{measured}} {{the effects on}} the agents performing daily prayers and reported benefits {{not only for the}} beneficiaries, but also for the agents, and the benefit levels correlated with the belief levels of agents and beneficiaries in some cases. The study measured anxiety and depression. This study used <b>beneficiary</b> <b>names</b> as well as photographs.|$|R
5000|$|Two-step filing (allowed for all categories): The {{petitioner}} files Form I-130, {{and after}} it is approved, the <b>beneficiary's</b> <b>name</b> is added to a queue of people awaiting immigrant visas.

50|$|The Serbian and Macedonian {{place names}} mean apple. The Hungarian <b>name</b> (<b>official</b> <b>name</b> Torontálalmás from 1898 to 1918) meant apple of Torontál. The German <b>name</b> (<b>official</b> <b>name</b> Apfeldorf from March 1943 to September 1944) meant apple's village.A legend tells about Serbian {{fishermen}} who settled nearby an apple tree. The legend {{has been published}} {{for the first time}} in 1912. There is no deed or other evidence of founding by first settlers.|$|R
50|$|Ademption by {{satisfaction}}, {{also known}} as satisfaction of legacies, is a common law doctrine that determines the disposition of property under a will when the testator has made lifetime gifts to <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>named</b> in the will. Under the doctrine, a gift that the maker of the will (the testator) gives during his lifetime to a <b>named</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of the will is treated as an advance payment of that beneficiary's inheritance. If the probate court determines that the testator intended the lifetime gift to satisfy a bequest under the will, {{the amount of the}} lifetime gift is deducted from the amount that the beneficiary would have received under the will.|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} to {{get a copy of}} the notice of record for an appeal made to AAO by submitting a Freedom of Information Act request to USCIS. However, this {{is not part of the}} appeal timeline, so an appellant cannot use delay in processing of the FOIA to explain delay in submitting any necessary documents. The FOIA can be made by anybody (not necessarily the petitioner or beneficiary); however, key identifying information, including the petitioner's and <b>beneficiary's</b> <b>name,</b> are often redacted.|$|R
50|$|Below {{shows how}} the current system works. For each division, its English <b>name,</b> <b>official</b> <b>name</b> or {{sponsorship}} name (which often differs radically from its <b>official</b> <b>name)</b> and number of clubs is given. Each division promotes to the division(s) that lie directly above them and relegates to the division(s) that lie directly below them.|$|R
5000|$|The PPA {{provides}} a new mechanism for an IRA {{to be passed}} on to a non-spouse beneficiary. Transferring an IRA account this way can allow better control over when to withdraw (and pay taxes on) the IRA funds. An IRA account can only be passed on once, and it is not directly transferred into the beneficiary's account. Instead, a special IRA account with the heading [...] " [...] Deceased Name For the Benefit of <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>Name</b> [...] " [...] is made to keep the transfer.|$|R

50|$|Notable metal {{documents}} are Roman military diplomas. A diploma was a bronze tablet issued, between c. AD 50 and 212 (when all free {{inhabitants of the}} empire were granted Roman citizenship) to an auxiliary soldier on completion of his 25-year term of service to prove the award of citizenship to the holder and his family. A particular advantage of diplomas for historians {{is that they are}} accurately datable. Diplomas also normally list the names of several auxiliary units which served in the same province at the same time, critical data on the deployment of auxiliary units in the various provinces of the Empire at different times. Also usually recorded are: beneficiary's regiment, regimental commander's <b>name,</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> military rank, <b>name</b> of <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>name</b> of <b>beneficiary's</b> father and origin (nation, tribe or city); <b>name</b> of <b>beneficiary's</b> wife and <b>name</b> of her father and origin; and names of children granted citizenship. Over 800 diplomas have been recovered, although most in a fragmentary state. (Even these, however, represent an infinitesimal fraction of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} diplomas which must have been issued. Apart from natural corrosion, the main reason for this low recovery rate is that, prior due to the late 19th century, when their historical value was recognised, diplomas were almost invariably melted down when found in order to recover their copper content - indeed most were probably melted down in the period following 212).|$|R
