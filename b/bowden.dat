5|$|Under {{head coach}} Bobby <b>Bowden,</b> the Seminole {{football}} team {{became one of}} the nation's most competitive college football teams. The Seminoles played in five national championship games between 1993 and 2001 and won the championship in 1993 and 1999. The FSU football team was the most successful team in college football during the 1990s, boasting an 89% winning percentage. Bobby <b>Bowden</b> would retire with the record for most all-time career wins in Division I football. Jimbo Fisher succeeded <b>Bowden</b> as head coach in 2010. FSU football is well known for introducing talented players into the NFL; see list of Florida State University athletic alumni.|$|E

5|$|Apt Pupil is a 1998 American thriller film {{directed}} by Bryan Singer and starring Ian McKellen and Brad Renfro. It {{is based on}} the 1982 novella of the same name by Stephen King. In the 1980s in southern California, high school student Todd <b>Bowden</b> (Renfro) discovers fugitive Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander (McKellen) living in his neighborhood under the pseudonym Arthur Denker. <b>Bowden,</b> obsessed with Nazism and acts of the Holocaust, persuades Dussander to share his stories, and their relationship stirs malice in each of them.|$|E
5|$|Florida State began 2010 after a 7–6 {{record in}} 2009 {{that ended with}} a 33–21 win against West Virginia in the 2010 Gator Bowl. Florida State also began the year under a new head coach. Bobby <b>Bowden,</b> who retired after 57years as a head coach, 34 at Florida State and 33consecutive winning seasons, was {{replaced}} by Jimbo Fisher. Immediately before the 2010 season began, <b>Bowden</b> claimed he had been pushed out as head coach, causing a stir before Florida State's first game.|$|E

5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{entered the}} 20002001 college {{football}} season after a 66 season in 1999 under first-year head coach Tommy <b>Bowden.</b> Fans and college football analysts predicted <b>Bowden</b> would continue Clemson's resurgence from a 38 season {{during the year}} before <b>Bowden</b> was hired. Some pointed to Bowden's undefeated season {{in the second year}} after assuming the head coaching job at Tulane University as a sign of what to expect from Clemson. Most analysts, however, anticipated a more moderate improvement over the previous year. In the annual preseason poll of media who covered Atlantic Coast Conference football, Clemson tied for second with Georgia Tech. Both teams were far behind perennial favorite Florida State, however. Nationally, Clemson debuted at No. 17 in the preseason AP Poll and No. 20 in the preseason coaches' poll.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with season four, one {{character}} who was credited {{as a guest}} star {{in the first three}} seasons, received star billing after the opening credits in addition to <b>Bowden,</b> Powell, Brown, Chapman, and Pancholy.|$|E
5|$|Transvaal {{began their}} reply strongly; their openers, Monty <b>Bowden</b> and John Hickson put on 69 {{runs for the}} first wicket, the {{majority}} being scored by <b>Bowden.</b> Once they lost their first wicket, the team continued to lose wickets at regular intervals; the second-highest partnership of the innings was the 17 runs made for the tenth, or last, wicket. George Glover {{was the best of}} the bowlers, collecting six wickets. Glover and Albert Rose-Innes bowled the majority of the overs, and took nine of the wickets between them. Bowden's score of 63 was substantially the best by any batsman in the innings, only John Piton, Spranger Harrison and Hickson scored more than 10 runs, and none managed as many as 20.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{predicted}} {{to be the}} key player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and an offense that earned 610rushing yards in the final two games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also was a point of interest. At the time, Florida State head coach Bobby <b>Bowden</b> had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was ranked third. Beamer had never defeated <b>Bowden</b> in a game. Before the game, Beamer was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.|$|E
5|$|Both sides made {{low scores}} {{in their first}} innings; Kimberley, who had opted to bat first, were {{dismissed}} for 98 runs, and in their reply Transvaal reached 117, a lead of just 19 runs. In the second innings, they both fared better; a century from Bernard Tancred helped Kimberley {{to a total of}} 235, but Transvaal reached their total in 38 five-ball overs, helped by a century from Monty <b>Bowden.</b>|$|E
5|$|Florida State (84) {{earned a}} BCS berth despite a record {{inferior}} to the other seven BCS teams. Regardless of that fact, the Seminoles' matchup with Penn State (101) in the 2006 Orange Bowl, where college football's two winningest coaches, Penn State's 78-year-old Joe Paterno and Florida State's 76-year-old Bobby <b>Bowden,</b> squared off.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State Seminoles are {{coached by}} Bobby <b>Bowden,</b> father of Tommy <b>Bowden.</b> Their 2001 matchup marked {{only the second}} time that a father and son had faced each other as {{opposing}} head football coaches. The only other meeting had been the previous year, when Tommy lost by three points to his father. In the 2001 meeting, No. 4 Florida State dominated No. 10 Clemson {{from the start of the}} game. In an effort to impress BCS voters, Florida State ran up the score and the game ended with the Seminoles on top, 527. The Seminoles' win gave them the ACC football championship and dropped Clemson to a No. 16 ranking. With its spot as the No. 2 ACC team assured, Clemson accepted a bid to the Gator Bowl on November 14, prior to its annual in-state rivalry game against South Carolina. In that game, South Carolina took a one-point lead with 59 seconds remaining, but Clemson drove the length of the field and kicked a field goal as time expired, giving the Tigers a 1614 win to end the regular season.|$|E
5|$|The third {{innings of}} the match gave Kimberley a second attempt at batting on the first day; they lost wickets {{regularly}} through the afternoon, but opener Tancred remained at the crease throughout, finishing the day unbeaten on 55, with the team on 100 for six. The match resumed on Monday 7 April 1890, with no play scheduled for the Sunday. After the early loss of Rose-Innes for 20 runs, Charles Rutherfoord joined Tancred. The pair scored 97 runs together, taking the score up to 226. Three quick wickets then ended the Kimberley innings; they scored 235 runs from 83 overs, in which Tancred scored a century, hitting 106 runs before being leg before wicket to <b>Bowden.</b> Vintcent took the most wickets for Transvaal, claiming four for 70. Smith claimed two wickets, and <b>Bowden,</b> who was designed on the scorecard as the team's wicket-keeper also claimed two wickets from the three overs that he bowled.|$|E
5|$|While {{returning}} to Kolkata after completing a floral survey, Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817–1911) {{carried out the}} first survey of Sitakunda's local flora, as recorded in his Himalayan Journals, in January 1851 (published by the Calcutta Trigonometrical Survey Office and Minerva Library of Famous Books; Ward, Lock, <b>Bowden</b> & Co., 1891).|$|E
5|$|Florida State's victory {{raised it}} {{to a final}} record of 84, and Virginia Tech's loss brought it also to a final record of 84. Following the loss, the Hokies had a 510 record in bowl games, {{including}} 13 in the Gator Bowl and 45 in bowl games under head coach Frank Beamer. Florida State's victory gave Seminoles head coach Bobby <b>Bowden</b> the 322nd win of his career, tying him for second in the overall Division I career wins list with Bear Bryant.|$|E
5|$|In their quarter final, they {{defeated}} Second Division Barnsley 4–1, having outplayed {{them right}} from the start, the first goal coming in the fourth minute from Beasley in an attacking move. <b>Bowden</b> scored the second goal, and the third came from a penalty scored by Bastin. The fourth and final Arsenal goal was Beasley's second, with Barnsley's consolation goal coming {{a couple of minutes}} {{from the end of the}} match. In the semi final, played at Huddersfield Town's ground, beating Grimsby Town 1–0 in a match that was described by reporters as completely one sided, with the goal coming from Bastin five minutes before half time.|$|E
5|$|Kelly gained one yard {{on first}} down, then Dantzler picked up 11 {{yards and a}} first down on a run up {{the middle of the}} field. An {{incomplete}} pass was followed by a run for no gain and another incomplete pass. Facing fourth and goal at the eight-yard line, <b>Bowden</b> sent in his field-goal kicker. After the Tigers called a time out, Hunt completed a 27-yard field goal attempt and cut Virginia Tech's lead to 2713 with 7:19 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Sir Robert <b>Bowden</b> Madgwick OBE (10 May 1905 – 25 March 1979) was an Australian educationist. He was {{the first}} Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England and served two terms as Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Madgwick was an {{influential}} proponent of adult learning and extension studies in tertiary education. At the University of New England, he directed the development of several degree programs, including rural science, agricultural economics, and educational administration which were the first of their kind in Australia. In recognition of his contributions to education, Madgwick {{was appointed to the}} Order of British Empire in 1962 and knighted in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{situation}} was not reflected at Clemson, where offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez {{announced that he}} was leaving the team for the head football coach job at West Virginia University, where he competed as a player in the 1980s. Rodriguez did not participate in Clemson's practices prior to the Gator Bowl, and he did not coach during the game. Replacing Rodriguez as temporary offensive coordinator was Brad Scott. Joining him in the press box during the Gator Bowl was Mike O'Cain, who was hired as Clemson's new quarterbacks coach. In an effort to prevent further defections, Clemson awarded head coach Tommy <b>Bowden</b> a seven-year contract extension worth $1.1 million annually plus incentives.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 Sugar Bowl {{kicked off}} at 8:00p.m. EST on January 3, 2005, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Official {{attendance}} {{was listed as}} 77,349. Mike Tirico, Tim Brant, Terry <b>Bowden,</b> and Suzy Shuster were the announcers for the television broadcast, which was aired on ABC. About 10million households watched the game on television in the United States, giving the game a Nielsen rating of 9.5 and making it the 24th most popular Bowl Championship Series game in terms of television ratings. The game was also broadcast on ESPN Radio, and was commentated by Mark Jones, Bob Davie, and Holly Rowe. Spread bettors favored Auburn {{to win the game}} by seven points.|$|E
5|$|The Smokers {{began their}} innings {{late on the}} first day. By that stage, the pitch had {{deteriorated}} and light was poor, making batting more difficult. By {{the end of the}} day's play forty minutes later, they had lost four wickets and only scored 25 runs. They fared better the following morning, but only three batsmen reached double figures—Billy Gunn, 18, Monty <b>Bowden,</b> 29, and Charles Clarke, 20 not out—as they were bowled out for 111 just before the lunch break. W. G. Grace was the pick of the bowlers, taking five wickets for 29 runs. A first-innings deficit of 139 runs meant that the Smokers were forced to follow on.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan, and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), her boss; and the distractions the writers of TGS face when writing sketches. This becomes evident when Liz's assistant, Cerie (Katrina <b>Bowden),</b> wears sexually suggestive clothing; and when Jack decides to join the writers for observation. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) learns that working for Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the main star of TGS, is more than he expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{team has}} played more than 1,150 games over 119 seasons. In that time, six coaches {{have led the}} Tigers in postseason bowl games: Jack Meagher, Ralph Jordan, Pat Dye, Terry <b>Bowden,</b> Tommy Tuberville and Gene Chizik. Seven coaches won conference championships: Walter H. Watkins and Mike Donahue won a {{combined}} three {{as a member of}} the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association; Chet A. Wynne won one {{as a member of the}} Southern Conference; and Jordan, Dye, Tuberville and Chizik won a combined seven as a member of the SEC. During their tenures, Jordan and Chizik each won a national championship with the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|The {{team has}} played more than 1,160 games over 117 seasons. In that time, eleven coaches {{have led the}} Razorbacks in postseason bowl games: Fred Thomsen, John Barnhill, <b>Bowden</b> Wyatt, Frank Broyles, Lou Holtz, Ken Hatfield, Jack Crowe, Danny Ford, Houston Nutt, Reggie Herring and Bobby Petrino. Five coaches won conference championships: Thomsen, Wyatt, Broyles, Holtz and Hatfield won a {{combined}} ten {{as a member of}} the Southwest Conference. Frank Broyles won the Razorbacks' lone national championship in 1964.|$|E
5|$|This episode {{focuses on}} the events of Valentine's Day for {{the cast and crew}} of TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictional sketch comedy series. Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) {{receives}} a mysterious gift; Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) comments that he hates Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski); Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) forgets Valentine's Day, which also happens to be his wife, Paula's (Paula Pell) birthday; Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) divorce from Bianca (Isabella Rossellini) is made official; the writers believe that Cerie Xerox (Katrina <b>Bowden)</b> has romantic feelings for Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer); and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tries to spend a night with his wife, Angie Jordan (Sherri Shephard).|$|E
5|$|Though its offense {{performed}} well, it was Virginia Tech's {{special teams}} and defense that earned it the win. Duane Brown's twin blocked kicks {{were the first}} blocks recorded in ACC Championship Game history and were the 116th and 117th blocked kicks recorded at Virginia Tech under head coach Frank Beamer. In addition to the blocks, Tech special teams excelled on punts and kickoffs. Tech punter Brent <b>Bowden</b> finished the day with seven punts {{for a total of}} 324yards. A 54-yard kick in the first quarter was the fourth-longest punt in ACC Championship Game history.|$|E
5|$|Transvaal batted {{rapidly in}} their second innings, {{reaching}} the required total to win the match inside {{the second day of}} the match, which had been scheduled for three days in total. Opening batsman <b>Bowden</b> batted throughout the whole innings, remaining not out on 126 when his side won the match. He was joined at the end by Vintcent, who scored 60 runs in a partnership of 126 runs between the two players. Kimberley tried six different bowlers in an effort to bowl Transvaal out, but only Rose-Innes and Irvine Grimmer took wickets, claiming two apiece.|$|E
5|$|Transvaal {{challenged}} Kimberley for the Currie Cup in 1890, {{the first}} such challenge for the trophy. A number of the team selections were controversial: the selection committee for Transvaal chose Aubrey Smith and Monty <b>Bowden,</b> both of whom had remained in South Africa after touring {{as part of the}} England cricket team the previous year, and Charlie Finlason, who played the majority of his cricket for the opposition Kimberley team. Finlason, a newspaper journalist, had fallen out with Smith after writing a number of articles criticising him and the English side. When Finlason was selected for Transvaal, Smith—who was captaining the side—made him bat at number eleven.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{entered the}} game headed by star quarterback Michael Vick, {{who led the}} Hokies to a 101 regular-season record despite being injured for {{a part of the}} season. Clemson entered the game with a regular-season record of 92 under the command of head coach Tommy <b>Bowden,</b> who was in the second year of his tenure. The contest {{featured}} two high-scoring offenses that emphasized different aspects of the game. These aspects were exemplified in the game, which saw Clemson pass for more yards than Virginia Tech, while the Hokies ran for more yards than the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Being {{from the}} First and Second Divisions respectively, both Arsenal and Sheffield United were seeded {{into the third}} round of the FA Cup. In the third round itself, Arsenal was drawn away against Third Division South team Bristol Rovers. Arsenal missed a penalty, and the third Division team went a goal up in the first half; Arsenal were playing so poorly that it seemed they would {{struggle}} even for a draw. The turnaround in the match occurred when Cliff Bastin took over from Bobby Davidson at the inside left position. Arsenal equalized in the 65th minute, and scored further four times {{over the course of the}} following fourteen minutes to win the game by five goals to one, with a single goal from <b>Bowden</b> and two each from Drake and Bastin.|$|E
5|$|Both teams made {{changes to}} their {{respective}} coaching staffs {{in the weeks that}} followed the Sugar Bowl. Chuck Amato resigned from his position as linebackers coach for Florida State to take the head coaching position at North Carolina State. His role as linebackers coach was filled by Joe Kines, whom Bobby <b>Bowden</b> hired from the University of Georgia. Amato's role as assistant head coach was filled by Jim Gladden, who had been a coach at Florida State for more than 25 years at the time he was named the assistant head coach. At Virginia Tech, head coach Frank Beamer also made some changes to his coaching staff, promoting several position coaches to higher positions in the Tech football hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and returned the opening kickoff to its 19-yard line. In his opening drive, Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed several long passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Once there, however, the Florida State offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three plays that followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard false start penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, Florida State coach Bobby <b>Bowden</b> sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and the three points gave Florida State an early 30 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Clemson's offense {{started at}} its 25-yard line. On {{the first play}} of the drive, Dantzler {{completed}} a pass to wide receiver Rod Gardner, who ran for 25 yards and a first down at the 50-yard line. A nine-yard shovel pass play {{was followed by a}} run up the middle for a first down at the Tech 37-yard line. Dantzler completed an eight-yard pass, then a running play was stopped short of the first-down marker. On third down, Dantzler faked a quarterback sneak in order to attempt a long pass downfield. Dantzler was unable to pass, however, and was sacked for a four-yard loss. Rather than attempt a field goal or punt the ball, Clemson coach Tommy <b>Bowden</b> had his team attempt to gain a first down. Dantzler scrambled forward, but didn't gain the five yards needed. The Tigers thus turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 28-yard line.|$|E
5|$|In {{its sixth}} {{game of the}} season, Wake Forest {{suffered}} its first loss. Against the No. 15 Clemson Tigers, Wake gave up 24 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to give Clemson a 27-17 victory. The Demon Deacons recovered quickly from the loss and proceeded to begin another winning streak, this time against ACC opponents. Over the next four weeks, Wake defeated North Carolina State, North Carolina, No. 16 Boston College, and Florida State. The 30-0 win over Florida State marked several milestones for the Deacons. The win marked the first time in school history that the Deacons had earned nine wins in a single season. In addition, Wake Forest recorded its first win against Florida State in Tallahassee since 1959 and became the first team to shut out a Bobby Bowden-coached Florida State team in Doak Campbell Stadium. The game continues to be celebrated in Tallahassee, as it marked the end of the Jeff <b>Bowden</b> era.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is dateless for ex-boyfriend Floyd DeBarber's (Jason Sudeikis) wedding, {{and does}} not want to be alone. She revisits her old boyfriends—Drew Baird (Jon Hamm) and Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters)—but the visits do not go well. Later, at a party, Liz learns from Cerie Xerox (Katrina <b>Bowden),</b> her office assistant, that she will be seated next to Wesley Snipes (Michael Sheen)—a man whom Liz despises—at Cerie's wedding. As a result of this, Liz invites Wesley as her date to Floyd's wedding. At the wedding, Wesley reveals that he has lost his job, and needs Liz to get him U.S. residency, and proposes {{marriage}} to her. After an unsuccessful conversation with Mike (John Anderson), a friend of Floyd's, Liz agrees to marry Wesley.|$|E
