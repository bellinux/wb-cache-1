5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E

Hard-to-measure {{properties}} of high-level cirrus clouds {{that may affect}} global warming were recorded using specially designed instruments while the ALTUS flew at 50,000 feet altitude off the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i. Clouds both reflect incoming solar energy back to space, and absorb warm longwave radiation from the Earth's surface, keeping that heat in the atmosphere.

25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E

She said that Eve was [...] "always willing to make sacrifices, and there's always somebody willing, as Ayn Rand said, to take any sacrifices you {{might be willing to}} make." [...] She compared Eve to Catherine Halsey in Rand's 1943 novel, The Fountainhead, particularly around the middle of the novel, before Catherine [...] "was completely destroyed". Ross described Eve as [...] "a self-sacrificing animal", and emphasized that her character was distinct from her own self-identification as an individualist. Ross said that her portrayal of Eve was also influenced by Eve White, a character with dissociative identity disorder played by Joanne Woodward in the 1957 film The Three Faces of Eve. The actress researched books on sociopaths and psychopaths to help her approach Eve's desire to hide her past at any cost. During the filming process, she kept a diary to help her <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> to approach future scenes. Ross also used the 2001 novel [...] to inform her interpretation of Eve's past. She expressed surprise that Eve's relationship with Julian was [...] "a real short courtship" [...] that turned the character from [...] "the innocent girl to the woman on the Studio 54 dance floor having sex". After adjusting her perception of Eve's past, Ross chose to play the character's descent into drugs and prostitution as [...] "more immediate, wild and impulsive" [...] and [...] "very untamed and unrestrained".|$|E

40|$|Due {{to recent}} {{activity}} involving diffusion measurements using pulsed gradient spin echo techniques, both experimental and theoretical, {{we now have}} a better understanding of diffusion of fluid molecules in a large class of natural and artificial porous media. At short times, the restrictions cause deviations from free diffusion that depend only on local properties of the pore-grain interface. This allows quantities such as the time-dependent diffusion coefficient and the return to the origin probability to be calculated exactly, and these results have been experimentally verified. At longer times, diffraction-like effects are observed in the measured momentum-space diffusion propagator, which can be understood in model systems. In general, it is <b>better</b> <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> diffusion measurements may be used to probe the microgeometry of porous media...|$|R

With cancer, specific information about a tumor is used to help create a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. [...] Pharmacogenomics is the study of how a person's genome affects their response to drugs. This field is relatively new but growing fast due in part to an increase in funding for the NIH Pharmacogenomics Research Network. Since 2001, there has been an almost 550% {{increase in the number of}} research papers in PubMed related to the search terms pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics. This field allows researchers to <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> genetic differences will influence the body's response to a drug and inform which medicine is most appropriate for the patient.

[...] Overall, researchers believe pharmacogenomics will allow physicians to better tailor medicine to the needs of the individual patient. As of November 2016, the FDA has approved 204 drugs with pharmacogenetics information in its labeling. These labels may describe genotype-specific dosing instructions and risk for adverse events amongst other information.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pedagogy}} of cognitivism {{prevalent in}} the early 1970s and early 1980s also promotes the idea of process over product, {{but it is a}} more scientific approach to composition studies and is opposed to moderate expressivism in many ways. Abstractly speaking, cognitivists believe that thinking exists in the mind apart from language and are concerned with understanding how language—or writing—is developed from mental processes of the mind. Cognitivists are primarily concerned with the goals of a writer, the decisions made during the writing process by the mind. Andrea Lunsford addresses the importance of understanding the cognitive mental faculties involved during composition, claiming {{that the best way to}} facilitate the writing process is through workshops and discussion rather than lecture-based instruction. [...] Researchers like cognitivist Sondra Perl conduct extensive studies of the composing process and the stages through which a writer goes in order to <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> to teach writing. Cognitivists Linda Flower and John Hayes see an exigency in composition studies to understand how and why a writer makes the choices they do during the writing process. Their research led them to claim that writing is a non-linear, hierarchal, goal-driven process. In addition, they concentrate their study of composition on the protocol of the writing process, including planning, translating, embedding, and reviewing. While like expressivists in their greater concern with the process of writing than with the final product, distinguishing them from the essay-driven pedagogy of current-traditional rhetoric, cognitivism proposes a more scientific approach by studying universal cognitive faculties of the mind in order to better understand the composition process.|$|E
