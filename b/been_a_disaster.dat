He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> for Asad and his now mainly Syrian army; Muslim control {{north of the}} Oxus had collapsed entirely, and while the governor {{had been able to}} escape complete destruction, he had suffered considerable casualties. Asad led his troops back to Balkh, but the Turgesh remained in Tokharistan, where they were joined by Ibn Surayj. As the Arabs customarily did not campaign during winter, Asad demobilized his men. On Ibn Surayj's urging, on the other hand, the Turgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack into Lower Tokharistan, hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Arabs. In this he was joined not only by Ibn Surayj and his followers, but by most of the native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan.|$|E
5|$|As {{had been}} the case at Northwestern, Notre Dame's {{football}} program {{was in a state}} of flux when Parseghian arrived. While Notre Dame built a proud history under Rockne and Frank Leahy, its two most successful coaches, the late 1950s and early 1960s had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster.</b> The team had finished 5–5 in 1962 under Joe Kuharich, who lost the confidence of his players and Notre Dame's administrators during his four years as coach. Kuharich's surprise departure at the end of that season to become supervisor of officials in the National Football League, a position created by his friend and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, left the program in disarray. Devore, a long-time Notre Dame employee who had played for Rockne and coached under Leahy, was brought in to lead the team on an interim basis in 1963. Notre Dame managed only a 2–7 finish that year.|$|E

5|$|Politically the {{expedition}} had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> yet Warwick gained recognition for his leadership since morale had been {{high and the}} civilian population had been treated with unusual respect. The Earl's rewards were the Welsh lordship of Ruthin and the Order of the Garter, which was awarded to him while still in France in April 1563. His war injurywhich never properly healedmade him ineligible for posts like Lord President of the Council of the North or Lord Deputy of Ireland when they were suggested {{for him in the}} future. Elizabeth Lady Tailboys had also died while her husband was in France, and on 11November 1565 Ambrose Dudley married for the third time. His bride was the 16-year-old Anne Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford. Robert Dudley, meanwhile Earl of Leicester, had arranged the match. It was an extraordinary court event. In between tournaments and banquets, the bride was given away by the Earl of Leicester {{in the presence of the}} Queen; she later became one of Elizabeth's closest friends.|$|E
5|$|While the Arab army {{returned}} to its base at Balkh, the Turgesh wintered in Tokharistan, where {{they were joined by}} Harith. The campaign had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> for Asad and his now mainly Syrian army; Muslim control north of the Oxus had collapsed entirely, and while the Arab governor had been able to escape complete destruction, he had suffered considerable casualties. The losses suffered by the Syrians under Asad's command in the 737 campaign in Khuttal were of particularly grave importance in the long term, as the Syrian army was the main pillar of the Umayyad regime. Its numerical decline in Khurasan meant that the Khurasan-born Arabs could no longer be completely controlled by force; this opened the way for the appointment of a native Khurasani Arab governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, to succeed Asad, and, eventually, for the outbreak of the Abbasid Revolution that toppled the Umayyad regime.|$|E

25|$|The German {{propaganda}} machine swiftly credited Wittmann, by then {{a household}} name in Germany, with all the British tanks destroyed at Villers-Bocage. Wittmann recorded a radio message {{on the evening of}} 13 June, describing the battle, and claiming that later counter-attacks had destroyed a British armoured regiment and an infantry battalion. Doctored images were produced; three joined-together photographs, published in the German armed forces magazine Signal, gave a false impression of the scale of destruction in the town. The propaganda campaign was given credence in Germany and abroad, leaving the British convinced that the Battle of Villers-Bocage had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> when in fact its results were less clear-cut. The Waffen-SS may have fought with distinction during the Battle of Kursk but could not match the army's success, hence Sepp Dietrich's attempts to manufacture a hero out of Wittmann.|$|E

25|$|The Etruscans, Samnites and Umbrians {{crossed the}} Apennine Mountains and {{advanced}} near Sentinum (in the Marche region, near modern Sassoferrato). Their plan {{was for the}} Samnites and Senones to engage the Romans and for the Etruscans and Umbrians to take the Roman camp during the battle. Deserters from Clusium informed Quintus Fabius about this plan. The consul ordered the legions in Falerii and the Vatican to march to Clusium and ravage its territory for another diversionary strategy. It drew the Etruscans away from Sentinium to defend their land. In the Battle of Sentinum, the Gauls stood on the right wing and the Samnites on the left. Quintus Fabius stood {{on the right and}} Publius Decius on the left. Livy said that the two forces were so evenly matched that if the Etruscans and Umbrians had been present it would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> for the Romans.|$|E
25|$|During the {{campaign}} in February 1816, Ochterlony {{decided to take a}} very infrequently used pass through the mountains. The failure there would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> for British. But the successful passage would allow Birith to directly emerge and attack the Nepalese's rear. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O’Hollorah followed the river Bagmati to reach Hariharpur Gadhi. Some of the heads of villagers were bribed for sensitive information about the defensive positions in the area of Hariharpur Gadhi. The information seriously compromised the Nepalese defences. Secret routes would have given the enemy advantage even if {{they were able to get}} only a battalion through. But the British were able to advance with more than a brigade’s strength. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O’Hollorah launched their attack from two different directions on 29 February. The Nepalese troops were eventually driven back from Hariharpur Gadhi after a big battle. Kaji Ranjore Singh Thapa withdrew to Sindhuli Gadhi to link up with Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. The British troops did not approach Sindhuli Gadhi and fell back to Makawanpur by the end of March 1815 AD.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, {{she decided}} to turn down a million dollar a year (approx. $13.6 million in 2017) {{contract}} with Paramount to join the newly created United Artists, where she was her own boss and could make the films she wanted, with whom she wanted, and when. Her first independent film, The Love of Sunya, was directed by Albert Parker, based on the play The Eyes of Youth, by Max Marcin and Charles Guernon. Produced by and starring Swanson, it co-starred John Boles and Pauline Garon. It {{is the story of}} a young woman granted the ability to see into her future, including her future with different men. The story had been filmed previously as Eyes of Youth starring Clara Kimball Young (that production was also directed by Albert Parker and was responsible for the discovery of Rudolph Valentino by June Mathis). The production was marred by several problems, mainly a suitable cameraman to deal with the film's intricate double exposures, as Swanson was not used to taking charge, and filming took place in New York. The film premiered at the grand opening of the Roxy Theatre in New York City on March 11, 1927. (Swanson was pictured in the ruins of the Roxy on October 14, 1960, during the demolition of the theater, in a famous photo taken by Time-Life photographer Eliot Elisofon and published in Life magazine.) The production had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> and Swanson felt its success would be mediocre at best. On the advice of Joseph Schenck, Swanson returned to Hollywood, where Schenck begged her to film something more commercial. She agreed but ended up filming the more controversial Sadie Thompson instead.|$|E

[...] The Los Angeles Times called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, [...] "the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster,</b> but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it sounds, more Shakespearean than sci-fi." ...|$|E

Saturday Evening Post reviewer Richard Warren Lewis wrote, [...] "The absurd notion of debasing Judy's reputation as a legendary figure and molding her show into an imitation of other prosaic variety shows has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> where it hurts most, in the audience-rating polls." [...] Indeed, Garland's show was averaging an 18 rating, about half of the audience represented by Bonanza and its 35 rating.|$|E

While other ships bombarded the fort from the main channel, Vigilant and a smaller ship worked their way up a secondary channel {{to the rear of the}} fort.

In recognition of the ship's success, her commander, Lieutenant John Henry, was promoted to the command of the frigate [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{reaction of}} the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2–3, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac that could have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them {{for the rest of}} the year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned [...] "rather sooner than I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished what I proposed on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac." [...] He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, [...] "Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that that army will be as quiet as a sucking dove." [...] Some Southern publications, such as the Charleston Mercury, criticized Lee's actions in the campaign and on August 8, he offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.|$|E
