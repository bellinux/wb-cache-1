In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. It {{gradually}} decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290miles (490km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200miles (320km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area initially remained broad and ill-defined. However, by July 18, the system <b>became</b> <b>much</b> better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220miles (355km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E
5|$|Banding {{features}} and outflow continued to develop as {{a ring of}} convection formed around the center of Fabian, and on August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest. As banding {{features and}} outflow became better defined, an eye developed {{in the center of}} the deepest convection. Fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day. Deep convection became very concentric around the 11.5mile (18.5km) wide eye, and the hurricane reached winds of 125mph (205km/h) early on August 31. At this time, the deepest convection near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection. Outflow continued to expand in all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud tops in the eyewall <b>became</b> <b>much</b> cooler; simultaneously, outflow away from the eye <b>became</b> <b>much</b> more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone. Fabian reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1 while located 345miles (555km) east of the northern Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th {{century in}} Japan, peasant revolts, known as ikki, <b>became</b> <b>much</b> more commonplace. During {{the turmoil of}} the Ōnin War (1467–1477) and {{subsequent}} years, these rebellions increased in both frequency and success. Many of these rebels became known as Ikkō-ikki, a collection of peasant farmers, Buddhist monks, Shinto priests, and jizamurai (lesser nobles) who all espoused belief in the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism. Rennyo, the Hongan-ji abbot who led the Jōdo Shinshū movement, attracted a large following in Kaga and Echizen Province, but distanced himself from the political goals of the ikki, advocating violence only for self-defense or defense of one's religion.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century botany {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany <b>became</b> <b>much</b> more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Classic {{there was}} greater {{public access to}} the acropolis; as the threat of warfare grew during the Terminal Classic (AD 800-900), access <b>became</b> <b>much</b> more restricted. The end of formal {{occupation}} {{of the city in}} the Terminal Classic appears to have been violent, with evidence of a battle recovered during excavations of the acropolis. Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca, but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century, after which it was never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|Following the Stonewall riots, lesbian {{themes in}} {{literature}} <b>became</b> <b>much</b> more diverse and complex, and shifted {{the focus of}} lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as The Furies, and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian. Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values {{are evident in the}} writings of Dorothy Allison, who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian sadomasochism themes.|$|E

5|$|In 1734, he {{switched}} sides {{and joined the}} supported Augustus III. After several years of distrust, August III started treating Poniatowski {{as one of his}} major advisers. Over the next few years, throughout the 1740s, he and familiar supported plans for reform and strengthening the Commonwealth, however most of them have failed due to liberum veto disrupting the Sejm proceedings. Those failures likely resulted in the his apathy, and he <b>became</b> <b>much</b> less active on the political scene in the 1750s. On 6 June 1752 he received the office of castellan of Kraków.|$|E
5|$|James Graham's {{exploits}} at Waterloo <b>became</b> <b>much</b> celebrated throughout Great Britain, {{and many}} {{accounts of the}} battle make reference to his actions, including a biography of Wellington, the memoirs of another sergeant, and Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words.

A watercolour portrait of Sergeant Graham himself is held at the National Gallery of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Rashomon, which premiered in Tokyo, {{became the}} {{surprise}} {{winner of the}} Golden Lion at the 1952 Venice Film Festival. The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets {{for the first time}} to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year, including a number of highly regarded (and often adapted) films, such as Ikiru (1952), Seven Samurai (1954) and Yojimbo (1961). After the 1960s, he <b>became</b> <b>much</b> less prolific, though his later work—including his final two epics, Kagemusha (1980) and Ran (1985)—continued to win awards though more often abroad than in Japan.|$|E

The military role of retainers <b>became</b> <b>much</b> more pronounced by the late 2nd century CE during the political turmoil that would eventually split the empire into three competing states. By then, hosts began to treat retainers as their personal troops (buqu 部曲), which undercut the freedoms of mobility and independence that earlier retainers had enjoyed. Whereas individual retainers had earlier joined a host by their own personal decision, by the late 2nd century CE the lives of the retainers' entire families became heavily controlled by the host.|$|E
5|$|The arts {{scene in}} Fairbanks also grew during this time. The Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra {{was founded in}} 1959, and the Fairbanks Drama Association was created in 1963.

The next year, the Goldpanners hosted their first annual Midnight Sun Baseball Game, a tradition that had been conducted since 1905 and continues under the Goldpanners' auspices today.

For the next several months, the UN forces enjoyed air supremacy, operating their air forces in support of ground combat virtually unopposed. The public perception of the F-80s, which had to this point been cautious, improved with news of the victories.|$|E
