In such a polymerisation, there is the additional challenge that the RAFT agent for the first monomer must also be suitable for the second monomer, making <b>block</b> <b>copolymerisation</b> of monomers of highly disparate character challenging.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} novel macrocyclic ligands bearing amine and phenol donor atoms was synthesised, with differing substituents on the {{aromatic}} ring. These ligands {{were designed to}} allow incorporation of two metal centres in proximity within a flexible macrocyclic cavity. From these ligands, three new bimetallic zinc acetate complexes were produced. These complexes were the most active catalysts for the copolymerisation of CO 2 and cyclohexene oxide at 1 atm CO 2 pressure, which could significantly reduce the energy cost of plastic production. The catalysts produced poly(cyclohexene carbonate) with near-perfect CO 2 incorporation. Variation of reaction conditions showed the catalysts were tolerant of water/oxygen, and active under low loadings. Trimetallic complexes were also synthesised, showing an externally bound zinc site to exhibit reduced activity. The copolymers produced had low molecular weights (< 20, 000 g/mol), probably due to chain transfer reactions. Replacement of zinc with cobalt(II) increased the activity tenfold, {{probably due to the}} more nucleophilic cobalt-carbonate bonds. Oxidation of the Co(II) /Co(II) complex produced a mixed valence Co(II) /Co(III) complex; characterised by X-ray crystallography, UV-Vis spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. The complexes showed extremely high activity under 1 atm CO 2, furthermore, at 10 atm, an activity similar to the best catalysts was observed. Both ionic and neutral cobalt(II) halide complexes were synthesised. These complexes showed slightly higher molecular weights, but lower activities. By coordinating strong nucleophilic donors (such as 4 -dimethylaminopyridine) to the metal centre, the catalytic activity was significantly reduced, a result which led to the proposal of a bimetallic mechanism. The use of other epoxides (e. g. propylene oxide and styrene oxide) in the copolymerisation was attempted. However, the catalysts were inactive for copolymerisation with these epoxides. The terpolymerisation of cyclohexene oxide, CO 2 and propylene oxide showed poor control and activity. The <b>block</b> <b>copolymerisation</b> of PCHC with lactide was also investigated producing, tri-block copolymers. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate Cu(0) -mediated living radical polymerisation and explore the potential and the limitations of this system with the ultimate goal to maximise the end-group fidelity and enable the synthesis of multiblock copolymers. Careful optimisation of the ligand and catalyst concentration was shown to be vital for preservation of end-group functionality, which can be exploited for post-polymerisation modifications. High molecular weight multiblock copolymers were obtained for the first time, although the weaknesses and limitations of the technique were also revealed and discussed. At the same time, a new, novel polymerisation protocol was discovered, exploiting photo-activation {{in the presence of}} a cupric precursor CuII(Me 6 -Tren) Br 2 and an excess of an aliphatic tertiary amine ligand Me 6 -Tren. For the first time under UV irradiation (λ 360 nm) near-quantitative conversions and narrow dispersities for a range of targeted molecular weights were achieved while the scope of this technique was expanded to a range solvents and monomers. Significantly, temporal control is also observed during intermittent light and dark reactions and excellent end-group fidelity can be attained. This remarkable degree of control obtained during both homo and <b>block</b> <b>copolymerisations</b> motivated further investigation into the scope of the system in pursuit of acrylic multiblock copolymers with good sequential control over discrete block compositions, synthesised via a photo-mediated approach in a one-pot process without intermediate purification steps and in the absence of potentially costly additives such as photo-redox catalysts, initiators and dye sensitisers. Both techniques utilised the multiblock copolymer synthesis as a tool not only to synthesise functional well-controlled materials but more importantly to enable polymerisations with high end-group fidelity, whereby termination has been significantly suppressed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the versatility of Cu(0) -mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerisation (RDRP) in aqueous media {{in order to facilitate}} the synthesis of multiblock copolymers consisting of various acrylamides. Under carefully optimised conditions, a simple and highly efficient one-pot polymerisation procedure (full conversion for each block and no intermediate purification required) will be developed allowing access to iterative monomer additions, fast polymerisation rates and high level of control. As a result, complex microstructures (such as hexablocks) can be achieved in a quantitative manner in a matter of few hours, which consists the fastest synthesis of such material up to date. However, the loss of the halide chain end will be shown to be the main limitation of the in situ chain extensions and <b>block</b> <b>copolymerisations</b> of acrylamides in water. In order to assess the effect {{of the nature of the}} monomer to the loss of the end group fidelity, a further investigation into the monomer nature and the lifetime of the ω-Br chain end will be conducted further highlighting the importance to monomer structure and sequence in poly(acrylamide) s multiblocks in order to maximise the retention of the bromine chain end. At the second part of this thesis, a mechanistic investigation of Cu(0) -mediated polymerisation in organic and aqueous media will also be presented. The role of the Cu(0) on the polymerisation kinetics and will be extensively investigated differentiating Cu(0) -wire from the in situ generated Cu(0) particles. The extent of disproportionation and comproportionation reactions in aqueous, organic and aqueous/organic mixtures will be also evaluated and the effect of the monomer on these reactions will also be shown demonstrating a completely different behaviour between organic and aqueous media. Finally, a direct comparison between Cu(0) and Cu(I) mediated polymerisation under exactly the same reaction conditions will be attempted indicating different active species depending on the conditions employed. Nevertheless and regardless the mechanism, the ideal polymerisation protocol that allows access to the preparation of high ordered materials will be shown. Very fast polymerisation rates (achieving quantitative conversion within 10 min), high end group fidelity even at full monomer conversion and good control over the molecular weight distribution will highlight Cu(0) -mediated polymerisation as a versatile tool for the synthesis of a wide range of materials...|$|R
40|$|In {{industry}} {{the effective}} mixing and de-agglomeration of two solid particles is vital in applications {{that require the}} intimate contact of homogeneously mixed reagents. One such application is {{in the preparation of}} pyrotechnic delay elements with reproducible burn speeds. The concept of surfactant assisted particle micro-mixing is proposed. This theory is based in the use of two amphiphilic polymeric surfactants to form two separate stable dispersions of the two solid particles to be mixed, but with the subsequent requirement that the dispersants are able to interact with each other. The formation of the individual dispersions allows for the deagglomeration of the particles and thus their preparation for homogeneous mixing, which is facilitated by the interacting surfactants. Low molecular mass block copolymers of styrene and acrylic acid and poly(ethylene oxide) -poly(propylene oxide) (PEO-PPO) surfactants are the proposed dispersants which will allow for the surfactant interaction by means of hydrogen bonding between the poly(acrylic acid) block and the PEO. The poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) block copolymer will be synthesised via Atom Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP) and subsequently used in the dispersion experiments. The synthesis of the polystyrene macroinitiators to initiate the <b>block</b> <b>copolymerisation</b> of the t-butyl acrylate was carried out satisfactorily, with good molecular masses and molecular mass distributions. In addition, lH-NMR analysis carried out on the polystyrene macroinitiators confirmed their synthesis. The use of the polystyrene macroinitiators was successful in synthesising poly(styrene-co-t-butyl acrylate) block copolymers with slightly higher polydispersities in comparison to the macroinitiatiators themselves, but acceptable. Hydrolysis of the poly(styrene-co-t-butyl acrylate) block copolymer to poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) was successful in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as catalyst. Attempts to hydrolyse in basic conditions (NaOH) and alternatively in acidic conditions (HCI) were not successful. Use of the poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) amphiphilic block copolymer to emulsion polymerise styrene requires the ionised form of the polymer and was therefore not favourable to observe surfactant-surfactant hydrogen bonding. In addition, attempts to synthesise a wax emulsion stabilised by a PEO containing surfactant proved to be unsuccessful. Subsequently, the micro-mixing experiments were carried out by using a poly(acrylic acid) stabilised melamine dispersion and a commercially available PEO containing surfactant stabilised wax emulsion. The interaction between the melamine and the poly(acrylic acid) allows for the formation of a stable melamine dispersion at above 7 % poly(acrylic acid) : melamine ratio (mass basis). Analysis by SEM shows that without the poly(acrylic acid) dispersant no wax particles are found to occur on the melamine particle surface. However, in an attempt to determine whether the amount of wax interaction increases with poly(acrylic acid) content, it was found that in the absence of poly(acrylic acid) dispersant, the most amount of wax precipitated out with the melamine. This is possibly attributable to the preferential occlusion of the wax particles between the melamine particles rather than surface attachment. Introduction of the poly(acrylic acid), however, shows via SEM analysis that the hydrogen bond interaction between the acrylic acid group and the ethylene oxide group does occur, since the attachment of the wax particles on the melamine particle surface is observed. Although results show that the surfactant-surfactant interaction allows for the micro¬mixing of particles, some refinement is required with respect to the systems that this phenomenon can be applied to. In addition, factors such as particle type, particle size and surfactant type will influence the micro-mixing interaction. It is therefore recommended that these factors be investigated in order to completely identify the micro-mixing phenomenon.
