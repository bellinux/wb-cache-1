6000|$|I dreamt {{that people}} from the Land of Chimes Arrived one autumn morning with their <b>bells,</b> To <b>hoist</b> them on the towers and citadels Of my own country, that the musical rhymes ...|$|R
50|$|In 2001, BCA Center {{learned that}} the Shelburne Museum hoped to give the {{original}} bell back to the Firehouse tower. Ravaged by years of water, damage, a re-engineering and renovation of the tower {{as well as a}} concentrated fundraising effort took place. The <b>bell</b> was <b>hoisted</b> back into its home on September 12, 2002.|$|R
50|$|The {{celebrations}} {{continued in}} the usual form with the firing of the siege cannons (today a small replica is used), the ringing of the cathedral <b>bells,</b> the <b>hoisting</b> of the Crimson Flags, and the laying of wreaths in memory of those who sacrificed their lives. In December they continue with the burning of an effigy of Robert Lundy (the Governor of Derry who had wished to negotiate with King James during the siege) and the service of thanksgiving in St Columb's Cathedral.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower was}} erected at a final cost of £5 940, but there was, as yet, no clock and no bells for the {{proposed}} carillon, and efforts were set afoot {{to raise funds for}} that purpose. The largest bell in the carillon is about 6 feet in diameter and weighs between three and four tons. The <b>bells</b> were <b>hoisted</b> into position in the belfry during July 1936 and the first recital on the carillon was given on 9 September by Lionel Field, Mus Bac, ARCM.|$|R
50|$|The eight tons {{of steel}} girders and {{seven and a}} half tons of <b>bells</b> were <b>hoisted</b> the seventy feet onto the tower and {{installed}} by Yarrows Shipyard of Victoria under the direction of Edward W. Izard in just six working days. As the tower was incomplete, a wooden shed was built over the bells to protect them from the elements. The bells were first rung on July 12, 1936, and the tower was completed in 1957 when construction on the cathedral resumed. The bells are rung by the Ringers' Guild for Sunday services, festivals, funerals, weekly rehearsals, and by arrangement for weddings.|$|R
5000|$|... 6. Karthigai Deepam (Festival {{of lights}} {{in the month of}} Karthikai) 7. Flag Hoisting: In {{addition}} to Pooran kodi, a special flag having 92 <b>bells</b> will be <b>hoisted</b> at Panguni and Vaikaasi festivals. And White flag, having the symbol of Killnaamam is hoisted twice a month, on the full moon day and on the third day of New Moon.|$|R
50|$|Once {{under the}} bell, the bellman would hook the lifting tackle {{to one or}} more of the D-rings {{provided}} for this purpose on the diver's harness, then enter the <b>bell</b> and <b>hoist</b> the diver in, taking care to avoid and release any snags, which may require the bellman to work below the water surface. Once the diver is in the bell, CPR should be started if the diver is not breathing. This requires the diver's helmet to be removed. If this must be done with the diver suspended from the hoist, the divers body must remain in the water to help preserve blood supply to the upper body and head by hydrostatic pressure.|$|R

These furnaces are used for the second stage debinding and sintering of metal parts in a variety of industries. Elnik Systems manufactures first stage debinding equipment including Water Debinding, Solvent Debinding and Catalytic Debinding. Another part of Elnik's portfolio are products for the heat treating industry. This portfolio includes high temperature vacuum and atmosphere ovens, hot zones and retorts made of molybdenum or graphite, oil free infrared vacuum ovens, double vacuum tube exhaust stations, carbonizer and carburizer systems, bell jars, <b>bell</b> jar <b>hoists,</b> deposit systems, and brazing ovens.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} Emilei, who had just taken porta Nuova, decided to leave for Veneice to seek help from the Venetian army. In contrast Iseppo Giovannelli and Alvise Contarini, the Venetian government representatives in the town, thought they could even now turn Verona back to its former Venetian neutrality, and so {{tried to make a}} compromise with the French military authorities, interrupting the sound of <b>bells</b> and <b>hoisting</b> a white flag atop torre dei Lamberti. Balland paused the bombardment (even if battle continued around Castel Vecchio, it having been isolated from the castelli on the hills and was thus unable to gain information on the course of events). Negotiations thus began, which Balland wanted to prolong to give more time for French reinforcements to arrive.|$|R
50|$|A very {{remarkable}} {{feature is}} shown {{in the construction of the}} bell tower. The rules of the Order did not originally permit the erection of a tower, but this prohibition was later removed. In many other similar structures the original transept arches have been used to carry the walls of a tower, however in this case the old arches were not built upon, but new piers were built alongside the old, and new arches were formed at the nave and choir, and in this way the stability of the tower was secured. There were seven bells in the tower plan, indicated by the seven openings for the bell ropes to the ringing chamber through the vault carrying the floor of the tower. There was also a large opening square through which the <b>bells</b> were <b>hoisted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bells were vitally {{important}} to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, {{to call the}} Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells. In 1846, two bells, the oldest in Alta California, were purchased from Misión Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó (Our Lady of Loreto) in Loreto, Baja California Sur, Mexico in exchange for six burro loads of barley and wheat. The bells were inscribed: [...] "N.S. De Loreto 1723" [...] and [...] "San Pedro 1767." [...] After the Mission began to deteriorate in the 1830s, and the <b>bells</b> were <b>hoisted</b> onto the yoke shown in the photograph at right. On a summer night, in 1926, the bells disappeared, apparently stolen. The day after they disappeared, a local named Jose Maria Osuna found the clappers (bell ringers) and took them home for safekeeping. After Osunas death, the clappers were passed down to others, until they were eventually returned to the Mission in 1959. In 1966, a remnant {{of one of the}} bells was discovered; details regarding where and how it was found have never been revealed.|$|R
60|$|The New-Englanders hid their {{prize in}} a shadowy nook, betwixt a large gray stone and the earthy roots of an overthrown tree; {{and when the}} {{campaign}} was ended, they conveyed our friend to Boston, and put him up at auction on the sidewalk of King Street. He was suspended, for the nonce, by a block and tackle, and being swung backward and forward, gave such loud and clear testimony to his own merits, that the auctioneer {{had no need to}} say a word. The highest bidder was a rich old representative from our town, who piously bestowed the bell on the meeting-house where he had been a worshipper for half a century. The good man had his reward. By a strange coincidence, the very first duty of the sexton, after the <b>bell</b> had been <b>hoisted</b> into the belfry, was to toll the funeral knell of the donor. Soon, however, those doleful echoes were drowned by a triumphant peal for the surrender of Quebec.|$|R
500|$|As the bell-making nears completion, Boriska’s {{confidence}} slowly transforms into a stunned, detached disbelief that he’s succeeded at the task. The work crew {{takes over}} as Boriska makes several attempts to {{fade into the}} background of the activity. Once the <b>bell</b> has been <b>hoisted</b> into its tower the Grand Prince and his entourage arrive for the inaugural ceremony as the bell is blessed by the priests. As the bell is prepared to be rung the royal entourage is overhead discussing their doubts that it will. It is revealed that Boriska and the work crew know if the bell fails to ring the Grand Prince will have them all beheaded. (It is also overheard that the Grand Prince had his brother, who raided Vladimir in The Raid sequence, beheaded.) There is a quiet, agonizing tension as the foreman slowly coaxes the bell's clapper back and forth, nudging it closer to the lip of the bell with each swing. A pan across the assembly reveals white-robed Durochka, leading a horse (preceded by a child, presumably hers) as she walks through the crowd. At the critical moment the bell rings perfectly, and she smiles. After the ceremony, Andrei finds Boriska collapsed on the ground, sobbing. [...] He admits his father never told him the secret of casting a bell. Andrei comforts him, breaking his vow of silence and telling the boy that they should carry on their work together: “You’ll cast bells. I’ll paint icons.” Andrei sees Durochka, the boy, and the horse walk off across a muddy field in the distance.|$|R
