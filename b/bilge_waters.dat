One {{of the most frequently}} observed behaviours in the stress-starvation response of gram-negative bacteria is the size reduction and cell morphology conversion from rod to resistant shape-form. In such framework, we report here on morphology (cell volume and cell shape) variations in psychrophilic strain Oleispira antarctica RB 8 T under different growth temperature and different hydrocarbons mixtures sources. Six different hydrocarbons mixtures (car commercial diesel, commercial crude oil engine; 2 different <b>bilge</b> <b>waters,</b> military jet fuel and crude oil) were used as single carbon source and two different cultivation temperatures (4 ° and 15 °C) were tested for 22 days. During incubation period, sub-aliquots of each bacterial culture were processed to estimate total bacterial abundance (DAPI count), variation of cell volume and morphological diversity (determination from digital photomicrographs using an image analysis program). Total bacterial abundance by DAPI staining showed an increase at both temperatures and in almost all substrates used in the first 18 days of experiment; after, values of bacterial abundance by DAPI counts showed a decrement of almost all cultures at both incubation temperatures. Overall, the mean cell volume decreased with increasing of temperature. Three morphological types of bacteria were identified: spiral bacteria (spirillae and curved rods), cocci and rods. The morphological analysis revealed that the spiral bacteria forms changed significantly in coccoid and rods shapes, in relation with the added substrates, except for the <b>bilge</b> <b>waters,</b> where spiral bacteria were mostly the dominant shape. The study of morphological and physiological variation of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria is a fundamental topic for the study of their potential use in the mitigation of oil spills phenomenon in cold environment...|$|E

40|$|Ships {{produce a}} large amount of oily wastewaters such as <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> which needs to be treated prior to being discharged. <b>Bilge</b> <b>water</b> is a very {{challenging}} wastewater to treat due to large variations in production rates and the complex nature of the wastes in solution. Ever increasing regulations are being imposed on the treatment and release of <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> to the environment. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a membrane process to remove oil and grease from <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> to a level where it could be discharged into sensitive environments. This work focused on five elements of study: (1) Evaluation of feasibility and performance of <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> treatment using a pilot scale microfiltration/ultrafiltration (MF/UF) hybrid membrane system; (2) Development of a pilot scale membrane cascade for selective removal of oil to 0 ppm or a non-detectable level from <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> while minimizing concentrate production; (3) Establishment of an analytical method to extract and analyze organic species at very low concentration levels for the analysis of oil and grease content found in <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> and membrane permeate; (4) Investigation of environmentally friendly membrane cleaning methods; and (5) Study of filtration mechanism in the treatment of <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> using ultrafiltration and microfiltration. Pilot scale membrane cascade systems were designed and tested for the treatment of synthetic <b>bilge</b> <b>water.</b> Experimental results showed that the pretreatment of this oily wastewater using microfiltration, prior to ultrafiltration, is desirable as used oils and particulates can block the feed channels of UF spiral and hollow fiber modules. Backflushing is an effective technique to reduce fouling caused by "sticky" cakes in synthetic <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> treatment using a microfiltration membrane. Membrane support structure was found to be critical in enhancing flux during backflushing. This work outlined the need for microfiltration membranes offering good particulate clearance to be used in backflushing coalescence applications. A pilot scale membrane hybrid system, consisting of a coalescing backflushed microfiltration membrane used as a pretreatment and an ultrafiltration membrane as a final polishing step, was found to be very effective in this application, producing permeate with oil and grease content well below the allowable discharge limit (15 ppm) for coastal waters. Another membrane cascade system using tubular MF and UF membranes in a first stage and flat sheet UF membranes in a second stage was found to be able to produce water containing below detectable levels of hexane extractable material. Permeates of various molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membranes from the cascade system were collected and analyzed using an extraction procedure followed by gas chromatography (GC). Analytical results showed that solid phase extraction using ENVI- 18 sorbent retained much of the organic matter found in the <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> and could not preserve the molecular weight distribution in the oil mixture used to prepare synthetic <b>bilge</b> <b>water.</b> n-Hexane liquid-liquid extraction technique was found to be able to preserve the molecular weight distribution of diesel and lubricating oils separated by ultrafiltration. The effect of membrane MWCO in separation of oil and grease was also studied in this work. Environmentally friendly physical membrane cleaning methods, such as backflushing with hot water or steam followed by pressurized air, were found effective in regenerating membrane flux for large pore KOCH carbon membranes in the treatment of synthetic <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> using a MF/UF hybrid system. The beneficial effects for steam cleaning were found to be evident. Optimal cycle times between physical cleanings were determined. Filtration mechanisms in the treatment of synthetic <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> were studied using four classical filtration models and a combined model. Experimental results of the research conducted in this study suggested that it is possible to achieve the target of removing oil from <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> to 0 ppm or non-detectable levels through the proper design of the membrane system, selection of appropriate membranes, determination of optimal operating parameters, and assessment of membrane performance...|$|R

40|$|Illegal {{discharge}} of <b>bilge</b> <b>waters</b> {{is a significant}} source of oil and other environmental pollutants in Canadian and international waters. Imaging satellites are commonly used to monitor large areas to detect oily discharges from vessels, off-shore platforms and other sources. While remotely sensed imagery provides a snap-shot picture useful for detecting a spill or the presence of vessels in the vicinity, it is difficult to directly associate a vessel to an observed spill unless the vessel is observed while the discharge is occurring. The situation then becomes more challenging with increased vessel traffic as multiple vessels may be associated with a spill event. By combining multiple sources of vessel location data, such as Automated Information Systems (AIS), Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) and SAR-based ship detection, with spill detections and drift models we have created a system that associates detected spill events with vessels in the area using a probabilistic model that intersects vessel tracks and spill drift trajectories in both time and space. Working with the Canadian Space Agency and the Canadian Ice Service’s Integrated Satellite Tracking of Pollution (ISTOP) program, we use spills observed in Canadian waters to demonstrate the investigative value of augmenting spill detections with temporally sequenced vessel and spill tracking information...|$|E
40|$|COD AND TPH ANALYSIS IN SLOPS EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT PLANTS: ANALYTICAL PROBLEMS. In {{the last}} years, the {{persistence}} and accumulation of xenobiotic compounds {{in the environment}} created many disposal problems of oily wastewater generated by ships, mainly in engine-rooms (<b>bilge</b> <b>waters)</b> and by cleaning of tanker (slops). The high salinity levels (up to 25. 000 mgL- 1) and the pollutants concentration, both limit the chances of discharge into the sewer systems and address the disposal of these wastewaters to the sea. For these reasons {{it is necessary to}} treat such wastewater efficiently before discharging [1]. As a part of a broader project concerning slops treatments, this work addresses issues related to the analytical methods of the COD and TPH parameters, chosen under the provisions of Italian Legislative Decree 152 / 06, that implements the European directives on environmental protection. In the COD analysis the greatest difficulty was the high salinity levels corresponding to high chlorides levels. Chlorides cause a positive interference in the measurement, and this interference during the analysis of COD was investigated at various concentrations of mercury {{in order to try to}} minimize the use of this reagent that causes many problems of safety and disposal, and at different times reaction [2][3][4]. The major problems in TPH analysis concerned correct setup of the gas chromatographic separation, high variability in sample composition and the high capacity of the sample to form emulsions during the liquid-liquid extraction procedure. This paper reports the results of the analysis of COD and TPH and the problems related to the development of a suitable analytical method for the analysis of these specimens. This study is part of STITAM European project, created with the aim to develop innovative technologies for the treatment of liquid wastes of navigation, in order to better safeguard marine environment.

The Directive of the European Parliament and Council 2000 / 59 /EB is addressed to the reduction of waste on board of ships and its wash overboard [...] Analysis of the ships entering Klaipėda Sea Port has estimated that oil waste comprises about 74 % of the whole collected waste amount. The analysis of technological flows and documents has indicated problematic points in the following processes: 1. collection of oily and engine <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> from ships; 2. collection of spilled overboard oil products; 3. exploitation of intermediate accumulative reservoirs in the port; 4. regular transportation of accumulated oily <b>water</b> engine <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> to the oil-polluted water treatment station; 5. distribution, storage, treatment (mechanical, physical, sorption) of pumped engine <b>bilge</b> <b>water.</b> Among oil polluted waste, its specific kind - oily water emerges in ports and it is called "engine bilge water" in the Waste Management Regulations. Engine <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> is specific and hazardous to the environment as it is a liquid compound of water and oil products capable of making steady emulsions. It also acquires specific properties during various technological processes. Equipment, technological processes, specificity of the control related to combustibility and inflammability, as well as conformity to the requirements of the International and EU Rights, technological processes management and documents are needed for the management of this specific waste. For this reason, separation of this oily water from the common oil-polluted waste and analysis of these streams of waste treatment are of great importance in enhancement of the effectiveness of environmental protection during the management process of this oily waste. Applying a system approach to the oily waste in the port, a waste management system algorithm based on the life cycle has been set up. The system of port waste management is a set of technological processes, each of them performing a certain function and demanding for stock, electric energy, fuel, transport, heat, technological equipment, etc. Having completed the analysis, the algorithm assessing the supervision of technological processes and documents of engine <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> management and a schematic diagram of the life cycle have been set up which make it possible:- to assess the supervision of formation, collection and utilization of oily and engine bilge water;- to effectively control energy and stock quantities supplied to each stage of a technological process;- to identify and assess the sources of the environmental pollution (ambient air, water, waste);- to foresee and evaluate the priority regions of optimization of engine <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> management. Having made the environmental assessment, it was suggested to convert the waste resulting from the engine <b>bilge</b> <b>water</b> treatment into the energy and to use it in a technological process when closing (finishing) the life-cycle. While exploiting ships and their mechanisms a particular type of waste is made – water which contains oil and its products. Such water is called oily-bilge water otherwise ballast waters, because of the accidental spillage during carrying out various technological processes sea water is polluted and thus a danger is caused to the environment. Oily-bilge water is particular water which contains different carbohydrates, fuel oil, lubricating oil, light benzene fractions etc. thus the cleaning of such water to a certain degree is hardly possible using traditional technologies. According to the previous scientific researches it was determined that oily water cleaning needs absorbing substances. There comes up a purpose to choose available sorbents, which are applicable widely in different technological processes. In the article investigation results were received with five absorbing substances (granular absorbent carbon, friable absorbent carbon, wood dust, wood sawdust and clay). The object of the research comprises the determinant of oily water cleaning degree and sorption effectiveness by using chosen methods.  ...|$|R
