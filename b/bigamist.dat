50|$|According to feminist {{historian}} Sara McDougall, the Christian European {{insistence on}} monogamy and its enforcement arose {{as a consequence}} of 16th Century Islamic incursions into Central Europe and the advent of European colonialism within the Americas, Africa, and Asia, which exposed European Christians to cultures that practised polygamy. As a consequence, nominal Christian male <b>bigamists</b> were subjected to unprecedented harsh punishments, such as execution, galley servitude, exile, and prolonged imprisonment.

40|$|In a {{computer}} search of 18 national newspapers {{over a three-year}} period (1993 – 1945) 420 mentions of bigamy were identified. 110 items (or 26 per cent) referred to 26 current criminal cases involving bigamy.

Two other cases included comments by judges. Using Phoenix's (1996) distinction between threats to the nation-state from 'inside' and 'outside', the analysis indicates that two issues of wider socio-political importance – familism and immigration – were central to the judges' comments reported in the press and produced an important counterpoise to the titillating features of these cases. It is argued that the newspaper reporting of bigamy constructs <b>bigamists</b> as being a threat to Britain from 'inside' to the institution of marriage, while the threat from 'outside' is from minority ethnic men marrying female <b>bigamists</b> to gain residential status in Britain.

25|$|In some countries, the {{registration}} {{of a marriage}} means that it cannot later be declared invalid, since it has been accepted by the government. In Taiwan, which follows {{a variation of the}} Napoleonic Code (received by way of Japan), the presumption is that each country maintains a central registry of its citizens, including their marital status. If a Taiwan citizen marries in another country, however, this information may not find its way into the records. Many thousands of ROC soldiers who came to Taiwan in 1949 left behind wives in mainland China, but married local Taiwanese women. Since the two polities did not share records, the result was a pattern of legally recognized second marriages, despite the ban on polygamy by both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Today, foreigners wishing to marry Taiwan citizens must present letters from their countries' representative offices testifying that they are not already married.

40|$|The Northern Mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), {{the state}} bird of Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas, is noted for the highly complex and melodious springtime song of males. It {{is ideal for}} {{studying}} mate choice and breeding success because the flamboyant male song is surprising in a socially monogamous bird. I conducted a three year study of mating and breeding success {{to test the hypothesis}} that male song, measured as mean bout length and versatility, could be explained by high rates of extra-pair matings, something which has been found in many other apparently monogamous birds. However, I found that extra-pair fertilization accounted for only 3. 1 % of all young, so my initial hypothesis was disproved. Because song could not be explained by extra-pair fertilization, I investigated the role of this and other variables in mockingbird mate choice and breeding success. The additional variables included: four initial dates in the breeding season, prior-year experience, age, singing frequency, territory quality measured as amounts of shrubbery, three measures of size, three measures of white plumage areas, condition measured as subdermal fat amounts, and blood and gut parasitemia. I looked at the role of these characters in mate choice by comparing mated and unmated males in two years and found that amounts of white plumage, weight, wing lengths, first date sighted on territory, first date heard to sing, blood parasitemia, age, and territory quality were different (P $<$ 0. 10) in one or both years. In 1993, 26. 1 % of mated males were <b>bigamists</b> (1992 : 6. 5 %) who differed from monogamous males in first date heard singing and blood parasitemia. Females prefer older, larger, healthier males with good territories.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The adaptiveness of {{polygyny}} in passerines poses {{a particularly}} intriguing problem. The altricial young {{of this group}} require extended parental care, but young of polygynous pairings generally lack the undivided attention of the male which young of monogamous pairings receive. Polygynous offspring may thus be undernourished and experience greater mortality. Hence, the selection for polygyny in populations where unmated males are available suggests that an uneven distribution of ecological factors affecting breeding success permits females settling in excellent habitat to raise more offspring unassisted by a polygynous male than can be produced with full male cooperation in a less suitable area. This study's central objective {{was to determine if}} male Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) pairing success was correlated with specific ecological factors within their territories, and if territory to territory differences in quality were sufficient to account for the selection of this mating pattern. In addition, I examined those adaptive modifications of breeding biology and parental behavior which served to minimize reproductive failure at nests not attended by males. Measures of various structural features of the vegetation were made at 1921 randomly-located sample points within an 11. 3 ha sedge-grass meadow in south central Wisconsin. The data from sample points falling within bachelor-occupied territories were grouped and statistically compared with values from territories of other mating classes, and with values from 388 sample points which surrounded nest cups. In addition, the breeding biology {{of a large number of}} color-banded individuals was intensively studied over five breeding seasons. These observations included carefully standardized recordings of adult time-budgetings. Morphological and behavioral differences between males and inter-territorial differences in food abundance were of minor importance in female mate choice compared to the enormous habitat disparities between different territory classes. Areas defended by bachelors, monogamists, <b>bigamists</b> and trigamists differed significantly in the density of large forbs which provided the only satisfactory nest concealment at the time nesting commenced. Furthermore, significant (P < 0. 01) discrepancies existed between these territories in the distribution and abundance of almost all habitat features characterizing nesting ares (per cent coverage of grasses, sedges and forbs, shading properties of the vegetation, and the vegetative foliage height profile). Bachelor territories were deficient in features important in female nest site selection and were thus unsatisfactory for breeding. The quality of monogamous and bigamous territories was improved over that in bachelor holdings, and trigamists occupied the most satisfactory habitat. Thus, when some males are forced into habitats too marginal for successful breeding, this polygynous system grants each female an opportunity to nest in a satisfactory location. Bobolink males generally assisted only their first (primary) female in feeding and brooding nestlings. A number of interrelated adaptations (the adaptive complex) functioned to circumvent heavy reproductive failure at secondary nests, where males did not aid. Secondary clutch sizes were significantly smaller than primary egg sets. This, combined with asynchronous hatching which promoted rapid brood reduction, brought brood size into correspondence with food transfer capabilities of secondary females. Moreover, male flexibility in feeding unusually large secondary broods and in caring for secondary nestlings late in the season increased secondary nesting success. Two of a series of other adaptive patterns were: (1) an optimization of the food delivery tempo of primary pairs, which probably extended breeding longevity; (2) a postponement of energy expenditure by yearling males in territorial and sexual advertisement behavior until special circumstances permitted opportunistic establishment in good habitat. This decreased unnecessary competition with older, experienced males...|$|R
