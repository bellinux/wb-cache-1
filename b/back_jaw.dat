500|$|Necrid is a bald, green, {{and muscular}} humanoid. His eyes glow bright red, and short bones {{protrude}} {{from his left}} arm, <b>back,</b> <b>jaw</b> and a Mohawk-like ridge on his head. The fingers on his right hand have claw points, but his left hand is much larger and has three fingers with large, talon-like bone claws. Two large, ram-like horns extend from opposite sides of his left wrist, toward and slightly beyond his elbow. His clothing consists of dark blue pants, large metal sandals held together by bandages, and armor plating covering his abdomen, {{the sides of his}} legs, and the back of his lower right arm. A pulsating red jewel described by McFarlane as a [...] "power plant" [...] is set in a circular piece of metal strapped to his chest. At about feet (196cm), Necrid is the second tallest Soul series character whose height is known.|$|E

In March 2008, after playing only 45 games over four years, Jacobs announced his retirement from AFL football because of a degenerative hip problem.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scarcity}} {{of the new}} toy provoked a [...] "shopping frenzy". Two women were arrested in Chicago for fighting over the doll, while in New York some people ran after delivery trucks hoping {{to get their hands}} on Elmo before it reached stores. Someone allegedly purchased a Tickle Me Elmo for $7,100 in Denver. A clerk working at a Wal-Mart store in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada was among those injured by [...] "Elmo-mania". During a Midnight Madness sale on December 14, a crowd of 300 stampeded down the aisle after spotting him being handed a box of the toys by another employee. Trampled, he suffered [...] "a pulled hamstring, injuries to his <b>back,</b> <b>jaw</b> and knee, a broken rib and a concussion".|$|E

60|$|Ide's {{trembling}} suddenly ceased. The color {{came back}} to his face, and he straightened his <b>back.</b> His <b>jaw</b> went forward half an inch, and a gleam came into his eye. He pushed back his battered hat with one hand, and extended the other, with levelled fingers, toward the lawyer. He took a long breath and then laughed sardonically.|$|R

60|$|He {{made one}} {{desperate attempt to}} pull out on the trail. But the moment he left the {{protection}} of the fire, the boldest wolf leaped for him, but leaped short. He saved himself by springing <b>back,</b> the <b>jaws</b> snapping together a scant six inches from his thigh. The rest of the pack was now up and surging upon him, and a throwing of firebrands right and left was necessary to drive them back to a respectful distance.|$|R
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) looks chunky {{and has a}} long condyloid {{process at}} its back; that of T.talamancae is more slender. The capsular process, a projection at the <b>back</b> of the <b>jaw</b> which houses {{the root of the}} lower incisor, is poorly developed.|$|R
60|$|With a cry so frightful, so bestial, that it {{momentarily}} paralyzed {{the startled}} Dango, the great ape launched his mighty bulk upon the surprised hyena. With a cry and a snarl, Dango, crushed to earth, turned to tear at his assailant; but as effectively might a sparrow turn upon a hawk. Taug's great, gnarled fingers closed upon the hyena's throat and <b>back,</b> his <b>jaws</b> snapped {{once on the}} mangy neck, crushing the vertebrae, and then he hurled the dead body contemptuously aside.|$|R
25|$|Scansoriopteryx is also {{notable for}} its wide, rounded jaws. The lower jaw {{contained}} at least twelve teeth, larger {{in the front}} of the jaws than in the <b>back.</b> The lower <b>jaw</b> bones may have been fused together, a feature otherwise known only in the oviraptorosaurs.|$|R
50|$|The {{teeth of}} Panphagia {{indicate}} a possible omnivorous diet, transitional in form between the mostly carnivorous theropods and the herbivorous sauropodomorphs.

50|$|The suprangular or surangular is a jaw bone {{found in}} most land vertebrates, except mammals. Usually in the <b>back</b> of the <b>jaw,</b> on the upper edge, it is {{connected}} to all other jaw bones: dentary, angular, splenial and articular. It is often a muscle attachment site.|$|R

50|$|The manatee {{does not}} have incisors or canine teeth, only cheek teeth (molars).

6000|$|... "Oh, Lord!" [...] groaned Good; and, {{as was his}} {{way when}} perplexed, {{he put his hand}} to his false teeth, {{dragging}} the top set down and allowing them to fly <b>back</b> to his <b>jaw</b> with a snap. It was a most fortunate move, for next second the dignified crowd of Kukuanas uttered a simultaneous yell of horror, and bolted back some yards.|$|R
50|$|Between 800,000 and 200,000 years ago. Teeth of Homo heidelbergensis were {{arranged}} {{in the jaw}} so that they formed a parabolic shape (curved at the front). The teeth were also smaller than those of earlier species but still larger than those of modern humans. Some members of this species possessed a gap called a retromolar space, behind the wisdom teeth at the <b>back</b> of the <b>jaw.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{daughter}} of Adela and John Hawke Grayson, Grayson {{was born on}} the family farm near Moose Jaw. She began painting as a young girl, and was given lessons by a local artist named Gertrude Rorason. After she married Arthur J. Mann in 1929, she moved to Summerland, British Columbia. Grayson moved <b>back</b> to Moose <b>Jaw</b> in 1961 and later died there {{at the age of}} 100.|$|R
50|$|Vopat {{started his}} playing career {{in his native}} Litv√≠nov, before {{spending}} a season in the Western Hockey League with the Moose Jaw Warriors, joining the Blues' IHL affiliate the Peoria Rivermen for their playoff run during the 1994-95 season.

50|$|The Amazonian manatee lacks nails on its flippers, {{setting it}} {{apart from other}} manatees. An almost unique feature (amongst mammals) of the manatee is the {{constant}} replacement of molar teeth; new teeth enter at the <b>back</b> of the <b>jaw</b> and replace old and worn teeth at the front. The order's closest relatives, the elephants, also have teeth that get replaced, but have only a limited set of these replacement teeth.|$|R
5000|$|... ‚Äò‚ÄôDatonglong‚Äô‚Äô was {{described}} as a new genus because of its unique dental structures. In the middle and <b>back</b> of the <b>jaw</b> are two functional teeth in each tooth position. Further, the main ridge of the tooth on the inner side is situated more to the back, while the secondary ridge is well developed. There are no further vertical ridges. The top of the tooth crown is bent slightly backwards.|$|R
500|$|Nordby spent a {{significant}} amount of time shooting [...] "the articulating jaw" [...] scene because they had [...] "ultimate control over how the light was hitting the head". He said, [...] "This so-called jaw shot became a pivotal point, because for four months of the post, the filmmakers thought the film was getting too scary so MPC pulled <b>back</b> on the <b>jaw</b> and then they thought it wasn't scary enough." [...] Because of this, [...] "they pushed <b>back</b> and this <b>jaw</b> went <b>back</b> and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. [...] "From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did", said Norby, [...] "there was a lot of work figuring out how to make this a scary film as well as a funny film." [...] Since the team was on a small budget, they [...] "relied more on skilled artists to think through shots rather than a brute force approach".|$|R
60|$|The {{short stories}} were {{returned}} in similar fashion. He read {{them over and}} over, and liked them {{so much that he}} could not puzzle out the cause of their rejection, until, one day, he read in a newspaper that manuscripts should always be typewritten. That explained it. Of course editors were so busy that they could not afford the time and strain of reading handwriting. Martin rented a typewriter and spent a day mastering the machine. Each day he typed what he composed, and he typed his earlier manuscripts as fast as they were returned him. He was surprised when the typed ones began to come <b>back.</b> His <b>jaw</b> seemed to become squarer, his chin more aggressive, and he bundled the manuscripts off to new editors.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{spending}} almost {{their entire}} lives underground, and having very poor eyesight, Cape mole-rats exhibit distinct diurnal rhythms {{in time with the}} hours of daylight on the surface, and are primarily nocturnal. Unlike some other species of mole-rat, they are solitary animals, and, except when a female is raising young, only one individual inhabits each burrow system. They are highly aggressive towards other members of their own species outside the breeding season. When encountering a rival, they adopt a rigid posture with the head thrown <b>back</b> and <b>jaws</b> open, chattering their teeth and occasionally making short leaps in the direction of their opponent. Because burrow systems can approach within 2 m of each other, burrowing animals warn away rivals using sex-specific seismic signals.|$|R
500|$|Schwimmer and G. Dent Williams {{proposed}} in 1996 that Deinosuchus may have preyed on marine turtles. Deinosuchus {{would probably have}} used the robust, flat teeth near the <b>back</b> of its <b>jaws</b> to crush the turtle shells. The [...] "side-necked" [...] sea turtle Bothremys was especially common in the eastern habitat of Deinosuchus, and several of its shells have been found with bite marks that were most likely inflicted by the giant crocodilian.|$|R
50|$|Draenei have skin {{ranging from}} purple to pale blue, and both genders are {{relatively}} tall compared to humans, have cloven goat-like hooves, tails that {{resemble those of}} a lizard, and dark hair. Males often have tentacle-like appendages extending from their chin, and occasionally large, complex structures on their forehead, while females have two horns on their temples extending backwards and thinner versions of the male's appendages hanging from behind the <b>back</b> of the <b>jaw.</b>|$|R

50|$|Occurring from sea-level to {{mountain}} tops, it is a fast-moving diurnal {{snake and}} an active predator on small frogs, lizards and mammals. Its common name, meaning 'sheep stabber' or 'sheep stinger', is misleading as its small teeth are set so far <b>back</b> in the <b>jaw</b> and its neurotoxic venom is so mild, {{that it is}} incapable of killing any large animal. It has a gentle disposition, being reluctant to bite even when provoked.|$|R
50|$|The describers {{established}} three autapomorphies, unique derived traits. The crest on {{the lower}} jaws is curved to the back. The crest is deeper than its base, measured from the front to the back, is wide. The crest is four times deeper than the <b>back</b> of the <b>jaw.</b> Two other diagnostic traits were indicated: the inner side of the lower jaw is thickened, causing a convex curvature; the inner side shows some shallow, but well-demarcated, depressions.|$|R
