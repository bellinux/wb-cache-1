[...] Unfazed, Claire follows Gillian home, telling her that she doesn't want to hire her but rather enable her to achieve. She notices that Gillian has been sick for quite some time and is unable to get treatment because of her lack of health insurance and money, so she takes care of her insurance and sets her a visit to a doctor for a complete checkup.|$|E

25|$|Rasputin's {{influence}} over the royal family was used against him and the Romanovs by politicians and journalists who wanted to weaken {{the integrity of the}} dynasty, force the Tsar to give up his absolute political power and separate the Russian Orthodox Church from the state.

Nobles in influential positions around the Tsar, as well as some parties of the Duma, clamored for Rasputin's removal from the court.
