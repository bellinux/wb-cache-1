50|$|Traditionally, {{the walls}} are made of yotojoro - a wattle and daub of mud, hay and dried canes, but some Wayuu now use more modern {{construction}} with cement and other materials. The preferred material for roofing and yotojoro wood is the dagger cactus (Stenocereus griseus), which the Wayuu call yosú. The word yotojoro originally referred to the cane-like inner wood of the yosú cactus. This plant is used for many other purposes: it is planted to create living fences around pastures; young shoots are fed to goats; the fruit (iguaraya) is similar to pitahaya and is a popular food among the Wayuu. Because the demand for yosú as food and wood is seasonal, at times there is little fruit, building material or even cuttings for fences. It has thus been proposed to develop techniques for the Wayuu to cultivate it. Due to varying supply of yosú wood for construction, other plants are also used, including trupillo or turpío (Prosopis juliflora), jattá (Haematoxylum <b>brasiletto),</b> kapchip (Capparis zeylandica) and kayush (Peruvian Apple Cactus, Cereus repandus).|$|E
50|$|The {{three main}} {{vegetation}} classifications are low height rainforest, medium height rainforest (as per {{the size of}} the trees), oak-pine forest and meadows. Medium height deciduous rainforest is mostly located {{on either side of the}} canyon, in the north and east of the part towards San Fernando and in the Cañada Muñiz at altitudes of between 150 and 1250 masl. It is mostly found in areas with basalt or granite rock and where there are lime deposits, covering an area of 11,382 hectares in total. While many plants here loose leaves in the dry season, there are some that retain them year round. Maximum height of trees varies between twenty five and thirty meters. The density of the tree cover in these areas is enough to lower temperatures on the ground in the summer rainy season due to the maximum foliage which occurs at this time. The tree cover is composed of the following species, breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclocarpum), totoposte (Licania arbórea), jocotillo (Astronium graveolens), cedar (Cedrela odorata), cuaulote blanco (Luehea candida), hormiguillo (Platymiscium dimorphandrum), chicozapote (Manilkara zapota), tempisque (Mastichodendron capiri) and various types of amate fig trees (Ficus spp.). Under the tree cover, there is significant plant diversity including palms and araceas. Epiphytes (air plants) are abundant as well, along with orchids, bromeliaceae and cactus. Cactus are primarily found on the vertical walls of the canyon and belong to the Ancanthocereus family. In the 1970s, tree area in a good state of conservation amounted to 3,818 hectares or 17.72% of the total land area. From 1988 to 1993, this amount was reduced to 1107 hectares or 5.35%. From 1990 to 2000, it is estimated that eight percent of the remaining forests and 38% of the rainforests were damaged. Many of the areas in good condition are broken up by disturbed areas. Most of the damage is due to illegal logging and the clearing of land for pasture or agriculture. Medium height perennial rainforest (also known as evergreen cloud forest) exists only in small dispersed patches, mostly on the sides of the canyon in contact with the Grijalva River. Many of these patches are under a hectare in size as they are located on small areas of flat land at an altitude of between 1000 and 2,500 masl. The soils are rich in un-decomposed plant matter which hold in moisture.Low height deciduous rainforest is mostly found around the La Ceiba and La Coyota lookout points in the south and southeast sections of the park, with some in the east towards the La Chacona Cañada. These occupy a territory of 4,404 hectares in the park. Tree heights extend from four to ten meters with some as high as fifteen meters. Non tree species are not as common and mostly consist of succulent species such as Agave, Opuntia, Stenocereus and Cephalocereus. Other important species include Alvaradoa amorphoides, Bursera simaruba, Ceiba acuminate, Bursera bipinnata, Bursera excels, Cochlospermum vitifolium, Haematoxylon <b>brasiletto,</b> Piscidia piscipula, Swietenia humilis, Acacia collinsii and Pseudobombax ellipticum.Pine/oak forests exist in the northwest of the park in the highest altitudes, covering about 87 hectares. They are part of the same type of forest found in the Soyaló region it is adjacent to. They are found at an altitude of 1,200 masl and above in areas that receive precipitation of about 1500 mm per year. The most common species is the oak called Quercus conspersa, often found mixed with the two kinds of rainforest found in the park. Air plants are common here as well as bromeliads, orchids and plants from the Maxillaria, Lycaste, Cattleya and Laelia groups.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} chemical composition, digestibility and in vitro digestion parameters in ten legume tree foliage using the in vitro gas-production method with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG). The foliages with higher protein content (P< 0. 001) (167. 1 to 180. 3 g/kg DM) were A. cochliacantha, L. esculenta, E. cyclocarpum and A. farnesiana; from the total phenols (P< 0. 001) (365. 9 to 680. 6 g/kg DM) L. divaricata, H. <b>brasiletto</b> and C. coriaria and condensed tannins (P< 0. 001) (35. 4 to 88. 0 g/kg DM) E. cyclocarpum, A. farnesiana, P. dulce, P. acatlense and G. sepium. The in vitro dry matter digestibility was different (P< 0. 001) among the foliages. The in vitro gas production (IVGP), in vitro organic matter digestibility, metabolizable energy (ME), gas yield (GY 24 h), short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and microbial mass production (PMM), were different (P< 0. 0001) among the foliage {{as a result of the}} species. The use of PEG increased (P< 0. 0001) IVGP, ME, GY 24 h and SCFA in H <b>brasiletto,</b> C. coriaria, L. esculenta and A. cochliacantha, but affect (P< 0. 0001) the partition factor and the PMM. The nutritional composition and fermentation parameters in vitro between foliages differ by effect of tree and use of PEG. It is concluded that chemical composition in the foliages affect the digestibility and fermentation parameters and use of PEG increased fermentation parameters in the foliages high in secondary compounds...|$|E
40|$|Many {{plants are}} not commercially {{produced}} {{due to a}} lack of accessible information on their horticultural requirements and landscape potential. Members of the Legume Family (Leguminosae) are often conspicuous components of the vegetation of arid and semi-arid subtropical regions.

Coursetia glandulosa, Erythrina flabelliformis, Eysenhardtia orthocarpa, Haematoxylon <b>brasiletto,</b> Lysiloma watsonii, Pithecellobium mexicanum, and Sophora arizonica are woody legumes native to the Sonoran Desert region which offer a variety of form, texture, color and function. All of these plants grow readily from scarified seed. E. flabelliformis and E. orthocarpa are easy to propagate from stem cuttings. Some irrigation is necessary for establishment and reasonable growth in the landscape. Maintenance and pests are minimal. Freezing temperatures are the primary limiting factor to several of the plants. S. arizonica is slow growing and is prone to rot in the nursery...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the effect of fodder tree species (FTS) with condensed tannin contents: Cordia elaeagnoides, Platymiscium lasiocarpum, Vitex mollis, and Haematoxylon <b>brasiletto,</b> on in vitro methane (CH 4) production at 24 h post incubation. The analysis was performed using the in vitro gas production technique, with three levels of inclusion/species: 600, 800, and 1, 000 mg and with 4 replicates/species/level of inclusion. The substrate was incubated at 39 °C, and the gas and CH 4 production were recorded at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h post incubation. The data collected was analyzed through Pearson correlation, polinomial regression and fixed effects models. There were negative correlations between FTS-total gas volume (r = − 0. 40; p 32. 7 %), {{taking into account the}} total CH 4 production at 24 h of the forage used as reference (Avena sativa). It’s suggested that C. elaeagnoides-according to its crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and condensed tannins content- is the best alternative within the FTS analyzed, for feeding ruminants and for the control of CH 4 emissions during the dry season...|$|E
30|$|Brazilwood {{has been}} {{extensively}} found in books of hours from the 15 th– 16 th c., and in the Galician-Portuguese Ajuda songbook, possibly dated from the 13 th c. [5, 11, 12] and is extracted from a tree, Caesalpinia sappan or other brazilwood species brought to Europe from Brazil from the 16 th c. onwards (Caesalpinia echinata, Caesalpinia brasiliensis, Caesalpinia violacea, Caesalpinia crista, and Haematoxylum <b>brasiletto)</b> [18]. Kermes was obtained from a small insect, Kermes vermilio, found in the kermes oak, Quercus coccifera L. Other important historical sources of red derived from the resin secreted from the female lac insect, Kerria lacca, from which are obtained both the lac dye and the shellac resin. It was applied as a dark red or pink colour in Portuguese manuscripts and it is characteristic of the Romanesque monastic production (12 th– 13 th c) [1, 10]. In the 16 th c. most of these sources were replaced by the red and scarlet colours of the American cochineal, Dactylopius coccus, commercialized by the Spanish empire [23].

40|$|The thesis summarises {{results from}} four studies in dry forests of Nicaragua aiming to gain {{knowledge}} supporting conservation and rehabilitation efforts in these highly threatened forests. In the first study, tree species composition, structure {{and diversity of}} dry deciduous and gallery forests {{was carried out in}} Chacocente National Wildlife Refuge during 1994 and 2000. A total of 29 families, 49 genera and 59 species were represented in 2 ha permanent plots in dry deciduous forest during 1994 and 2000 assessments. In the gallery forest, the number of families, genera and species recorded in 2000 inventory was 33, 48 and 58, respectively, and slightly higher than the 1994 inventory. The number of stems ≥ 10 cm dbh varied from 451 (1994) to 489 (2000) per ha in the deciduous forest, and from 283 (2000) to 298 (1994) per ha in the gallery forest. The gallery forest was found to be more diverse than the deciduous forest using Fisher’s diversity index. In the second study, the temporal and spatial variation in seedling and sapling population densities of Gyroscarpus americanus, Calycophyllum candidissimum, Haematoxylon <b>brasiletto</b> and Cedrela odorata were investigated in the dry forest in Chacocente National Wildlife Refuge for three consecutive years. The density of seedlings and saplings varied significantly over time and among species. The overall density of recruits was higher for G. americanus and C. candidissimum compared with H. <b>brasiletto</b> and C. odorata. The net change in population density of seedlings and saplings was positive for C. candidissimum only, indicating a continuous and advanced regeneration. For the two most abundant species, G. americanus and C. candidissimum, the population density of recruits varied with respect to slope of the terrain and crown exposure to direct sunlight, thus resulted in clumped pattern of regeneration. The third study dealt with soil seed bank assembly following secondary succession on abandoned agricultural fields in a chronosequence of 4 to 14 years. The species composition of the seed bank and seed density varied significantly with increasing age of abandonment. A total of 3, 5 and 9 species were found on sites abandoned 4, 9 and 14 years ago, respectively. The total number of seeds ranged from 327 in the 4 -year old site to 146 in the 14 -year old site, and the density of viable seeds ranged from 141 seeds m- 2 in the 4 -year old site to 22 seeds m- 2 in the 14 -year old site. In the fourth study, seed germination responses of C. candidissimum, C. odorata and Guaiacum sanctum, to different constant and alternating temperature regimes under continuous light or darkness in the laboratory, and the effect of canopy cover on seedling survival of C. odorata and G. sanctum in the field were investigated. Among the species tested, germination of C. candidissimum seeds was positively photoblastic, and for all species the optimal temperature for germination was 20 - 25 ºC. Survival of G. sanctum seedlings was higher in all three sites, but the relative growth rate in collar diameter was higher in open sites. Survival was poor for C. odorata...|$|E
