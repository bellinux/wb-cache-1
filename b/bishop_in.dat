5|$|After Foliot's failed {{candidacy}} as <b>bishop,</b> <b>in</b> February 1216 John {{appointed him}} to the benefice of Colwall in Herefordshire, the king having {{the ability to make}} the appointment because Giles de Braose, the Bishop of Hereford, who would normally have made the appointment, had recently died.

5|$|After the {{transfer}} of Louisiana to the United States, the Spanish had ended subsidies to the Catholic Church in St. Louis. As a result, Catholics in St. Louis had no resident priest until the arrival of Louis William Valentine Dubourg in early January 1818.

These <b>bishops</b> <b>in</b> turn largely consecrated new <b>bishops</b> <b>in</b> their respective countries, effectively erasing other episcopal lines.|$|R
5|$|Bishop Short later founded St Peter's Cathedral, an Anglican church, in 1869.
