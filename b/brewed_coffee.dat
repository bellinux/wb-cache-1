25|$|<b>Brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> from typical grounds {{prepared}} with tap water contains 40mg caffeine per 100 gram and no essential nutrients in significant content. In espresso, however, {{likely due to}} its higher amount of suspended solids, there are significant contents of magnesium, the B vitamins, niacin and riboflavin, and 212mg of caffeine per 100 grams of grounds.|$|E

25|$|The first Starbucks {{store was}} located in Seattle at 2000 Western Avenue from 1971–1976. This cafe was later moved to 1912 Pike Place; never to be {{relocated}} again. During this time, the company only sold roasted whole coffee beans and did not yet brew coffee to sell. The only <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee</b> served in the store were free samples. During {{their first year of}} operation, they purchased green coffee beans from Peet's, then began buying directly from growers.|$|E

The Cunningham & Walsh spot aired yearly until 1998, then in edited form in 2004 and 2005.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{products}} are sold {{for the convenience}} of consumers who do not want to prepare their own coffee or who {{do not have access to}} coffeemaking equipment. Instant coffee is dried into soluble powder or freeze-dried into granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water. Originally invented in 1907, it rapidly gained in popularity in many countries in the post-war period, with Nescafé being the most popular product. Many consumers determined that the convenience in preparing a cup of instant coffee more than made up for a perceived inferior taste, although, since the late 1970s, instant coffee has been produced differently in such a way that is similar to the taste of freshly <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee.</b> Paralleling (and complementing) the rapid rise of instant coffee was the coffee vending machine invented in 1947 and widely distributed since the 1950s.|$|E

It was first unveiled in New York City with subsequent testing of the product also in Seattle, Chicago, and London. The first two VIA flavors include Italian Roast and Colombia, which were then rolled out in October 2009, across the U.S. and Canada with Starbucks stores promoting the product with a blind [...] "taste challenge" [...] of the instant versus fresh roast, in which many people could not tell the difference between the instant and fresh <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee.</b> Analysts speculated that by introducing instant coffee, Starbucks would devalue its own brand.|$|E

The men are paid annually by the treasurer of the Hajj-caravan. They are supposed to be relieved after seven years; but they have wives and families; and, like the British soldier in India half a century ago, they are content to pass their working lives in local service. The commandant showed us over his castle, which was in excellent order; and <b>brewed</b> <b>coffee,</b> which we drank in the cool porch of the single gate.

5000|$|Nitro cold <b>brew</b> <b>coffee,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "NCB," [...] is cold <b>brew</b> <b>coffee</b> charged with nitrogen to give it a rich, creamy head, similar to nitro draft beer like Guinness. Though many lighter beers are infused with carbon dioxide, darker stouts are infused with nitrogen, extracting sweet flavors and a smooth finish from the beer. This is a direct effect of nitrogen bubbles being smaller in size than those of carbon dioxide, making it harder for the water in either beer or coffee to dissolve and resulting in a beverage with a thicker [...] "mouthfeel." [...] The nitrogen effect also cuts the acidity that is tied to traditional cold brew, making it easier on the stomach.|$|R
