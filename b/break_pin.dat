40|$|Abstract. Friction stir {{processing}} (FSP) of cast AM 60 {{magnesium alloy}} {{has been studied}} using the <b>breaking</b> <b>pin</b> method, freezing the microstructure during the process. Strong evidence is seen that partial melting {{plays a key role}} in removing the Î²-Mg 17 Al 12, whereas the manganese rich intermetallics persist during FSP. This is consistent with temperature predictions made using a process model adapted to FSP of AM 60 castings that show the eutectic melting point is exceeded...|$|R

50|$|The act of <b>breaking</b> a <b>pin</b> is unpinning. This can be {{executed}} {{in a number}} of ways: the piece creating the pin can be captured; another unit can be moved onto the line of the pin; or the unit to which a piece is pinned can be moved.|$|R

40|$|In {{monolayer}} {{transition metal}} dichalcogenides (TMDs), electrons in opposite $K$ valleys {{are subject to}} opposite effective Zeeman fields, which {{are referred to as}} Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC) fields. The Ising SOC, originated from in-plane mirror symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>pins</b> the electron spins in out-of-plane directions, and results in the newly discovered Ising superconducting states with strongly enhanced upper critical fields. In this work, we show that the Ising SOC generates equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with spin polarization in the in-plane directions. Importantly, the spin-triplet Cooper pairs can induce superconducting pairings in a half-metal wire placed on top of the TMD and result in a topological superconductor with Majorana end states. Direct ways to detect equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs and the differences between Ising superconductors and Rashba superconductors are discussed. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures.

50|$|Pinning of a {{stock to}} a {{particular}} strike can be exploited by options traders. One way is to sell both a put and a call struck at the pinned value. As noted above, stocks can <b>break</b> their <b>pin</b> and move off the strike, so the trader must keep a careful eye on his positions.|$|R
5000|$|Black <b>breaks</b> the <b>pin</b> on the h4-d8 {{diagonal}} {{and forms}} a pin {{of his own}} on the c3 knight (exploiting {{the absence of the}} White's queen bishop from the queenside). If Black later plays dxc4, there may be threats against the g5-bishop. Note that 5.cxd5 cannot win a pawn because of the Elephant Trap. The main line continues 7.Nd2 Bb4 with the threat of ...Ne4 and pressure along the a5-e1 diagonal.|$|R

5000|$|Formerly, 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 was {{the main}} line of the Najdorf, when White threatens to attack the [...] knight with 8.e5. Black can simply <b>break</b> the <b>pin</b> with 7...Be7, when White usually plays 8.Qf3 and 9.0-0-0. Some of Black's {{alternatives}} are 7...Qb6, the Poisoned Pawn Variation popularized by Fischer, and 7...b5, the Polugaevsky Variation, which has the tactical point 8.e5 dxe5 9.fxe5 Qc7! 10.exf6 Qe5+ winning the bishop {{in return for the}} knight.|$|R
50|$|The mini-DIN pins, being weak, {{sometimes}} bend. This {{can result}} {{in the loss of}} colour or other corruption (or loss) in the signal. A bent pin can be forced back into shape, but this carries the risk of the <b>pin</b> <b>breaking</b> off.|$|R
50|$|Jerry then {{waves at}} Tom from the pins, and Tom grabs {{a bowling ball}} to throw, but Tom lets go in the air, and the ball lands on his back. Jerry laughs, but Tom then throws the ball successfully, making Jerry, hiding behind a pin, jiggle. Tom then bowls the pins down as Jerry clings onto the first pin, jumping out of the way. After Tom's fifth ball <b>breaks</b> the <b>pin,</b> Jerry hides behind another as Tom {{converts}} a split.|$|R
50|$|The {{material}} of a shear pin is selected and treated {{so that it}} is relatively resistant to fatigue (material). That is, when subjected to small forces, each one insufficient to <b>break</b> the <b>pin,</b> the pin does not retain damage. If material fatigue were to weaken a shear pin, the pin could potentially be broken by a force smaller than the original threshold force causing the mechanism to operate unintentionally, or a safety shear <b>pin</b> to <b>break</b> during normal operation of the machinery it protects.|$|R
50|$|Downward {{pressure}} on the spider presses down {{on the head of}} the fuze, <b>breaks</b> a shear <b>pin,</b> and inverts a belleville spring, flipping the striker downwards into a stab sensitive detonator, triggering the mine. The M4 version of the mine has two secondary fuze wells so that anti-handling devices can be fitted.|$|R
5|$|The next match {{featured}} Chris Benoit {{defending the}} United States Championship against Chavo Guerrero (accompanied by Vickie Guerrero). Before {{the bell rang}} to start the match, Chavo tried to attack Benoit, but as the match began, Benoit retaliated by delivering a clothesline. Benoit and Guerrero wrestled inconclusively until Benoit covered Chavo to try to pin him. Chavo managed to place his foot {{on top of the}} bottom rope, which forced Benoit to <b>break</b> the <b>pin</b> per official wrestling match rules. While Guerrero was lying on his stomach, Benoit applied the Sharpshooter, and made Chavo submit to retain the championship.|$|R
5000|$|Adding coins to {{increase}} your [...] "health" [...] did little to revive your wrestler after a lengthy beating or even increase his chances of kicking out of a pin. Also, as the game progressed, the computer opponents became more difficult to beat, the CPU's illegal partner constantly <b>breaking</b> your <b>pins</b> and submissions. However, pinfall victories in these harder levels can still be achieved after performing {{a certain number of}} pin attempts. If you move {{all the way up the}} ranks and win the Championship Title you then defend it against the computer who becomes even more difficult.|$|R

50|$|Jim {{tries to}} reform his ways and begins {{by taking a}} job testing aircraft, even {{conducting}} dangerous flights as {{he wants to give}} Ann a real home. Gunner remains true to his friend. One day, Gunner accompanies Jim on a test flight of a new bomber (an early Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress prototype). Upon reaching 30,000 feet, something goes wrong; the bomber goes into a spin and sandbags (substituting for the weight of bombs) <b>break</b> loose, <b>pinning</b> Gunner. Unwilling to bail out without his buddy, Jim manages to crash land, and pulls a badly injured Gunner out of the wreckage right before it burst into flames; but it is too late for Gunner. When Jim realizes the toll his job has taken on his wife, he gives it up.|$|R
25|$|Early torpedoes used contact {{exploder}}s. A typical exploder had {{a firing}} pin that stuck {{out from the}} warhead and was restrained by a transverse shear pin. The torpedo would hit the target with enough energy to <b>break</b> the shear <b>pin</b> and allow the firing pin to strike a percussion cap that ultimately detonated the warhead. An arming impeller was an additional safety device: the firing pin could not move until the torpedo had travelled a preset distance.|$|R
50|$|The {{penultimate}} {{match was}} a no disqualifications match between Texano and Blue Demon Jr. Mr. Cisco and Cortez Castro freely interfered to help Demon, <b>breaking</b> up the <b>pin</b> when Texano hit a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker, a spinebuster and a sitout powerbomb. Then, Chavo Guerrero Jr. ran {{out with a}} chair, teased hitting Demon, but hit Texano across the back instead. The chair was passed to Demon, who cracked Texano {{in the head with}} it, leading to the pinfall victory.|$|R
50|$|Pressure of 400 pounds (180 kg) on {{the center}} of the mine or 200 pounds (90 kg) on its edge deforms the {{pressure}} plate compressing a spring, and <b>breaking</b> a shear <b>pin</b> which holds back the spring-loaded striker. Once the striker is released it flips downwards into a percussion cap which fires the adjacent detonator followed by the booster charge and then the main explosive filling of TNT. Most were painted field gray (dark green). From 1943, they were painted dark yellow.|$|R
50|$|The Dolphins, who had {{deferred}} {{the opening}} coin toss, chose to receive {{at the start}} of the second half but went three-and-out. On the next play (after a penalty), Brady threw a short sideline pass to Aiken, who caught the ball over the defender and proceeded to run down the sideline for an 81-yard touchdown, extending the Patriots' lead to 21-10. It was the third 50+ yard completion of the game for Brady, a career first, and the third longest completion of Brady's career. He also eclipsed 30,000 career passing yards on the play. Following a 51-yard kickoff return by Ted Ginn, Jr., the Dolphins took two plays to reach Patriots territory. On a 3rd-and-4 from the Patriots' 46-yard line, Henne attempted a deep sideline pass to wide receiver Brian Hartline, who stopped and turned back to catch the ball but was taken down by Wilhite for a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty. However, the Pats surrendered only three yards and forced the Dolphins to kick a field goal; Carpenter's 24-yard score cut the Patriots' lead to 21-13. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Dolphins continued to pressure the Patriots defense, moving 64 yards on 12 plays and cutting the deficit to two points on a 7-yard Hartline touchdown catch. The Dolphins attempted to tie the game on a two-point conversion pass attempt to Fasano, but the pass fell incomplete. The Patriots' next drive reached the Dolphins' 39-yard line, where the Patriots again attempted to convert a fourth down, this one with three yards to gain. The Patriots appeared to do so at first, as Welker caught a 13-yard pass from Brady, but the play was nullified by an Aiken offensive pass interference penalty. After another penalty on the first punt attempt, the second punt attempt by Hanson actually gave the Patriots a better <b>break,</b> <b>pinning</b> the Dolphins at their own 3-yard line at the end of the third quarter.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fourth}} match, The Miz defended the Intercontinental Championship in a Fatal Four-Way match against Cesaro, Kevin Owens, and Sami Zayn. The match started with Zayn {{immediately}} executing a Helluva Kick on Owens. In {{the middle of}} the match, Miz executed the Skull Crushing Finale on Cesaro for a near-fall. Cesaro applied the Sharpshooter on Miz, who submitted, but the referee did not see it as he was distracted by Maryse. Cesaro performed a Neutralizer on Owens, but Zayn broke up the pin. Owens performed a Pop-Up Powerbomb on Cesaro, but Miz broke up the pin and executed a Skull Crushing Finale on Owens outside the ring. In the climax, Zayn executed a Helluva Kick on Cesaro, but Owens pulled Zayn out of the ring to <b>break</b> the <b>pin.</b> As Owens and Zayn brawled at ringside, Miz pinned Cesaro to retain the title.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, minor botches {{are simply}} glossed {{over and the}} match is continued. One example was {{the ending of the}} Hulk Hogan-Sid Justice match at WrestleMania VIII. The planned ending was to involve Papa Shango running into the ring to <b>break</b> up Hogan's <b>pin</b> attempt. However, Shango missed his cue, forcing Sid to kick out of the pin attempt and manager Harvey Whippleman to jump onto the ring apron to {{interfere}} and prompt the disqualification, just as Shango ran into the ring to assist Sid with the intended double-team beating of Hogan.|$|R
500|$|The {{variation}} with 7.Bg5 {{is named}} after Wolfgang Uhlmann, who played {{it a few times}} in the 1960s. Botvinnik also employed it in his 1960 world championship match against Tal. By pinning the knight, White aims to transpose into favourable lines of the [...] of the King's Indian Defence, which may occur after 7...0-0 8.Nd2!. To prevent this, Black can either <b>break</b> the <b>pin</b> immediately with 7...h6 8.Bh4 g5 9.Bg3 Nh5, or after developing with 7...Bg7 8.e4 h6 9.Bh4. At this point 9...g5 10.Bg3 Nh5 runs into the pawn sacrifice 11.Bb5+ Kf8 12.e5! when White has a dangerous attack, and in the late 1970s this line was even thought to have refuted the Modern Benoni. Later it was realized that Black can prevent the bishop check with 9...a6!: the only way White can forestall ...g5 and ...Nh5 is with 10.Nd2, but this allows Black to expand on the queenside with 10...b5 and reach a satisfactory position.|$|R
50|$|The Komet was so {{fast that}} pilots found it {{difficult}} to fire enough cannon rounds to destroy a bomber in a single pass. The Jagdfaust was developed to address this problem. A 5 cm shell was mounted in a launch tube held in place by a pair of thin pins. Five such tubes were mounted vertically (to fire upward) in each wing. To ensure it would be fired at the correct time, the weapon featured a simple form of automated trigger in which an optical photocell detected the dark silhouette of an Allied bomber replacing bright blue sky and triggered the firing of the armed Jagdfaust guns. When the weapon fired, the force of the launch would <b>break</b> the <b>pins</b> holding the tube in place and the heavy tube would be ejected downward to offset the momentum of the explosive force of the shell. As a result the plane's flight was not affected.|$|R
