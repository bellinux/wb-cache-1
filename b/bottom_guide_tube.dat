40|$|For {{attaining}} {{a higher}} fueling efficiency in JT- 60 U centrifugal pellet injection experiments, <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> for a magnetic high-field side (HFS) injection were developed. The <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> for HFS (top) injection is about l 5 m in length, 5 mm in inner diameter and 600 mm {{in the smallest}} curvature radius, and has been connected to the upper port of the vacuum vessel. The speed exceeding 220 m/s led to pellet destruction in the <b>guide</b> <b>tube,</b> while the injected pellet mass estimated from the increase of plasma density reached about 80 Vo of that from low-field side (LFS) injection. A simple impact model was applied to explain the above result. The perpendicular pellet velocity limit on the wall inside the tube {{was estimated to be}} 20 m/s indicating that less than 100 m/s pellets can pass through the <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> even with a minimum curvature of 200 mm. Based on this estimation, a new <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> for HFS (mid) injection was designed and installed in March, 2001.

40|$|AbstractSafety rod <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{important}} components of fast reactor cores for ensuring safe reactor operation. Their failure or considerable changes of their size {{may lead to}} safety rod wedging that is unacceptable. Two <b>guide</b> <b>tubes,</b> one each from BN- 350 and BOR- 60, were examined post-irradiation to determine {{the reasons for their}} deformation and loss of functionality. These tubes were constructed from high-nickel alloy EP- 150 and austenitic 18 Cr 9 Ni, respectively. It is found that various forms of deformation of safety rod <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> occur due to non-uniform swelling along the tube height, perimeter and across-wall thickness. The swelling gradients can lead to bowing and ovality, and can be accompanied by significant internal stresses within the tube material. The latter can lead to size reduction of <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> dimension in some directions due to irradiation creep. High levels of swelling-induced residual stresses, in combination with a swelling-induced embrittlement of the tube material, can lead to the tube failure {{even in the absence of}} any external loading...|$|R

However, the deviation of wind pressure decreases with a <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> length, so that the frequency component of wind pressure exceeding 10 Hz reduces remarkably in case of more than 3 m tube length.

A new {{effective way to}} enhance the transmission of the ultracold neutrons through guides is demonstrated. This method involves internally coating stainless steel <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> with deuterated polystyrene using a spinning method, or with Fomblin oil. Results show that the UCN transmission in one metre is increased from about 37 % for the honed only <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> to about 84 % and 88 % when coated internally with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil respectively. The enhancement in the <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> surface quality due to the electropolishing process resulted in increasing the UCN transmission rate for the honed tube from 37 % to about 81 %. So coating a honed only tube with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil gave better transmission rates than electropolishing the tube and not coating it. The transmission measurements are for neutrons with an average axial velocity of about 9. 2 m s"-" 1.

Enhancing the capability to monitor the {{steam generators}} {{has been identified as}} having the potential to provide key evidence in justifying the extension of the generating lifetime of the stations. It has been proposed to install new temperature measuring instrumentation to monitor reactor gas temperature and to provide additional data regarding steam generator operating conditions. The modification will be to introduce thermocouples to the bore of an intact steam generator tube to facilitate temperature measurement at or near to the locations of interest. The modified steam generator tube will be sealed at the feed header upstand. Between the upper surface of the superheater header tubeplate and the wall of the superheater header, the thermocouple bundle and sheath will be contained within a rigid stainless steel <b>guide</b> <b>tube.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> will be attached at both ends by welds, each forming a pressure boundary.

40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) leads to axonal damage and limits {{the ability of}} the brain to {{communicate}} {{with the rest of the}} body. Several bioengineered approaches have been developed for the recovery of SCI. Among these techniques, degradable guidance tubes have shown promising results. However, design of nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> requires several design considerations and has been a significant challenge. To assess the efficacy of a prototypical implanted nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes,</b> it is essential to perform continuous monitoring. In this respect, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most reliable imaging techniques as it offers the ability to achieve extraordinary high temporal and spatial resolution in addition to its non-invasive features. In spite of the excellent image quality of non-enhanced MRI various types of contrast agents have been developed to further enhance the contrast and allow improved visualization. The MRI contrast agents principally work by shortening the T 1 or T 2 relaxation times of protons located nearby. The presented study was intended to evaluate the in vitro degradation of the nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> made of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). PLGA tubes incorporated with different concentrations of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) were scanned by MRI 3 T on weekly basis during the degradation period. Spin-echo (SE) sequence with various echo times (TEs) ranged from 13. 3 to 314. 4 msec was applied. T 2 mapping was computed using in-house algorithm developed in Matlab. Least square fit was used to find the slope of the decay curve by plotting log intensity on the y-axis and echo time on the x-axis. The average T 2 values were calculated. Mass loss and water uptake of the degrading tubes were also measured weekly. Moreover, the micro-structural changes of the tubes were investigated using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The MRI results showed that the concentration of SPIO affects the signal intensity of the T 2 weighted images reducing the T 2 relaxation time value. Accordingly, a linear correlation between SPIO concentration and T 2 relaxation time was found. At the beginning of degradation, the SPIO nanoparticles were trapped within the polymeric network. Therefore, water penetration was the predominant factor affecting the T 2 relaxation times. At week 5, a significant mass loss was observed. From this stage onwards, the trapped SPIO were released from the polymeric network increasing T 2 relaxation time dramatically. According to SEM images, the size of the pores in PLGA <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> was increased with the degradation. Approaching the end of degradation, shrinkage of the tubes was observed and the degraded nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> were shown to be collapsed. Similar shape variation was observed in T 2 weighted MR images. In summary, this study provided an approach to non-invasive monitoring of degradation behavior of nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> using contrast enhancement.
