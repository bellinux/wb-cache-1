5|$|Star Dust (registration G-AGWH) was a British South American Airways (BSAA) Avro Lancastrian {{airliner}} which {{crashed into}} Mount Tupungato in the Argentine Andes on 2 August 1947, during {{a flight from}} Buenos Aires to Santiago, Chile. A comprehensive search of a wide area (including what is now {{known to have been}} the crash site) was fruitless, and the fate of the aircraft and occupants remained unknown for over 50 years. An investigation in 2000 after wreckage of G-AGWH had been found determined that the crash was caused by weather-related factors, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> <b>then</b> speculation had included theories of international intrigue, intercorporate sabotage and even abduction by aliens.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{must then}} defeat the God Beasts {{before they can}} gather and destroy the world. However, after doing this they realize killing the God Beasts has given more power to their main enemy, who their personal enemies were working for—the Dragon Emperor for Duran and Angela, the Dark Prince for Hawk and Lise, and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Carlie. The already powerful villain absorbs {{the power of the}} Sword of Mana and the God Beasts in order to become a god, but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power. After defeating the villain's minions, the characters go and defeat their main enemy, but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world. The Faerie then fuses with what is left of the Mana Tree; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess in a thousand years, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> <b>then</b> Mana will not exist in the world. As the game ends, the characters go back to their homelands.|$|E

5|$|The {{resilience}} of Indonesian Republican resistance and active international diplomacy set world opinion against the Dutch efforts to re-establish their colony. The second 'police action' was a diplomatic {{disaster for the}} Dutch cause. The newly appointed United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson pushed the Netherlands government into negotiations earlier recommended by the United Nations <b>but</b> <b>until</b> <b>then</b> defied by the Netherlands. The Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference was held in The Hague from 23 August 1949 to 2 November 1949 between the Republic, the Netherlands, and the Dutch-created federal states. The Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over a new federal state known as the 'United States of Indonesia' (RUSI). It would include all {{the territory of the}} former Dutch East Indies with the exception of Netherlands New Guinea; sovereignty over which it was agreed would be retained by the Netherlands until further negotiations with Indonesia. The other issue on which Indonesia gave concessions was Netherlands East Indies debt. Indonesia agreed to responsibility for this sum of £4.3billion, much of which was directly attributable to Dutch attempts to crush the revolution. Sovereignty was formally transferred on 27 December 1949, and the new state was immediately recognised by the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|Xenogears {{composer}} Yasunori Mitsuda {{announced plans}} to create an album of orchestral arrangements of music from that game on October 6, 2010, via his Twitter account. Mitsuda had previously released two albums of music from the game, both in 1998, the year the game was released—Xenogears Original Soundtrack, a soundtrack album for the game, and Creid, an album of arranged music inspired by Celtic folk music and Japanese rock. He {{has said that he}} decided to make the album due to the emotions that he and fans still felt about the game 13 years after its release, which led him to want to commemorate that. The music of Xenogears is particularly close to Mitsuda, as it was the last soundtrack that he worked on for Square Enix—the first video game company he worked for—and he knew that he would be leaving when he composed the soundtrack for the game. He has said that he had been considering the idea of a Xenogears orchestral album for six or seven years prior to starting on it, <b>but</b> <b>until</b> <b>then</b> did not have both the opportunity to work on the project and the confidence in his own abilities as an orchestrator to make the album sound as he wished.|$|E

The true figure for the critical mass was about four times as large; <b>but</b> <b>until</b> <b>then</b> it had been assumed that such a bomb would require many tons of uranium, and consequently was impractical to build and use.
