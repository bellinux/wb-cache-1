5|$|Obvious Child {{originated}} as a 2009 {{short film}} {{which was written}} by Robespierre, Anna <b>Bean</b> <b>and</b> Karen Maine, and also starred Slate in the main role. By making the film, Robespierre hoped to remove the stigma surrounding abortion and to correct what she perceived as a misrepresentation of unplanned pregnancy in earlier films. She finished the feature-length script in 2012. The film was financed through various production companies and filmmaking grants and it was shot in New York in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid {{is a major}} pest of sugar beet, <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. The plants are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E

5|$|Beiderbecke {{attended}} Davenport High School from 1919 to 1921. During this time, {{he sat in}} {{and played}} professionally with various bands, including those of Wilbur Hatch, Floyd <b>Bean</b> <b>and</b> Carlisle Evans. In the spring of 1920 he performed for the school's Vaudeville Night, singing in a vocal quintet called the Black Jazz Babies and playing his horn. He also performed, {{at the invitation of}} his friend Fritz Putzier, in Neal Buckley's Novelty Orchestra. The group was hired for a gig in December 1920, but a complaint was lodged with the American Federation of Musicians, Local 67, that the boys did not have union cards. In an audition before a union executive, Beiderbecke was forced to sight read and failed. He did not earn his card.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944 Treloar was overworked {{and unhappy}} {{to be in}} Melbourne instead of at the Memorial. He was also uncomfortable with {{the way in which}} <b>Bean</b> <b>and</b> the AWM's acting {{director}} Arthur Bazley were running the Memorial in his absence, and sought to intervene in its management. This degree of intervention frustrated Bazley, and led to increasing conflict between the two men who had worked together since 1917. Their relationship worsened in 1945, and the Memorial's board was eventually forced to make a ruling on what Bazley and Treloar's responsibilities were. In 1946, Bazley left the Memorial to take a job in the Department of Immigration due to continuing tensions with Treloar.|$|E

5|$|In Mazatlán and 22other nearby towns, power {{service was}} cut off but was {{restored}} the next day. The surge and strong winds of Hurricane Tico were responsible for severe flooding and heavy damage. Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the hurricane destroyed nearly 19,000acres (77km²) of <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> corn, {{although most of the}} agricultural damage occurred south of Mazatlán. Many roofs of homes received damage. In addition, the hurricane disrupted the flow of drinking water. A total of 13 hotels received extensive damage and 14 people were hurt. Throughout Durango, many bridges collapsed due to flooding. Twenty-five thousand people were homeless and damage throughout the country was estimated at $200million (1983USD). However, the death toll was initially uncertain. Local reports from {{a few days after the}} storm indicated 105people were missing. According to a report from the United States Agency for International Development indicated that Hurricane Tico caused a total of 135deaths in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Near its {{landfall}} location, Charley destroyed 290 of the 300houses in the village, while over 70,000homes in Havana {{were either}} damaged or destroyed. Numerous hotels reported damage, potentially impacting the important tourism {{industry in the}} country. Agricultural damage was heavy, with the hurricane damaging more than 3,000 agricultural institutions. Citrus officials estimated a loss of 15,000metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000metric tons of citrus trees in the Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000acres (230km²) of fruit trees in the Havana area. Approximately 95% of the sugar cane, <b>bean,</b> <b>and</b> banana crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was directly responsible for four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of non-native species, predominantly giant reed, castor <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> tobacco tree, native plant species in the watershed began to die out. As giant reed is not suitable habitat for many species, areas infested by giant reed are biologically dead in comparison with unaffected areas. It can grow extremely fast, removing too much water from the creek, and during flood events, {{many parts of the}} giant reed can wash downstream and re-establish themselves as a new colony, increasing the problem. Along with increasing concentrations of nutrients from fertilizer and other substances contained in runoff, algal blooms began to hurt the water quality of the creek, especially above Sulphur Creek Reservoir. The historically seasonal creek was replaced with a constant flow of polluted water from several large storm drains and many smaller ones.|$|E

5000|$|Red <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> rice {{is one of}} the few New Orleans style {{dishes to}} be {{commonly}} served both in people's homes and in restaurants. Many neighborhood restaurants continue to offer it as a Monday lunch special, usually with a side order of either smoked sausage or a pork chop. While Monday washdays are largely a thing of the past, red beans remain a staple for large gatherings such as Super Bowl and Mardi Gras parties. Indeed, red <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> rice is very much part of the New Orleans identity. New Orleanian Louis Armstrong's favorite food was red <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> rice - the musician would sign letters [...] "Red <b>Beans</b> <b>and</b> Ricely Yours, Louis Armstrong".|$|R
5|$|However, {{the project}} was not without its trials. Edwards' initial plan to employ a team of writers was thwarted {{by a lack of}} {{resources}} and funds. He instead had to enlist historians based outside of the AWM for some of the volumes, who agreed to work on the history without financial compensation. The series also experienced problems with staff turnover. Aside from Pemberton, the unexpected death in 1998 of Ian McNeill—author of the volumes on the Australian Army—caused extensive delays to the series' completion. The first seven volumes (including McNeill's To Long Tan , dealing with army operations up to 1966), were delivered in a timely fashion and published successively from 1992 to 1998. However, McNeill's next volume was only partway written when he died. His research assistant, Ashley Ekins, was eventually appointed to complete the series. On the Offensive was published in 2003, while the final volume, Fighting to the Finish, appeared in 2012; two decades after the first volume, and sixteen years after Edwards' position at the AWM had ended. Again following the path of <b>Bean</b> <b>and</b> Long, Edwards was then commissioned by the AWM to write a single volume summary of the series. Australia and the Vietnam War was published by NewSouth in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
5|$|There are sixteen {{prominent}} vegetation {{zones in}} the San Juan watershed, which include riparian vegetation, montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Riparian vegetation is found {{along the banks}} of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months out of the year. These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Trabuco Creek, Cañada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while chaparral is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as giant reed, castor <b>bean,</b> <b>and</b> tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. Giant reed has taken over huge areas of wetlands, swamps and riparian zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken steps toward eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams.|$|E
