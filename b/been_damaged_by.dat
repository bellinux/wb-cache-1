5|$|After the war, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that most holiday camps in Britain had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> troop occupation, and the situation was so bad that questions were raised in parliament. Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Between 15 July and 21 September, German sources {{stated that}} 21 {{transport}} vessels and 214 barges had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> British air raids. These figures {{may have been}} under-reported.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might explain why so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E
5000|$|Knob-and-tube wiring {{may also}} <b>be</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> {{building}} renovations. [...] Its cloth and rubber insulation can dry out and turn brittle. [...] It may also <b>be</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> rodents and careless {{activities such as}} hanging objects from wiring running in accessible areas like basements.|$|R

5|$|In the Florida Keys, {{multiple}} {{buildings that}} had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> Hurricane Georges were leveled by Mitch. Tornadoes {{from the storm}} damaged or destroyed 645 houses across the state, in addition to injuring 65people. Gusty winds left 100,000 without power during the storm's passage. In all, Mitch caused $40million in damage (1998USD) in Florida and two deaths from drowning when two boats capsized.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 White Paper {{was seen}} by many as an attempt to {{strengthen}} Australia's relationship with the United States, which had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> New Zealand's stance against nuclear weapons in its ports. In line with this policy, the RAN was structured to become more self-reliant and its activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within Australia's local region.|$|E
5|$|Action Film and JIF {{continued}} producing films {{until the}} beginning of the Japanese occupation of the Indies began in early 1942, leading to the closing of all but one film studio. The cast of Srigala Item remained with JIF until the company closed, as did Tan. According to JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Catalogue of Indonesian Films), a copy of Srigala Item is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta. The reels have <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> acid, leading to part of the film being excised.|$|E

5|$|After the shooting, Yousafzai was airlifted to a {{military}} hospital in Peshawar, where doctors were forced to begin operating after swelling developed in the left portion of her brain, which had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> the bullet when it passed through her head. After a five-hour operation, doctors successfully removed the bullet, which had lodged in her shoulder near her spinal cord. The day following the attack, doctors performed a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull is removed to allow room for the brain to swell.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Syrian Civil War, Palmyra {{experienced}} widespread looting and damage by combatants. In 2013, the façade of the Temple of Bel sustained a large hole from mortar fire, and colonnade columns have <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> shrapnel. According to Maamoun Abdulkarim, the Syrian Army positioned its troops in some archaeological-site areas, while Syrian opposition fighters positioned themselves in gardens around the city.|$|E
5|$|By April 1946, Gakushuin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, {{located near}} the Tokyo Imperial Palace, had not <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of Prince Akihito, the future emperor of Japan. She {{graduated}} in 1951 and was accepted into the philosophy program of Gakushuin University as {{the first woman to}} enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{of prehistoric}} human {{occupation}} {{in the parish}} exists {{in the form of}} 30 round barrows, about half of which are sited over chalk and half over Reading Beds. Many of the barrows have <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> more recent activities. The remains of strip lynchets of 'Celtic' fields have been found near a few of the barrows. One of the three 'Rainbarrows' on Duddle Heath has been excavated; bucket urns containing cremations from the site were taken to the Dorset County Museum.|$|E
5|$|Granny {{was also}} used as a focal point of {{environmental}} efforts {{that resulted in the}} Endangered Species Act protections for orca. Environmentalists estimate that Granny may have had a PCB load of up to 100 parts per million, and that her descendants' reproductive systems may have <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> exposure to pollution. Additionally, declining West Coast salmon populations put Granny and her family at risk.|$|E
5|$|Hertfordshire Constabulary advised {{people who}} had houses with smashed windows to seek refuge with friends or family nearby if possible. Some people whose homes were damaged by the blast were placed in hotels, while others stayed in a nearby {{shopping}} centre.

5|$|On 21 February 2016, a {{referendum}} {{was held on}} the question of whether Morales should be allowed to run for a fourth term when his third term would expire in 2020 which he narrowly lost. His approval rating had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> the allegations concerning his relationship with Gabriela Zapata Montaño. In December 2016 the MAS nominated Morales as their candidate for the 2019 presidential election regardless, stating that they would seek various avenues to ensure that this would be legal.|$|E
5|$|Roger de Pont L'Évêque (or Robert of Bishop's Bridge; c. 1115–1181) was Archbishop of York from 1154 to 1181. Born in Normandy, he preceded Thomas Becket as Archdeacon of Canterbury, and {{together}} with Becket served Theobald of Bec while Theobald was Archbishop of Canterbury. While in Theobald's service, Roger was {{alleged to have}} committed a crime which Becket helped to cover up. Roger succeeded William FitzHerbert as archbishop in 1154, and while at York rebuilt York Minster, which had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> fire.|$|E
5|$|Roger did {{not like}} monks, and William of Newburgh said that he often {{referred}} to the foundation of Fountains Abbey as the worst mistake of Archbishop Thurstan's episcopate. Roger also was accused of avarice, and of making unworthy clerical appointments. However, he also started the rebuilding of York Minster, which had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> fire in 1137, and helped with {{the building of a}} church at Ripon. He also endowed the school at York with an annual income of 100 shillings.|$|E

5|$|The congregation's building, a Gothic Revival {{structure}} {{built in}} 1850 as the Norfolk Street Baptist Church and purchased in 1885, {{was one of}} the largest synagogues on the Lower East Side. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. In the late 20th century the congregation dwindled and was unable to maintain the building, which had <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> storms. Despite their obtaining funding and grants, the structure was critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|The sub-surface {{station has}} twice <b>been</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> explosions. On 30 October 1883, a bomb planted by Fenians campaigning for an {{independent}} Irish Republic exploded on a train near the station. The bomb damaged the train it was on and a passing train along with part of the station and the signal box. Sixty-two passengers were injured. On the night of 13 October 1940, the station was hit by German bombs dropped during The Blitz killing five people in the station with four more subsequently dying of injuries.|$|E
