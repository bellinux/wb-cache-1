40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} re-design and {{characterization of}} the Erica tilt-rotor aircraft, carried out by some Partners of the NICETRIP consortium, is presented. The re-design activities concern some specific aircraft components, like the fuselage/wing fairing, the wing airfoils, the <b>blade</b> <b>cuff</b> and the rotor spinner. The aerodynamic characterization is carried out both experimentally and numerically, although the present paper {{is focused on the}} numerical work, with the aim at identifying improvements of current ERICA geometry leading to improved aerodynamic performance...|$|E
5000|$|AVX Aircraft {{proposed}} an aircraft with their coaxial rotor and twin ducted fan design that provides better steering and some additional forward power. Their JMR-TD {{is to be}} built at 75% scale. It is capable of flying at , with 40% lift from the small forward wings and 60% from the 56-foot rotors. Half the drag of the design comes from the fuselage and half from the rotor system, so wind tunnel tests are aiming to reduce drag by a third. The rotor system has two composite-flexbeam hubs with drag-reducing aerodynamic fairings on the <b>blade</b> <b>cuffs</b> and the mast between the hubs. The medium-sized version is proposed to weight 27,000 lb, carry four crew and 12 troops, and have a 13,000 lb external lifting capacity. It has a six-by-six foot cabin, which is twice {{the interior of the}} UH-60 Black Hawk, and has an 8,000 lb internal lifting capacity. The aircraft can carry 12 NATO litters, have an auxiliary fuel system for self-deployment over distances, and is planned to be capable of being optionally manned. The utility and attack versions will have 90% commonality and fly at the same speed. Test aircraft will be equipped with current GE T706 engines, but AVX is looking to equip their design with the Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine with its higher 4,800 hp output. AVX has teamed with Rockwell Collins, General Electric, and BAE Systems. It features entry doors {{on both sides of the}} fuselage with a large rear ramp for easy cargo handling. Both versions have retractable landing gear, and the attack variant carries all armaments stored inside until needed to provide a clean aerodynamic design. The company refers to the unnamed concept as an [...] "innovative compound coaxial helicopter" [...] capable of achieving 80 percent of the speed of the V-22 Osprey at half the cost. It will be able to hover at 6,000 ft in temperatures of 35˚C (95˚F) and fly unrefueled from Travis Air Force Base in California to Hawaii, a distance of [...] AVX considers its position as a smaller company (with 25 employees, some of which worked on the V-22) to its advantage without a legacy or burden of overhead attributes like larger defense corporations; if selected to supply an aircraft, AVX will likely have a teaming arrangement with another company that can handle assembly, integration, and production support. Like Sikorsky, AVX considers coaxials as unsuitable for heavy-lift, and suggests their tiltrotor instead for Capability Set 4 (Chinook replacement).|$|R
