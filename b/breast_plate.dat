500|$|In the mid-ground, the Archangel Michael's armour {{is heavily}} inscribed with esoteric and often {{difficult}} to source phrases. Letters on his <b>breast</b> <b>plate</b> read VINAE(X) while his jewel-encrusted oval buckler displays the cross and is decorated with Greek script reading ADORAVI TETGRAMMATHON AGLA. The meaning of this phrase has not been conclusively identified; some art historians believe it contains misspellings and has been misread. Friedländer transcribed the first word as ADORAVI while the final word AGLA is thought be taken from the first four letters of the Hebrew words for [...] "Thou Art Mighty", and thus may signify God; the word also appears in a floor tile in the Ghent Altarpiece. In the upper portion, gilded inscriptions running vertically across the edges of Christ's mantle read VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI ("Come, ye blessed of my father").|$|E

They become a superhero duo, calling themselves [...] "Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl". Later, Lucy Lawless (dressed as Xena) addresses fans at a science fiction convention. Comic Book Guy, who has styled himself as a villain called [...] "The Collector", kidnaps her using a magnet to attract her metal <b>breast</b> <b>plate.</b> Lawless tries to remove the breastplate but stops after she notices that her horny nerd fans have cameras ready. The Collector takes her to his lair, where he puts her in an aluminized PET film bag for [...] "safekeeping" [...] and imprisons her in a room of other similarly-captured celebrities. Stretch Dude and Clobber Girl then enter the fray {{in an attempt to}} free Xena, but they are soon captured as well. The Collector suspends the duo over a vat of [...] "Lucite". After feigning interest in the villain, Lawless starts clobbering him. The Collector grabs his limited edition double edged lightsaber from [...] (which was released a few months before the episode) and ignites the blades, but when Lawless reminds him that he has removed it from its original packaging, he panics and ends up falling into the Lucite. Lawless then flies the children home (Lisa points out that Xena cannot fly, but Lawless reminds her she's not Xena, she's Lucy Lawless).|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} years of pistol and arquebuses, {{firearms}} were relatively low in velocity. The full suits of armor, or <b>breast</b> <b>plates</b> actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. The front <b>breast</b> <b>plates</b> were, in fact, commonly shot as a test. The impact point would often be encircled with engraving to point it out. This was called the [...] "proof". Armor often also bore an insignia of the maker, especially if it was of good quality. Crossbow bolts, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range.|$|R

2500|$|The Game {{released}} a controversial artwork {{of the album}} via Instagram on October 21, 2012 and also announced the release date will be December 11. The cover portrays a dark-skinned Jesus in a stained glass window with a teardrop tattoo, a red bandanna around his mouth, and wearing a Jesus piece. The stained glass-inspired image shows Jesus sitting on a throne adorned with gang-related symbols. In the artwork, Jesus is holding a gold [...] "Jesus Piece" [...] chain and pointing to a symbol on his <b>breast</b> <b>plate.</b> The red bandana over his mouth is {{a reference to the}} Cedar Block Piru Bloods gang, to which Game is allegedly a member. The artwork has a slightly altered logo on the top, which features on all of Game's previous studio albums. The album's title Jesus Piece is stylized as Je5us Piece, depicting that it is Game's fifth studio album. Je5us Piece logo is styled after the iconic Louis Vuitton. The cover was designed by Mike Saputo. The religious imagery of the art has gained mixed reactions and the ire of some fans who deem the work as blasphemous. Several celebrities praised the artwork, including Busta Rhymes, Mac Miller and Kevin Hart. However, The Game decided to make this cover for the deluxe edition after the Roman Catholic Church complained to Interscope Records about it. Complex named the album cover the fifteenth best cover of 2012. On November 12, an alternative cover for the standard edition of the album was released. This cover paid homage to one of The Game's older brothers, Jevon Danell Taylor, who was shot and killed at the age of 20 on May 21, 1995.|$|E

60|$|Every citizen {{loved his}} city and her greatness above all else. There was as yet little wealth among them; the richest owned {{little more than}} a few acres, which they {{cultivated}} themselves by the help of their families, and sometimes of a few slaves, and the beautiful Campagna di Roma, girt in by hills looking like amethysts in the distance, had not then become almost uninhabitable from pestilential air, but was rich and fertile, full of highly cultivated small farms, where corn was raised in furrows made by a small hand plough, and herds of sheep, goats, and oxen browsed in the pasture lands. The owners of these lands would on public days take off their rude working dress and broad-brimmed straw hat, and putting on the white toga with a purple hem, would enter the city, and go to the valley called the Forum or Marketplace to give their votes for the officers of state who were elected every year; especially the two consuls, who were like kings all but the crown, wore purple togas richly embroidered, sat on ivory chairs, and were followed by lictors carrying an axe in a bundle of rods for the execution of justice. In their own chamber sat the Senate, the great council composed of the patricians, or citizens of highest birth, and of those who had formerly been consuls. They decided on peace or war, and made the laws, and were the real governors of the State, and their grave dignity made a great impression on all who came near them. Above the buildings of the city rose steep and high the Capitoline Hill, with the Temple of Jupiter on its summit, and the strong wall in which was the chief stronghold and citadel of Rome, the Capitol, the very centre of her strength and resolution. When a war was decided on, every citizen capable of bearing arms was called into the Forum, bringing his helmet, <b>breast</b> <b>plate,</b> short sword, and heavy spear, and the officers called tribunes, chose out a sufficient number, who were formed into bodies called legions, and marched to battle under the command of one of the consuls. Many little States or Italian tribes, who had nearly the same customs as Rome, surrounded the Campagna, and so many disputes arose that every year, as soon as the crops were saved, the armies marched out, the flocks were driven to folds on the hills, the women and children were placed in the walled cities, and a battle was fought, sometimes followed up by the siege of the city of the defeated. The Romans did not always obtain the victory, but there was a staunchness about them that was sure to prevail in the long run; if beaten one year, they came back to the charge the next, and thus they gradually mastered one of their neighbors after another, and spread their dominion over the central part of Italy.|$|E

When the Ndebele tribe finally settled, this language of colours and forms in their jewellery was used on the outer walls of their houses.|$|R
