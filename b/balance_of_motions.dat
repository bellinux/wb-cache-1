40|$|The Dynamic Universe model {{introduced}} in previous PIRT conferences {{is based on}} a zero energy <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> and gravitation in spherically closed space. Such an approach explains the rest energy of matter as the energy <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> mass in space possesses due to the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> space, and allows the study of space as a closed energy system. Due to the spherical symmetry, a universal reference at rest in space is a state with zero velocity in space directions, directions perpendicular to the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> space along the 4 -radius of the spherical structure. Following the zero energy principle all local energy systems in space become related to the universal rest frame. Conservation of the total energy relates local velocities in space to the velocity of space and local gravitation in space to the gravitation of whole space — thus replacing observer oriented reference frames to energy system oriented reference frames like intrinsically applied in thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and celestial mechanics or any mechanical system.

40|$|Abstract: The Dynamic Universe model {{comprises}} {{a holistic}} view and {{detailed study of}} space as a spherically closed 3 -dimensional energy system in a 4 -dimensional universe. It is based on zero-energy <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> and gravitation <b>of</b> space as a 3 D surface of a 4 -sphere – contracting and expanding {{in the direction of}} the 4 -radius. Such a dynamic solution shows the rest energy of mass in space as the energy <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> mass possesses due to the expansion. DU shows relativity as a consequence of the conservation of total energy and the zero-energy balance in interactions in space, and allows the derivation of physical and cosmological predictions in relatively simple mathematics – with no need to rely on kinematically derived coordinate transformations. The postulates DU employs do not include the principle of relativity, the equivalence principle, or assumptions about the constancy of the velocity of light. Yet, for local phenomena, including near space, DU predictions are essentially the same as the corresponding predictions given by the special and general theories of relativity. Cosmology predictions in DU fit with observations without the need to free parameters like mass density and dark energy used in Friedman-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology. The Dynamic Universe model offers plausible basis for philosophical considerations and leads to an intelligible picture of physical reality from quantum phenomena to the cosmological structure and development of space.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Motor-driven {{transport}} along microtubules is {{a primary}} cellular mechanism for moving and positioning organelles. Many cargoes move bidirectionally by using both minus and plus end-directed motors. How such cargoes undergo controlled net transport is unresolved. Results: Using a combination of genetics, molecular biology, and biophysics, we have identified Halo, a novel regulator of lipid droplet transport in early Drosophila embryos. In embryos lacking Halo, net transport of lipid droplets, but not that of other cargoes, is specifically altered; net transport is minus-end directed at developmental stages when it is normally plus-end directed. This reversal is due to an altered <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> {{at the level of}} individual organelles; without Halo, travel distances and stall forces are reduced for plus-end and increased for minus-end motion. During development, halo mRNA is highly upregulated just as net plus-end transport is initiated (phase II), and its levels drop precipitously shortly before transport becomes minus-end directed (phase III). Exogenously provided Halo prevents the switch to net minus-end transport in phase III in wild-type embryos and induces net plus-end transport during phase II in halo mutant embryos. This mechanism of regulation is likely to be of general importance because the Drosophila genome encodes a family of related proteins with similar sequences, each transiently expressed in distinct domains. Conclusions: We conclude that Halo acts as a directionality determinant for embryonic droplet transport and is the first member of a new class of transport regulators...|$|R

Expert John Kouwenhoven has classified Day’s artistic style as being a combination of accepted design traditions with more rural or folk artistic practices reflecting the Southern culture surrounding him; thus, it is more likely, according to scholarly research, that Day was simply employing his own regional creativity to popular urban styles as was his tendency, rather than utilizing a distant cultural heritage that Day, as a free mulatto integrated into high-status white society, likely had little personal connection to. Kouwenhoven has described Day’s style as inherently American {{in the way that}} it combines both popular and folk design traditions, but these carved faces of angular design do somewhat reflect African design traditions and could represent a cultural link in Day’s craftsmanship to his heritage, however tenuous.  Today, six houses on the National Register of Historic Places contain interior or exterior woodwork attributed to Thomas Day: Brandon Plantation, William Henry and Sarah Holderness House, Longwood, James Malone House, Woodside, and Burleigh Plantation. Fittings in the Presbyterian Church and Baptist Meeting House (Milton Church) located in the Milton Historic District are also attributed to him.|$|R

40|$|Here {{we report}} a new motion {{illusion}} where the prevailing motion direction is {{strongly influenced by}} the relative phase of the harmonic components of the stimulus. The basic stimulus {{is the sum of}} three sinusoidal contrast-reversing gratings: the first, the third, and the fifth harmonic of two square wave gratings that drift in opposite direction. The phase of one of the fifth components was kept constant at 180 deg, whereas the phase of the other fifth harmonic was varied over the range 0 - 150 deg. For each phase value of the fifth harmonic, the motion was strongly biased toward its direction, corresponding to the direction with stronger phase congruency between the three harmonics. The strength <b>of</b> the prevailing <b>motion</b> was assessed by measuring motion direction discrimination thresholds, by varying the contrast of the third and the fifth harmonics plaid pattern. Results show that the contrast of high harmonics had to be increased by more than a factor of 10, to achieve a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> for phase differences greater than 60 deg between the 2 fifth harmonics. We also measured the dependence on the absolute phase of harmonic components and found that it is not an important parameter, excluding the possibility that local luminance cues could be mediating the effect.

The model computes local energy function from a pair of space-time separable front stage filters and applies a battery of directional second stage mechanisms.

50|$|In his {{furniture}} workshop, Day {{tended to}} employ his own design style {{for all of}} his pieces; this style evolved with popular stylistic trends throughout his few decades as a successful and skilled craftsman. Day’s work is characterized by improvisational subscription to popular urban styles of the time and his designs were methodical and symmetrical. Scholars of African and African-American art and design widely agree that this facet of Day’s style could reflect his racial heritage, since African and African-American art was highly creative and improvised, with visible rhythms in the designs. However, American design scholars warn against attributing Day’s entire design style to his African heritage, because American rural furniture designers of all races often creatively and spontaneously elaborated on popular stylistic themes as well. Essentially, Day took basic structures and ideas from urban trends on furniture designs and elaborated on them utilizing his personal creative taste. This habit of utilizing popular designs, combined with the cost-efficient production methods in his workshop through steam power, made Day’s designs not only symbols of status for customers through their style, but also competitively priced. Based on stylistic analysis, it appears that Day pleaded many of his basic design structures for his various furniture pieces from a craftsman pattern book by John Hall, the Cabinet Makers’ Assistant, especially his use of s-shape curves.Day enjoyed employing both horizontal and vertical curvature ornamentations that balanced each other out. Scholars argue that his craftsmanship focused on creating a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> in his pieces, where curvilinear designs as well as scroll motifs suggested motion to the eye, while the interplay between the horizontal and vertical directions, as well as the negative space between such curves, created a sense <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> in the piece. On many of his tables, Day carved animalistic paws, even adding carved fur, onto the clawed foot style that was fashionable at the time, as well as adding carved foliage resembling tobacco leaves. These stylistic choices further illustrate Day’s tendency to take popular designs and add his own regional twist, with the tobacco leaves referencing his own tobacco farm as well as the tobacco-growing tradition in North Carolina.|$|R
