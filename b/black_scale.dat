50|$|Halmus chalybeus, {{commonly}} known as the steelblue ladybird, is a species of ladybird (the beetle family Coccinellidae). It has a rounded appearance with an iridescent blue/green colouration and is a predator of other insects. It was introduced to New Zealand from Australia in 1899 and 1905 to control <b>black</b> <b>scale</b> and blue gum scale (see scale insect) on citrus trees, where it is now common in northern regions. It has also been recorded eating San Jose scale. They are about 3-4 mm long.|$|E
50|$|Growing up to 90 cm in length, {{its light}} grey colour has small <b>black</b> <b>scale</b> centres dotted around its body. Its first dorsal (on the back or {{top of the}} fish) fin is red, before {{changing}} towards the tail to a darker colour. The area {{around the base of}} its pectoral fins (on the chest behind the head) is red or orange. The area around its eyes, the corner of its mouth and on parts of the fins on the bottom can also be red or orange.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-13 mm. The forewings {{are deep}} black with light yellow markings. There is an oblique yellow {{spot on the}} basal fourth of the costa and a yellow spot on the apical fourth of the costa, {{as well as a}} small yellow tuft of raised scales on the middle of the fold. <b>Black</b> <b>scale</b> tufts are found at the basal fourth {{and at the end of}} the cell, the latter with a few yellow scales. There is also a minute yellow dot at the tornus. The hindwings are blackish fuscous.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 34 mm. Adults are uniform pale olive green, the forewings {{with a few}} scattered <b>black</b> <b>scales</b> and small raised specks of <b>black</b> <b>scales</b> at the middle {{and end of the}} cell, as well as an indistinct minutely dentate curved postmedial line. The hindwings are slightly paler.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 32 mm. The forewings are yellowish white with small spots formed of aggregated <b>black</b> <b>scales</b> beyond the lower {{angle of the}} cell below veins 5, 4 and 3. The hindwings are yellowish white with an irroration of large <b>black</b> <b>scales</b> in, beyond and below {{the end of the}} cell.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 8-12 mm for males and 9-12.5 mm for females. The forewings are yellow with <b>black</b> <b>scales</b> with a few <b>black</b> <b>scales</b> at the extreme base, {{as well as a}} few <b>black</b> <b>scales</b> {{in the middle of the}} basal area. The antemedial line is black and the medial area is yellow with some orange. The postmedial line consist of black dots on the veins. The hindwings are yellow in males and yellow with a black border or completely black in females. Adults have been recorded on wing nearly year round, except August.|$|R
50|$|Scale insects suck sap from plants, are {{stationary}} {{and covered}} by a flattened disk. The <b>black</b> <b>scale</b> {{is the most common}} nuisance; it secretes a white manna, which frequently grows a black mould and attracts ants. The San Jose scale is a tiny grey dot that attacks trees. Plague thrips feed in flowers causing petals to brown. The greenhouse whitefly is a small aphid with white wings that attacks weeds and broadleaf vegetables. The European wasp has made an appearance in the 21st century. Other introduced insects include useful ones such as honeybees, dung beetles, and parasitic wasps. Bees however can become a nuisance, and there are feral swarms.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 34 mm. The forewing basal area is pale ocherous brown, mixed {{with black and}} white scales. The median area is white mixed with pale yellow and yellowish brown scales, with dense yellowish brown scales from the costa scattered to above the cell. The distal area is yellowish brown, mixed with black scales. The antemedian line is black, ill-defined anteriorly, extending distinctly from the <b>black</b> <b>scale</b> tuft near the base obliquely outward to below 1A+2A, then straightly reaching the dorsal one-third. The postmedian line is black, extending from the costal three-fourths obliquely outward to M2, then arched and extending inward along CuA1, forming a blunt angle, finally straight to the dorsal two-thirds, its inner margin serrated. The costa has a blackish-brown spot at the basal one-third diffused to above the cell, with a white spot at {{the outside of the}} postmedian line spreading to R5. The discal spot is small, black surrounded by pale yellowish brown, with raised white scales on its outer margin. The discocellular spot is nearly rectangular, relatively large, surrounded by pale yellowish brown scales and the terminal line is yellowish white, with ill-defined spots along its inner side. The hindwings have the basal three-fourths white mixed with pale yellow. The distal one-fourth is greyish brown, deepening from the costa to the dorsum and with the discocellular spot pale greyish brown.|$|E
40|$|The {{olive tree}} may be {{attacked}} by several insect pests, especially the <b>black</b> <b>Scale,</b> which {{is associated with}} this plant throughout its cycle, could limit the production due to leaf drop and poor fruit set. This study aims to evaluate {{the behavior of the}} predatory stinkbug Podisus nigrispinus Dallas (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in olive <b>black</b> <b>scale.</b> Females of P. nigrispinus were placed in Petri dishes, individually, receiving only water in cotton balls for five days. After this, were offered to females of the predator, individuals of <b>black</b> <b>scale</b> in different stages (1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd immatures instar) or adults, fixed in olive leaves. The predatory behavior of females of P. nigrispinus was observed continuously for 12 hours. Podisus nigrispinus showed no predatory activity of olive <b>black</b> <b>scale</b> in laboratory conditions...|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 27 mm. Adults {{have a black}} ground colour. The wings are extensively hyaline with rare grey scale-covering. The forewings and hindwings costal and lower margins are densely covered with <b>black</b> <b>scales.</b> The forewing is elongate and the discal vein is marked by <b>black</b> <b>scales.</b> Adults have been recorded in early March.|$|R
