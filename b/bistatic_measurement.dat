40|$|To date {{only very}} few {{bistatic}} measurements (airborne or in controlled laboratories) have been reported. Therefore {{most of the}} current remote sensing methods are still focused on monostatic (backscatter) measurements. These methods, based on theoretical, empirical or semi-empirical models, enable the estimation of soil roughness and the soil humidity (dielectric constant). For the bistatic case only theoretical methods have been developed and tested with monostatic data. Hence, there still remains a vital need to gain of experience and knowledge about bistatic methods and data. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to estimate the soil moisture and the soil roughness by using full polarimetric bistatic measurements.

In this paper we report an imaging lidar {{on the basis of}} this novel telescope system applied to the detection of atmospheric aerosols. Because of the wide acceptance angel, the bistatic configuration enables light detection in the forward-scattering mode, greatly enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{contribution of}} <b>bistatic</b> radar <b>measurements</b> for bare soil moisture retrieval is investigated in this paper. A simulation study based on well-established electromagnetic models of rough surface scattering (both coherent and incoherent components) {{has been accomplished}} for this purpose. The retrieval accuracy has been evaluated by using both the Cramer-Rao lower bound and the error variance of a linear regression estimator, thus considering slightly different assumptions on retrieval conditions. Both methods have allowed us to identify the optimal system configurations in terms of observation directions, polarizations, and frequency. This identification {{has been carried out}} for single-polarization and multipolarization receivers and for the case in which <b>bistatic</b> <b>measurements</b> are complemented by monostatic ones, which are expected to be available through already-existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radars. The optimal systems have first been singled out by considering a Gaussian autocorrelation function (ACF) and a constant value of correlation length. Successively, the simulations for an exponential ACF and a variable correlation length have been analyzed, demonstrating that the results substantially remain the same. The comparison between the soil moisture estimation accuracy yielded by the optimal configurations and that provided by the standard monostatic radar has shown that a significant improvement in the quality of retrieval can be achieved by complementing <b>bistatic</b> and monostatic <b>measurements.</b> © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
30|$|The other {{challenge}} {{is due to}} the broadcasting signal frequencies for passive radars and the type of receivers, the angle information is of realistically poor quality and target tracking using only the range and range rate without angle information inevitably generates ghost tracks.

This measurement error is demonstrated by placing a diagonal square flat plate in the target zone and rotating it to appropriate angles. These angles are determined by bisecting the plane wave and stray signal directions. This results in a peak <b>bistatic</b> <b>measurement</b> of the edge diffracted stray signal. It is proposed that the diagonal flat plate be used to evaluate new reflector designs as well as existing systems.

40|$|In this thesis, a fully {{autonomous}} {{and persistent}} bistatic anti-submarine warfare (ASW) surveillance solution is developed using the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The passive receivers are carried by these AUVs, and are physically {{separated from the}} cooperative active sources. These sources {{are assumed to be}} transmitting both the frequency-modulated (FM) and continuous wave (CW) sonar pulse signals. The thesis then focuses on providing novel methods for the AUVs/receivers to enhance the bistatic sonar tracking performance. Firstly, the surveillance procedure, called the Automated Perception, is developed to automatically abstract the sensed acoustical data from the passive receiver to the track report that represents the situation awareness. The procedure is executed sequentially by two algorithms: (i) the Sonar Signal Processing algorithm - built with a new dual-waveform fusion of the FM and CW signals to achieve reliable stream of contacts for improved tracking; and (ii) the Target Tracking algorithm - implemented by exploiting information and environmental adaptations to optimize tracking performance. Next, a vehicular control strategy, called the Perception-Driven Control, is devised to move the AUV in reaction to the track report provided by the Automated Perception. The thesis develops a new non-myopic and adaptive control for the vehicle. This is achieved by exploiting the predictive information and environmental rewards to optimize the future tracking performance. The formulation eventually leads to a new information-theoretic and environmental-based control. The main challenge of the surveillance solution then rests upon formulating a model that allows tracking performance to be enhanced via adaptive processing in the Automated Perception, and adaptive mobility by the Perception-Driven Control. A Unified Model is formulated in this thesis that amalgamates two models: (i) the Information-Theoretic Model - developed to define the manner at which the FM and CW acoustical, the navigational, and the environmental measurement uncertainties are propagated to the <b>bistatic</b> <b>measurement</b> uncertainties in the contacts; and (ii) the Environmental-Acoustic Model - built to predict the signal-to-noise power ratios (SNRs) of the FM and CW contacts. Explicit relationships are derived in this thesis using information theory to amalgamate these two models. Finally, an Integrated System is developed onboard each AUV that brings together all the above technologies to enhance the bistatic sonar tracking performance. The system is formulated as a closed-loop control system. This formulation provides a new Integrated Perception, Modeling, and Control Paradigm for an autonomous bistatic ASW surveillance solution using AUVs. The system is validated using the simulated data, and the real data collected from the Generic Littoral Interoperable Network Technology (GLINT) 2009 and 2010 experiments.

40|$|The {{development}} of low-frequency SONAR systems, using {{a network of}} autonomous systems in unmanned vehicles, provides a practical means for <b>bistatic</b> <b>measurements</b> (i. e. when the source and receiver are widely separated, thus allowing multiple viewpoints of a target). Furthermore, time-frequency analysis, in particular Wigner-Ville analysis, {{takes advantage of the}} evolution of the time dependent echo spectrum to differentiate a man-made target (e. g. an elastic spherical shell, or cylinder) from a natural one of the similar shape (e. g. a rock). Indeed, key energetic features of man-made objects can aid in identification and classification in the presence of clutter and noise. For example, in a fluid-loaded thin spherical shell, an energetic feature is the mid-frequency enhancement echoes (MFE) that result from antisymmetric Lamb waves propagating around the circumference of the shell, which {{have been shown to be}} an acoustic feature useful in this pursuit. This research investigates the enhancement and benefits of <b>bistatic</b> <b>measurements</b> using the Wigner-Ville analysis along with acoustic imaging methods.
