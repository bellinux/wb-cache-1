40|$|Abstract Background The Maternal and Child Health Voucher Scheme (MCHVS) was {{introduced}} in Myanmar to address {{the high rate of}} maternal and infant mortalities. It aimed to increase access to maternal and child health (MCH) services by skilled birth attendants (SBAs) and improve the health of pregnant women and their babies. A study to pilot a voucher scheme was implemented in May 2013 in Yedarshey Township. This paper provides a report on a mid-term review of the programme after 7  months of implementation to determine the outcomes of the programme and its impediments. Methods Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used. Secondary quantitative data were analysed in order to measure the coverage and utilisation of the programme. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in groups and individually with 79 key informants to explore qualitative information on voucher communication, <b>beneficiary’s</b> <b>identification,</b> voucher distribution, and challenges for beneficiaries and providers under the MCHVS. Results The results showed that 63  % of eligible pregnant women who registered to the programme received voucher booklets, while the utilisation of most of the MCH services increased over time; in particular, delivery by SBAs increased significantly (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) after implementing MCHVS. Overall, the programme was implemented well in terms of promoting and communicating the programme to people in Yedarshey Township. Although a number of targeted poor pregnant women were included in the programme, some beneficiaries were overlooked for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, both providers and beneficiaries who experienced the MCHVS service utilisation were satisfied with the programme. The evaluation indicated several programme challenges, i. e. external and internal programme communication, voluntary voucher distributor recruitment, incentive and support for voucher distributors, beneficiary screening criteria, and approaches to increase access of services for pregnant women living in remote areas. Conclusions Generally, the MCHVS pilot programme is a promising initiative to increase access to and utilisation of the MCH services for pregnant women and their babies in Myanmar. However, increasing coverage of the programme and overcoming the barriers should be considered as high-priority issues that need to be addressed...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} the CPPD-VR program on the labor market outcomes of disability <b>beneficiaries.</b> Our <b>identification</b> strategy rests on the selection of a comparison group of reassessed claimants that we think reduces the amount of selection we face relative to a broader comparison group, combined with a “selection on observed variables” assumption rendered (somewhat) plausible by our data on CPPD spell duration, pre-disability labor market outcomes and demographics. That variation in the number of CPPD-VR slots does not depend on local economic conditions also adds to the credibility of our analysis, as do the flexible specification we employ in our propensity score model, our comparison of multiple matching and weighting estimators and our additional analysis of the sensitivity of our estimates to the presence of unobserved confounders. We argue that we have done about the best we can with the data available to us and the institutions generating variation in treatment receipt.|$|R

40|$|The {{top-down}} public {{agricultural extension}} system in China and its early commercialization reforms during the 1990 s have left millions of farmers {{without access to}} extension services. A pilot inclusive agricultural extension system was introduced in 2005 to better meet the diverse needs of small-scale farmers. Three key features of the experiment are (1) inclusion of all farmers as target <b>beneficiaries,</b> (2) effective <b>identification</b> of farmers' extension service needs, and (3) an accountability system to provide better agricultural extension services to farmers.

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} 2009 / 10 {{implementation}} of the Farm Input Subsidy Programme 2009 / 10 {{in the context of}} experience from 2005 / 6 to 2008 / 9. The 2009 / 10 programme differed from previous years in restriction of fertiliser subsidies to maize production, reduced fertiliser distribution budgets which were also adhered to, large increases in maize (particularly hybrid) and legume seed distribution, considerable carry forward of fertiliser stocks from previous year purchases, and earlier sales of fertiliser. These changes all have important positive implications for the programme’s effectiveness and efficiency as a result of reduced displacement, improved targeting, reduced programme costs (which also benefited from lower fertiliser prices), improved returns to use of subsidised fertiliser on hybrid maize, and food security, diversification and soil fertility benefits from the increased legume seed sales. Increased maize and legume seed sales through private retailers should also stimulate input market development. The economic benefit cost ratio for the programme is estimated at 1. 12, a respectable result (despite the many difficulties with this analysis and its blindness to many longer term and intangible benefits) with considerable potential for further improvement. The macro-economic costs of the programme have also been substantially reduced as compared with the previous year and the year on year rises in costs halted. These are important achievements. There are two main areas where it is proposed that programme implementation could look for substantial improvements in the future: first in achieving greater transparency in <b>beneficiary</b> <b>identification</b> and coupon issues and second in allowing earlier sales of inputs. Greater transparency in <b>beneficiary</b> <b>identification</b> and coupon issues should build on achievements {{over the last four years}} (for example in improved targeting and use of open meetings) by (a) resolving inconsistencies both in changing MoAFS farm family numbers across regions and with NSO estimates, (b) improving effective communication about coupon allocation and distribution systems, (c) increasing the transparency and accountability of these processes with, for example, the involvement of different stakeholders representing farmers, and (d) sharing and implementing good practice in particular districts or areas more widely across the country. Earlier input sales are important for reducing the costs and risks faced by farmers in redeeming coupons, promoting higher yield responses from earlier planting and fertiliser application, reducing pressures and costs in fertiliser deliveries to markets, and giving farmers more voice and choice when redeeming coupons. This requires that the 2009 / 10 improvements in fertiliser deliveries and in seed contracting are sustained and accompanied by earlier finalising of coupon allocations and printing than in 2009 / 10 – as has already been recognised by strenuous attempts to achieve earlier commencement of sales in 2010...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years Malawi made {{remarkable}} progress toward increasing its national maize production and achieving food security owing to its long-running policy of subsidizing fertilizer. The implementation of these subsidy programs is continuously being improved upon as the country learns from past experiences. 1 Recent evaluations of the current Farm Input Subsidy Program by Dorward and Chirwa (2011, 2012) suggest that various components of the program have been redesigned over time. These include timeliness of fertilizer delivery, fertilizer coupon receipts, regional distribution, area targeting, allocation and distribution processes, and coupon use and re-demption. However, the issue of <b>beneficiary</b> <b>identification</b> and targeting remains a challenge for the program. Draw-ing on recent research by Houssou and Zeller (2010, 2011, 2012), this note proposes an alternative approach to effec-tively target the poor within the group of potential program beneficiaries. In our analysis we are mindful of the fact that targeting criteria for the current program are vague at best. One interpretation of these criteria is that the pro-gram intends to target the “productive poor”, and since poverty is widespread in Malawi, some would argue that the focus of the targeting mechanism should be on identifying farmers who would make best use of subsidized fertilizer (e. g., as measured by their marginal productivity per unit of fertilizer applied).

Using the nonrandomized cohort from the Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) Trial, we analyzed the predictors of outcome {{based on the}} presenting vascular problem and prevalence of comorbid conditions and cardiac risks. Methods and ResultsBetween March 1, 1999 and February 28, 2003, 4414 patients were ineligible for randomization in the CARP Trial and their survival was retrieved through the BIRLS system (the Department of Veterans Affairs <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>Identification</b> and Records Locator Subsystem). Surgical indications were either an abdominal aortic aneurysm (N = 1598) or lower extremity ischemia for claudication (N = 1116), rest pain (N = 670), or tissue loss (N = 1030). Patients were screened for major cardiac risks that included a history of angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, pathological q-waves, and diabetes. The absence of multiple cardiac risks, as the sole reason for exclusion from randomization, occurred in 2314 (52. 4 %) screened patients and their probability of survival at 2. 5 -year post-surgery was 0. 88. This {{was better than the}} survival of the remaining excluded patients (N = 2100), which was 0. 75 (P 3. 5 mg/dL were significantly associated with long-term postoperative mortality. ConclusionsPatients without multiple cardiac risks or comorbid conditions have a good outcome following elective vascular surgery.

We determined decedent status using California death certificates linked to VA utilization data and the VA <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>Identification</b> and Records Locator System (BIRLS) death file. We compared the characteristics of decedents who {{would not have been}} identified by either single source (e. g., VA BIRLS alone or California death certificates alone) {{with the rest of the}} cohort. Results A total of 8, 813 veteran decedents were identified from both VA decedent files and death certificates. Of all decedents, 5, 698 / 8, 813 (65 %) veterans were identified in both source files, but 2, 426 / 8, 813 (28 %) decedents were not identified in VA BIRLS, and 689 / 8, 813 (8 %) were not identified in death certificates. Compared to the rest of the cohort, decedents whose mortality status was ascertained through either single source differed by race / ethnicity, marital status, and California residence. Clinically, veterans identified from either single source had less comorbidity and were less likely to have been users of VA inpatient or long term care, but equally or more likely to have been users of VA outpatient services. Conclusion As single sources, VA decedent files and death certificates each provided an incomplete record, and death ascertainment was improved by using both source files.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether a history of depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with all-cause mortality in primary care patients over an average of 2 years. Methods: Patients from seven Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers completed mailed questionnaires. Depression and PTSD status were determined from patient self-report of a prior diagnosis and/or electronic administrative data. Date of death was ascertained from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture and the Department of Veterans Affairs ’ <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>Identification</b> and Records Locator System. Results: Among 35, 715 primary care patients, those {{with a history of}} depression without a history of PTSD (n 6876) were at increased risk of death over an average of 2 years compared with patients with neither depression nor PTSD after adjustment for demographic variables, health behaviors, and medical comorbidity (hazard ratio (HR) 1. 17; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1. 06 – 1. 28). However, patients with a history of PTSD without a history of depression (n 748) were not at increased risk of death compared with patients with neither depression nor PTSD (HR 0. 84; 95 % CI 0. 63 – 1. 13). Patients with a history of both (n 3762) were at increased risk of death after adjustment for demographic factors, although not after additional adjustment for health behaviors and medical comorbidity (HR 0. 90; 95 % CI 0. 78 – 1. 04).

This study examines the knowledge, attitudes, and experiences of healthcare providers and facility managers in the Kenya reproductive health output-based approach voucher program. Methods: A total of 69 in-depth interviews with healthcare providers and facility managers in 30 voucher accredited facilities were conducted. The study hypothesized that a voucher program {{would be associated with}} improvements in reproductive health service provision. Data were transcribed and analyzed by adopting a thematic framework analysis approach. A combination of inductive and deductive analysis was conducted based on previous research and project documents. Results: Facility managers and providers viewed the RH-OBA program as a feasible system for increasing service utilization and improving quality of care. Perceived benefits of the program included stimulation of competition between facilities and capital investment in most facilities. Awareness of family planning (FP) and gender-based violence (GBV) recovery services voucher, however, remained lower than the maternal health voucher service. Relations between the voucher management agency and accredited facilities as well as existing health systems challenges affect program functions.

They recognize that {{it has the potential to}} significantly increase demand for reproductive health services, improve quality of care and reduce inequities in the use of reproductive health services. To improve program functioning going forward, there is need to ensure the benefit package and criteria for <b>beneficiary</b> <b>identification</b> are well understood and that the public facilities are permitted greater autonomy to utilize revenue generated from the voucher program...|$|E
40|$|Early studies {{suggested}} that gastric surgery for benign ulcer disease {{was associated with}} a subsequent increase in the risk of large bowel cancer. Dietary fats, altered bac-terial flora, and secondary bile acids are considered {{to play a major role}} in the disease etiology. Gastric surgery is known to alter bile salt metabolism as well as bacterial flora in the colon. This cohort study was designed to investigate the risk of large bowel cancer following gastric surgery for benign ulcer disease and to identify potential patient and treatment characteristics that may be associated with this risk. A cohort of 15, 983 males was selected from Department of Veterans Affairs hospital admissions in 1970 and 1971. The exposed group (n = 7, 609) included all males treated with gastric surgery (resection or vagotomy and drainage) for benign ulcer disease. The unexposed group (n = 8, 374) was a random sample of all other male patients from the same time period and database. All subjects were followed through 1989 to identify vital status and cause of death. Deaths were identifiable by computerized linkage of the subjects ' social se-curity numbers with the Department of Veterans Affairs <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>Identification</b> Record Locator System and the National Death Index. The cause of death was documented by two certified nosologists from the death certificates of 99 % of the deceased patients. Statistical analyses included estimations of risk based on standardized mortality ratios and standardized risk ratios. In this selected cohort, no increase in large bowel cancer risk was detected (risk ratio = 0. 81, 95 % confidence interval 0. 62 - 1. 05). The type of surgical procedure, ulcer diagnosis, age at the time of surgery, and length of follow-up did not alter the risk estimates. Unlike the previously identified increase in gastric cancer risk following ulcer surgery, no elevation in the risk of large bowel cancer following such surgery was detected in this study. Factors that may alter gastric surgery sequelae and resultant site-specific cancer risks deserve further investigations. Am J Epidemiol 1994...|$|E
40|$|The dawn of {{democracy}} in 1994 brought hope to South Africans particularly {{those who had been}} previously disadvantaged as a result of apartheid policies. This new hope was premised on a vision of creating a people-centred society and a better life for all expressed in the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) whose goals were to eliminate poverty and inequalities of the decades of apartheid. In order to meet this vision the RDP made explicit reference to building the capacity of civil society through extensive development of human resource. It provided a central role for nonprofit organizations. A vibrant and diverse civil society is important in consolidating and sustaining democracy as well as in holding government accountable. Since 1994 government has involved civil society in various stages of policy development aimed at alleviating poverty. This study therefore evaluates the extent to which programmes implemented by civil society, particularly in partnership with Social Development, are participative, empowering, effective and sustainable. This research indicates that civil society, have succeeded in mobilizing communities to take charge of their own development. This has been achieved through activities like needs and <b>beneficiary</b> <b>identification,</b> project implementation and fund raising. Despite this success the study shows that civil society experience challenges in ensuring that their programmes are effective and sustainable. These challenges include limited funding, lack of various skills including management skills, organizational skills, resource mobilization and accountability. The study contends that civil society has a critical role in implementing poverty alleviation programmes and in occupying space {{between the state and the}} community. In order to ensure long lasting impact of programmes, there is a great need for strengthening the organizational, management and administrative capacity of civil society. It is generally accepted that local organization capacity is recognized as key for development effectiveness and empowerment of the poor. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|Abstract Background One of the {{national}} mortality databases in the U. S. is the <b>Beneficiary</b> <b>Identification</b> and Record Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) Death File that contains death dates {{of those who have}} received any benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The completeness of this database was shown to vary widely from cohort to cohort in previous studies. Three other sources of death dates are available in the VA that can complement the BIRLS Death File. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the completeness and accuracy of death dates in the four sources available in the VA and to examine whether these four sources can be combined into a database with improved completeness and accuracy. Methods A random sample of 3, 000 was drawn from 8. 3 million veterans who received benefits from the VA between 1997 and 1999 and were alive on January 1, 1999 according to at least one source. Death dates found in BIRLS Death File, Medical SAS Inpatient Datasets, Medicare Vital Status, and Social Security Administration (SSA) Death Master File were compared with dates obtained from the National Death Index. A combined dataset from these sources was also compared with National Death Index dates. Results Compared with the National Death Index, sensitivity (or the percentage of death dates correctly recorded in a source) was 77. 4 % for BIRLS Death File, 12. 0 % for Medical SAS Inpatient Datasets, 83. 2 % for Medicare Vital Status, and 92. 1 % for SSA Death Master File. Over 95 % of death dates in these sources agreed exactly with dates from the National Death Index. Death dates in the combined dataset demonstrated 98. 3 % sensitivity and 97. 6 % exact agreement with dates from the National Death Index. Conclusion The BIRLS Death File is not an adequate source of mortality data for the VA population due to incompleteness. When the four sources of mortality data are carefully combined, the resulting dataset can provide more timely data for death ascertainment than the National Death Index and has comparable accuracy and completeness. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{are large}} {{gaps in the}} {{literature}} relating {{to the implementation of}} user fee policy and fee exemption measures for the poor, particularly on how such schemes are implemented and why many have not produced expected outcomes. In October 2003, Madagascar instituted a user fee exemption policy which established "equity funds" at public health centres, and used medicine sales revenue to subsidise the cost of medicine for the poor. This study examines the policy design and implementation process of the equity fund in Madagascar in an attempt to explore factors influencing the poor equity outcomes of the scheme. Methods: This study applied an agency-incentive framework to investigate the equity fund policy design and implementation practices. It analysed agency relationships established during implementation; examined incentive structures given to the agency relationships in the policy design; and considered how incentive structures were shaped and how agents responded in practice. The study employed a case-study approach with in-depth analysis of three equity fund cases in Madagascar's Boeny region. Results: Policy design problems, triggering implementation problems, caused poor equity performance. These problems were compounded by the re-direction of policy objectives by health administrators and strong involvement of the administrators in the implementation of policy. The source of the policy design and implementation failure was identified as a set of principal-agent problems concerning: monitoring mechanisms; facility-based fund management; and the nature and level of community participation. These factors all contributed to the financial performance of the fund receiving greater attention than its ability to financially protect the poor. Conclusion: The ability of exemption policies to protect the poor from user fees {{can be found in the}} details of the policy design and implementation; and implications of the policy design and implementation in a specific context determine whether a policy can realise its objectives. The equity fund experience in Madagascar, which illustrates the challenges of <b>beneficiary</b> <b>identification,</b> casts doubts on the application of the 'targeting' approach in health financing and raises issues to be considered in universal health policy formulation.
