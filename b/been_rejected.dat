5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's claims {{are treated as}} sacrosanct, {{as shown by the}} aspects of Darwin's theory that have <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> or revised by scientists over the years to form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. The claim that evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{refused to}} do anything about those servicemen who had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> by the courts prior to Denning's judgment, which provoked public outcry under the slogan 'Fit for Service, Fit for Pension'.

30|$|The null {{hypotheses}} {{for each}} test were as follows: ‘the compatibility hypothesis of headway distribution with fitted model <b>was</b> <b>rejected</b> (P-value < α) or not rejected (P-value > α)’. The ‘p-value’ {{is defined as}} the probability of obtaining a result equal to or “more extreme” than what was actually observed, when the null hypothesis is true [13, 34]. A critical value is the point on the scale of the test statistic beyond which the null hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>rejected,</b> and <b>is</b> derived from the level of significance (α) of the test. If the test statistic exceeds the critical value for the predefined significance level then the null hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>rejected.</b> The null hypothesis cannot <b>be</b> <b>rejected</b> when the hypothesized distribution passes the K-S test [31]. However, if the hypothesized distribution <b>is</b> <b>rejected</b> by the K-S test, it signifies that the distribution is not good enough to model the empirical distribution.|$|R

5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has <b>been</b> <b>rejected,</b> as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E

After being referred to Chas Chandler, who was leaving the Animals and interested in managing and producing artists, Hendrix was signed to a management and production contract with Chandler and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. Chandler brought Hendrix to London and began recruiting members for a band designed to showcase the guitarist's talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In late October, after having <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> by Decca Records, the Experience signed with Track, a new label formed by the Who's managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 until 1991, Said was an {{independent}} {{member of the}} Palestinian National Council (PNC). In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E
5|$|George {{inherited}} the throne at a politically turbulent time. Lloyd George's People's Budget had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> {{the previous year}} by the Conservative and Unionist-dominated House of Lords, contrary to the normal convention that the Lords did not veto money bills. Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith had asked the previous king to give an undertaking that he would create sufficient Liberal peers to force the budget through the House. Edward had reluctantly agreed, provided the Lords rejected the budget after two successive general elections. After a general election in January 1910, the Conservative peers allowed the budget, for which the government now had an electoral mandate, to pass without a vote.|$|E

5|$|Gliding did {{not return}} to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E

Otherwise, it must inform the declarant in writing that the application has <b>been</b> <b>rejected.</b> The decision must be communicated to the declarant no later than the eve of nomination day. All decisions of the Community Committee and its Sub-Committees are final, and a community certificate is conclusive of the matters it certifies– they {{are not subject to}} appeal or review in any court.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{ten years}} after the eastern {{extension}} of Route 37 was canceled, RIDOT began planning studies for a western extension of the freeway. The expressway was included in a proposal to extend I-84 eastward from Hartford, Connecticut to Providence; more northern alignments for the freeway had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> due to concerns of potential damage to the Scituate Reservoir. The southern routing of I-84, which would have utilized Route 37 and terminated in Warwick, largely bypassed the reservoir's watershed. In 1982, however, I-84 was officially canceled by RIDOT after studies indicated that the southern alignment was not a feasible alternative.|$|E
