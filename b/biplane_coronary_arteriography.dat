BACKGROUNDParadoxical vasoconstriction of stenotic coronary arteries has been reported during dynamic exercise and {{may be due to}} several factors such as alpha-adrenergic drive, a decreased release of nitric oxide, platelet aggregation with release of serotonin, or a passive collapse of the vessel wall. METHODSTwenty-six patients were studied at rest, during two levels of supine bicycle exercise and after 1. 6 mg sublingual nitroglycerin. The alpha-blocker phentolamine was given to 16 patients before exercise, five of whom had also taken a beta-adrenergic-blocker the same morning. Ten patients served as controls. The cross-sectional areas of a normal and a stenotic coronary vessel were determined by <b>biplane</b> quantitative <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography.</b> RESULTSIn the normal vessel segments, coronary cross-sectional area did not change after phentolamine injection, but increased in all patient groups similarly during exercise. Although coronary vasoconstriction existed in stenotic vessel segments in control patients, phentolamine-treated patients showed exercise-induced vasodilation without difference in patients with and without chronic beta-blockade. CONCLUSIONSExercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenotic coronary arteries is prevented by intracoronary administration of phentolamine. There was no difference in coronary vasomotion between patients receiving phentolamine alone and patients receiving phentolamine in addition to a beta-blocker.

Luminal {{area of a}} normal and a stenotic coronary artery was determined before and after PTCA using <b>biplane</b> quantitative <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography.</b> Patients were studied at rest, during supine bicycle exercise and 5 mm after 1 · 6 mg sublingual nitroglycerin. Workloads before and after PTCA were identical. Percentage diameter stenosis decreased from 78 % to 24 % (P < 0 · 001) after PTCA. Mean pulmonary artery pressure increased during exercise from 21 to 40 mmHg (P < 0 · 001) before and from 19 to 34 mmHg (P < 0 · 001) after PTCA. Peak exercise pulmonary artery mean pressure was significantly (P < 0 · 05) lower after PTCA.

METHODS: A questionnaire was sent out {{to the members of the}} Swiss Society of Cardiology. In the first study 78 patients with an echocardiographic diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who had undergone <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> or had been followed-up for > 5 years were investigated. In a second study, the echocardiograms of 50 patients with either idiopathic cardiomyopathy or severe coronary heart disease, all of whom had also undergone <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography,</b> were reviewed by two independent echocardiographers without access to any complementary information. RESULT: The questionnaire revealed that one half of the Swiss cardiologists generally refer such patients for <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography.</b> The first study showed that the diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was confirmed in all cases, in which the echocardiographer had been certain of the diagnosis (64 / 78 [82 %]).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of dynamic exercise on coronary vasomotion in hypertensive patients in the presence and absence of coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction with abnormal coronary vasodilation in response to acetylcholine {{has been reported in}} patients with arterial hypertension. METHODS: Coronary artery dimensions of a normal and stenotic vessel segment were determined in 64 patients by <b>biplane</b> quantitative <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> at rest and during supine bicycle exercise. Patients were classified into two groups: 20 patients without evidence of coronary artery disease (10 normotensive, 10 hypertensive [group 1]) and 44 patients with coronary artery disease (26 normotensive, 18 hypertensive [group 2]). Both groups were comparable with regard to clinical characteristics, serum cholesterol levels, body mass index, exercise capacity and hemodynamic data. RESULTS: Mean aortic pressure was significantly higher in hypertensive than normotensive patients. Exercise-induced vasodilation of the normal vessel segment was similar in normotensive and hypertensive patients without coronary artery disease (group 1), namely, + 19 % versus + 20 %. However, in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, exercise-induced vasodilation was significantly less in both normal and stenotic vessel segments than in normotensive subjects (+ 1 % vs. + 20 % for normal [p < 0. 003] and - 20 % vs. - 5 % for stenotic vessels [p < 0. 025]). Administration of 1. 6 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin at the end of exercise led to a normalization of the vasodilator response in normotensive as well as hypertensive patients. However, this response became progressively abnormal in group 2 when coronary artery disease was present. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of coronary artery disease, the vasomotor response to exercise is normal in both normotensive and hypertensive patients. However, in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, an abnormal response of the coronary vessels can be observed, with a reduced vasodilator response to exercise in normal arteries but an enhanced vasoconstrictor response in stenotic arteries. This behavior of the epicardial vessels during exercise suggests the occurrence of endothelial dysfunction (i. e., functional defect) that is not evident in the absence of coronary artery disease.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate coronary vasomotor response to dynamic exercise in patients with coronary artery disease with and without arterial hypertension and to determine the effect of calcium antagonists on coronary vasomotion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional areas of a normal and a stenotic coronary vessel segment were examined in 79 patients with coronary artery disease at rest and during supine bicycle exercise (Ex). Change in luminal area after acute administration of a calcium antagonist (diltiazem or nicardipine), during exercise, and after sublingual nitroglycerin (percent change compared with rest = 100 %) was assessed by <b>biplane</b> quantitative <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography.</b> Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (control) consisted of 48 patients without (normotensive subjects, n = 30; hypertensive subjects, n = 18) and group 2 of 31 patients with (normotensive subjects, n = 15; hypertensive subjects, n = 16) pretreatment with a calcium antagonist immediately before exercise. The groups did not differ with regard to clinical characteristics or hemodynamic data measured during exercise. Mean aortic pressure at rest, however, was significantly increased in hypertensive patients compared with normotensive subjects in group 1 (103 mm Hg versus 92 mm Hg, P <. 01) and group 2 (110 mm Hg versus 98 mm Hg, P <. 025). In group 1, exercise-induced vasomotor response was significantly different between normotensive and hypertensive patients in normal (+ 20 % versus + 1 %, P <. 003) and stenotic vessels (- 5 % versus - 20 %, P <. 025). However, in group 2 there was coronary vasodilation in normotensive and hypertensive patients for both normal (delta Ex + 23 % versus + 21 %, P = NS) and stenotic vessel segments (+ 24 % versus + 26 %, P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal coronary vasomotion during exercise can be observed in hypertensive patients with reduced vasodilator response in normal arteries and enhanced vasoconstrictor response in stenotic arteries. Calcium antagonists prevent the abnormal response of normal and stenotic coronary arteries to exercise in hypertensive patients and thus may compensate for endothelial dysfunction with reduced vasodilator response to exercise...|$|R

In group 2 luminal area increased after intracoronary administration of diltiazem (+ 19 %, P< 0 · 01), during bicycle exercise (+ 23 %, P< 0 · 001) and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (+ 39 %, P< 0 · 001). Stenotic vessel: In the control group luminal area decreased significantly (− 29 %, P< 0 · 001) during bicycle exercise but increased after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin {{at the end of}} the exercise test (+ 12 %, NS vs. rest). In group 2 intracoronary administration of diltiazem was associated with a mild increase in stenosis area (+ 11 %, P< 0 · 05). There was a further increase in stenosis area during bicycle exercise (+ 23 %, P< 0 · 001 vs. rest) and after sublingual nitroglycerin (+ 32 %, P< 0 · 001). Coronary vasodilation of the stenotic segment was, however, significantly more pronounced after sublingual nitroglycerin in group 2 than 1 (+ 32 % versus 12 %, P< 0 · 05). Thus, it is concluded that diltiazem prevents exercise-induced coronary vasoconstriction of the stenotic vessel segment probably due to its direct vasorelaxing action on the smooth vasculature. Diltiazem combined with nitroglycerin elicits an additive effect on coronary vasodilation of the stenotic vessel segments but not on the normal coronary arteries. The exact mechanism of this additive effect is not clear but might be due to the combined action of the two vasoactive drugs with different mode of actio...|$|R

These angiographic signs are described and the clinical implications of proper demonstration of the anomalous circumflex coronary artery are discussed. Additional Indexing Words: <b>Coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> RIGIN of the left circumflex coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva is a well known anatomic variation which has no clinical significance per se. Recognition and angiographic demonstration of the anomalous artery assumes high priority, however, in patients undergoing evaluation for direct coronary artery surgery or prosthetic valve replacement. This anomaly has been recognized in 0. 67 % of patients undergoing selective <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> in our laboratory. Certain angiographic signs during left ventriculography and selective opacification of the left coronary artery have proved reliable in recognizing the presence of the anomaly, thus allowing its proper demonstration. Failure to demonstrate the anomaly can lead to erroneous inter-pretations of coronary artery anatomy and can prove hazardous to the patient. It is the purpose of this com-munication to describe 20 examples of this anomaly recognized among 2996 patients undergoing selective <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> on one or more occasion...|$|R

The two groups were similar with regard to important baseline variables. During the initial hospital stay, <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> was performed in 93. 9 % of the routine catheterization group and 34. 7 % of the selective catheterization group (p < 0. 001), but the frequency of coronary revascularization (angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery) was similar {{in the two groups}} (24. 4 % versus 20. 7 %, p = NS). Coronary arteriograms showed a predominance of zero or one vessel disease (stenosis ≥ 60 %) in both groups (routine catheterization group 73. 1 %, selective catheterization group 61. 3 %). During the 1 st year after infarction, rehospitalization for cardiac reasons and the interim performance of <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> were more common in the selective catheterization group (37. 9 % versus 27. 6 %, p = 0. 007 and 28. 6 % versus 11. 6 %, p < 0. 001, respectively); however, the interim rates of death, nonfatal reinfarction and performance of coronary revascularization procedures were similar. At the end of 1 year, <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> had been performed one or more times in 93. 9 % of the routine catheterization group and 59. 4 % of the selective catheterization group (p < 0. 001), whereas death and nonfatal reinfarction had occurred in 10. 2 % versus 7. 0 % (p = 0. 10) and 8. 6 % versus 9. 0 % (p = 0. 87), respectively. Because the selective <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> policy exposes about 40 % fewer patients to the small but finite risks and inconvenience of the procedure without compromising the 1 year survival or reinfarction rates, it seems to be an appropriate management strategy...|$|R

Two-dimensional echocardiography and aortic root angiography are occasionally unable to delineate the coronary arteries. In neonates, the arterial approach for selective <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> is difficult and may compromise visceral and lower limb perfusion. A venous technique was used in two newborns to define selectively the coronary origins and their distribution.

In six patients a period of physical training changed indeterminate initial tests to definitive ones after the training.

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the modern {{management}} of the non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction). Patients with these syndromes are at varying degrees of risk of (re) infarction and death. This risk can be reliably predicted by clinical, electrocardiographic, and biochemical markers. Aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight), and anti-ischaemic drugs should be offered to all patients, irrespective of the predicted level of risk. Patients at high risk should also receive a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor and should undergo early <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> {{with a view to}} percutaneous or surgical revascularisation. Lower risk patients should undergo non-invasive testing. When inducible myocardial ischaemia is exhibited <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> should follow.
