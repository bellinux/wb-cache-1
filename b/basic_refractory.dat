50|$|The cupola tender {{observes the}} furnace through the sight glass or peep {{sight in the}} tuyeres. Slag will {{rise to the top}} of the pool of iron being formed. A slag hole, located higher up on the {{cylinder}} of the furnace, and usually to the rear or side of the tap hole, is opened to let the slag flow out. The viscosity is low (with proper fluxing) and the red hot molten slag will flow easily. Sometimes the slag which runs out the slag hole is collected in a small cup shaped tool, allowed to cool and harden. It is fractured and visually examined. With acid refractory lined cupolas a greenish colored slag means the fluxing is proper and adequate. In <b>basic</b> <b>refractory</b> lined cupolas the slag is brown.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} part of steelmaking is the formation of slag, which floats {{on the surface of}} the molten steel. Slag usually consists of metal oxides, and acts as a destination for oxidised impurities, as a thermal blanket (stopping excessive heat loss) and helping to reduce erosion of the refractory lining. For a furnace with <b>basic</b> <b>refractories,</b> which includes most carbon steel-producing furnaces, the usual slag formers are calcium oxide (CaO, in the form of burnt lime) and magnesium oxide (MgO, in the form of dolomite and magnesite). These slag formers are either charged with the scrap, or blown into the furnace during meltdown. Another major component of EAF slag is iron oxide from steel combusting with the injected oxygen. Later in the heat, carbon (in the form of coke or coal) is injected into this slag layer, reacting with the iron oxide to form metallic iron and carbon monoxide gas, which then causes the slag to foam, allowing greater thermal efficiency, and better arc stability and electrical efficiency. The slag blanket also covers the arcs, preventing damage to the furnace roof and sidewalls from radiant heat.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} new {{refractories}} for copper converters is addressed in this thesis. Penetration resistance is viewed as the first property that must be evaluated for the selection of new refractories since {{it is known that}} melt penetration can promote or enhance the main wear mechanisms in copper converters: dissolution, erosion and spalling. Thus, a penetration test was designed where it is possible to control the oxygen potential and the "in-situ" formation of converter melts by injecting a mixture of inert gas and oxygen according to thermodynamic calculations. Initially, the effects of oxygen potential and matte grade on three different refractories (burned magnesite chrome brick, burned spinel bonded magnesite brick and spinel direct bonded) were studied using the operating conditions of copper converters. This allowed the selection of a potential candidate, the spinel direct bonded brick. Subsequently, the effect of time, temperature and melt composition on the penetration resistance of this candidate was studied and compared with the current refractory used in copper converter, namely burned magnesitechrome brick. The reactions occurring at the refractory pill-interface, the mechanisms and kinetics of penetration and the differences in performance were determined. In addition the mechanism of dissolution and penetration of magnetite coatings applied into <b>basic</b> <b>refractories</b> were elucidated since it is considered important when proposing new solutions and alternative refractories to avoid or reduce wear in copper converters...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} reaction mechanisms, when unused chrome-magnesite, magnesite-chrome and magnesite refractories {{are exposed}} to sulfur-bearing gas mixtures of SO 2 -O 2, SO 2 -N 2 and SO 2 at 700 °C to 1350 °C, were investigated. The investigations comprised chemical analyses, thermodynamic analyses and microstructural examination. The extent of the conversion reactions was measured {{as a function of}} temperature and reaction time. Six <b>basic</b> <b>refractories</b> were investigated and characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) methods. The microstructural examination indicated that physical changes in the original microstructure of the refractory could possibly influence the reactions with sulfur-bearing gases and the chemical analyses of the product phases confirmed the formation of secondary sulfates within pores, along grain boundaries and cracks. The structural features in the original refractory were determined by technological processes employed during original firing in production. The factors attributed to the principal physical changes of the original microstructure were related to the diffusion processes, which affected the phase distribution, pore size distribution and grain size. The fundamental reactions involved in the pore size distribution and microstructure were attributed to the differential diffusion mechanism of individual components that resulted in the development of magnesia spinels. The effects on the microstructure demonstrated that the reactions were limited to the grain boundary region due to the product layer formed as the reactions progressed. The chemical product analyses indicated that in the sulfates formed, the sulfation reactions were significantly affected by the equilibrium thermodynamics of the oxygen and sulfur dioxide gas combination in the products of 1 / 2 SO 2 O 2 P P. The phase changes led to the dissolution of the refractory components and crystallization of MgO and CaO. This influenced the permeability of the sulfur-bearing gases that reacted to form MgSO 4 and CaSO 4 found as grain boundary and pore space fillings. Resistance to sulfur-bearing gas infiltration and sulfation in fine-grained direct bonded refractories were found to be better than that of the coarse-grained direct bonded refractories. The decreased sulfation of the fine-grained refractory was related to the restricted diffusion processes due to the stable magnesia spinel phases and retention of the closed pore structure at different temperatures. However, the dissolution and crystallization mechanism described in sulfation, demonstrated that MgSO 4, CaSO 4, CaMg 3 (SO 4) 3 and compound mixtures of sulfate, silica, magnesia and sesquioxides (Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3) were formed along the grain boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{chemical}} composition of a comet nucleus {{can be very}} strictly constrained by combining the latest results on: the core-mantle interstellar dust model, the solar system abundances of the elements, the space observed composition of the dust of comet Halley, and the latest data on the volatile molecules of comet comae. The distribution of the components in the comet nucleus fall naturally into two <b>basic</b> categories – <b>refractories</b> and volatiles. The refractory components are tightly constrained to consist of about 26 % {{of the mass of}} a comet as silicates (a generic term for combinations of the elements Si, Mg, Fe), 23 % complex organic refractory material (dominated by carbon), and about 9 % in the form of extremely small (attogram) carbonaceous/large molecule (PAH) particles. The remaining atoms are in an H 2 O dominated mixture containing of the order of 2 − 3 % each of CO, CO 2, CH 3 OH plus other simple molecules. The H 2 O abundance itself is very strictly limited to ∼ 30 % of the total mass of a comet – not much more nor much less. The refractory to volatile (dust to gas) ratio is about 1 : 1, while the dust to H 2 O ratio is ≈ 2 : 1. The maximum mean density of a fully packed nucleus would be ≈ 1. 65 g cm − 3. The morphological structure of the component materials, following the interstellar dust into the final stage of the presolar cloud contraction, is as tenth micron silicate cores with organic refractory inner mantles and outer mantles of “ices ” with each grain containing many thousands of the attogram carbonaceous/large molecule particles embedded in the icy and outer organic fraction...|$|R

40|$|Low carbon {{ferrochrome}} is {{a primary}} alloying element {{in the production of}} stainless steel. The Mixing Method (Perrin and Duplex) processes are most commonly used for the production thereof. However, during the cocktailing step, process temperatures are extremely high, resulting in rapid deterioration of the ladle refractories and fuming of the products. The high temperature {{is a result of the}} exothermic silicothermic reduction reactions. A significant amount of energy is lost to the atmosphere. The Furnace Method, and in particular the Liquid Feed Furnace Method, has the potential to improve on the shortcomings of the Mixing Method. A techno-economic evaluation was performed on the different process routes to identify whether or not there is merit in choosing one over the other. The evaluation showed that the capital cost for the methods are comparable, but a saving in the operating cost is achievable when using the Furnace Method instead of the Mixing Method. Savings of 7. 3 to 7. 9 % were calculated for the Solid Feed Furnace Method and 9. 6 to 10. 7 % for the Liquid Feed Furnace Method, when compared to the Mixing Method. This is largely due to the lower energy requirement and raw material consumptions for the Furnace Method. The oxidising conditions in the Mixing Method ore-lime melt furnace, combined with a high slag basicity and high operating temperatures, are very conducive for producing hexavalent chromium, which is severely toxic to humans. Leaching tests, performed on a dust sample from an existing facility that uses the Perrin process, confirmed that a significant amount of Cr(VI) was produced. This poses a severe health and safety risk, as well as a financial burden to properly neutralise and dispose of any Cr(VI) that has formed. A closed furnace with little to no air ingress is used in the Furnace Method, thereby ensuring a more neutral atmosphere. A lower basicity slag, with a lower liquidus temperature is also used, thereby further decreasing the amount of Cr(VI) that would be likely to form. Having established that the Furnace Method has definite advantages over the Mixing Method, the preferred refractory-slag system was identified by means of thermochemical modelling. Different combinations of lime and doloma fluxed slag were modelled with magnesia and doloma refractories. Quartz fluxed slag in contact with an alumina lining was also considered to identify any unexpected benefits. The required slag liquidus temperature, to be compatible with low carbon ferrochrome alloy (which has a very high liquidus temperature), was determined to be between 1550 and 1700 ºC. Modelling showed that a quartz fluxed slag had a liquidus temperature well below this range for a very wide basicity range evaluated. Such a slag would therefore not be suitable. While a doloma fluxed slag had a liquidus temperature within this range, the slag basicity for that range would be very low and not be compatible with any of the two <b>basic</b> <b>refractory</b> systems evaluated. Doloma refractories were also found to suffer severe wear at an operating temperature of 1750 ºC, the temperature required to ensure that the alloy is molten. The required basicity range for a lime fluxed slag that had a liquidus temperature between 1550 and 1700 ºC was found to be 1. 68 to 1. 90. The slag only became saturated in MgO above a slag basicity of 1. 99. However, in a commercial-size furnace, the temperature at the refractory hot face would be lower than the process temperature, provided that the slag bath was not excessively turbulent. Sidewall cooling would also assist in maintaining a slag freeze lining. Operating with a slag basicity within the 1. 68 to 1. 90 range should therefore not pose a severe risk. As the process will be operated on a semi-batch basis, the variation of the slag and alloy composition throughout the heat could potentially result in a material that is not compatible with the refractory lining. Two scenarios were modelled, where FeSiCr was added to an ore-lime mixture, and vice versa. The first was found not to be detrimental to the refractories, but there is a concern regarding the high liquidus temperature of the ore-lime melt at the start of the heat. For the second scenario, magnesium was found to report to the gas and alloy phases at the start of the heat. This is of great concern as it would severely damage the refractory lining. To utilise as much of the exothermic energy as possible, while ensuring the integrity of the refractory lining, it was suggested to feed a portion of the ore-lime mixture first, followed by all of the FeSiCr before feeding the remainder of the ore-lime mixture. Feeding crushed, solid FeSiCr allows for better control. However, the latent heat and sensible heat of the FeSiCr would not be utilised. Smelting tests were performed with samples that had slag target basicities of 1. 5 and 2. 0 to investigate the phases that were formed and the severity of the slag-refractory interaction. The composition of the slag with a basicity of 1. 5 corresponded well with that predicted by the thermochemical model, while the slag composition for a target basicity of 2. 0 was very variable. This was due to the high solids content in the slag, which was operated close to its liquidus temperature. The slag CrO content was much lower and the alloy Cr content much higher for both tests, when compared to the values predicted by modelling. The extent to which the reduction reactions occurred was therefore higher than predicted by modelling. The reasons for this would have to be verified by analysing the mechanism by which the reactions occur. The complete dissolution of a refractory disc that was placed in the mixture for the test with a slag target basicity of 1. 5, along with slag penetration into the high density magnesia crucible, indicates that the 1. 5 basicity slag was not compatible with the magnesia. This is in agreement with the model. Although the refractory disc was still discernable for the test at a slag target basicity of 2. 0, it was severely worn. Slag penetration into the high density magnesia crucible was also evident. A freeze lining would therefore always be required. The Furnace Method can be considered as a suitable alternative to the Mixing Method. However, care should be taken to control the slag basicity in the region of 1. 70 and a freeze lining should be maintained to protect the refractories. The batch feed sequence is also critical to find a balance between having a liquid slag, while still retaining refractory integrity.
