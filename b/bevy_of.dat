It was initially exhibited as A Composition, taken from the Eleventh Book of Milton's Paradise Lost, and was referred to by Etty himself as The <b>Bevy</b> <b>of</b> Fair Women and The Origin of Marriage. By 1862, when it was shown at the International Exhibition, it had acquired its present title.|$|E

He commanded a number of ships of the line in the following years, in the Baltic, North Sea and off of the French coast. He was promoted to rear-admiral in 1814, but did not receive a seagoing command. He married in 1818 and died in 1826, having served with prominent naval officers like Hood, Jervis and Nelson in a long and distinguished career.|$|E

The team was not officially disbanded until April 1995 but not before the league damaged its credibility by twice giving provisional approval to a relocation to Jackson, Mississippi, {{to the point where the}} Mississippi team was included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching staff, only to have the deal collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned the Posse. A group from Miami, Florida tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of the Posse and move them to South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.|$|E

5|$|On the field, the Australians—captained by Richie Benaud—were successful. They {{defeated}} Pakistan 2–0 {{in three}} Tests, and India 2–1 over five matches. Australia’s only other Test win on Pakistani soil came in 1998 {{and they have}} only won two series in India since the Benaud-Loxton expedition. They also remained unbeaten outside the Test matches. Despite the success with bat and ball, the Australians were struck down by serious illness during {{the second part of}} their tour in India, despite taking Dr. Ian McDonald—a former Victorian first-class cricketer—with the travelling party. Gordon Rorke, Lindsay Kline and Gavin Stevens all contracted hepatitis; the former two were sent home, while the latter was too ill to fly back to Australia {{until the end of the}} tour. Harvey said that Stevens—who never played first-class cricket again after his illness—"could've been the first man to die on tour". Due to the <b>bevy</b> <b>of</b> unfit players, Loxton was forced to line up in one game, against Indian Universities in Bangalore, two years after playing his last first-class match. He scored 33 and bowled six overs without taking a wicket in a high-scoring draw.|$|E

From the inside, each of us will know for ourselves. From the outside, we can only speculate, though it doesn’t seem to matter {{that no one can}} ever be sure. It is quite {{remarkable}} that questions we ask about life and death have close parallels in the context of gravity, and these questions are even forced upon us when we consider quantum effects. As we watch from afar, we might see a star burn up its nuclear fuel to eventually undergo gravitational collapse. If the star were to collapse within a critical radius, it would become a black hole with a horizon at the critical radius. However, we will never actually “see ” the formation of a black hole as the collapsing star will appear to freeze in its motion just outside the black hole horizon. When we include quantum effects in our calculations of gravitational collapse, the collapsing star slowly leaks off energy, and its mass depletes during collapse. For an “asymptotic ” observer, an observer far away from the star, gravitational collapse leads to a “frozen star ” or “black star ” which evaporates by quantum effects 1. Since the evaporation occurs at a steady rate, all the initial mass of the star gets depleted even as the collapsing matter i...|$|R
