5|$|A {{reversible}} surgical method {{under investigation}} is reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) {{which consists of}} injecting a polymer gel, styrene maleic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, into the vas deferens.

Ultrasound and methods to heat the testicles have undergone preliminary studies.|$|E

5|$|After the {{monument}} was discovered and {{identified in the}} twentieth century, a folk motif came {{to be associated with}} it. According to this story, the circle's stones had landed in their location after having been hurled at Corfe Castle by the Devil. This is a variant of a story that has also been connected to the Agglestone Rock near Studland. According to stories associated with this large sandstone <b>block,</b> <b>it</b> had been thrown by the Devil from The Needles on the Isle of Wight, with the intention of hitting either the castle, Sherborne Abbey, Bindon Abbey, or Salisbury Cathedral.|$|E

Critical response to Growing the Big One was largely positive; some critics praised the story and Doherty's performance, while others were more critical of the chemistry between the two lead actors. It was released on DVD three days following the film's premiere.|$|E
5|$|When an SSD {{is writing}} {{large amounts of}} data sequentially, the write {{amplification}} is equal to one meaning there is no write amplification. The reason is as the data is written, the entire block is filled sequentially with data related to the same file. If the OS determines that file is to be replaced or deleted, the entire block can be marked as invalid, {{and there is no}} need to read parts of it to garbage collect and rewrite into another <b>block.</b> <b>It</b> will need only to be erased, which is much easier and faster than the read-erase-modify-write process needed for randomly written data going through garbage collection.|$|E

5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to <b>block</b> <b>it,</b> as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E
5|$|In February 1976, Koubek {{contributed a}} third {{high-rise}} office building to Farragut Square, {{this one a}} brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW. His massive, grid-like 400 North Capitol Street, {{one of the few}} office buildings he designed with a plaza between two wings, opened in June. His 12-story International Square building—with its inverted setbacks above the Farragut West Washington Metro station, ninth-floor balcony with non-structural columns, interior atrium, and ground level set-back retail concourse—opened in November. Originally just a single office building on a corner for a city <b>block,</b> <b>it</b> expanded to occupy nearly the entire block with the addition of two almost identical towers in 1979 and 1980. (The atrium was upgraded and a fountain added in 1992.) Two blocks to the west, in April 1977 Koubek also designed a fairly nondescript office building at 1990 K Street NW.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} {{eastern side of}} the house is an orangery, which was built as a {{greenhouse}} in 1701 and has a glazed roof which was added around 1800 by Humphrey Repton. The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to eat on the days when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable <b>block.</b> <b>It</b> is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E

5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 3, 1953, {{was the second}} held under the city charter of 1951 and represented the first test of the Democratic city government of Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr. In the 1951 election, the voters had elected a Democratic mayor {{for the first time}} in 67 years, breaking the Republican hold on political power in the city. They had also elected a majority-Democratic City Council along with Democrats for district attorney and other citywide offices (also called row offices). In 1953, the voters had the chance to continue the Democratic trend or to <b>block</b> <b>it</b> in the election for City Controller, Register of Wills, and various judges and magistrates. On election day, the Republican organization recovered from their 1951 losses, electing all their candidates citywide. Republicans celebrated the victory, but subsequent Democratic triumphs in the 1955 and 1959 elections made the 1953 result more of an aberration than a true comeback for the once-powerful Philadelphia Republican machine.|$|E
5|$|The United States National Bank Building in {{downtown}} Portland, Oregon, is {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places. Designed by famed Portland architect A. E. Doyle in a Roman classical style, the four-story building's first section, facing Sixth Avenue, was completed and opened in 1917. An extension westward to Broadway, approximately doubling its size, was constructed in 1925. Since then the building has occupied one-half of a city <b>block.</b> <b>It</b> features a four-story-high colonnade of Corinthian order columns at its eastern end, originally the principal façade, and extensive use of glazed terracotta. The interior is also decorated extensively with highly textured materials. The building was constructed for the United States National Bank of Portland (USNB), which ultimately became part of U.S. Bancorp, whose retail banking division operates as U.S. Bank. In 2017, 100 years after the building's opening, it continues {{to serve as the}} bank's main Portland branch.|$|E
5|$|The city of Sacramento also {{wished to}} modify its section of SR 275, which, while not a freeway, was still {{designed}} for motor vehicle traffic.

A ramp from the bridge to N Street was closed in July 2007, allowing the <b>block</b> <b>it</b> had cut diagonally through to be sold. The ramp's counterpart, from L Street to the Tower Bridge, remained open, though the lot that includes it was sold to the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency in 2005. The ramp finally closed to traffic in 2016 {{in conjunction with a}} project to connect 2nd Street in Old Sacramento to Capitol Mall.|$|E

5|$|The present {{courthouse}} {{is located}} at 200 West Dallas Avenue, two blocks west {{of the center of}} the city of Cooper. The building and its property take up half of the city <b>block.</b> <b>It</b> is bordered by Texas State Highway 154 (Dallas Avenue) to the south, Bonham Avenue to the north, NW 2nd Street to the east, and a small alleyway to the west. The courthouse is located slightly south of the geographic center of Delta County. The courthouse serves as the offices for most of the county government, including the county judge, commissioners' court, county auditor, clerk, sheriff, and the justice of the peace. The court also houses all of the county's historical records.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69) is a {{business}} loop running through downtown Port Huron. The first mile or so (1.7km) of BL I-69 runs southeasterly from I-69 at the interchange where it meets I-94. The business loop follows a four-lane freeway until the intersection with 32nd Street. A bit further east, it turns due east–west into a one-way pair of three-lane surface streets, eastbound along Oak Street and westbound along Griswold Street, that run through residential areas on the west and south sides of Port Huron. East of 23rd Street. {{the two halves of}} BL I-69 narrow to two lanes each. In downtown Port Huron, BL I-69 turns northerly running concurrently with BL I-94 on four-lane Military Avenue parallel to the St. Clair River. North of the crossing of the Black River, BL I-69/BL I-94 continues northward on Huron Avenue through downtown. At the intersection with Glenwood Avenue, the business loop turns northwesterly onto Pine Grove Avenue through residential areas {{on the north side of}} the city. The street is five lanes, two in each direction with a center turn lane, and passes under the I-94/I-69 freeway at the toll and customs plazas for the Blue Water Bridge; north of the freeway, there is a ramp to connect to the eastbound direction of the freeway and the bridge. The business loop continues along Pine Grove Avenue, intersecting the southern end of M-25 at Hancock Street. At that intersection, the business loop turns westward for a <b>block.</b> <b>It</b> then turns south along the connector to terminate at westbound I-94/I-69 west of the Blue Water Bridge toll plaza.|$|E
5|$|The Whig Party {{was also}} divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, out of {{politics}} since his fatal shooting of Representative Cilley, had the backing of sitting Whig governor William Owsley, while Archibald Dixon had secured support from former Whig governor Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election would have an injurious effect on Whig hopes of carrying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential election; another former Whig governor, Thomas Metcalfe, concurred. At the Whig nominating convention, both Graves and Dixon withdrew their names and a delegate from Logan County put forward Crittenden's name without his consent. The nomination easily carried before Crittenden's friends could <b>block</b> <b>it.</b> The governorship was less prestigious and paid less than Crittenden's position in the Senate. He {{would also have to}} abandon his growing legal practice before the Supreme Court and would lose input on national issues of importance to him such as the territorial questions that grew out of the Mexican War. Nevertheless, he believed that his candidacy would unite the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky's electoral votes in the general election. He accepted the nomination a week after it was made.|$|E

5|$|Within the Lifestream, Tifa helps Cloud {{reconstruct}} his memories. Cloud {{was never}} accepted into SOLDIER, instead becoming a low-ranking infantryman. The SOLDIER in his memories was his friend Zack. At Nibelheim, Cloud was injured, but fatally wounded Sephiroth, who only survived due to Jenova. Cloud and Zack were then taken for experiments by Hojo, with Zack escaping {{four years later}} with a catatonic Cloud. The two were eventually cornered by Shinra soldiers, and Zack was killed; the combined trauma of his experience, the experiments and Zack's death triggered an identity crisis, with Cloud constructing a false persona around Zack's stories and his own fantasies. Realizing and accepting his past, Cloud recovers and together with Tifa reunites with the party. It is revealed that Aerith's prayer to the Planet was successful: the Planet had attempted to summon Holy to prevent Meteor's impact, but Sephiroth blocked Holy. After killing Hojo {{when he tries to}} aid Sephiroth, who is revealed to be Hojo's biological son, the party descends into the Planet's core and defeats both Jenova and Sephiroth. The party escapes and Holy is summoned, attempting to block Meteor as it descends on Midgar. As Meteor is too close, Holy cannot <b>block</b> <b>it,</b> but the Lifestream rises from the planet and aids Holy in destroying Meteor. Five hundred years later, Red XIII is seen with two cubs looking out over the ruins of Midgar, which are now covered in greenery, showing the planet has healed.|$|E
