Firstly this essay illustrates the facts that icons came into being and have been spreading with CMC, brought forth the special nonverbal intercommunicating functions of icons in CMC. Then based on those intercommunicating functions of the <b>body</b> <b>languages</b> in face-to-face communication, the article analyses and discusses the phenomena of icons’ taking on some functions of “internet body languages” and their realistic meanings of this cross-subjects net-language culture...|$|R

5|$|<b>Body</b> <b>Language</b> is {{the ninth}} studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, {{released}} on 10 November 2003 by Parlophone. Following the massive commercial success of her eighth studio album Fever (2001), Minogue enlisted {{a diverse group}} of writers and producers to aid in creating a new album, including Cathy Dennis, Dan Carey, Emiliana Torrini, Johnny Douglas and Mantronix among others. Influenced by the musical works of the 1980s and artists like Prince and Scritti Politti, <b>Body</b> <b>Language</b> musically differs from Minogue's previous albums, which mainly featured disco-oriented dance-pop tracks, and instead explores genres like synthpop, electroclash, R, and hip hop. Many tracks in <b>Body</b> <b>Language</b> contain references to songs from the 1980s and lyrically, the album touches upon themes of enjoyment, flirting, and sex.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} how the corporeality (physicality and materiality) {{of language}} makes it untenable {{to view the}} <b>body</b> and <b>language</b> as entirely distinct categories, particularly in drama. When language is made to act instead of mean, {{the distinction between the}} <b>body</b> and <b>language</b> is removed. Schizophrenia is a good example to illustrate what is meant by the effacement of the boundary between the <b>body</b> and <b>language,</b> because it is the inability to coordinate between materiality and signification. Materialization of the fragmented body and subject through the physicality of language is where the distinction between the <b>body</b> and <b>language</b> gets lost. I think it is at this point that theatre attempts to free itself from the constraints of representation. Instead of dealing with metaphors, symbols and analogies, a text is put into action through the materiality and physicality of language. The poststructuralist deconstruction of the unified subject and subjectivity, especially in relation to the constructive and performative aspects of language casts light on an important dimension of the move away from the classical representational paradigm and why theatre seeks to be nonrepresentational to find its own voice. Beckett is one of the writers who questioned and blurred the boundary between the <b>body</b> and <b>language.</b> In this thesis, I discuss the possibilities Beckett created in terms of freeing theater from the constraints of representation and meaning through the plays Not I, Act Without Words II, What Where, and Play...|$|R
5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's <b>body</b> <b>language</b> and willing to work accurately {{at a distance from}} the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.|$|E

40|$|Unlived {{experiences}} of the <b>body,</b> <b>languages,</b> space, and time lead us to restate questions regarding the operations involved in the processes of constituting and transforming subjectivity in the virtual domain, beyond the logic of identity. While it guarantees certain conditions of anonymity, the virtual regime favors suspension of the identity established for "civil life" and propitiates various semiotic processes of identity reconfiguration. This work discusses these processes by making an analytical approximation of the procedures of "presenting oneself" that govern the entry of subjects to virtual communities...|$|R

5|$|Social pragmatic theories, also in {{contrast}} to the constraints view, focus on the social context in which the infant is embedded. According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation. Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, <b>body</b> <b>language,</b> gesture, and smile help infants to understand the meanings of words. Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their {{toothed whale}} counterparts, baleen whales {{are hard to}} study because of their immense size. Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their bulk and lack of <b>body</b> <b>language</b> makes a {{reaction}} impossible to be definitive. However, studies on the brains of humpback whales revealed spindle cells, which, in humans, control theory of mind. Because of this, {{it is thought that}} baleen whales, or at least humpback whales, have consciousness.|$|E
5000|$|In ancient Rome the Latin word adlocutio {{means an}} address {{given by a}} general, usually the emperor, to his massed army and legions, and a general form of Roman salute from the army to their leader. Many {{researches}} of adlocutio focus {{on the art of}} statuary and coinage aspects. It is often portrayed in sculpture, either simply as a single, life-size contraposto figure of the general with his arm outstretched, or a relief scene of the general on a podium addressing the army. Such relief scenes also frequently appear on imperial coinage. The adlocutio {{is one of the most}} widely represented formulas of Roman art. The convention is regularly shown in individual figures like the famous Augustus of Prima Porta or can be put into a narrative context as seen in the Aurelian panel. Gestures and <b>body</b> <b>languages</b> are crucial for the study of adlocutio as in ancient time, as addressing to thousands of soldiers was less penetrable in voice sounds compared to <b>body</b> <b>languages</b> and gestures which were more powerful, infectious of raising the army's enthusiasm. Characteristic of the formula is the outstretched hand of speech as well as the contrapposto pose with the weight clearly shifted to one leg. Much information about adlocutio can be interpreted by these sculptures.|$|R

40|$|Although Gustavo Pérez Firmat left Cuba in 1960, at {{the early}} age of eleven years old, made almost all of his studies in English, and was {{integrated}} into the culture and professional life of the US, the Cuban-american writer still considers himself an exile. This article examines how this identification is produced, in which way Pérez Firmat’s essays explore and eventually articulates an identity signed by exile. We see how, for him, the real space of the nation is, first of all, {{the space of the}} concrete experience of <b>bodies,</b> <b>language,</b> and memory...|$|R
5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and <b>body</b> <b>language</b> during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E

Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role.

5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} believable simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with <b>body</b> <b>language</b> and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, obesity, and global catastrophic risk. It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E

50|$|To use {{the active}} {{listening}} technique to improve interpersonal communication, one puts personal emotions aside during the conversation, asks questions and paraphrases {{back to the}} speaker to clarify understanding, and one also tries to overcome all types of environment distractions.

Eye contact and appropriate <b>body</b> <b>languages</b> are seen as important components to active listening. The stress and intonation may also keep them active and away from distractions.|$|R
