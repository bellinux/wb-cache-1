40|$|Whilst {{there is}} some {{literature}} in the UK and internationally surrounding both peer groups and their activities during <b>break-times</b> and more generally group-work within the class-room, there is no research, as yet, that focuses specifically on the influence that peer groups' activity during <b>break-times</b> has on pedagogy. This is an under-explored and under-theorised area which {{suggests that there is}} little understanding in education of how social relationships outside the class-room influence learning within the class-room. Moreover, much of the available literature focusing on teaching and learning seems to have been underpinned by traditional models of learning. This research seeks to highlight the importance of friendships and its direct relationship with learning through the exploration and application of the socio-cultural theory (in particular through the work of Vygotsky and his zone of proximal development, Lave and Wenger's (1998) Communities of Practice literature and Bronfenbrenner's (1979) ecological approach). Here, learning is reconceptualised by moving the focus away from the individual in isolation and the personal, towards a focus on the social and active participation. This qualitative research Main Study was carried out within the autumn term in a secondary school in Wales. Taking part in the research were a total of forty-four female pupils (all within Key Stage 3) and eight teachers. The pupils participated in focus groups (which were all tape-recorded) and one friendship group from each year volunteered for participant observation which took place over two full days per group. The teachers were all interviewed individually using semi-structured interviews. The data from the field was all transcribed and analysed using the socio-cultural framework. A narrative was also written to help to provide a more holistic view of the data and to help situate the experience of friendships within the whole school day. One main over-riding theme emerged from the transcription, that of 'the secret world of friendship'. The theme revealed how much of peer group activity during <b>break-times</b> was opaque to many teachers and how pupils played out their powerlessness within the class-room in the face of oppression (due to the way that the education system is presently structured). Many secret notes were passed around and personal objects used as acts of resistance. The data showed that negotiating identities (by curtailing the tension between the personal and the social) and generally managing social relationships were a key element in a school pupil's life and important in their overall identity, but this area still remains predominantly secret to, or ignored by, many teachers. The socio-cultural approach highlights many of the tensions that are embedded within the present structure of the education system as it stands. By adopting this approach, or gaining an awareness of its key premises, the personal and the social become reunited and peer groups can become a positive and productive part of learning.

40|$|In {{this study}} the food habits of {{schoolchildren}} aged 11 - 15 years in three primary schools in Manzini, Swaziland were described and explored. Their eating patterns and {{the composition of}} their meals during the week and over weekends, together with their familiarity, consumption and preference rating of selected traditional foods were established. The school meal programme {{and other aspects of}} the school food environment were also included as part of the study. As there is limited information on the food habits of Swazi people in general, and no recent information available on the food habits of Swaziland’s primary schoolchildren, this study has contributed to filling a gap in the literature. Studies done in other sub-Saharan African countries on the food habits of schoolchildren have reported changes in their dietary intake due to migration, urbanisation, modernisation and Westernisation, processes also found in this country’s history. This explorative and descriptive cross-sectional study is deductive in nature and followed a quantitative research design. A self-administered, pre-tested survey questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended questions was developed and completed by 300 Grade 5, 6 and 7 primary schoolchildren to determine their eating and consumption patterns. The results reflect a change in daily meal patterns from the traditional two meals to the Western-orientated eating pattern of three meals a day with in-between-meal snacking. In-between meal snacking was more common during the week than over weekends. For the majority of the respondents breakfast consisted of either bread or a soft porridge prepared from sorghum or maize meal and tea. Lunch and supper meals were markedly predominantly stiff maize meal porridge served with a legume dish, meat stew or a vegetable relish. Rice is increasingly being eaten for lunch (25 %) and supper (35 %). Both healthy and unhealthy food and beverage choices were consumed as in-between-meal snacks. This, together with the reported low vegetable, fruit and milk consumption by the majority, is a matter of concern. Most of the selected traditional foods and dishes listed were familiar and consumed by the majority of the respondents. Although some traditional foods and dishes received a low preference rating, the children preferred most of those listed with the exception, as could be expected, of the bitter tasting green leafy vegetables. Concerning the school food environment, results revealed that the majority brought money to purchase food items from vendors during <b>break-times.</b> With the exception of fruit and fruit juice, most of the food items for sale were products with a high fat, sugar or sodium content. Most of the respondents participated in the school meal programme. Although the schoolchildren were satisfied with the meals served, they could not be regarded as nutritionally adequate. This study not only provided empirical data on the food habits of this group of Swazi schoolchildren, but also gave valuable insights into the school food environment. The important role of the school environment in promoting healthy eating was once again confirmed. Based on {{the findings of this study}} recommendations and guidelines to promote healthy eating in Swaziland’s primary schools were formulated.

40|$|Research has {{suggested}} that the decline in physical activity (PA) levels for adolescent girls is most marked during the transition from primary school to secondary school. However, this decline in PA for adolescent girls is also coincident with the onset of maturation and as such, maturation and the physical changes associated with maturation (e. g., increased body fat and development of secondary sexual characteristics) may have a direct influence on PA. In addition, these physical changes may indirectly influence perceptions of competence and body attractiveness and subsequently influence PA behaviour. Therefore the aim of this thesis was to further explore this decline in PA during this transitional period. Study one involved a longitudinal examination of the relationship between maturation, physical self-perceptions and PA in adolescent girls over 12 months during the transition from primary to secondary school. At Phase 1 (primary school) 208 adolescent girls participated (mean age = 11. 83 ± 0. 39 years) and were tracked into secondary school (Phase 2) where 156 girls participated (mean age = 12. 79 ± 0. 31 years). PA was assessed using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children; maturation was assessed using the self-report Pubertal Development Scale; physical characteristics of body mass, waist circumference and sum of skinfolds were measured and physical self perceptions were assessed using the Children and Youth‟s Physical Self-Perception Profile. Cross-sectional findings at both Phase 1 and Phase 2 highlighted that maturation and physical characteristics were not significantly related to PA and {{there were no significant differences}} in PA between maturation stages. Results also indicated that physical self-perceptions were all significant moderate positive correlates of PA at both primary and secondary school. Longitudinal findings examining the change in variables over the 12 months highlighted a significant decrease in PA from primary to secondary school. Furthermore, this decrease was evident during <b>break-times,</b> lunch-times and after-school yet PA significantly increased in PE lessons between schools. Maturation had a limited influence on PA behaviour; however the increase in body mass was related to perceptions of body attractiveness and physical self-worth becoming less positive. In addition, decreases in physical self perceptions partially accounted for the decrease in PA over the 12 months. It was apparent from the quantitative findings of study one that further research was needed to explore the influence of additional variables on PA. The aim of study two was to explore the decrease in PA evident during the school transition using a narrative approach. A purposive sampling technique was used and one-to-one narrative interviews were conducted (n = 14; age 13. 6 ± 0. 3 years). Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to identify the „whats‟ (i. e. content) of the girls‟ PA stories and structural analysis was used to identify „how‟ the girls told their PA stories. Findings suggest that the PA environment had an impact on their sense of self with regards to levels of enjoyment, perceived competence, confidence and self-presentation issues. These findings support the current research trend towards a focus on the environment the individual is experiencing rather on the individual. Overall the findings suggested that the decrease in PA behaviour in early adolescent girls may depend more on perceptions of competence and ability in a particular environment rather than the possible influence of the physical changes accompanying maturation.

ISBN 1900990342. This detailed, {{thoughtful}} book {{stands alone}} {{but has a}} follow-on volume, Making the Case for Play: Building Policies and Strategies for School-Aged Children. Taken together, they offer {{an overview of the}} state of play and play policy in England as of 2001, as well as a method of approaching the subject for other countries. I confess to envy as I read the first volume-why don’t we have this kind of information and information gathering on play in the U. S. ? The central government’s Department of Culture Media and Sport funded the Children’s Play Council (CPC) to undertake the study reported in Gathering the Evidence, reviewed here. The CPC and the New Policy Institute made four separate sub-studies and reports. The first, “Something Good and Fun,” uses survey data from English children, youth, and parents to discuss and define play. The second, “The Value of Children’s Play and Play Provision,” surveys and summarizes the research on the play of school-aged children-mainly from British literature but includes some U. S. studies as well. “The Planning and Location of Play Provision in England” is the third report. It surveys government and other agencies to ascertain play policy and provision, including the kind and number of places available for children ages 5 - 16, both supervised and unsupervised, the amount of money spent per child, and the types of agencies and personnel involved. It includes four detailed case studies revealing wide variance by area. The fourth report, “The State of Play,” surveys play professionals, for example, people who work with summer and after school activities in parks and adventure playgrounds, typically as planners and administrators. Anyone concerned with children’s play in a country that has signed on to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (that is, every country but the U. S. and Somalia) will appreciate what that document does for framing the discussion on play. Play is a given for children, so the discussion is about the details of its benefits and the policies necessary to support play. “Something Good and Fun” reveals that children and parents both value active, physical play, especially in the outdoors-preferably in green spaces, although streets are certainly used. Fears of bullying, strangers, traffic, and dirty disorder limit children’s ability to play outdoors as much as they and their parents wish. These findings corroborate those of Last Child in the Woods, by Richard Louv, recently published in the U. S., which expresses concern about the bad effects of lost outdoor play areas. “The Value of Children’s Play and Play Provision” offers details of play’s benefits for children based on a review of numerous recent studies some of which are on health (however, the link between a lack of play and childhood diabetes and obesity is not mentioned). Some of the newer research on brain activity during play is reported, but more up-to-date research should be sought elsewhere. It is heartening to realize that the subject of play continues to attract scholars, in particular regarding subgroups such as minorities, children with disabilities, and girls. Involving children in planning for play spaces and activities is an increasingly frequent topic as well. Play is defined consistently throughout the book as something freely entered into, self-directed by children, and truly “something good and fun. ” This leaves out school-based play, except for <b>break-times.</b> Freely-chosen sports are still included in the definition. By surveying what is being provided for children’s play and also surveying the people who work to offer children more time and space for play, Making the Case for Play is able to take a fairly positive approach to the problem of children’s access to play. It outlines the national, regional, and local structures and organizations with policies and responsibilities for children’s play in the UK. In the U. S., schools often have policies that restricting children from the outdoors, {{even to the point of}} building schools without playgrounds, typically in the cause of making more time for academic activities. In the UK, like in the U. S., play spaces and access to them are lost to development, but Making the Case for Play shows support from the British central government for ameliorating the situation for the sake of children’s development and long-term health. The U. S. central government is instead obsessed with test scores. Making the Case for Play: Gathering the Evidence is an extremely useful book. By showing a structure for surveying play provision and policy, it offers researchers and policy-makers in other countries models for gathering comparable data and provides them with a handy solid summary of recent research. By speaking directly with the players and their parents, the authors were able to capture and present fresh, yet timeless observations about the essential value of play for children. Both public and research libraries ought to have this book...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary It is {{estimated}} that 2, 773, 460 people under 17 {{are in need of}} child and adolescent mental health services provided by the GP or schools. It is also known that half of all anxiety disorders - the most common mental health condition - are experienced before the age of 12 years old. 	Young people face many risk factors for poor mental health but not all young people with mental health conditions seek support or receive the support or services they need. The current environment of austerity means that there is decreasing resourcing of the third sector and increasing pressure on CAMHS. 	‘Shelf Help’ is the name that has been used to market the Reading Well for young people scheme. It is a reading list for those who experience mental health problems between 13 - 18 yrs old, or are friends with, live with, or care for people who do and is. Shelf Help is delivered in partnership with the Society of Chief Librarians as part of the Chief Librarian’s Universal Health Offer. 	Reading Well for young people is endorsed by health professionals and supported by public libraries and provides advice of specific topics such as anxiety, depression, stress, OCD, self-harm, bullying, eating disorders, autism and aspergers as well as general topics to do with adolescence. This research report documents the impact of introducing ‘Shelf Help’ – the Reading Well for young people scheme - into a secondary school environment in partnership with a local charity, which supports the mental wellbeing of young people. 	Adult stakeholders were interviewed during a scoping phase (n= 12) to determine how to discretely monitor the usage and impact of the Reading Well for young people at The Priory School and Phase, in Hitchin. 	Multiple copies of the reading list were given to the School and Phase, and young people were left to interact with the books for 3 months (Dec 2016 – February 2017. The engagement with the books was monitored at each site. Young people and key adult stakeholders were consented to take part in focus groups and interviews (during March 2017). Qualitative analysis of interviews focus groups used to determine the impact of engaging with the Reading Well for young people books. 	 33 participants provided qualitative data for the project, 18 young people and 15 adults. 	 26 participants (8 adults and 18 young people) took part in focus groups and interviews to determine engagement with and impact with the scheme. 	Innovative and successful approaches to getting young people to engage with Shelf Help books were devised e. g. Creating a wellbeing corner in the library, selecting a’ book of the week’, promoting the scheme to the whole school to create inclusivity and talking points, making Shelf Help the focus of wellbeing events, a staff reading challenge, opportunity to write short reviews for other library users. Books were recommended to service users of Phase which included young people and parents. 	 128 Reading Well for young people books were borrowed from the library by 67 people during the 3 months, a further 35 titles were borrowed by 18 users at Phase. Borrowers ranged from year 7 to year 11 as well as adults. Several titles were renewed and many were continually on loan {{for the duration of the}} project. Interestingly, many people used the wellbeing corner to browse and read books during <b>break-times,</b> without taking out loans. Many positive impacts of reading the Shelf Help books were identified. Four key themes emerged in the qualitative research analysis: 	Improved awareness, knowledge and understanding of mental health conditions. 	Improved emotional and mental wellbeing, specifically relating to confidence, self-esteem, hope, isolation and emotional intelligence 	Changes in behaviour and improved relationships 	Normalising and destigmatizing mental health discussions. Through piloting Shelf Help in a secondary school and charity setting there were several areas of learning going forwards. The books can be accessed by people with low, moderate or severe mental health conditions, thus suggestions to develop a supportive environment include: 	 	Ensuring appropriate training in mental first aid to key staff involved in the shelf help scheme – this may include staff who would not normally have this training. 	Provide time and access for staff to read through the list of books and familiarise themselves with the content prior to rolling out to the whole organisation. 	Providing activities, or book groups that would allow young people to discuss the books they have been reading within a facilitated environment, especially where some books may make young people feel sad or upset. 	Ensure the use of the Shelf Help leaflet as much as possible, specifically as it has contact number for support organisations that can be contacted, often 24 / 7. In conclusion, all participants found the Reading Well for young people scheme highly acceptable and the inclusive approach has supported an increase in discussion about mental health in each organisation that piloted ‘Shelf Help’. Further research should now be conducted to further understand the impact of the Reading Well for young people scheme on wellbeing and resilience...|$|R

5000|$|The {{history of}} {{industrial}} mission in Britain is {{strongly associated with}} the city of Sheffield, where the first industrial mission team was established in 1944. Bishop Leslie Hunter, Bishop of Sheffield, was concerned that the Church of England had been losing touch with people in the industrialised cities during the inter-war years, and sent the Revd. Ted Wickham into factories to engage with workers. This mission was well received by working people, and the Sheffield Industrial Mission was set up under Ted Wickham's direction. The purpose of Wickam’s role was to address the ‘problem’ of the progressive estrangement of the working classes from the church which had adversely affected church attendance since the industrial revolution, particularly in industrial cities like Sheffield. Wickham sought to build and sustain an engagement with the working population by visiting steelworks and other heavy industries. His style was participatory. He and his chaplains made regular factory visits engaging people in informal conversation and holding formal <b>break-time</b> discussions about issues of importance to them. The Sheffield model involved development of a theology and set of methods that provided a template which was followed by mission teams {{in other parts of the}} country.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Reliable {{assessment}} of children’s dietary behaviour {{is needed for}} research purposes. The {{aim of this study}} was (1) to investigate the level of agreement between observed and child-reported <b>break-time</b> food items; and (2) to investigate the level of agreement between children’s reports and those of their parents regarding children’s overall consumption of fruit, water and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB). Methods The children in this study were 9 – 13  years old, attending primary schools in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Children were observed with respect to foods brought for <b>break-time</b> at school. At the same day, children completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to recall the food(s) they brought to school to consume during <b>break-time.</b> Only paired data (observed and child-reported) were included in the analyses (n[*]=[*] 407 pairs). To determine each child’s daily consumption and average amounts of fruit, water and SSB consumed, children and their parents completed parallel questionnaires. Only paired data (parent-reported and child-reported) were included in the analyses (n[*]=[*] 275 pairs). The main statistical measures were level of agreement between <b>break-time</b> foods, fruit, water and SSB; and Intra-class Correlation Coefficients (ICC). Results More children reported bringing sandwiches and snacks for <b>break-time</b> than was observed (73  % vs 51  % observed and 84  % vs 33  % observed). The overall agreement between observed and child-reported <b>break-time</b> foods was poor to fair, with ICC range 0. 16 – 0. 39 (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Children reported higher average amounts of SSB consumed than did their parents (1. 3 vs 0. 9  L SSB, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Child and parent estimations of the child’s water and fruit consumption were similar. ICC between parent and child reports was poor to good (range 0. 22 – 0. 62, p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Conclusion Children report higher on amount of <b>break-time</b> foods as compared to observations and children’s reports of SSB consumption are higher than those of their parents. Since the level of agreement between the observed <b>break-time</b> foods and that reported by children and the agreement of child’s intake between parent and child reports are relatively weak, future studies should focus on improving methods of evaluating children’s consumption behaviour or on ways on how to best use and interpret multiple-source dietary intake data.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the length of}} the period of validity of a classical description for the cosmic axion field. To this end, we first show that we can understand the oscillating axion solution as expectation value over an underlying coherent quantum state. Once we include self-interaction of the axion, the quantum state evolves so that the expectation value over it starts to deviate from the classical solution. The time-scale of this process defines the quantum <b>break-time.</b> For the hypothetical dark matter axion field in our Universe, we show that quantum <b>break-time</b> exceeds the age of the Universe by many orders of magnitude. This conclusion is independent of specific properties of the axion model. Thus, experimental searches based on the classical approximation of the oscillating cosmic axion field are fully justified. Additionally, we point out that the distinction of classical nonlinearities and true quantum effects is crucial for calculating the quantum <b>break-time</b> in any system. Our analysis can also be applied to other types of dark matter that are described as classical fluids in the mean field approximation. Comment: 25 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

The primary outcome was the proportion of <b>break-time</b> spent in Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) assessed by the System for Observing Playground Activity in Youth (SOPLAY). The analysis involved linear mixed models adjusting for the clustering effect of schools. The study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN 12614001128684). Results Four schools (two intervention and two control) met the inclusion criteria (1582 children: 790 males; 267 controls, total of 792 females; 248 controls).

40|$|The quantum <b>break-time</b> of {{a system}} is the {{time-scale}} after which its true quantum evolution departs from the classical mean field evolution. For capturing it, a quantum resolution of the classical background - e. g., {{in terms of a}} coherent state - is required. In this paper, we first consider a simple scalar model with anharmonic oscillations and derive its quantum <b>break-time.</b> Next, we apply these ideas to de Sitter space. We formulate a simple model of a spin- 2 field, which for some time reproduces the de Sitter metric and simultaneously allows for its well-defined representation as quantum coherent state of gravitons. The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons turns out to be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while their frequency is given by the de Sitter Hubble parameter. In the semi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known properties of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal Gibbons-Hawking radiation, all in the language of quantum $S$-matrix scatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most importantly, this framework allows to capture the $ 1 /N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical treatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite quantum <b>break-time</b> of the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times $N$. We also point out that the quantum-break time is inversely proportional to the number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum <b>break-time</b> imposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes must have smaller cosmological constants. For the maximal, phenomenologically acceptable number of species, the observed cosmological constant would saturate this bound if our Universe were $ 10 ^{ 100 }$ years old in its entire classical history.

40|$|The {{conditions}} of quantum-classical correspondence {{for a system}} of two interacting spins are investigated. Differences between quantum and classical expectation values are examined for both chaotic and regular conditions well beyond the short-time (Ehrenfest) regime. We find that quantum-classical differences initially grow exponentially with a characteristic exponent consistently larger than the largest Lyapunov exponent. We provide numerical evidence confirming a log(ħ^- 1) <b>break-time</b> rule, but also demonstrate that <b>break-time</b> measures are not robust since in typical cases the largest quantum-classical deviations are only O(ħ) in the limit ħ→ 0. These results confirm the correspondence principle {{in the sense that}} quantum mechanics is found to converge to the classical Liouville flow for a closed chaotic system.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} to quantum-classical correspondence are distinguished {{according to the}} classical dynamical theory with which quantum theory is compared. The first of these, Ehrenfest correspondence, defines a dynamical regime in which the quantum expectation values follow approximately a classical trajectory. The second of these, Liouville correspondence, applies when the quantum probability distributions remain well approximated by a density in the classical phase space. The former applies only for narrow states, whereas the latter may remain valid even for quantum states that have spread to the system size. A spin model is adopted for this correspondence study because the quantum state is discrete and finite- dimensional, and thus no artificial truncation of the Hilbert space is required. The quantum time-evolution is given by a discrete unitary mapping. The corresponding classical model is volume-preserving (non-dissipative) and the time-evolution is given by a symplectic map. In classically chaotic regimes, the widths of initially narrow quantum states grow, on average, exponentially with time, until saturation at the system size. This initial spreading rate is well approximated by the classical Lyapunov exponent when the accessible classical phase space is predominantly chaotic. Because of the exponential growth rate of the quantum variance, the Ehrenfest regime is delimited by a <b>break-time</b> that grows logarithmically with increasing quantum numbers. The small differences between quantum expectation values and corresponding Liouville averages of dynamical variables also grow exponentially, initially, if the classical behaviour is chaotic. This exponential rate is independent of h and consistently larger than the classical Lyapunov exponent by at least a factor of two. Interestingly, this exponential growth rate does not continue until these differences approach magnitudes of order the system size, but crosses over to power-law growth (or simply saturates), when the differences have reached magnitudes no larger than order ħ. Because of the exponential growth of these quantum-classical differences, the Liouville regime is also delimited by a <b>break-time</b> that grows logarithmically with increasing quantum numbers. However, due to the early saturation of the exponential growth of the differences, the Liouville log <b>break-time</b> applies only in a restricted domain. After spreading to the system size, the quantum states relax to an approximately time-independent state. This is characterised by equilibrium distributions that are subject to rapidly oscillating fluctuations about the coarse-grained classical steady-state. If the accessible classical phase space is predominantly chaotic, then the equilibrium quantum probability distributions are nearly microcanonical. Otherwise the steady-state quantum probability distributions accurately reflect {{the details of the}} KAM surfaces in the classical phase space. The equilibrium regime quantum fluctuations, which are quantum-classical differences, are shown to approach zero as a negative power of the quantum numbers. Since the differences between quantum expectation values and individual classical trajectories grow exponentially in time to a magnitude that scales with the system size, the Ehrenfest regime is delimited by an unrestricted log <b>break-time.</b> The log <b>break-time</b> may be short compared to experimental time-scales for some chaotic macroscopic bodies, and, as a result, an observable breakdown of Ehrenfest correspondence may arise for some macroscopic systems. Although the Liouville regime is also delimited by a log <b>break-time,</b> an observable breakdown of correspondence between quantum mechanics and Liouville mechanics for macroscopic bodies is not likely since their differences, expressed relative to the dimensions of the observable, approach zero in the limit of large quantum numbers...|$|E

The classical dynamics is chaotic and we find the classical diffusion rate D is asymmetric in momentum up to a finite time t_r. The quantum behaviour produces a corresponding asymmetry in the momentum distribution which is 'frozen-in' by Dynamical Localisation provided the <b>break-time</b> t^* > t_r. We conclude that the cold atom ratchets require Db/ ħ∼ 1 where b is a small deviation from period-one pulses. Comment: new version with typos correcte...|$|E

The issues {{affect the quality of}} the bus service which then pointed to the efficiency or inefficiency of the bus driver scheduling system. Thus, this study investigates the problem and constraints connected to bus driver scheduling activities as a case in a campus environment. Therefore, we developed an efficient bus driver scheduling model based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach. The GA model is able to schedule efficiently bus drivers to working slots and break in a particular day. It is thus, a time-saving effort and able to satisfy equal break distribution among drivers with overtime work being considered at the same time...|$|E

Each staff will be assigned in three different shift each day. Since the number of staffs equal {{to the number of}} shifts then the problem arises in determining the shift pattern assigned to staff in one cycle period. The shift pattern must consider day-off assignment in one cycle period that prevent staff shortage, and satisfy minimum duration of betweendays <b>break-time</b> to prevent the staff experiences fatigue. We determine optimal cycle period that distribute each shift type in average among 3 staffs, then we develop shift pattern by assigning off-day and shift types in one cycle period.

The relationships between 56 school-level variables and Fat Mass Index (FMI; fat mass (kg) /height (m 2)) were investigated among 1724 well characterised children from 92 schools in this cross-sectional study. After stepwise removal of variables from multilevel linear regression models stratified by gender, only three variables {{were significantly associated with}} FMI. Among girls, attending a school with more pupils in the year group was associated with lower FMI, and attending a school with better cycle provision was associated with higher FMI. In boys being allowed to eat any food at <b>break-time</b> was associated with higher FMI. There was some evidence of moderation of the relationship between cycle provision and FMI by urban-rural location. These data suggest that few school factors are associated with FMI, and provide limited pointers to inform potential future school-based interventions to reduce obesity...|$|E

Differences between quantum expectation values and classical Liouville averages are examined for both regular and chaotic dynamics well beyond the short-time regime of narrow states. We find that quantum-classical differences initially grow exponentially with a characteristic exponent consistently larger than the largest Lyapunov exponent. We provide numerical evidence that {{the time of the}} break between the quantum and classical predictions scales as log(J/ ħ), where J is a characteristic system action. However, this log <b>break-time</b> rule applies only while the quantum-classical deviations are smaller than order hbar.
