The {{projection}} <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> {{one of a}} {{convex body}} K in R^n is the body whose support function is, up to a constant, the average mean width of the orthogonal projections of K onto hyperplanes through the origin. The paper contains an inequality for the support function of the projection <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> one of K which implies in particular that such a function is strictly convex, unless K has dimension one or two. Furthermore, an existence problem related to the reconstruction of a convex body is discussed to highlight the different behavior of the area measures of order one and of order n − 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{we will discuss}} the Hankel {{determinants}} H(f) =a_ 2 a_ 4 -a_ 3 ^ 2 of order 2 for normalized concave functions f(z) =z+a_ 2 z^ 2 +a_ 3 z^ 3 + [...] . with a pole at p∈(0, 1). Here, a meromorphic function is called concave if it maps the unit disk conformally onto a domain whose complement is convex. To this end, we will characterize the coefficient <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 2 for the class of analytic functions φ(z) on |z|< 1 with |φ|< 1 and φ(p) =p. We {{believe that this is}} helpful for other extremal problems concerning a_ 2, a_ 3, a_ 4 for normalized concave functions with a pole at p. Comment: 10 page...|$|E

2500|$|The Adamantine Arrow: [...] spiritual {{warriors and}} masters of conflict, who claim a {{heritage}} {{going back to}} the First City's defenders. Currently, the <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Arrow could perhaps be described as something akin to a knightly sect, though bushido and other warrior codes find a place in The Arrow. [...] These mages conduct intensive physical and mental training, honing the minds and <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> members into deadly weapons which magical society may then wield against its enemies (such as , , Seers of the Throne, and so on).|$|R
5000|$|Electors in the Council {{include the}} members of the Sovereign Council, other office-holders and representatives of the members <b>of</b> the <b>Order.</b> The Grand Master is aided by the Sovereign Council (the {{government}} <b>of</b> the <b>Order),</b> which is elected by the Chapter General, the legislative <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Order.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many local <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> the <b>order</b> were absorbed, {{along with}} those of other {{appendant}} Odd Fellow organizations into the Ancient Mystic <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Samaritans., while others continued to exist independently as late as until 1934.

50|$|Until 2003, Portugal had {{a system}} of {{permanent}} military courts that dealt with the military justice, which constituted a separate jurisdiction.

As lower instance courts of military justice, several territorial military courts and the Naval Military Court also existed.|$|R
25|$|In the 15th century, various popes endeavoured {{to promote}} reforms. All these efforts at a reform <b>of</b> the great <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>order</b> proved unavailing; but local reforms, {{producing}} various semi-independent offshoots and congregations, were successfully {{carried out in}} many parts {{in the course of}} the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} seven shoguns reissued the buke shohatto in its 1683 form, {{with only}} the most minor of stylistic changes. Though these were once pronounced along with the Shoshi hatto (laws for samurai), the latter became largely obsolete after 1683 and was absorbed into the wider <b>body</b> <b>of</b> shogunal <b>orders</b> and prohibitions (the kinrei-ko).|$|R
5|$|The Supreme Council is the {{governing}} <b>body</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Order</b> and {{is composed of}} elected representatives from each jurisdiction. In {{a manner similar to}} shareholders at an annual meeting, the Supreme Council elects seven members each year to the Supreme Board of Directors for three-year terms.

50|$|The Ancient Mystic <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> Cabiri (AMOC) {{was founded}} as a {{playground}} {{order for the}} Odd Fellows around 1920, beginning with Oakland Council #1 in Oakland, CA.

The groups held social dances in addition to ceremonials and stated meetings and were also known to organize the Cabiri Band which held public performances.|$|R

The <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Star, a Freemasonry-related fraternal organization open to both men and women, is currently gaining membership among Scottish freemasons.|$|R

5000|$|Astronomers {{now know}} that the four {{brightest}} Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) have satellites. Among the fainter members of the belt only about 10% {{are known to have}} satellites.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} fluid relationship between monastic women and religious orders. I examine {{the roles of}} popes and their representatives, governing <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> religious <b>orders,</b> and the nunneries themselves in outlining the contours of those relationships. At {{the beginning of the}} thirteenth century, many emerging religious communities belonged to small, local groups with loose ties to other nearby houses. While independent houses or regional congregations were acceptable {{at the time of the}} formation of these convents, after the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, monastic houses were required to follow one of three monastic rules and to belong to a recognized order with a well-defined administrative structure and mechanisms for enforcing uniformity of practice. This program of monastic reform had mixed success. Though some nunneries attained official incorporation into monastic or mendicant orders due to papal intervention, the governing <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> these <b>orders</b> were reluctant to take on the responsibility of providing temporal and spiritual guidance to nuns, and for most nunneries the relationship to an order remained unofficial and loosely defined. The continuing instability <b>of</b> <b>order</b> affiliation and identity becomes especially clear in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when war-related destruction forced many nunneries to move into the walled area of the city, often resulting in unions of houses that did not share a rule and order affiliation. Moreover, some individual houses changed rules and orders several times. Though a few local houses of religious women had a strong and durable identification with their order, for many nunneries, the boundaries between orders remained porous and their organizational affiliations were pragmatic and mutable...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the disturbed flow field created by conducting bodies in a mesosonic, collisionless plasma stream is reported. The mid-wake region is investigated, where, for <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> a Debye length in size, the focused ion streams converge to form a significant current density peak on the wake axis. A parametric description is obtained {{of the behavior of}} the amplitude, width, and position of this peak. The results also indicate that portions of the axial ion peak are created by additional mechanisms and that body geometry affects the mid-wake structure only when the sheath is sufficiently thin to conform to the shape <b>of</b> the <b>body...</b>|$|R
