5000|$|John {{had become}} famous for {{landing on the}} Chester Road near The Swan Inn in the 1920s to refuel at a petrol station and for a planned landing on the second highest {{mountain}} in England. In 1926 John Leeming, chairman of Lancashire aero club and Bert Hinkler (1892-1933), the Australian chief test pilot of A.V.Roe Avro Manchester, two daring airmen decided to lift the nation's spirits by being the first aircraft to land on a mountain in Great Britain. They chose to land on Helvellyn in the English Lake District, which is 3,117 feet above sea level. They set off in his Avro Avian 585 two-seater biplane on 22 December. They managed {{to land on the}} stony plateau which tops the fell, witnessed by a fell walker who was visiting the area. An academic, E.R. Dodds (1893-1979), Professor of Greek at the University of Birmingham, recorded the event, signing an old <b>bill</b> (<b>receipt)</b> to that effect, before they took off again. It was quite some feat. The plane had only a 30-yard run-up to the rim overlooking Red Tarn (a lake), as they flew back to Woodford, some 90 miles away south of Manchester. Today the event is marked by a slate which reads: [...] "The first aeroplane to land on a mountain in Great Britain did so on this spot. On December 22nd 1926 John Leeming and Bert Hinkler in an AVRO 585 Gosport landed here and after a short stay flew back to Woodford".|$|E

This paper also described the process to maintain the complete quarter and power consumption details of different section employees. finally, the module of generating reports represented in graphs based on the low tension and high tension readings taken monthly and yearly were studied which contains the power consumption details of the substations working under south central railway. The most significant feature of this system is that all the details are stored in a database such that we can have remote login and the manual errors can also be fixed. II.
