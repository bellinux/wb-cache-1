5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch. A rollback {{occurs when the}} train fails to make it {{over the top of}} the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes retractable magnetic <b>brakes</b> <b>on</b> its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into the loading station.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} off-season, Kings Dominion widened the first high-speed turn {{to lower the}} amount of G-force experienced on the ride. The park's goal was {{to reduce the number}} of blackouts some riders were experiencing. The modification allowed them to remove the trim <b>brakes</b> <b>on</b> the ride's first drop, making it possible for the roller coaster's maximum speed to return to original specifications.|$|E
5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive <b>brakes</b> <b>on</b> the sides of the fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E

30|$|For {{differential}} braking control: (1) In general, to prevent rollover or oversteer accidents, <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> outside wheels on axles {{in front of}} the CG point can generate a larger extra yaw moment than on rear axles. (2) To prevent understeering, <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> the inside wheels on axles after the CG point can generate better effects than <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> the front axles. (3) The largest yaw moment changes generated by <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> each wheel are limited not only by initial forces of the tires, ability of air braking system, and steering angle but also by distances between the axles and CG position. (4) In terms of braking wheel, when the root of the quadratic sum of braking force and lateral force is equal to the radius of Kamm’s Circle, <b>braking</b> wheels <b>on</b> the rear axle need a complex control logic. When the truck is in the danger of drifting, <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> front axles is a better choice.|$|R
50|$|All {{units have}} four braking systems - electro-operating {{regenerative}} brakes and an electromagnetic <b>brake</b> <b>on</b> the drive chassis and an electro-mechanical brake and a spring parking <b>brake</b> <b>on</b> all axles.

5|$|Most drivers {{stayed on}} the track during the caution, {{allowing}} Bowyer to remain the leader on the restart. On lap 48, Michael McDowell drove to the garage because of engine problems. Five laps later, Bowyer led the race, with McMurray 1.3 seconds behind him. Landon Cassill went to the garage due to failing <b>brakes</b> <b>on</b> lap 56. Johnson moved into sixth, as Edwards passed McMurray five laps later for second. By lap 64, Bowyer's lead was over 3.5 seconds.|$|E

The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the <b>brakes</b> <b>on</b> his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E

5|$|The Met {{opened with}} no stock of its own, with the GWR {{and then the}} GNR {{providing}} services. The GWR used eight-wheeled compartment carriages constructed from teak. By 1864, the Met had taken delivery of its own stock, made by the Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co., based on the GWR design but standard gauge. Lighting was provided by gas— two jets in first class compartments and one in second and third class compartments, and from 1877 a pressurised oil gas system was used. Initially the carriages were braked with wooden blocks operated by hand from the guards' compartments at {{the front and back}} of the train, giving off a distinctive smell. This was replaced in 1869 by a chain that operated <b>brakes</b> <b>on</b> all carriages. The operation of the chain brake could be abrupt, leading to some passenger injuries, and it was replaced by a non-automatic vacuum brake by 1876. In the 1890s, a mechanical 'next station' indicator was tested in some carriages on the circle, triggered by a wooden flap between the tracks. It was considered unreliable and not approved for full installation.|$|E

5|$|The second {{qualifying}} period was fifteen minutes in length, {{and was used}} to set positions eleven through to sixteen. It was once again topped by Nico Rosberg, {{who was the first}} person to set a time under 1:43.000 all weekend. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton locked his <b>brakes</b> <b>on</b> the approach to turn 7, damaging his race tyres. Hamilton narrowly avoided elimination, setting a time good enough to proceed on his last attempt. Romain Grosjean was eliminated in eleventh, having overcome issues with his brake balance. Nico Hülkenberg was a surprise elimination in twelfth, having run consistently at the front of the field throughout the weekend. His elimination was attributed to a miscommunication between himself and his engineer over the amount of fuel he had on board. Carlos Sainz Jr. and Fernando Alonso finished thirteenth and fourteenth to fill the seventh row of the grid, ahead of Gutiérrez.|$|E
5|$|Liuzzi {{pulled over}} {{to the inside of}} the circuit on the third lap, at turn ten, with left-rear {{suspension}} damage resulting from contact with the wall. His retirement triggered the deployment of the safety car as marshals were required to push his car away from the track. Webber was the only top running driver to pit for the medium compound tyres during the safety car period on lap four. Red Bull had told Webber to enter the pit lane, assuring him that it was the right decision, though he questioned the move. Several drivers towards the rear also chose to pit. Racing resumed at the end of lap five when the safety car pulled into the pit lane. Webber immediately pushed hard and passed Glock for tenth position and a line of cars began to form behind Glock. Alonso began to pull away from Vettel as he set consecutive fastest laps. Webber passed Kobayashi at turn five to move into ninth on lap seven, and withstood an attempt to Kobayashi to reclaim ninth heading into turn seven. Hülkenberg and Petrov's wheels made contact and both drivers went off the circuit on the same lap; Hülkenberg managed to move ahead of Petrov with Massa taking advantage to pass Petrov. Webber caught Schumacher on lap 11 and passed the latter on the same lap at turn five after Schumacher ran wide. Vettel was told by his team to cool his <b>brakes</b> <b>on</b> the same lap as Alonso continued to extend his lead. Sutil got ahead of Glock for eleventh place three laps later and started to pull away from the queue behind Glock. Hülkenberg ran wide at turn seven on the same lap but did not lose any positions. Hülkenberg passed Glock in the first sector of the track for twelfth on lap16.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} to the late-1970s, engine compression-releases {{were also used}} to {{supplement}} rear-wheel <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> many two-stroke engine powered motorcycles, primarily those used off-road or for various types of dirt-track racing, such as motocross and flat-tracking. Since two-stroke engines normally lack the compression braking effect of four-stroke engines when the throttle is shut off, {{the addition of a}} compression release <b>brake</b> <b>on</b> two-strokes essentially mimicked the four-stroke compression braking effect. Using throttle-off engine compression for at least some <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> both two-stroke and four stroke motorcycles was especially important during that era, since most motorcycles used drum-brakes, which would wear-out much more quickly than modern disc brakes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Handling {{behaviour}} of articulated vehicles {{combination is}} more complex and less predictable than that of non-articulated vehicles. It is usually difficult for drivers to maneuver a tractor semi-trailer during high speed emergency <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> split-mu road surface. <b>Braking</b> <b>on</b> this type of road surface, the conventional anti-lock braking systems will cause the vehicle deviate from the desired direction, or overmuch stopping distance. In this paper, a 3 -dof of tractor semi-trailer model was used to produce desired yaw rates which were compared with actual yaw rates. An active front steering control and four-channel ABS were integrated to improve the tractor semi-trailer lateral stability while <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> split-mu road surface, which will produce maximum braking force. A full function tractor semi-trailer model was built and assembled in multi-body dynamics software, and the dynamic analysis was performed on split-mu road surface. The simulation {{results show that the}} integrated system can improve the tractor semi-trailer lateral stability under <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> split-mu road surface...|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> {{handling}} {{is complicated by}} load transfer, which {{is proportional to the}} (negative) acceleration times the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. The difficulty is that the acceleration at the limit of adhesion depends on the road surface, so with the same ratio of front to back braking force, a car will understeer under <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> slick surfaces and oversteer under hard <b>braking</b> <b>on</b> solid surfaces. Most modern cars combat this by varying the distribution of braking in some way. This is important with a high center of gravity, but it is also done on low center of gravity cars, from which a higher level of performance is expected.|$|R
