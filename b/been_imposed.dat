5|$|In 1921, the regimental {{title was}} altered to The North Staffordshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's). In 1937, the black facings {{formerly}} {{worn by the}} 64th Foot were restored, replacing the white colour that had <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> on all non-royal English regiments in 1881.|$|E
5|$|In October 1942, the Germans {{began to}} {{implement}} compulsory deportation of Belgian workers {{to work in}} German factories. The introduction of the policy, which had <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> in World War I and which the Committee had hoped to avoid at all costs, marked the last blow to the Committee's influence.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. He noted that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E

50|$|Ukrainian legal {{liability}} includes constitutional liability, which <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> on President or Deputy of Parliament by the Parliament of Ukraine, criminal liability, which <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> by local {{courts in the}} form of sentencing, civil liability, which <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> by local courts {{in the form of}} decision, administrative liability, which <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> by administrative courts in form of decision, and disciplinary liability, which <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> by superior officials or specially created organizations.|$|R
50|$|Boundary {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> at {{vortex ring}} level. Vortex rings can be triangular or quadrilateral, but most importantly, {{they can be}} slender or solid. On slender rings, Neumann boundary conditions <b>are</b> <b>imposed,</b> while on solid rings, Dirichlet boundary conditions <b>are</b> <b>imposed.</b> Imposing one BC or the other implies calculating the local velocity or the local velocity potential.|$|R
5|$|In 1798, {{the revolutionary}} French {{government}} conquered Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution. This centralised {{the government of}} the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, Mülhausen joined France and Valtellina valley, the Cisalpine Republic, separating from Switzerland. The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{established}} {{a close relationship}} with the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, and was probably the second most-powerful person in the country after the prime minister, although many Australians resented MacArthur as a foreign general who had <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> upon them. MacArthur had little confidence in Brett's abilities as commander of Allied Air Forces, and in August 1942 selected Major General George C. Kenney to replace him. Kenney's application of air power in support of Blamey's troops would prove crucial.|$|E
5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Croatian President Franjo Tuđman {{called on}} the public to bring the siege to an end, and the plea {{resulted}} in a large-scale protest against the JNA in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard on 6 May 1991. On 7 May, 80 tanks and tracked vehicles and 23 wheeled vehicles of the JNA 10th Motorised Brigade left barracks in Mostar, only to be stopped by civilians ahead of Široki Brijeg, west of Mostar. The convoy remained in place for three days as the crowd demanded that the JNA lift the siege of Kijevo. The protest ended after Alija Izetbegović, the President of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited and addressed the protesters, assuring the crowd that the convoy was heading to Kupres rather than Kijevo. Tuđman and Cardinal Franjo Kuharić sent telegrams to the protesters supporting Izetbegović. The siege of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations a few days later, {{two weeks after the}} blockade had <b>been</b> <b>imposed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the lifting}} of the five-year ban on English clubs from European competitions, which had <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> after the Heysel Stadium disaster, United became England's first {{entrants}} into the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the 1990–91 season. Bruce played regularly, and scored three goals, in the team's progress to the final against FC Barcelona. He came close to scoring the first goal, only for Mark Hughes to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal, and United {{went on to win the}} game 2–1. This was a particularly high-scoring season for Bruce, who found the net 13times in the First Division and 19times in total in all competitions. He also played again at Wembley, in the Football League Cup final, in which United were defeated by Sheffield Wednesday of the Second Division.|$|E
5|$|However, a major rift {{of opinion}} {{existed between the}} Japanese {{government}} and its two field armies, the SEA and 10th Army, which as of November were both nominally {{under the control of}} the Central China Area Army led by SEA commander Matsui. Matsui made clear to his superiors even before he left for Shanghai that he wanted to march on Nanking. He was convinced that the conquest of the Chinese capital city of Nanking would provoke the fall of the entire Nationalist Government of China and thus hand Japan a quick and complete victory in its war on China. Yanagawa was likewise eager to conquer Nanking and both men chafed under the operation restriction line that had <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> on them by the Army General Staff.|$|E
40|$|A {{large and}} growing {{literature}} has demonstrated that imposing control on agents {{has the potential to}} backfire, leading agents to withhold effort. Consistent with principles of procedural fairness, we find that the way in which control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> — in particular whether control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> symmetrically on both principals and agents and whether both parties have a say in whether control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> — affects how agents respond to control. In our setting, control leads agents to withhold effort only when control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> unilaterally with an asymmetric affect on the agent...|$|R
50|$|The United States has an {{assortment}} of federal, state, local, and special-purpose governmental jurisdictions. Each imposes taxes to fully or partly fund its operations. These taxes may <b>be</b> <b>imposed</b> on the same income, property or activity, often without offset of one tax against another. The types of tax imposed at each level of government vary, {{in part due to}} constitutional restrictions. Income taxes <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> at the federal and most state levels. Taxes on property <b>are</b> typically <b>imposed</b> only at the local level, though there may be multiple local jurisdictions that tax the same property. Other excise taxes <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> by the federal and some state governments. Sales taxes <b>are</b> <b>imposed</b> by most states and many local governments. Customs duties or tariffs <b>are</b> only <b>imposed</b> by the federal government. A wide variety of user fees or license fees <b>are</b> also <b>imposed.</b>|$|R

5|$|On June 12, 1942, Judge James Alger Fee of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon began {{presiding}} over the non-jury trial of Yasui, the first case challenging the curfew {{to make it to}} court. The trial was held at the Federal Courthouse in Portland. Fee determined in his ruling issued on November 16, 1942, that the curfew could only apply to aliens, as martial law had not <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> by the government. However, he also ruled that because Yasui had worked for the Japanese government he had forfeited his citizenship, so that the curfew did apply to him. Fee sentenced Yasui to one year in jail, which was served at the Multnomah County Jail, and $5,000 fine. This federal court decision with constitutional and war power issues made news around the country.|$|E
5|$|A North Indian shopkeeper {{was killed}} in Bhandup, Mumbai after he refused to shut down his shop when MNS activists protesting Raj's arrest forced him to do so. Four persons were killed and another seriously injured in a village near Kalyan. Deputy {{commissioner}} of police (rural) Sanjay Shintre said two North Indians, {{a member of the}} Agri community and an MNS worker were killed in a clash between the two communities in Pisavali, 10km from Kalyan. Earlier, curfew had <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> in the entire Kalyan area. The situation in Kalyan worsened in the evening as Raj was driven there to a police station lock-up where he was to spend the night before being presented in a court on 22 October. Five outdoor broadcast vans belonging to media houses were damaged by MNS supporters. A cameraman from ETV was injured and had to be admitted to a private hospital. One Kalyan-Dombivli municipal transport bus was set on fire while five bikes were reduced to ashes. Transport services across Kalyan were paralysed. A jewellery shop was also ransacked by MNS supporters. In all one hundred and twenty-five cases of arson, rioting and stonepelting were registered across the state, including in Pune and Marathwada, by early evening, and 2,085 people were arrested, state director general of police A N Roy said.|$|E
5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and {{a public}} consultation was held in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton weight limit had <b>been</b> <b>imposed</b> on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, and {{to build a new}} bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.|$|E

But the period of probation is not limited by the period of maximum sentence that might have <b>been</b> <b>imposed.</b> On the other hand, probation does not become a nullity if the period of probation was not specified in the sentence, since the probationary period is limited by the maximum term of the sentence.|$|E
