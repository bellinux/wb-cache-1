25|$|Although bite mark {{analysis}} {{has been used}} in legal proceedings since 1870, it remains a controversial topic due to a variety of factors. DeVore and Barbenel and Evans have shown that the accuracy of a bite mark on skin is limited at best. Skin is not a good medium for dental impressions; it is liable to have a number of irregularities present before the imprint that could cause distortion. Also, bite marks can be altered through stretching, movement or a changing environment during and after the actual bite. Furthermore, the level of distortion tends to increase after the bite mark was made. <b>Both</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that for the bite mark to be accurately analyzed, the body must be examined in exactly the same position it was in when the bite occurred which can be a difficult if not an impossible task to accomplish. Bite mark distortion can rarely be quantified. Therefore, bite marks found at the scene are often analyzed under the assumption that they have undergone minimal distortion. Only limited research has been done in trying to quantify the level of distortion of a bite mark on human skin since the 1970s. The lack of research may largely be {{due to the fact that}} such studies are difficult to organize and are very expensive.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a CIAR-funded {{study on}} secondhand smoke {{exposure}} by Peter Lee was published. The tobacco industry {{hoped that the}} study would undermine the validity of a 1981 study by Takeshi Hirayama, which reported a positive association between secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk. The final paper concluded that studies like Hirayama's were subject to misclassification bias, and therefore, had [...] "little scientific basis". In 1995, the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology published two studies funded by the CIAR examining the association between ETS and heart disease. <b>Both</b> <b>studies</b> concluded that ETS exposure from spouses did not {{increase the risk of}} heart disease, and that previous conclusions to the contrary were due to publication bias. Both of these studies have been criticized for suffering from exposure misclassification, because <b>both</b> <b>studies</b> failed to distinguish between current and former smokers. In 2003, a study funded by the center was published in the BMJ. Authored by James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat, the study found little association between secondhand smoke and coronary heart disease or lung cancer. This study has been criticized for failing to distinguish between those who were exposed to second-hand smoke and those who were not, because, according to the American Cancer Society, the study's participants were enrolled in 1959, [...] "when exposure to secondhand smoke was so pervasive that virtually everyone was exposed to ETS, {{whether or not they were}} married to a smoker." ...|$|E

500|$|Researchers at the University of Maine have {{actively}} {{been developing}} value-added green crab products, {{with the goals}} of driving business interest, stimulating a commercial green crab fishery, and alleviating predation effects.

500|$|In 1934 artist Katherine Maltwood {{suggested}} a landscape zodiac, {{a map of}} the stars on a gigantic scale, formed by features in the landscape such as roads, streams and field boundaries, could be found situated around Glastonbury. She held that the [...] "temple" [...] was created by Sumerians about 2700BC. The idea of a prehistoric landscape zodiac fell into disrepute when two independent studies examined the Glastonbury Zodiac, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 [...] and the other by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy in 1983. These both used standard methods of landscape historical research. <b>Both</b> <b>studies</b> concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea of an ancient zodiac. The eye of Capricorn identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors. The Cancer boat (not a crab as in conventional western astrology) consists of a network of 18th-century drainage ditches and paths. There are some Neolithic paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features. There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the [...] "temple" [...] in any form, from conventional archaeologists. Glastonbury is also said to be the centre of several ley lines.|$|E
