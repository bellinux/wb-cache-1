5|$|Although most banded sugar ant colonies are monogynous (a nest that {{contains}} a single queen), some {{have been found to}} be polygynous, where a colony will have multiple queens; this is the fourth Camponotus species that is recognized as exhibiting polygyny. In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are monandrous, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their nuptial flight, although virgin queens and males (alates) were observed mating in South Australia in January. This hints that banded sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), which is when the alates begin to swarm. A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven years or more. The <b>black</b> <b>carpenter</b> <b>ant</b> (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is known to adopt larvae and pupae from banded sugar ant colonies.|$|E

50|$|They build nests inside wood {{consisting}} of galleries chewed {{out with their}} mandibles, preferably in dead, damp wood. They do not consume the wood, however, unlike termites. Sometimes, carpenter ants hollow out sections of trees. They also commonly infest wooden buildings and structures, and are a widespread nuisance and major cause of structural damage. One of the most familiar species associated with human habitation in the United States is the <b>black</b> <b>carpenter</b> <b>ant</b> (Camponotus pennsylvanicus).

50|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> {{and their}} larvae are eaten {{in various parts}} of the world. In Australia, the Honeypot ant (Camponotus inflatus) is {{regularly}} eaten raw by Indigenous Australians. It is a particular favourite source of sugar if Australian Aboriginals are living in arid regions, partially digging up their nests instead of digging them up entirely, in order to preserve this food source. In North America, lumbermen during the early years in Maine would eat <b>carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> to prevent scurvy, and in John Muir's publication, First Summer in the Sierra, Muir notes that the Digger Indians of California ate the tickling, acid gasters of the large jet-black <b>carpenter</b> <b>ants.</b> In Africa, <b>carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> are among the vast amount of species that are consumed by the San people.|$|R

5000|$|Black {{carpenter}} ants {{are known}} to forage up to 100 yards in search of food. Workers are most active at night, traveling from their nest to a food source following trails. They do establish chemical (pheromone) trails. The ants produce crackling sounds that can often be heard near a large nest. A large colony can have thousands of individuals. The <b>black</b> <b>carpenter</b> <b>ant</b> does notsting, but the larger workers can administer a sharp bite, which can become further irritated bythe injection of formic acid, which they produce.|$|E

50|$|On November 22, 2009 at Chikara's Season eight finale titled Three Fisted Tales, {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} the main event between The Colony (Fire Ant and Soldier Ant) and The Osirian Portal (Amasis and Ophidian), the two masked men from months prior invaded the ring and one of them stated that a war was coming and that he was tired of waiting. Green Ant and Carpenter Ant came out to support their fellow Colony members, in addition to the entire tecnico locker room. Mike Quackenbush and Claudio Castagnoli confronted the men, however, one of the men demanded to meet the man with the real power and pointed at UltraMantis Black, who had been doing commentary during the main event. UltraMantis handed the Eye of Tyr to Vökoder before entering the ring, where {{he said that he was}} sick of the men and claimed to not even know who they were. This led to both men removing their masks, the larger man revealed another mask with a helmet, horns and beard, while the man with the microphone unmasked as Ares, a Swiss wrestler. Immediately following this Castagnoli, fellow Swiss and Ares' longtime tag team partner, blasted Quackenbush with a European uppercut, turning rudo in Chikara for the first time in three years. A massive brawl broke out, during which Vökoder attacked UltraMantis <b>Black,</b> <b>Carpenter</b> <b>Ant,</b> a relatively new member of The Colony, who had shocked everyone by winning the annual torneo cibernetico with an inverted Chikara Special, turned on the rest of The Colony and Sara Del Rey and Daizee Haze, who had been complaining about the way the company had used them, turned on Chikara wrestlers, helping the rebel faction. Once the fight had subdued with the new group on top, Carpenter Ant unmasked as Pinkie Sanchez and Vökoder unmasked as Tim Donst, both of whom had a history with the Order of the Neo-Solar Temple. The group saluted in a formation, before the larger masked man cut the lights and the stable fled the arena, with the Eye of Tyr intact.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> {{can damage}} wood {{used in the}} {{construction}} of buildings. They can leave behind a sawdust-like material called frass that provides clues to their nesting location. <b>Carpenter</b> <b>ant</b> galleries are smooth and very different from termite-damaged areas, which have mud packed into the hollowed-out areas. <b>Carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> can be identified by the general presence of one upward protruding node, looking like a spike, at the [...] "waist" [...] attachment between the thorax and abdomen (petiole). Control involves application of insecticides in various forms including dusts and liquids. The dusts are injected directly into galleries and voids where the <b>carpenter</b> <b>ants</b> are living. The liquids are applied in areas where foraging ants are likely to pick the material up and spread the poison to the colony upon returning.|$|R
