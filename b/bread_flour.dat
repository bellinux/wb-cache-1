5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The wheat fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for <b>bread</b> <b>flour,</b> and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E

25|$|At {{its most}} basic, {{traditional}} bagel dough contains wheat flour (without germ or bran), salt, water, and yeast leavening. <b>Bread</b> <b>flour</b> or other high gluten flours are preferred {{to create the}} firm, dense but spongy bagel shape and chewy texture. Most bagel recipes call for {{the addition of a}} sweetener to the dough, often barley malt (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, with or without eggs, milk or butter. Leavening can be accomplished using a sourdough technique or a commercially produced yeast.|$|E

25|$|Before {{contact with}} the Spanish, Acoma people {{primarily}} ate corn, beans, and squash. Mut-tze-nee was a popular thin corn bread. They also raised turkeys, tobacco, and sunflowers. The Acoma hunted antelope, deer, and rabbits. Wild seeds, berries, nuts, and other foods were gathered. After 1700, new foods were noted in the historical record. Blue corn drink, pudding, corn mush, corn balls, wheat cake, peach-bark drink, paper <b>bread,</b> <b>flour</b> bread, wild berries, and prickly pear fruit all became staples. After {{contact with the}} Spanish, goats, horses, sheep and donkeys were raised.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, Syria's economy worsened; by mid-1984, the food crisis was severe, {{and the press}} was full of complaints. Assad's {{government}} sought a solution, arguing that food shortages could be avoided with careful economic planning. The food crisis continued through August, despite government measures. Syria lacked sugar, <b>bread,</b> <b>flour,</b> wood, iron and construction equipment; this resulted in soaring prices, long queues and rampant black marketeering. Smuggling goods from Lebanon became common. Assad's government tried to combat the smuggling, encountering difficulties due to the involvement of his brother Rifaat in the corruption. In July 1984, the government formed an effective anti-smuggling squad to control the Lebanon–Syria borders. The Defense Detachment commanded by Rifaat al-Assad {{played a leading role}} in the smuggling, importing $400,000 worth of goods a day. The anti-smuggling squad seized $3.8million in goods during its first week.|$|E
25|$|Over 18 days in June 1827 {{at least}} 100 {{members of the}} Pallittorre clan from the North nation were killed in {{reprisals}} for the killing of three stockmen and Ryan calculates that in the eight months from 1 December 1826 to 31 July 1827 more than 200 Aboriginal {{people were killed in}} the Settled Districts in reprisal for their killing of 15 colonists. An entire clan of 150 Oyster Bay people may have been killed in one pursuit through the Sorell Valley in November 1827, significantly reducing population numbers. In September Arthur appointed another 26 field police and deployed another 55 soldiers from the 40th Regiment and New South Wales Royal Veteran Company into the Settled Districts to deal with the rising conflict. Between September 1827 and the following March, at least 70 Aboriginal attacks were reported throughout the Settled Districts, taking the lives of 20 colonists. By March 1828 the death toll in the Settled Districts for the 16 months since Arthur's November 1826 official notice had risen to 43 colonists and probably 350 Aboriginal people. But by then reports were being received that Aboriginal people were more interested in plundering huts for food—stealing <b>bread,</b> <b>flour,</b> tea and digging up potatoes and turnips from settlers' gardens—than killing colonists.|$|E

25|$|The {{whole of}} the Soviet Union became {{dedicated}} to the war effort. The population of the Soviet Union was probably better prepared than any other nation involved in the fighting of World War II to endure the material hardships of the war. This is primarily because the Soviets were so used to shortages and coping with economic crisis in the past, especially during wartime—World War I brought similar restrictions on food. Still, conditions were severe. World War II was especially devastating to Soviet citizens because it was fought on their territory and caused massive destruction. In Leningrad, under German siege, over one million people died of starvation and disease. Many factory workers were teenagers, women and the elderly. The government implemented rationing in 1941 and first applied it to <b>bread,</b> <b>flour,</b> cereal, pasta, butter, margarine, vegetable oil, meat, fish, sugar, and confectionery all across the country. The rations remained largely stable in other places during the war. Additional rations were often so expensive {{that they could not}} add substantially to a citizen’s food supply unless that person was especially well-paid. Peasants received no rations and had to make do with local resources that they farmed themselves. Most rural peasants struggled and lived in unbearable poverty, but others sold any surplus they had at a high price and a few became rouble millionaires, until a currency reform two {{years after the end of}} the war wiped out their wealth.|$|E
500|$|Point du Sable {{settled on}} the north bank of the Chicago River close to its mouth {{at some time in}} the 1780s. The {{earliest}} known record of Point du Sable living in Chicago is an entry that Hugh Heward made in his journal on May 10, 1790 during a journey from Detroit across Michigan and through Illinois. Heward's party stopped at Pointe du Sable's house en route to the Chicago portage; they swapped their canoe for a pirogue that belonged to Point du Sable, and they bought <b>bread,</b> <b>flour</b> and pork from him. Perrish Grignon, who visited Chicago in about 1794, described Point du Sable as a large man who was a wealthy trader. In 1800 he sold his farm to John Kinzie's frontman, Jean La Lime, for 6,000 livres; the bill of sale, which was rediscovered in 1913 in an archive in Detroit, outlined all of the property Point du Sable owned as well as many of his personal artifacts. This included a house, two barns, a horse drawn mill, a bakehouse, a poultry house, a dairy and a smokehouse. The house was a [...] log cabin filled with fine furniture and paintings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} {{addition}} of gelatinized rice porridge to bread {{has been investigated}} on loaf volume, viscoelastic properties and air-bubble structure. We prepared four variety of bread: bread containing rice porridge (rice porridge bread), bread containing gelatinized rice flour (gelatinized rice <b>flour</b> <b>bread),</b> and wheat <b>flour</b> and rice <b>flour</b> <b>breads</b> for references. Instrumental analyses the bread samples were carried out by volume measurement of loaf samples, creep test and digital image analysis of crumb samples. Rice porridge bread showed the maximum specific volume of 4. 51 cm 3 /g, and even gelatinized rice <b>flour</b> <b>bread</b> showed 4. 30 cm 3 /g, which was larger than the reference bread samples (wheat and rice <b>flour</b> <b>breads).</b> The values of viscoelastic moduli of gelatinized rice <b>flour</b> <b>bread</b> and rice porridge bread were significantly smaller (p < 0. 05) than those of wheat flour and rice <b>flour</b> <b>breads,</b> which indicates addition of gelatinized rice flour or rice porridge to bread dough encouraged breads softer. Bubble parameters such as mean air- bubble area, number of air-bubble, air-bubble area ratio (ratio of bubble area to whole area) {{were not significantly different}} among the bread crumb samples. Therefore, the bubble structures of the bread samples seemed to similar, which implied that difference of viscoelasticity was attributed to air-bubble wall (solid phase of bread crumb) rather than air-bubble. This study showed that addition of gelatinized rice to bread dough makes the bread with larger loaf volume and soft texture without additional agents such as gluten...|$|R

40|$|The {{protein quality}} of bread samples {{produced}} from wheat and cowpea flour blends was investigated. The wheat flour (WF) was composite with cowpea flour (CF) at {{the levels of}} 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % and used for bread production. The samples of bread produced were later sliced, dried and milled systematically into <b>bread</b> <b>flours.</b> The resulting <b>bread</b> <b>flours</b> were individually formulated into test diets whereas the casein based diet was similarly formulated and used as control. After formulation, the protein quality of the test diets and the control were evaluated using the protein efficiency ratio index with thirty-five weanling albino rats. The rats which were six weeks old and weighing between 42. 3 and 44. 1 grammas were divided into five groups of seven rats each and housed in individual metabolic cages; fed diets and tap water adlibitum {{for a period of}} 21 days. From the results, the corrected protein efficiency ratio (PER) of casein based diet was 2. 5 and those of the test diets formulated from bread were 2. 18, 2. 23, 2. 30 and 2. 32 respectively.
