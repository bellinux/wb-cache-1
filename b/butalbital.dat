25|$|There is a {{small group}} of List II drugs for which doctors have to write the {{prescriptions}} according to the same, tougher guidelines as those for List I drugs (writing the prescription in full in letters, listing the patients name, and have to contain the name and initials, address, city and telephone number of the licensed prescriber issuing the prescriptions, as well as the name and initials, address and city of the person the prescription is issued to). Among that group of drugs are the barbiturates amobarbital, <b>butalbital,</b> cyclobarbital, and pentobarbital.|$|E
25|$|Barbiturates {{induce a}} number of hepatic CYP enzymes (most notably CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), leading to exaggerated effects from many prodrugs and {{decreased}} effects from drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes to inactive metabolites. This can result in fatal overdoses from drugs such as codeine, tramadol, and carisoprodol, which become considerably more potent after being metabolized by CYP enzymes. Although all known {{members of the class}} possess relevant enzyme induction capabilities the degree of inhibition overall as well as the impact on each specific enzyme span a broad range with phenobarbital and secobarbital being the most potent enzyme inducers and <b>butalbital</b> and talbutal being among the weakest enzyme inducers in the class.|$|E
25|$|Some {{symptoms}} of an overdose typically include sluggishness, incoordination, difficulty in thinking, slowness of speech, faulty judgement, drowsiness, shallow breathing, staggering, and, in severe cases, coma or death. The lethal dosage of barbiturates varies greatly with tolerance and from one individual to another. The lethal dose is highly variable among different {{members of the}} class with superpotent barbiturates such as pentobarbital being potentially fatal in considerably lower doses than the low-potency barbiturates such as <b>butalbital.</b> Even in inpatient settings, however, the development of tolerance is still a problem, as dangerous and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms can result when the drug is stopped after dependence has developed. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and sedative effects of barbiturates tends to develop faster than tolerance to their effects on smooth muscle, respiration, and heart rate, making them generally unsuitable for a long time psychiatric use. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects tends to correlate more with tolerance to physiological effects, however, meaning that they are still a viable option for long-term epilepsy treatment.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances {{was signed}} in Vienna. Designed to {{regulate}} amphetamines, barbiturates, and other synthetics, the 34th version of the treaty, , regulates secobarbital as schedule II, amobarbital, <b>butalbital,</b> cyclobarbital, and pentobarbital as schedule III, and allobarbital, barbital, butobarbital, mephobarbital, phenobarbital, butabarbital, and vinylbital as schedule IV on its [...] "Green List". The combination medication Fioricet, consisting of <b>butalbital,</b> caffeine, and paracetamol (acetaminophen), however, is specifically exempted from controlled substance status, while its sibling Fiorinal, which contains aspirin instead of paracetamol and may contain codeine phosphate, remains a schedule III drug.|$|E
2500|$|On July 20, 2017 the NTSB Investigation {{was officially}} completed. Of note was that Horner {{had been taking}} {{prescription}} medications for high cholesterol and headaches. The probable cause of Horner's accident was as follows: [...] "The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from terrain during low-level airwork, which resulted in uncontrolled collision with terrain. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's impairment from the combined effects of <b>butalbital</b> and codeine." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 2017, the Wayne County Medical Examiner {{released}} its autopsy and toxicology {{report in the}} death of Cornell. The coroner confirming that the manner of death was suicide by hanging and that [...] "drugs did not contribute" [...] to the cause of death. Only prescription medications were found in Cornell's system and in therapeutic doses: the sedative <b>Butalbital</b> (5.4 mcg/mL), commonly prescribed for the treatment of headache, four doses (41ng/mL) of the anti-anxiety medication lorazepam (Ativan), the decongestant pseudoephedrine (170ng/mL) and its metabolite norpseudoephedrine (10ng/mL), caffeine (from No-Doz tablets that Cornell had ingested), along with naloxone (Narcan), used to reverse opioid overdoses, and reportedly administered by EMTs arriving on scene. The Ativan was prescribed to Cornell in 2016. Photos from Cornell's hotel room showed that his prescription for Ativan was [...] "1 tablet every 12 hours".

50|$|<b>Butalbital</b> is a {{barbiturate}} with {{an intermediate}} duration of action. <b>Butalbital</b> is often {{combined with other}} medications, such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) or aspirin, and is commonly prescribed {{for the treatment of}} pain and headache. The various formulations combined with codeine are FDA-approved for the treatment of tension headaches. <b>Butalbital</b> has the same chemical formula as talbutal but a different structure—one that presents as 5-allyl-5-isobutylbarbituric acid.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} Fioricet {{was not a}} {{controlled}} substance whereas Fiorinal was.(CIII) The reason for this was Fiorinal contains aspirin and Fioricet contains acetaminophen. Aspirin is highly bound to plasma proteins whereas acetaminophen is not. Aspirin being bound to these proteins allows for a higher blood level of <b>Butalbital.</b> <b>Butalbital</b> is metabolized to Phenobarbital therefore more free <b>Butalbital</b> leads to greater potential for abuse.|$|E

50|$|Opioids and <b>butalbital</b> are {{sometimes}} inappropriately used as treatment for migraine and headache {{and should be}} avoided {{in favor of more}} effective, migraine-specific treatments. Opioid and <b>butalbital</b> use can worsen headaches and cause MOH. When a patient fails to respond to other treatment or migraine specific treatment is unavailable, then opioids may be used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butalbital</b> is not {{suggested}} as a first-line treatment for headache because it impairs alertness, brings risk of dependence and addiction, {{and increases the}} risk that episodic headaches will become chronic. When other treatments fail or are unavailable, <b>butalbital</b> may be appropriate for treating headache if the patient can be monitored to prevent the development of chronic headache.|$|E

50|$|It {{was also}} used in the {{treatment}} of migraine headaches in a similar manner to <b>butalbital.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Butalbital</b> has {{generalized}} depressant {{effect on}} {{central nervous system}} and, in very high doses, has peripheral effects. Acetaminophen has analgesic and antipyretic effects mediated by a metabolite which acts at cannabinoid receptors, {{contrary to popular belief}} it is not an antiinflammatory at safe levels (it becomes toxic at doses above 1,000mg per dose and/or 3,000mg per day). Caffeine is thought to produce constriction of cerebral blood vessels and serves to counteract the sedative effect of <b>butalbital.</b>|$|E
50|$|Paracetamol is {{commonly}} used in multi-ingredient preparations for migraine headache, typically including <b>butalbital</b> and paracetamol with or without caffeine, and sometimes containing codeine.|$|E
50|$|The {{risk and}} {{severity}} of all side effects is greatly increased when <b>butalbital</b> (or butalbital-based medications, such as Fioricet) are combined with other sedatives (ex. ethanol, opiates, benzodiazepines, antihistamines), and other side effects, which are not typically associated with <b>butalbital,</b> may occur. Inhibitors of the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4 may also increase the risk, severity, and duration of side effects, many drugs inhibit this enzyme as do some foods such as grapefruit and the blood orange. Taking butalbital-based medications with some other drugs may also increase {{the side effects of}} the other medication.|$|E

50|$|Talbutal (Lotusate) is a {{barbiturate}} with a {{short to}} intermediate duration of action. It is a structural isomer of <b>butalbital.</b> Talbutal is a schedule III drug in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|There are {{specific}} treatments which {{are appropriate for}} targeting migraines and headaches which are preferable to <b>butalbital</b> when available as an option. It is a least preferable option to be used if other available treatments fail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butalbital</b> is a {{physically}} and psychologically addictive barbiturate. Mixing with alcohol {{increases the risk}} of intoxication, increases respiratory depression, and increases liver toxicity when it is a <b>butalbital</b> combination including paracetamol (acetaminophen).Many opioid-dependent persons frequently use barbiturates as a potentiator to their normal dose of opiates in order to increase the effects, or with a less than normal dose as means of conserving their supply. Especially when used with the stronger narcotics, suicide or accidental death occurs much more frequently than first reported with one drug alone. Use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other CNS-depressants often also contribute to respiratory depression, coma, and in extreme cases fatality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butalbital</b> has a {{half-life}} {{of about}} 35 hours. Acetaminophen has a half-life of about 1.25 to 3 hours, {{but may be}} increased by liver damage and after an overdose. Caffeine has a half-life of about 2.5 to 4.5 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Confusion {{has arisen}} about the {{controlled}} substance status of this medication. Per DEA listing, Fioricet is a DEA exempt prescription product. [...] There is no logical rationale for {{why this is}} exempted from controlled substance scheduling, {{but it has been}} postulated that the concentration of <b>butalbital</b> with the acetaminophen (and caffeine) allows this to be an analgesic combination that the DEA allows exemption to. However peculiar it may be, Fioricet's sister product, Fiorinal, contains the same amount of <b>butalbital</b> per dose, combined with aspirin (and caffeine) instead of acetaminophen (and caffeine) but it is in fact a DEA Schedule III item. [...] However, Fioricet is listed as Schedule III in five states (MD, GA, UT, FL and NM).|$|E
50|$|Fioricet and Esgic are {{brand names}} of a {{combination}} of <b>butalbital</b> (a barbiturate), acetaminophen and caffeine which is indicated for the treatment of tension headaches, muscle contraction headaches and post-dural puncture headaches. Although not indicated, they are commonly used to treat migraines and other pain related ailments.|$|E
5000|$|Per {{most recent}} DEA Exemptions List ( [...] http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/exempt/exempt_rx_list.pdf) both {{old and new}} {{formulations}} of Fioricet are both exempt and not considered a controlled substance, not just the old formula.Per FDA guidelines recommending that manufacturers limit the dose of acetaminophen in prescription products, the formulation of Fioricet has changed. [...] "Old formulations" [...] of Fioricet contained 50 mg of <b>butalbital,</b> 325 mg of acetaminophen and 40 mg caffeine; [...] "new formulations" [...] contain 50 mg of <b>butalbital,</b> 300 mg of acetaminophen and 40 mg caffeine. Manufacturers were allowed to make the [...] "old formulation" [...] of fioricet until January 1, 2014. Currently there is no move to remove or destroy the [...] "old formulation", allowing for an odd situation in which there could be two different formulations of fioricet in pharmacies.|$|E
