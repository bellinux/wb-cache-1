40|$|We {{discuss the}} "life cycle model" by first {{introducing}} a credit market with only <b>biometric</b> <b>risk,</b> and then market risk is introduced via risky securities. This framework {{enables us to}} find optimal pension plans and life insurance contracts where the benefits are state dependent. We compare these solutions both to the ones of standard actuarial theory, and to policies offered in practice. Two related portfolio choice puzzles {{are discussed in the}} light of recent research, one is the horizon problem, the other is related to the aggregate market data of the last century, where theory and practice diverge. Finally we present some comments on longevity risk and cohort risk. The life cycle model; pension insurance; optimal life insurance; longevity risk; the horizon problem; equity premium puzzle...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{several aspects}} of modern life {{insurance}} mathematics are considered in a discrete finite time framework. The dissertation consists of three parts. Part I: The classical Principle of Equivalence ensures that a life insurance company can accomplish that the mean balance per contract converges to zero almost surely for {{an increasing number of}} independent clients. In an axiomatic approach, this idea is adapted to the general case of stochastic financial markets. The implied minimum fair price of general life insurance products is then uniquely determined by the product of the given equivalent martingale measure of the financial market with the probability measure of the biometric state space. This minimum fair price (valuation principle) is in accordance with existing results. Part II: Assuming a product space model for biometric and financial events, there exists a rather natural principle for the decomposition of gains of life insurance contracts into a financial and a biometric part using orthogonal projections. The dissertation shows the connection between this decomposition, locally variance-optimal hedging and the so-called pooling of <b>biometric</b> <b>risk</b> contributions. For example, the mean aggregated discounted <b>biometric</b> <b>risk</b> contribution per client converges to zero almost surely for an increasing number of clients. A general solution of Buehlmann's AFIR-problem is proposed. Part III: This part proposes differentiability properties for positively homogeneous risk measures which ensure that the gradient can be applied for reasonable risk capital allocation on non-trivial portfolios. It is shown that these properties are fulfilled for a wide class of coherent risk measures based on the mean and the one-sided moments of a risky payoff. In contrast to quantile-based risk measures like Value-at-Risk, this class allows allocation in portfolios of very general distributions, e. g. discrete ones...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we assess the joint impact of {{biometric}} and financial risk {{on the market}} valuation of life insurance liabilities.

The contracts considered include pure endowments, deferred whole life annuities and guaranteed annuity options. Our results stress the predominance of systematic over diversifiable risk in determining fair participation rates.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} ocular biometric {{parameters and}} darkroom prone provocative test (DPPT) in {{family members of}} pri-mary angle closure (PAC) glaucoma (PACG) patients and to establish any correlation between these biometric parameters and the DPPT response. Methods. Seventy-four family members of PACG patients underwent ultrasound ocular biometry, slit lamp biomicroscopy, Goldmann applanation tonometry, fundus examination, and gonioscopy. Lastly, DPPT was performed. Results. Of 74 family members examined, 6 (8. 1 %) {{were found to have}} PAC, 8 (10. 8 %) were PAC suspects, and 60 (81. 1 %) were unaffected. Of those affected, 4 (66. 7 %) had a positive DPPT response, whereas 87. 5 % of the PAC suspects had a positive or a borderline DPPT response. Affected and PAC suspects had the shallowest anterior chamber depth, thickest lens, shortest axial length, and most anteriorly positioned lens. Anterior chamber depth and lens thickness showed a significant correlation with positive DPPT. Conclusions. Anterior chamber depth and lens thickness and, to a lesser extent, axial length and lens position were signi-ficantly correlated with a positive DPPT response. The ocular <b>biometric</b> <b>risk</b> factors associated with PACG patients are also found in their respective family members who are affected and suspected of having PAC.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the <b>biometric</b> <b>risk</b> factors for corneal surface complications associated with hydrogel soft contact lens (SCL) fitting in myopic patients in Korea. Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study. The records of 124 subjects (124 eyes) who wore SCLs {{on a daily}} basis were reviewed. Thirty-one patients (31 eyes) who were diagnosed with corneal neovasculariza-tion (NV) while wearing SCLs were included in the complication group. Ninety-three age- and sex-matched patients (93 eyes) who wore SCLs, who did not have corneal NV and who visited our clinic for correction of re-fractive errors were included in the control group. The degree of spherical equivalent, astigmatism and corneal base curve radius (BCR) were compared in both groups. Results: Patients with NV exhibited poorer best corrected visual acuity and more myopia than controls (p = 0. 008 and 0. 006, respectively). In univariate analysis, highly myopic patients (- 9 diopters [D] or higher) were more likely to experience NV (odds ratio [OR], 2. 232; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 602 to 3. 105). High astigmatism (≥ 2 D) increased the risk of complications (OR, 2. 717; 95 % CI, 1. 141 to 6. 451). Steep cornea, in which BCR was < 7. 5 mm, also raised the risk of complications (OR, 4. 000; 95 % CI, 1. 661 to 9. 804). Flat cornea was not a risk factor for the development of NV.

40|$|Objective To {{quantify}} {{the impact of}} a practical, hospital-based nurse-coordinated prevention programme on cardiovascular risk, integrated into the routine clinical care of patients discharged after an acute coronary syndrome, as compared with usual care only. Design RESPONSE (Randomised Evaluation of Secondary Prevention by Outpatient Nurse SpEcialists) was a randomised clinical trial. Setting Multicentre trial in secondary and tertiary healthcare settings. Participants 754 patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome. Intervention A nurse-coordinated prevention programme, consisting of four outpatient nurse clinic visits, focusing on healthy lifestyles, <b>biometric</b> <b>risk</b> factors and medication adherence, in addition to usual care. Main outcome measures The main outcome was 10 -year cardiovascular mortality risk as estimated by Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation at 12  months follow-up. Secondary outcomes included Framingham Coronary Risk Score at 12  months, in addition to changes in individual risk factors. Risk factor control was classified as ‘poor’ if 0 to 3 factors were on target, ‘fair’ if 4 to 6 factors were on target, and ‘good’ if 7 to 9 were on target. Results The mean Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation at 12  months was 4. 4 per cent (SD 4. 5) in the intervention group and 5. 4 per cent (SD 6. 2) in the control group (p= 0. 021), representing a 17. 4 % relative risk reduction. At 12  months, risk factor control classified as ‘good’ was achieved in 35 % of patients in the intervention group compared with 25 % in the control group (p= 0. 003). Attendance to the nurse-coordinated prevention programme was 92 %. In the intervention group, 86 rehospitalisations were observed against 132 in the control group (relative risk reduction 34. 8 %, p= 0. 023). Conclusions The nurse-coordinated hospital-based prevention programme in addition to usual care is a practical, yet effective method for reduction of cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary disease. Our data suggest that the counselling component of the programme may lead to a reduction in hospital readmissions...|$|E
40|$|Improvement of {{health-related}} {{quality of}} life (HRQOL) is an important goal in preventive cardiology. HRQOL is also related to depressive symptoms, which represent a common co-morbidity and risk factor in patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Comprehensive nurse-coordinated prevention programmes (NCPP) in secondary care {{have been shown to}} reduce cardiovascular risk, however their effects on HRQOL and depressive symptoms have not been evaluated. We therefore investigated HRQOL and depressive symptoms in a secondary analysis in the RESPONSE trial, evaluating the effect of a NCPP on cardiovascular risk. RESPONSE was a multicentre (n[*]=[*] 11) randomised controlled trial in ACS-patients in secondary and tertiary healthcare settings evaluating a NCPP. The intervention consisted of four outpatient nurse clinic visits in the first 6 months after the index event, focusing on healthy lifestyles, <b>biometric</b> <b>risk</b> factors and medication adherence, in addition to usual care. The control group received usual care only. The outcome was change in HRQOL as measured by the MacNew questionnaire and change in depressive symptoms as measured by Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire at 12 -months follow-up relative to baseline. Of 754 patients randomised, 615 were analysed for HRQOL; 120 for depressive symptoms. At baseline, HRQOL was 5. 17 (SD 1. 09) and 5. 20 (SD 1. 04) (scale range 1. 0 to 7. 0) in the intervention and control group, respectively. At 12 months follow-up, HRQOL increased by 0. 57 (SD 0. 89) in the intervention group as compared with 0. 42 (SD 0. 90) in the control group (p[*]=[*] 0. 03). This increase was observed across all relevant subscales. The BDI decreased by 1. 9 in the intervention group as compared with 0. 03 in the control group (p[*]=[*] 0. 03) (scale range 1. 0 to 63). Participation in a NCPP is associated with a modest but statistically significant increase in HRQOL, and a decrease of depressive symptoms, both of which are highly relevant to patients. A reduction in depressive symptoms may in addition contribute to a reduction in the overall risk of recurrent events. Dutch trials register: NTR 1290. Registered 24 April 200...|$|E

Eighty-five children with intrauterine growth retardation were followed up prospectively to 3 years of age, using <b>biometric</b> parameters, perinatal <b>risk</b> questionnaires, and neurodevelopmental evaluations. Forty-two children served as controls. A significant difference in neurodevelopmental score at 3 years of age was noted between the intrauterine growth retardation and control groups (P <. 001). In the intrauterine growth retardation group, the clinical parameters that most significantly correlated with outcome were cephalization index (head circumference:birthweight ratio), neona-tal risk score, and birthweight. The best predictor of 3 -year outcome was the cephalization index (P <. 01). The children with intrauterine growth retardation with neonatal complications had significantly lower IQ scores (P <. 05) and a poorer neurodevelopmental outcome (P <. 01) than those without complications. Children with intrauterine growth retardation are at higher risk for developmental disabilities than are controls, especially in the presence of neonatal complications and a high cephalization index.

40|$|Biometrics have a long-held hope of {{replacing}} passwords {{by establishing a}} non-repudiated identity and providing authentication with convenience. Convenience drives consumers toward biometrics-based access management solutions. Unlike passwords, biometrics cannot be script-injected; however, biometric data is considered highly sensitive due to its personal nature and unique association with users. Biometrics differ from passwords in that compromised passwords may be reset. Compromised biometrics offer no such relief. A compromised <b>biometric</b> offers unlimited <b>risk</b> in privacy (anyone can view the biometric) and authentication (anyone may use the biometric). Standards such as the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS) (IEEE 2410 - 2016) provide a detailed mechanism to authenticate biometrics based on pre-enrolled devices and a previous identity by storing the biometric in encrypted form. This paper describes a biometric-agnostic approach that addresses the privacy concerns of biometrics through the implementation of BOPS. Specifically, two novel concepts are introduced. First, a biometric is applied to a neural network to create a feature vector. This neural network alone {{can be used for}} one-to-one matching (authentication), but would require a search in linear time for the one-to-many case (identity lookup). The classifying algorithm described in this paper addresses this concern by producing normalized floating-point values for each feature vector. This allows authentication lookup to occur in up to polynomial time, allowing for search in encrypted biometric databases with speed, accuracy and privacy. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

ID documents such as driver’s licenses in some states and all U. S. passports are now implanted with radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. In recent proposals, Congress has considered implementing a digitalized biometric identification card—such as a biometric-based, “high-tech” Social Security Card—which may eventually lead {{to the development of a}} universal multimodal biometric database (e. g., the collection of the digital photos, fingerprints, iris scans, and/or DNA of all citizens and noncitizens). Such “hightech” IDs, once merged with GPS-RFID tracking technology, would facilitate exponentially a convergence of cybersurveillance-body tracking and data surveillance, or dataveillance-biographical tracking. Yet, the existing Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is tethered to a “reasonable expectation of privacy” test that does not appear to restrain the comprehensive, suspicionless amassing of databases that concern the biometric data, movements, activities, and other personally identifiable information of individuals. In this Article, I initiate a project to explore the constitutional and other legal consequences of big data cybersurveillance generally and mass biometric dataveillance in particular.

40|$|In theory, {{workplace}} wellness programs {{offer an}} important {{public health and}} policy opportunity to improve {{the health of the}} working population, encourage prevention, and lower the cost of healthcare. However, the success of these programs is highly dependent on the level of participation, the effect on health claims costs, on medical utilization, and the resulting decrease in health risk behaviors as a result of participation in the program. This three-paper dissertation evaluates a workplace wellness program in California that uses a financial incentive to recruit people to participate. The study is a two-year observational cohort study utilizing data provided by Blue Shield of California Health Insurance Plan from their Healthy Lifestyle Rewards (HLR) program. Demographic, claims, and medical utilization data from a subset of 8, 003 participants in 2006 and 2007 are compared with a control group of non-participants. Program exposure and Wellness Assessment survey data is available for a subset of the participating population. Paper 1 evaluates the determinants of employee participation and retention in the program from 2006 to 2007. The analysis finds that lower-income and high-risk employees have greater odds of participating in HLR as compared to high-income employees. Participation in HLR is significantly related to medication usage for two chronic conditions: high cholesterol, and depression. Paper 2 evaluates the effect of participating in HLR on health care utilization and medical claims. The results find that participation in HLR in 2006 was associated with significant declines in all measures of outpatient utilization (including non-institutional physician and non-physician claims, and physician visits) in the following year. There were no significant effects on claims spending for cholesterol and depression medications, or in utilization in the categories of emergency department visits, and inpatient admissions. HLR may serve as a substitute for some forms of outpatient physician and non-physician care, most likely acting as an informational resource. Paper 3 evaluates the impact of participating in HLR on modifiable health risks. The results find that the use of specific HLR help modules is associated with a significant improvement in many <b>biometric</b> and health <b>risk</b> factors. Participants in HLR exercised more frequently, consistently ate more fruits and vegetables, and reported lower stress levels. Overall, it is found that HLR reduces health care expenditures and decreases medical utilization without a detectable effect of negative health behaviors or increased health risks. These findings suggest that promoting workplace wellness programs may be a promising component of comprehensive health care reform...|$|R
