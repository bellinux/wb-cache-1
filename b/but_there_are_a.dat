5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In {{the quality of their}} milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of {{buildings in the}} area are houses from the 20th century, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few buildings, landmarks, and objects that date from the 16th century, in addition to Bramall Hall which dates from the 14th century. In particular, there are many Victorian buildings in several places across the area. The local drift geology is mostly glacial boulder clay, as well as glacial sands and gravel. For many years the clay has been used for making bricks and tiles.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have drawn}} {{on a range}} of sources on Henry, {{including}} the accounts of chroniclers; other documentary evidence, including early pipe rolls; and surviving buildings and architecture. The three main chroniclers to describe the events of Henry's life were William of Malmesbury, Orderic Vitalis, and Henry of Huntingdon, but each incorporated extensive social and moral commentary into their accounts and borrowed a range of literary devices and stereotypical events from other popular works. Other chroniclers include Eadmer, Hugh the Chanter, Abbot Suger, and the authors of the Welsh Brut. Not all royal documents from the period have survived, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of royal acts, charters, writs, and letters, along with some early financial records. Some of these have since been discovered to be forgeries, and others had been subsequently amended or tampered with.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the spore shape, the species is readily identified {{with the use of}} a microscope because of its setae. Setae are a kind of unusual cystidia unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in P.ellipsoideus, are found in the hymenium. In shape, the setae are ventricose, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles (underdeveloped cystidia) can be found in the species, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of rhomboid crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{architecture}} of the town is undistinguished <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of listed buildings, many of them in the more outlying areas but some are scattered throughout the town. The listed churches are the Anglican churches of St Luke's, Farnworth (and its adjacent bridewell), and St Mary's, West Bank, the Roman Catholic churches of St Michael's, St Marie's and St Bede's, and the two chapels in the cemetery. The railway stations of Widnes and Hough Green are listed, as are the former town hall and the former power house of the transporter bridge.|$|E

5|$|Regenbald's {{lands are}} {{recorded}} in a charter from {{the reign of}} King Henry I of England which dealt with the gift of those lands after Regenbald's death. This charter lists a number of estates as owned by Regenbald that were also listed in Domesday Book as Regenbald's, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few other possessions that did not get recorded in Domesday. The lands listed include lands in Gloucestershire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Dorset. Domesday lists the value of Regenbald's lands at £40 per year. His estates totalled about 90 hides, {{although some of the}} estates were given to him after the Norman Conquest.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> {{few examples of}} migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the Eurasian wryneck breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements {{can be described as}} dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E
5|$|During a flyby on 26 September 2012, Cassinis radar {{detected}} in Titan's northern polar region {{what is likely}} a river with a length of more than 400 kilometers. It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini RADAR altimeter observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are {{at the same level}} as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E

5|$|During the series' fifty-year history {{only a few}} of {{the films}} have {{remained}} substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a giant squid, and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.|$|E
5|$|The Pictish and Cumbric {{languages}} {{were replaced}} by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse, with Gaelic emerging as the major cultural language. From the eleventh century French was adopted in the court and in the late Middle Ages, Scots, derived from Old English, became dominant, with Gaelic largely confined to the Highlands. Christianity brought Latin, written culture and monasteries as centres of learning. From the twelfth century, educational opportunities widened and a growth of lay education cumulated in the Education Act 1496. Until in the fifteenth century, when Scotland gained three universities, Scots pursuing higher education had to travel to England or the continent, where some gained an international reputation. Literature survives in all the major languages present in the early Middle Ages, with Scots emerging as a major literary language from John Barbour's Brus (1375), developing a culture of poetry by court makars, and later major works of prose. Art from the early Middle Ages survives in carving, in metalwork, and elaborate illuminated books, which contributed {{to the development of}} the wider insular style. Much of the finest later work has not survived, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few key examples, particularly of work commissioned in the Netherlands. Scotland had a musical tradition, with secular music composed and performed by bards and from the thirteenth century, church music increasingly influenced by continental and English forms.|$|E

25|$|Upwards of 2000 {{inscriptions}} {{have been}} recorded by excavators {{under the aegis of}} New York University. Many of these inscriptions had been re-used in the city walls. Most inscriptions are from the Imperial period, with funerary and honorary texts being particularly well represented, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> handful of texts from all periods from the Hellenistic to Byzantine.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundaries}} of the regions are based largely on drainage basins. This anticipated {{the responsibilities of the}} Resource Management Act 1991.

An example is Taupo District, split between four regions, although most of its area is in the Waikato region.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{characters}} have appeared on the American children's television series Sesame Street.

25|$|Lebanese nationalism, which rejects Arab identity, {{has found}} a strong support among some Maronites and even other Orthodox Christians. However, this form of nationalism, nicknamed Phoenicianism, never {{developed}} into an integrated ideology led by key thinkers, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few who stood out more than others: Charles Corm, Michel Chiha, and Said Aql in their promotion of Phoenicianism.|$|E
25|$|Trauma can {{be caused}} by a wide variety of events, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> few common aspects. There is {{frequently}} a violation of the person's familiar ideas about the world and their human rights, putting the person in a state of extreme confusion and insecurity. This is seen when institutions depend upon for survival, violate, humiliate, betray, or cause major losses or separations instead of evoking aspects like deserve, special, safe, new and freedom.|$|E
25|$|A similar annual pattern {{occurs in}} salinity. There {{is a clear}} {{seasonal}} variation, with values ranging from a summer high of around 35.7 ppt, to a winter low of around 35.4 ppt. As with water temperatures, the variability in salinity is much smaller than in coastal waters, where summer salinity reaches 36.4 ppt. This difference {{is partly due to}} the low-salinity waters of the Leeuwin Current, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of other factors involved, including high evaporation of coastal waters in summer.|$|E
