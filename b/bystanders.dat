40|$|Radiation damages {{initiated}} by radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effect (RIBE) {{are not limited}} to the first or immediate neighbors of the irradiated cells, but the effects have been observed in the cells far from the irradiation site.

Current study was planned to test the hypothesis. MRC 5 and QU-DB cell lines were irradiated, and successive medium transfer technique was performed to induce <b>bystander</b> effects in two <b>bystander</b> cell groups. Conditioned medium extracted from the target cells was transferred to the <b>bystander</b> cells (first <b>bystander</b> cells). After one hour, conditioned medium was substituted by fresh medium.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare the level of <b>bystander</b> effect in a couple of tumor and normal cell lines (QU-DB and MRC 5). To induce <b>bystander</b> effect, cells were irradiated with 0. 5, 2, and 4 Gy of 60 Co gamma rays and their media were transferred to non-irradiated (<b>bystander)</b> cells of the same type. Cells containing micronuclei were counted in <b>bystander</b> subgroups, non-irradiated, and 0. 5 Gy irradiated cells. Frequencies of cells containing micronuclei in QU-DB <b>bystander</b> subgroups were higher than in <b>bystander</b> subgroups of MRC 5 cells (P < 0. 001). The number of micronucleated cells counted in non-irradiated and 0. 5 Gy irradiated QU-DB cells was also higher than the corresponding values for MRC 5 cells (P < 0. 001). Another difference between the two cell lines was that in QU-DB <b>bystander</b> cells, a dose-dependent increase in the number of micronucleated cells was observed as the dose increased, but at all doses the number of micronucleated cells in MRC 5 <b>bystander</b> cells was constant.

40|$|This work {{evaluated}} the radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effect in mitochondrial mutant cells and in normal cells treated with mitochondrial inhibitors. Although much {{research has been}} performed on the <b>bystander</b> effect, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Cells without intact mitochondrial DNA {{have been shown to}} lack the <b>bystander</b> effect, which is an energy-dependent process. Based on these findings, cells harboring mutations in the mitochondrial genes responsible for ATP synthesis, and normal cells treated with mitochondrial inhibitors, were hypothesized to show a decreased <b>bystander</b> effect when compared to normal cells that were not treated with the mitochondrial inhibitors. Radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effects were analyzed in normal and mitochondrial mutant human lymphoblastoid cells using the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay. The results indicate that the mitochondrial mutant cells do not exhibit the <b>bystander</b> effect while the normal cells do. Both the normal and mitochondrial mutant cells were found to show a dose-responsive increase in DNA damage upon direct exposure to radiation. The generation of and response to <b>bystander</b> signals in the normal and mitochondrial mutant cells were then analyzed by evaluating the radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effects between each possible pair-wise combination of normal and mutant cell lines. Normal cells were found to generate and to respond to <b>bystander</b> signals, while the mitochondrial mutant cells neither generated nor responded to <b>bystander</b> signals. To determine whether normal cells behave similar to the mutant cells when their mitochondrial ATP synthesis is inhibited, the radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effect in normal cells treated with mitochondrial inhibitors was evaluated. The results indicate that the normal cells treated with rotenone or oligomycin do not exhibit the <b>bystander</b> effect. To determine the time period during which the inhibition was effective, normal cells were treated with the inhibitors at different times before, during and after radiation. The results indicate that normal cells do not exhibit the <b>bystander</b> effect when the inhibitors were added 24 hours before radiation and were removed immediately after radiation. Similarly, normal cells treated with the inhibitors after radiation did not exhibit the <b>bystander</b> effect. However, when the inhibitors were added just prior to radiation and were removed immediately after radiation, normal cells did not show an inhibition of <b>bystander</b> effect, indicating that this short period of treatment might not be sufficient to cause the inhibition. These results indicate that mitochondrial ATP synthesis in human lymphoblastoid cells {{plays an important role in}} the generation and response to <b>bystander</b> signals and thus, the <b>bystander</b> effect...|$|R

We investigated whether dispatcher-assisted <b>bystander</b> CPR shows favorable neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category scale 1 or 2) {{in children with}} out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Methods and Results-Children (n= 5009, age < 18 years) with OHCA were selected from a nationwide Utstein-style Japanese database (2008 - 2010) and divided into 3 groups: no <b>bystander</b> CPR (n= 2287); <b>bystander</b> CPR with dispatcher instruction (n= 2019); and <b>bystander</b> CPR without dispatcher instruction (n= 703) groups. The primary endpoint was favorable neurological outcome at 1 month post-OHCA. Dispatcher CPR instruction was offered to 53. 9 % of patients, significantly increasing <b>bystander</b> CPR provision rate (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 7. 51; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 6. 60 to 8. 57). <b>Bystander</b> CPR with and without dispatcher instruction {{were significantly associated with}} improved 1 -month favorable neurological outcomes (aOR, 1. 81 and 1. 68; 95 % CI, 1. 24 to 2. 67 and 1. 07 to 2. 62, respectively), compared to no <b>bystander</b> CPR.

40|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} used to treat many {{diseases}} such as cancer. However, off-targeted side-effects called <b>bystander</b> effects are observed in patients post radiotherapy. <b>Bystander</b> effects are when non-irradiated cells exhibit similar effects as directly irradiated cells. Understanding how these <b>bystander</b> effects are mediated can help improve cancer treatment. Previous work from our lab has shown that extracellular vesicles derived from conditioned media of irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts mediate radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effects by inhibiting clonogenic survival, increase γH 2 AX, and increase ROS. However, when the protein Abl is mutated so {{that it no longer}} can enter the nucleus, the EVs from the conditioned media of these irradiated cells do not cause <b>bystander</b> effects. When nuclear Abl is reconstituted into these mutant cells, the EVs from the conditioned media of these irradiated cells cause <b>bystander</b> effects such as increase γH 2 AX and increase ROS. This suggests that nuclear Abl is required for extracellular vesicle mediated radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effects. Abl inhibitors are FDA approved and might be viable treatments to reduce <b>bystander</b> effects in patients undergoing radiation therapy. Additionally, in a paper previously published by our lab, nuclear Abl is required for miR- 34 c processing. Since EVs can contain miRNAs as cargo, miR- 34 c could be involved in the nuclear Abl dependent extracellular vesicle mediated radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effects.

40|$|Abstract—Radon risks {{derive from}} {{exposure}} of bronchio-epithelial cells to alpha particles. Alpha-particle exposure {{can result in}} <b>bystander</b> effects when irradiated cells emit signals resulting in damage to nearby unirradiated <b>bystander</b> cells. <b>Bystander</b> effects can cause downwardly-curving dose-response relations and inverse dose-rate effects. We have extended a quantitative mechanistic model of <b>bystander</b> effects to include protracted exposure, with inverse dose-rate effects attributed to replenishment, during exposure, of a subpopula-tion of cells which are hypersensitive to <b>bystander</b> signals. In this approach, <b>bystander</b> effects and the inverse dose-rate effect are manifestations of the same basic phenomenon. The model was fitted to dose- and dose-rate dependent radon-exposed miner data; {{the results suggest that}} one directly-hit target cell can send <b>bystander</b> signals to about 50 neighboring cells and that, in the case of domestic radon exposures, the risk could be dominated by <b>bystander</b> effects. The analysis con-cludes that a naive linear extrapolation of radon miner data to low doses, without accounting for dose rate/bystander effects, would result in an underestimation of domestic radon risks by about a factor of 4. However, recent domestic radon risk estimates (BEIR VI) have already applied a phenomenological correction factor of 4 for inverse dose-rate effects, and have thus already implicitly taken into account corrections which we here suggest are due to <b>bystander</b> effects. Thus current domestic radon risk estimates are unlikely to be underesti-mates as a result of <b>bystander</b> effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to explore a possible molecular mechanism by which ultraviolet (UV) biophotons could elicit <b>bystander</b> responses in reporter cells and resolve the problem of seemingly mutually exclusive mechanisms of a physical UV signal & a soluble factor-mediated <b>bystander</b> signal. The human colon carcinoma cell line, HCT 116 p 53 +/+, was directly irradiated with 0. 5 Gy tritium beta particles to induce ultraviolet biophoton emission. <b>Bystander</b> cells were not directly irradiated but were exposed to the emitted UV biophotons. Medium was subsequently harvested from UV-exposed <b>bystander</b> cells. The exosomes extracted from this medium were incubated with reporter cell populations. These reporter cells were then assayed for clonogenic survival and mitochondrial membrane potential with and without prior treatment of the exosomes with RNase. Clonogenic cell survival was significantly reduced in reporter cells incubated with exosomes extracted from cells exposed to secondarily-emitted UV. These exosomes also induced significant mitochondrial membrane depolarization in receiving reporter cells. Conversely, exosomes extracted from non-UV-exposed cells did not produce <b>bystander</b> effects in reporter cells. The treatment of exosomes with RNase prior to their incubation with reporter cells effectively abolished <b>bystander</b> effects in reporter cells and this suggests a role for RNA in mediating the <b>bystander</b> response elicited by UV biophotons and their produced exosomes. This study supports a role for exosomes released from UV biophoton-exposed <b>bystander</b> cells in eliciting <b>bystander</b> responses and also indicates a reconciliation between the UV-mediated <b>bystander</b> effect and the <b>bystander</b> effect which has been suggested in the literature to be mediated by soluble factors...|$|R

40|$|The radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effect {{represents}} {{a paradigm shift}} {{in our understanding of}} the radiobiological effects of ionizing radiation, in that extranuclear and extracellular events may also contribute to the final biological consequences of exposure to low doses of radiation. Although radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> effects have been well documented in a variety of biological systems, the mechanism is not known. It is likely that multiple pathways are involved in the <b>bystander</b> phenomenon, and different cell types respond differently to <b>bystander</b> signalling. Using cDNA microarrays, a number of cellular signalling genes, including cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2), {{have been shown to be}} causally linked to the <b>bystander</b> phenomenon. The observation that inhibition of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) suppressed the <b>bystander</b> response further confirmed the important role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade in the <b>bystander</b> process. Furthermore, cells deficient in mitochondrial DNA showed a significantly reduced response to <b>bystander</b> signalling, suggesting a functional role of mitochondria in the signalling process. Inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) and mitochondrial calcium uptake provided evidence that NO and calcium signalling are part of the signalling cascade. The <b>bystander</b> observations imply that the relevant target for various radiobiological endpoints is larger than an individual cell.

In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Walt's partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) has just shot Gale {{to death on}} orders from Walt to foil Gus' plot to kill and replace them. Gus' henchman Victor (Jeremiah Bitsui) arrives at Gale's {{apartment}} and finds him dead, surrounded by neighbors who have just called the police. Victor finds a stunned Jesse sitting in his car outside and forces him at gunpoint {{to return to the}} meth lab, where Gus' employee Mike (Jonathan Banks) is holding Walt hostage. Mike, who is concerned that Victor was seen by <b>bystanders</b> at the murder scene, calls to inform Gus of the events. Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bystander</b> {{conflict}} {{is a situation}} in which employees are hindered in their work by parties not involved in the primary process. Public service employees and emergency care workers, such as ambulance employees and firefighters, often encounter this kind of conflict with potentially far-reaching detrimental effects for public or patient safety. Unfortunately, until now, <b>bystander</b> conflict has hardly received scientific attention. In this paper, we will present the results of an experiment (Study 1) and a simulation study (Study 2). Taken together, the results indicate that <b>bystander</b> {{conflict is}} negatively related to the affective, behavioural, and cognitive outcomes of individuals. Higher levels of <b>bystander</b> conflict were associated with more negative and less positive feelings (Studies 1, 2), unfavourable <b>bystander</b> appraisals (Studies 1, 2), and lower levels of performance (Study 2). Additionally, Study 2 revealed that <b>bystander</b> conflict was negatively and indirectly related to positive affect and performance through cognitive capacity. We investigated the moderating role of resilience, in order to provide insight into potential factors alleviating these negative associations. In both studies, resilience alleviated the negative associations of <b>bystander</b> conflict. Overall, the results of the two studies provide a first step towards a theory on <b>bystander</b> conflict...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bystander</b> effect/DMSO/Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS). Evidence is accumulating that {{irradiated}} cells produce some signals which interact with non-exposed {{cells in the}} same population via a <b>bystander</b> effect. Here, we examined whether DMSO is effective in sup-pressing radiation induced <b>bystander</b> effects in CHO and repair deficient xrs 5 cells. When 1 Gy-irradiated CHO cells were treated with 0. 5 % DMSO for 1 hr before irradiation, the induction of micronuclei in irra-diated cells was suppressed to 80 % of that in non-treated irradiated cells. The suppressive effect of DMSO on the formation of <b>bystander</b> signals was examined and the results demonstrated that 0. 5 % DMSO treat-ment of irradiated cells completely suppressed the induction of micronuclei by the <b>bystander</b> effect in non-irradiated cells. It is suggested that irradiated cells ceased signal formation for <b>bystander</b> effects {{by the action of}} DMSO. To determine the involvement of reactive oxygen species on the formation of <b>bystander</b> signals, we examined oxidative stress levels using the DCFH staining method in irradiated populations. The results showed that the treatment of irradiated cells with 0. 5 % DMSO did not suppress oxidative stress levels. These results suggest that the prevention of oxidative stress is independent of the suppressive effect of DMSO on the formation of the <b>bystander</b> signal in irradiated cells. It is suggested that increased ROS in irradiated cells is not a substantial trigger of a <b>bystander</b> signal...|$|R
40|$|The radiation-induced <b>bystander</b> {{effect is}} defined as “the {{induction}} of biological effects in cells that are not directly traversed by a charged particle but are {{in close proximity to}} cells that are. ” Although these <b>bystander</b> effects have been demonstrated with a variety of biological endpoints in both human and rodent cell lines (as well as in 3 D tissue samples), the mechanism of the phenomenon is not known. Although gap junction communication and the presence of soluble mediator(s) are both known to play important roles in the <b>bystander</b> response, the precise signaling molecules have yet to be identified. By using the Columbia University charged particle beam in conjunction with a strip dish design, we show here that the cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2, also known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase- 2) signaling cascade plays an essential role in the <b>bystander</b> process. Treatment of <b>bystander</b> cells with NS- 398, which suppresses COX- 2 activity, significantly reduced the <b>bystander</b> effect. Because the critical event of the COX- 2 signaling is the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, our finding that inhibition of the extracellular signal-related kinase phosphorylation suppressed <b>bystander</b> response further confirmed the important role of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade in the <b>bystander</b> process. These results provide evidence that the COX- 2 -related pathway, which is essential in mediating cellular inflammatory response, is the critical signaling link for the <b>bystander</b> phenomenon...|$|R
