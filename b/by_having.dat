5|$|It {{is usually}} easy to {{recognise}} {{that a particular}} insect is a bee.

5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands <b>by</b> <b>having</b> overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
