25|$|A <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>discrimination</b> was {{included}} in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised Constitution. The ban on sexual harassment in the workplace forms part of the Federal Act on Gender Equality (GEA) of 24 March 1995, where it is one of several provisions which prohibit discrimination in employment and which are intended to promote equality. Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances, Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the complaints procedure. Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual harassment. The ban on sexual harassment is intended exclusively for employers, within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality, mental and physical well-being and health.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} whether banks {{should be allowed}} to set different ATM prices to their customers depending on whether they hold an account on the bank. In Massoud and Bernhardt (2002), without considering an interchange fee, a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> price <b>discrimination</b> <b>on</b> ATM services increases total surplus. In the present model that considers an interchange fee, the effect of a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> price <b>discrimination</b> depends <b>on</b> the way the interchange is fixed. If it is fixed to maximize the profits of banks, forbidding price discrimination reduces total surplus.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} short- and long-run {{implications}} of third-degree price discrimination in input markets. In {{contrast to the}} extant literature, which typically assumes that the supplier is an unconstrained monopolist, in our model input prices are constrained {{by the threat of}} demand-side substitution. In our model, the more efficient buyer receives a discount. A <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> price <b>discrimination</b> thus benefits smaller but hurts more efficient, larger firms. It also stifles incentives to invest and innovate. With linear demand, a <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> price <b>discrimination</b> benefits consumers in the short run but reduces consumer surplus in the long run, which is once again the opposite of what is found without the threat of demand-side substitution.

5000|$|The Dutch Parliament {{enacted the}} Equal Rights Act in 1994, which bans {{discrimination}} {{on the grounds of}} sexual orientation in employment, housing, and both public and private accommodations. Transgender people are protected under the category 'gender'. Although gender identity is not specifically mentioned, there have been cases where the Dutch Institute for Human Rights has ruled that transgender people fall under this clause. However, in 2014 the Ministry of BZK started exploring how the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>discrimination</b> based on gender identity and gender expression can be made explicit in the Equal Rights Act. The results where published on 23 June 2016. The report states that although discrimination against transgender people is forbidden, it is recommended to explicit prohibition in the Equal Rights Act, in order to raise awareness of this ban. The report also recommends to ban discrimination of people with an intersex condition. On 16 January 2017, the political parties D66, PvdA and GL published a bill to amend the Equal Rights Act. The bill will explicit the <b>ban</b> <b>on</b> <b>discrimination</b> on the grounds of sexual characteristics, gender identity and gender expression.

5000|$|The {{decision}} {{met with}} public protest across the country, {{and led to}} regular [...] "indignation meetings" [...] held in numerous cities. The Supreme Court decision severely restricted {{the power of the}} federal government to guarantee equal status under the law to blacks. State officials in the South took advantage of the eclipsed role of Congress in the prohibition of racial discrimination and proceeded to embody individual practices of racial segregation into laws that legalized the treatment of blacks as second-class citizens for another seventy years. The court's decision thus ultimately led to the enactment of state laws, such as Jim Crow Laws, which codified what had previously been individual adherence to the practice of racial segregation. Several northern and western states however did not follow suit and began instead enacting their own <b>bans</b> <b>on</b> <b>discrimination</b> in public places.|$|R
