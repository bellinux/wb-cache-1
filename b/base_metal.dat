5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the <b>base</b> <b>metal.</b> In addition to melting the <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E
5|$|A few {{thousand}} {{of the first}} circulation strikes, {{as well as a}} handful of proof coins, came from a prototype die with smaller letters in the motto than all other 1864 pieces. Although specimens of the two-cent piece, being of <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> were not set aside for testing by the annual Assay Commission, Congress did order that internal checks be done at the Mint as to their composition and weight.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the Mint {{had begun}} to strike {{copper-nickel}} clad coins instead of silver, due to rises in bullion prices. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, and none, initially, were minted in the new metal. Beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died in March of that year, {{there were a number}} of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President Richard Nixon, who had served as vice president under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing the new coin on December 31, 1970.|$|E
30|$|Al-Cu joints are {{difficult}} to manufacture by fusion welding processes due to the {{significant difference in the}} chemical composition and physical properties of the <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b> Consequently, these type of dissimilar joints are mostly welded by solid-state welding processes, where only the differences in the physical and mechanical properties of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> need to be considered (Joseph 2006). With fusion welding processes, on the other hand, many more factors have to be considered, such as the dilution of the filler <b>metal</b> and <b>base</b> <b>metals,</b> the physical properties of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> and filler metal and the heat treatment used.|$|R
50|$|Two {{characteristics}} are regularly associated with minor metals: (1) their global production {{is relatively small}} in comparison to <b>base</b> <b>metals,</b> and (2), they are predominantly extracted as by-products of <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b> However, due to {{the diversity of the}} metals often classified as minor metals, there is still much discussion about what exactly defines a minor metal. It has also been noted that minor metals can also be characterized as having relatively few end uses in comparison to <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> and that they are more difficult to extract from their naturally occurring host minerals than <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{looks into}} the price {{behavior}} of five <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> – aluminum, copper, zinc, lead and nickel traded on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), using near month futures contracts and spot contracts for the period from November 2007 to January 2013. To {{assess the impact of}} the recent Global Financial Crisis on trading of <b>base</b> <b>metals,</b> the price volatility of the <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> has been examined using GARCH models. The paper also studies the effect of implied volatility of equity market, measured by India VIX on the price volatility of the five <b>base</b> <b>metals.</b> The findings of the study suggest that there is presence of short term persistence in price volatility of the metals, and the daily price volatility of <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> is influenced by the Global Financial Crisis. The implied volatility in equity market is also found to affect the price volatility of the metals. Thus, the paper gives important evidence in support of the introduction of option contracts on <b>base</b> <b>metals</b> in Indian Commodity Markets, since option contracts are priced considering the price volatility of the underlying asset. ...|$|R
5|$|Since its introduction, the Roosevelt dime {{has been}} struck {{continuously}} in large numbers. The Mint transitioned from striking the coin in silver to <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> in 1965, {{and the design}} remains essentially unaltered from when Sinnock created it. Without rare dates or silver content, the dime is less widely sought by coin collectors than other modern U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|Some Peace dollars using a <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> {{composition}} {{were struck}} as experimental pieces in 1970 {{in anticipation of}} the approval of the Eisenhower dollar; they are all presumed destroyed. This new dollar coin was approved by an act signed by President Richard Nixon on December 31, 1970, with the obverse to depict President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had died in March, 1969. Circulating Eisenhower dollars contained no precious metal, though some for collectors were struck in 40%silver.|$|E
5|$|Steel <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> is iron, {{which is}} able to take on two {{crystalline}} forms (allotropic forms), body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC), depending on its temperature. It is the interaction of those allotropes with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In the body-centred cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the centre of each cube, and in the face-centred cubic, there is one {{at the center of}} each of the six faces of the cube.|$|E

5|$|Alchemy {{was already}} well {{established}} before {{the rise of}} Islam. It {{was based on the}} belief that substances were made up of the four Aristotelian elements, fire, earth, air, and water in different proportions. Alchemists supposed that gold was the noblest metal, and that other metals formed a series down to the basest, such as lead. They believed, too, that a fifth element, the elixir, could transform a <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> into gold. Jabir ibn Hayyan (8th–9th centuries) wrote on alchemy, based on his own experiments. He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue to be used when alchemy had transformed into chemistry. Ibn Hayyan identified many substances including sulphuric and nitric acids. He described processes such as sublimation, reduction and distillation. He made use of equipment such as the alembic and the retort stand.|$|E
5|$|In many applications, {{the noble}} gases {{are used to}} provide an inert atmosphere. Argon {{is used in the}} {{synthesis}} of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography, as a filler gas for thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber. Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War caused most American coins {{to vanish}} from circulation, with the gap filled by such means as {{merchant}} tokens, encased postage stamps, and United States fractional currency, issued in denomination {{as low as}} three cents. Although specie (gold or silver coins) was hoarded or exported, the copper-nickel cent, then the only <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> denomination being struck, also vanished. In 1864, Congress began the process of restoring coins to circulation by abolishing the three-cent note and authorizing bronze cents and two-cent pieces, with low intrinsic values, to be struck. These new coins initially proved popular, though the two-cent piece soon faded from circulation. On March 3, 1865, Congress passed legislation authorizing the Mint to strike three-cent pieces of 75%copper and 25%nickel.|$|E

5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{composition of}} the coins was sterling (0.925) silver. In common with all British silver coins, the fineness was reduced to 0.500 in 1921. In 1947 silver was removed from all circulating British coinage in favour of cupronickel, but as it was felt to be inappropriate to strike Maundy coins in <b>base</b> <b>metal,</b> their fineness was restored to 0.925. On Decimal Day, 15 February 1971, the pound sterling became decimalised, with 100 new pence instead of 20 shillings of 12 pence (240 pence) in a pound. No change was made {{to the design of}} the Maundy pieces, and all Maundy pieces, both pre- and post-Decimal Day, are by law deemed denominated in new pence, more than doubling the face value of the pre-1971 pieces. The Maundy pieces continue to use the original obverse design for Queen Elizabeth II by Mary Gillick, although the bust of the Queen on other British coins has been repeatedly replaced as she ages. At the time of decimalisation, the Royal Mint Advisory Commission recommended the retention out of affection for the Gillick design; this was accepted by the Queen.|$|E
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} mineral resources, the Goat Rocks area {{can be divided}} into three segments, each rich with certain minerals. The first two are named Packwood Glacier–McCall Basin and Glacier Basin, and are located near past {{volcanic}} vents. These areas exhibit anomalous levels of cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc, well-dispersed levels of pyrite, and sporadic concentrations of silver. Area C corresponds to the Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and lies along the area of contact between Goat Rocks volcano and older volcanoes to the east. It is distinct from the other two study areas, featuring anomalous amounts of barium, cobalt, copper, and manganese, as well as smaller quantities of lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc. Other minerals found in Area C include barite, boron, cinnabar, mercury, pyrite, and tin in concentrates taken from stream-sediment. The water has high concentrations of chlorine, copper, fluorine, and molybdenum, and altered rocks contain arsenic, lead, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc at especially high levels. The Goat Rocks vicinity seems to offer large <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> deposits. Outside the area studied, coal has been identified at the Packwood and Cowlitz fields, and building stones and gravel are being quarried to the north and west of the volcano. The Goat Rocks area's potential resources for oil and gas remain unidentified. Because no volcanic activity has occurred during the Holocene (within the past 11,700 years), Goat Rocks has very little potential for geothermal resources.|$|E
5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fair}} closed, the {{question}} remained {{what to do}} with the some 4,600,000 half dollars which had not been sold. Organizers did not wish them to be issued, to preserve the premium price paid by purchasers. Those remaining in the Company's hands were redeemed by the Mint, which melted them; the fee for this service was forgiven by act of Congress. The coins which had been impounded by the Treasury were offered for sale at face value beginning in October 1894; when there were few takers, they were released into circulation. A million coins held by the Chicago banks were also placed in circulation. Although 2,501,700 half dollars were melted (all dated 1893), this still left a like number of Columbians in public hands. Coin dealer and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers recalls that when he began collecting coins as a boy in the 1950s, the Columbians were among the most common 19th-century pieces remaining in circulation. It was not until the 1930s that the pieces, in uncirculated condition, commanded the original price of $1. Prices began to rise as silver coins were replaced by <b>base</b> <b>metal</b> ones in the 1960s. In the 2012 version of Yeoman's catalog, both pieces are listed at under $20 in almost uncirculated (AU-50) condition, with specimens in near-pristine MS-66 selling for over a thousand dollars.|$|E
