In the first part, a survey is performed to assess {{the state of the}} art in rotor balancing technology as it applies to Army gas turbine engines and associated power transmission hardware. The second part evaluates thermal spray processes for balancing weight addition in an automated balancing procedure. The industry survey reveals that: (1) computerized balancing equipment is valuable to reduce errors, improve balance quality, and provide documentation; (2) slow-speed balancing is used exclusively, with no forseeable need for production high-speed balancing; (3) automated procedures are desired; and (4) thermal spray balancing is viewed with cautious optimism whereas laser balancing is viewed with concern for flight propulsion hardware. The FARE method (Fuel/Air Repetitive Explosion) was selected for experimental evaluation of bond strength and fatigue strength. Material combinations tested were tungsten carbide on stainless steel (17 - 4), Inconel 718 on Inconel 718, and Triballoy 800 on Inconel 718.

This qualitative study was part of a cross-national project entitled ENABLE-AGE which examined the relationship between home and healthy ageing. Interviews explored the notion of healthy ageing, the meaning and importance of home, conceptualisations of independence and autonomy and links between healthy ageing and home. Data analysis identified five ways in which older people constructed healthy ageing: home and keeping active; managing lifestyles, health and illness; balancing social life; and <b>balancing</b> <b>material</b> and financial circumstances. Older people reflected on their everyday lives at home in terms of being engaged in purposeful, meaningful action and evaluated healthy ageing in relation to the symbolic and practical affordances of the home, contextualised within constructions of their national context. The research suggests that older people perceive healthy ageing as an active achievement, created through individual, personal effort and supported through social ties despite the health, financial and social decline associated with growing older. The physicality and spatiality of home provided the context for establishing and evaluating the notion of healthy ageing, whilst the experienced relationship between home, life history and identity created a meaningful space within which healthy ageing was negotiated.

40|$|The current {{research}} argues that definiteness in Arabic {{can be used}} for formal purposes. The definite article and the nunnation suffix -n (NnnS) manage the information flow in the sentence through maintaining accepted informativity balance. Additionally, the study assumes that NnnS, -n, is not an indefinite article. Its main function is rather to stimulate the speaker to add information about indefinite nouns. The information triggered by the NnnS is labelled as 'balancing materials', whose aim is to restore sentence acceptability which degrades due to indefinite nouns. <b>Balancing</b> <b>materials</b> can be of two types: semantic and formal. When the speaker balks at adding either types of <b>balancing</b> <b>materials,</b> the definite article is used, instead. Here, the definite article resolves the tension of adding information about the indefinite nouns and refraining from doing so. These issues are supported by empirical evidence. With this new role of definiteness, new insights into some pertinent issues, including sentence building and translation are offered.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{comparing}} gas reservoir performance using two different methods, namely numerical simulation and general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> was conducted. The Songo Songo dry gas field in Tanzania {{was used for}} this study. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare results from the two methods with actual data obtained from the field and determine which one best fits the performance of dry gas reservoir. To accomplish the objective of this study, geology of the Songo Songo field was studied and physics and principles underlying gas reservoir simulation and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> were reviewed. These guided to set-up simulation procedures, designing flowchart for <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analysis and gathering relevant data. The geological formations and stratigraphy gave guidelines to reveal factors affecting the performance of the Songo Songo reservoir. From this study, it was determined that, reservoir simulation and general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> gave similar trends of the performance curves in the pR/Z plot. The analysis of variance at 95 % confidence level indicated that the probability of no significant difference between the results of the two methods was equal to 0. 927. It is early to specify that reservoir simulation or general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> gives better performance of the Songo Songo dry gas reservoir because the history of the field is short and the pressure support in reservoir simulation model and in general <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> model is different.

40|$|Estimating {{original}} hydrocarbons {{in place}} (OHIP) in a reservoir is fundamentally important to estimating reserves and potential profitability. Quantifying the uncertainties in OHIP estimates can improve reservoir development and investment decision-making for individual reservoirs {{and can lead}} to improved portfolio performance. Two traditional methods for estimating OHIP are volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> methods. Probabilistic estimates of OHIP are commonly generated prior to significant production from a reservoir by combining volumetric analysis with Monte Carlo methods. <b>Material</b> <b>balance</b> is routinely used to analyze reservoir performance and estimate OHIP. Although <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> has uncertainties due to errors in pressure and other parameters, probabilistic estimates are seldom done. In this thesis I use a Bayesian formulation to integrate volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses and to quantify uncertainty in the combined OHIP estimates. Specifically, I apply Bayes?? rule to the Havlena and Odeh <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> equation to estimate original oil in place, N, and relative gas-cap size, m, for a gas-cap drive oil reservoir. The paper considers uncertainty and correlation in the volumetric estimates of N and m (reflected in the prior probability distribution), as well as uncertainty in the pressure data (reflected in the likelihood distribution). Approximation of the covariance of the posterior distribution allows quantification of uncertainty in the estimates of N and m resulting from the combined volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses. Several example applications to illustrate the value of this integrated approach are presented. <b>Material</b> <b>balance</b> data reduce the uncertainty in the volumetric estimate, and the volumetric data reduce the considerable non-uniqueness of the <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> solution, resulting in more accurate OHIP estimates than from the separate analyses. One of the advantages over reservoir simulation is that, with the smaller number of parameters in this approach, we can easily sample the entire posterior distribution, resulting in more complete quantification of uncertainty. The approach can also detect underestimation of uncertainty in either volumetric data or <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> data, indicated by insufficient overlap of the prior and likelihood distributions. When this occurs, the volumetric and <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> analyses should be revisited and the uncertainties of each reevaluated...|$|R

In natural gas processing plants, {{where there are}} only phase separation processes and no chemical reactions, accurate <b>material</b> <b>balances</b> are crucial for ensuring the optimal processing of the natural gas hydrocarbons. Due to random and gross errors, caused by faulty or miscalibrated instrumentation, wrong sampling methods and erroneous laboratory analyses, measured data are unreliable and unsuitable for <b>material</b> <b>balances.</b> In order to compensate for incorrect measured variables, data reconciliation is required, to satisfy {{the constraints of the}} <b>material</b> <b>balance</b> and minimise the residual error between the measured and the adjusted variables.

40|$|Soil {{nutrient}} status {{is one of}} the most important constituents of land productivity. The research presented in this paper is aimed at describing the influence of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium availability on crop yield across the major soil types of Hungary, under different climatic conditions. For this purpose, historical times series data from a five year period (1985 - 1989) regarding soil, land management and crop yield of more than eighty thousand fields, representing approximately four million hectares of arable land, were statistically analyzed. The database was recently recovered from statistical archives stored in the format of digital records of the early 1980 s and were used to study the productivity of major soil types for winter wheat cropping under balanced fertilizer input. Calculations were made to quantify the effects of soil nutrient levels. The evaluation was also performed for optimal and suboptimal climate conditions. Results show that the effect of nitrogen availability (as obtained from organic matter content) had the largest influence on winter wheat yields. Up to a 26 % difference in yields was observed, both on those soils with <b>balanced</b> <b>material</b> regimes and on those with leaching material regimes, under optimal climatic conditions. The effect of different levels of phosphorous was most significant under optimal climatic conditions on soils with <b>balanced</b> <b>material</b> regimes; reaching up to 17 % difference between soils with very low and high phosphorous levels. The effect of different levels of potassium was the least significant in soils with <b>balanced</b> <b>material</b> regimes (maximum 8 % difference among categories) and somewhat more pronounced in soils with leaching material regimes. Differences between the effects of nutrient levels due to climatic variation were also observed. According to our findings, stable production can be planned on croplands with average nutrient availability, regardless which of the two soil types they belong to. On the other hand, yield gap can be detected on fields with both low and high nutrient levels among optimal and suboptimal years, for all three nutrients (NPK) of the analysis. Although our findings are based on historical data, most of the main relationships described are valid under current climatic and management conditions as well. JRC.
