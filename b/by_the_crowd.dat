5|$|Charles was universally beloved, beloved {{not only}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> of {{individuals}} with whom he came in contact, not only adored by his dependents, but thoroughly popular with the mass of his subjects and particularly with the poorer populace of London who knew him best.|$|E
5|$|Onlookers had {{gathered}} {{to watch the}} procession, and the soldiers were attacked on Eutaw Street by crowds throwing bricks and stones. No serious damage was done, and they continued until again, on Eutaw near Camden Street, they were stopped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> who injured several with their missiles.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Family {{step onto}} the balcony of the palace and are applauded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> a title card {{explains}} that Logue was always present at King George VI's speeches {{during the war and}} that they remained friends {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

5|$|Čabrinović {{swallowed}} his cyanide {{pill and}} {{jumped into the}} Miljacka river. Čabrinović's suicide attempt failed, as the cyanide only induced vomiting, and the Miljacka was only 13cm deep due to the hot, dry summer. Police dragged Čabrinović out of the river, and he was severely beaten <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> before being taken into custody.|$|E
5|$|De Launay {{had limited}} options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, {{he would have}} to turn the cannon {{directly}} inside the Bastille's courtyard on the crowds, causing great loss of life and preventing any peaceful resolution of the episode. De Launay could not withstand a long siege, and he was dissuaded by his officers from committing mass suicide by detonating his supplies of powder. Instead, de Launay attempted to negotiate a surrender, threatening to blow up the Bastille if his demands were not met. In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly came down and the revolutionary crowd stormed in. De Launay was dragged outside into the streets and killed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> and three officers and three soldiers were killed {{during the course of the}} afternoon <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform coats and were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by the crowds until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers. The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.|$|E
5|$|During the protest, {{the crowd}} {{assaulted}} a JNA armoured personnel carrier {{and managed to}} remove a machine gun mounted on the vehicle, while one of the protesters, Ivica Balić, hoisted a Croatian flag at the building to singing of the Croatian anthem <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> In a scuffle which broke {{out in front of}} the building, Saško Gešovski, a JNA conscript from Macedonia, was killed by a shot fired from the crowd. By the end of the afternoon, the crowd removed the Yugoslav flag from the building, moved away and dispersed.|$|E
25|$|When {{news of the}} Shah's {{departure}} was announced, {{there were}} spontaneous scenes of joy throughout the country. Millions poured onto the streets, virtually every remaining sign of the monarchy was torn down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds.</b>|$|R
60|$|They {{made their}} way towards the river, {{avoiding}} the street which was blocked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> and <b>the</b> fire-engines. As they crossed the Strand, the man looked back. A red glow was in the sky.|$|R
60|$|Their case seemed truly {{desperate to}} Miles, {{as he and}} his comrades passed through the narrow streets, for no pitying eye, but many a frown, was cast on them <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> who stopped to gaze and scoff.|$|R
5|$|In the morning, {{attention}} focused on the capital Saigon, where approximately 500 Buddhist laypeople, mostly youths, protested {{in front of the}} Government Delegate's office while 300 troops stood <b>by.</b> <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> and a government official equipped with a loudspeaker exchanged taunts and accusations. When the official claimed that Vietcong were among the crowd and attempting to cause trouble, the troops aimed their firearms at the protestors.|$|E
5|$|She {{competed in}} the fifth out of six heats of the women's 200 metre {{competition}} on 19 August. She finished {{in a time of}} 32.16 in eighth and last place, nine seconds behind South African Isabel Le Roux in seventh position. Having had no funding, Omar competed in loose fitting equipment donated by the Sudanese team, but despite finishing in last place, the media coverage of her meant that she was cheered loudly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> as she finished.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} {{scheduled a}} public celebration with free {{food and drink}} for the testing of the recast bell. When the bell was struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When {{the fruit of the}} two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell was hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.|$|E
50|$|Crowdsourcing Week is {{a global}} {{platform}} committed to helping organizations, innovators and entrepreneurs transition into a more open, connected, and socially productive society enabled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Internet and online tools powered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds.</b> <b>The</b> company {{highlights the importance of}} people-powered or crowd economy practices such as crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, collaborative consumption, sharing economy, and open innovation and among others through global conferences, summits and advisory services, CSW2.|$|R
60|$|Savonarola was too keen not {{to divine}} {{something}} of the conflict that was arresting her--too noble, deliberately to assume in calm speech that self-justifying evasiveness into which he was often hurried in public <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowding</b> impulses of <b>the</b> orator.|$|R
25|$|Smith {{was again}} booed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mexican <b>crowd</b> {{after she was}} {{announced}} {{as part of the}} top five while the local representative from Mexico was not. This continued as Smith answered her final question, finishing <b>by</b> thanking <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> in Spanish, which finally made <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> cheer. She eventually placed fourth runner-up, equaling the placement of her predecessor Tara Conner at Miss Universe 2006.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{his father}} {{saying he was}} betrayed by his friend C. W. McAllister during their climb on the mountain, Homer accepts and is aided by two Sherpas, but fires them after waking up one night to find them {{secretly}} dragging him up. Realizing he lacks the strength and resources to reach the top, Homer enters a cave to find McAllister's frozen body and evidence proving it was Abraham who betrayed him. Tired and ashamed, Homer sticks his flag pole on the ledge. The ensuing crack collapses {{the rest of the}} mountain, making where he is on now the peak. Proud, he uses McAllister's body to sled down, where he is greeted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} season on 16 September, as Chelsea {{defeated}} Maccabi Tel Aviv 4–0 in the Champions League. He, Costa and Oscar were jeered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> in December after the dismissal of Mourinho, with the supporters believing that the trio's conduct and poor performances were more culpable for the team's poor form. His first league goal came in a 3–3 home draw against Everton on 15 January 2016 and his second came in a 2–1 away win against Southampton on 27 February 2016. On 19 March 2016, Fàbregas scored a free-kick {{as well as a}} penalty in 2–2 home draw against local rivals West Ham United. Fàbregas scored Chelsea's last goal of the season after converting a penalty in the 1–1 draw against new Premier League champions, Leicester City.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{decided to}} retire from all cricket after the tour, not {{returning}} for Gloucestershire in 1947. Within 24 hours of his arrival back in England, he married Sybil Ness-Harvey. He played only two more first-class games. He scored an unbeaten 92 for the M.C.C. against Ireland in 1950. To help boost a Gloucestershire membership drive, he joined his former side for a match the following year. Although given an excellent reception <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> his tired appearance and struggle to score seven runs before being dismissed embarrassed many of those present. In all first-class cricket, Hammond scored 50,551 runs {{at an average of}} 56.10 with 167 centuries. He remains seventh on the list of highest run scorers in first-class cricket and has the third highest number of centuries, as of 2015.|$|E
50|$|Beginning with stints as Sydney's 'king of the hill' in the anarchic 'sing-along uni/ bar/ pub' {{scene of}} the late '70s and early '80s, Drummond became renowned for writing musical mini-operas that {{included}} whole sections scripted for and performed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} chosen for the solemn end to the {{demonstration}} held at Pamplona in 1893, and sang along <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> after widespread indignation sparked at the Spanish government's breach of fiscal terms concerning Navarre - protests known as the Gamazada.|$|R
25|$|Argetoianu {{followed}} Averescu into {{opposition to}} the Ion I. C. Brătianu National Liberal Party (PNL) cabinet, and joined the People's Party (PP) created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> latter. He later documented the populist message of the movement, and left testimonies of Averescu's spontaneous adulation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> of peasants.|$|R
5|$|Initially, {{surgeons}} recommended {{an eight-hour}} procedure {{to remove the}} tumours; however, their size and proximity to his voice box eventually persuaded them to recommend radiotherapy, of which Boycott had 35 sessions from 22 October. By December, scans revealed {{that the majority of}} the tumours had disappeared, and the final tumour's disappearance was confirmed in early 2003. Although initially reluctant to discuss his health with the public, he spoke privately with his daughter, Emma, and then released a statement publicly, which evoked a significant emotional response. On 16 August 2003, he was given his own standing ovation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> at Trent Bridge as he and a number of other cricketers did a lap of the ground in vehicles to celebrate Trent Bridge's 50th Test match.|$|E
5|$|Shearer {{was awarded}} a {{testimonial}} match by the club, against Scottish-side Celtic. All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes. Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland, Shearer was unable {{to play in the}} whole match; however he kicked-off the game and came off the bench to score a penalty, winning the game 3–2. The match was a sell-out, and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family, with his young son notably covering his ears due to the volume of noise produced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> in tribute.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield {{continues}} to be remembered by fans of his former teams. On 9 August 2014, as Exeter started the new season against Portsmouth, a giant flag resembling his club shirt was displayed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> Hereford F.C., the phoenix club of Hereford United, gave a minute's applause to Stansfield in the 9th minute – his number for the Bulls – in the 2016 FA Vase Final. Exeter and Yeovil agreed that on their meeting at St James Park on 8 August 2015, {{there would be a}} minute's applause in the seventh minute and ninth, for the numbers he wore at each club. Earlier the same day, there was also a match between the two clubs' supporters in Topsham, Devon, to raise funds for his foundation.|$|E
50|$|On October 17, 1806, Emperor Dessalines was ambushed by {{his former}} comrades Alexandre Pétion, Jean-Pierre Boyer, André Rigaud, and Bruno Blanchet. He was fatally shot north of Port-au-Prince. His body was then {{brought into the}} city where it was stoned and {{mutilated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds.</b>|$|R
50|$|At 9:20 p.m., {{in order}} to relieve some of <b>the</b> {{pressure}} created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> <b>the</b> guards let the first few people leave for West Berlin, although {{the head of the}} passport control unit Lieutenant-Colonel Harald Jäger had their passports stamped invalid, thus expatriating the passport holders without their knowledge. By 11:30 p.m., however, <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> had grown so large that he - still without official orders - finally raised the barrier. In the hour that followed, around 20,000 people were able to cross the Bösebrücke bridge without being checked.|$|R
50|$|A housing {{shortage}} forces two couples, each with an infant child, {{to share a}} house. Their inability to find and retain a reliable nanny exacerbates <b>the</b> problems caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowding,</b> and a pretty young lodger (played by Audrey Hepburn) and Sabina's persistent old beau (Guy Middleton) intensify the romantic tensions.|$|R
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E
5|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 178, with Earnhardt leading Johnson and Vickers. That lap, Burton (in fifth) had a flat left {{rear tire}} and lost a lap. The field then formed a single line, with most remaining in that formation {{for the rest}} of the race. On the final lap, Johnson and Vickers left turn two with Johnson moving out of line to pass Earnhardt. When Vickers tried to move out with Johnson to provide drafting assistance, he clipped Johnson's right rear quarter panel. Johnson clipped Earnhardt, sending both drivers into the infield. The yellow flag went out and the field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Vickers the victory (the first of his career), although he was booed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king. A group of six women nominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women {{to the point that}} one of them fainted at his feet. After this brief but pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse some food from the royal stores, with more promised, and some in the crowd felt that their goals had been satisfactorily met. As rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.|$|E
