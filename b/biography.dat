5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 <b>biography</b> by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when the {{question}} was still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his <b>biography</b> of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine {{is the only one who}} never became President. Although several authors studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol’s 2000 work, Muzzey’s was the last full-scale <b>biography</b> of the man until Neil Rolde’s 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams was working on a new <b>biography</b> of Blaine, tentatively titled James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics, until his death in 2016.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the years}} many have written <b>biographies</b> of Einstein. They all based their <b>biographies</b> on primary sources, archival material: {{memories}} and letters {{of people who}} were in contact with Einstein, Einstein's own recollections; interviews that Einstein had given over the years, and letters of Einstein to his friends - youth friends like Marcel Grossman and Michele Besso and later friends and colleagues like Heinrich Zangger; and especially his love letters with Mileva Marić. One can demarcate between two types of <b>biographies,</b> namely, Documentary <b>biographies,</b> and, Non-documentary <b>biographies.</b> Non-documentary <b>biographies</b> were written by people who based themselves on documentary <b>biographies</b> and on other non-documentary <b>biographies.</b> Documentary <b>biographies</b> were written by people who knew Einstein personally, and received information from him and from other people who were in personal contact with him. This type can be further divided into two subgroups: books that were written while Einstein was still alive, and books that were written after his death. Among the first group there were some <b>biographies</b> that Einstein considered to be more reliable, others he thought were less reliable, and still other <b>biographies</b> which he considered to be almost pure imagination. I will demonstrate that relying on primary sources and "documentary" does not necessarily mean "reliable"...|$|R

30|$|The {{presence}} of gender stereotypes and sexism and the Linguistic Intergroup Bias (LIB) theory suggest that abstract terms {{would be more}} likely to be used to describe positive aspects in the <b>biographies</b> of men than in <b>biographies</b> of women. Similarly, abstract language {{would be more likely}} to describe negative aspects in the <b>biographies</b> of women in comparison to <b>biographies</b> of men. We test this hypothesis first through a chi-square test on the aggregated ratios of adjectives over positive and negative words in all <b>biographies</b> of each gender. To test if the bias appears at the individual level, we then focus on <b>biographies</b> with at least 250 words and one evaluative term, testing if the measured r_+ and r_- depends on gender while controlling for professions and the century in which a person was born.|$|R
