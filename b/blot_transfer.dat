40|$|Some {{properties}} of gonococcal outer membrane III were studied {{by using a}} monoclonal antibody (2 E 6) in Western <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> and immunoprecipitation reactions. By Western blot, the 2 E 6 monoclonal had a single antigenic target: outer membrane protein III. All three gonococcal strains examined exhibited identical reactivities for their protein(s) III with this monoclonal. When 125 I-labeled gonococci were incubated with monoclonal antibody 2 E 6, lysed in Zwittergent, and antibody-antigen complexes were immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose, both outer membrane proteins I and III {{were present in the}} immunoprecipitates regardless of the gonococcal strain used. Exposure of gonococci to Iodogen and 2 -mercaptoethanol influences the electrophoretic migration characteristics of protein(s) III in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate; the antigenicity of protein(s) III was unaltered when assessed by Western <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> after reaction with Iodogen or 2 -mercaptoethanol.

The clone includes a long (1. 4 -kilobase) 3 ' untranslated region. Within the coding region, the data show extensive homology with other intermediate filament proteins, particularly in those regions predicted to be alpha-helical. RNA <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> experiments using the cloned GFAP cDNA probe revealed a single GFAP mRNA species of 2. 7 kilobases in mouse brain.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the isolation of}} a set of overlapping cDNAs encoding mouse microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP 2), using an anti-MAP antiserum to screen a mouse brain cDNA expression library cloned in bacteriophage lambda gt 11. The authenticity of these clones was established by the following criteria: (a) three non-identical clones each expressing a MAP 2 immunoreactive fusion protein were independently isolated from the expression library; each of these clones cross-hybridized at the nucleic acid level; (b) anti-MAP antiserum was affinity purified using nitrocellulose-bound fusion protein; these antibodies detected only MAP 2 in an immunoblot experiment of whole brain microtubule protein; (c) a series of cDNA "walking" experiments was done so as to obtain a non-overlapping cloned fragment corresponding to {{a different part of the}} same mRNA molecule. Upon subcloning this non-overlapping fragment into plasmid expression vectors, a fusion protein was synthesized that was immunoreactive with an anti-MAP 2 specific antiserum. Thus, a single contiguous cloned mRNA molecule encodes at least two MAP 2 -specific epitopes; (d) the cloned cDNA probes detect an mRNA species in mouse brain that is of a size (approximately 9 kb) consistent with the coding capacity required by a 250, 000 -D protein. The MAP 2 -specific cloned cDNA probes were used in RNA <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> experiments to assay for the presence of MAP 2 mRNA in a variety of mouse tissues. Though brain contained abundant quantities of MAP 2 mRNA, no corresponding sequences were detectable in RNA prepared from liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, or thymus. We conclude that the expression of MAP 2 is brain-specific. Use of the MAP 2 specific cDNA probes in genomic Southern <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> experiments showed the presence of a single gene encoding MAP 2 in mouse. The microheterogeneity of MAP 2 is therefore ascribable either to alternative splicing within a single gene, or to posttranslational modification(s), or both. Under conditions of low stringency, the mouse MAP 2 cDNA probe cross-hybridizes with genomic sequences from rat, human, and (weakly) chicken, but not with sequences in frog, Drosophila, or sea urchin DNA. Thus, there is significant interspecies divergence of MAP 2 sequences. The implications of the above observations are discussed in relationship to the potential biological function of MAP 2...|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} {{sites for}} viral DNA in cells infected with Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} (M-MuLV) were studied by restriction endonuclease cleavage of cellular DNA followed by electrophoresis in agarose gels, <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> to nitrocellulose, and detection by M-MuLV-related sequences by hybridization with high-specific-activity 32 P-labeled M-MuLV complementary DNA. When EcoRI was used to cleave cellular DNA, numerous DNA fragments with sequence homology to M-MuLV were detected in uninfected mouse cell DNA. These endogenous sequences are mouse specific since they are not detectable in rat cell DNA, and {{are related to the}} 38 S genomic RNA of M-MuLV. Infected cells contain additional M-MuLV-specific DNA fragments which are not detected in uninfected cells. Different patterns of M-MuLV-specific DNA fragments were detected in each cloned infected line examined. These data suggest the existence of multiple sites for integration of M-MuLV DNA in infected mouse fibroblasts. Cleavage of infected cell DNA with BamHI, which cleaves M-MuLV viral DNA at least twice, released the internal BamHI B fragment from each infected line, confirming the presence of integrated M-MuLV DNA sequences in each infected cell line which retain some features of the sequence organization of unintegrated M-MuLV DNA...|$|E

40|$|A {{family of}} {{mitochondrial}} RNAs hybridizes {{specifically to the}} var 1 region on Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial DNA (Farrelly et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257 : 6581 - 6587, 1982). We constructed a fine-structure transcription map of this region by hybridizing DNA probes containing different portions of the var 1 region and some flanking sequences to mitochondrial RNAs isolated from var 1 -containing petites. We also report the nucleotide sequence of more than 1. 2 kilobases of DNA flanking the var 1 gene. Our primary findings are: (i) The family of RNAs we detect with homology to var 1 DNA is colinear with the var 1 gene. Their direction of transcription is olil to cap, {{as it is for}} most other mitochondrial genes. (ii) Extensive hybridization anomalies are present, most likely due to the high A-T (A-U) content of the hybridizing species and to the asymmetric distribution of their G-C residues. An important conclusion is that failure to detect transcripts from A-T-rich regions of the yeast mitochondrial genome by standard <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> hybridizations cannot be interpreted to mean that such sequences, which are commonly supposed to be spacer DNA, are noncoding or lack direct function in the expression of mitochondrial genes...|$|E

40|$|By {{in vitro}} translation, we have {{identified}} the mRNA species that codes for a novel actin polypeptide (Ax-actin) in the chemically transformed human fibroblast line HuT- 14. The relatedness of the coding sequences of the Ax- and beta-actin genes is indicated by our finding that pcDd actin ITL-I DNA, a recombinant plasmid DNA that contains a DNA sequence complementary to actin mRNA of Dictyostelium discoideum, hybridizes both the Ax-actin mRNA and the beta-actin mRNA but not the gamma-actin mRNA. In contrast, pcHa- 1 DNA, a recombinant plasmid constructed by cloning a DNA sequence complementary to human actin mRNA from HuT- 14 cells into pBR 322, hybridized to all three mRNA species. In addition, no difference was observed between Ax- and beta-actin mRNAs when their molecular size was determined either by sucrose density gradient sedimentation or by methyl mercury agarose gel electrophoresis. Southern <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> of radioactive pcDd actin DNA to restriction endonuclease-digested Hut- 14 DNA produced only a single hybrid band (a 6 -kilobase fragment); the pcHa- 1 DNA probe detected one additional band (a 3 -kilobase fragment).

When considered together with recent determination of the entire amino acid sequences of Ax- and beta-actin, our findings indicate that Ax-actin {{is the product of}} a mutated beta-actin gene and are evidence for the occurrence of a mutation in a chemically transformed cell...|$|E

40|$|Methods in Molecular Biology. Chromatin Protocols. - 2 nd ed. /Edited by Srikumar P. Chellappan. (Series (Springer), 7651) Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is a sub-pathway of {{nucleotide}} {{excision repair}} {{that allows for}} the enhanced repair of the transcribed strand of active genes. A classical method to study DNA repair in vivo consists in the molecular analysis of UV-induced DNA damages at specific loci. Cells are irradiated with a defined dose of UV light leading {{to the formation of}} DNA lesions and incubated in the dark to allow repair. About 90 % of the photoproducts consist of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, which can be cleaved by the DNA nicking activity of the T 4 endonuclease V (T 4 endoV) repair enzyme. Strand-specific repair in a suitable restriction fragment is determined by alkaline gel electrophoresis followed by Southern <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> and indirect end-labeling using a single-stranded probe. Recent approaches have assessed the role of transcription factors in TCR by analyzing RNA polymerase II occupancy on a damaged template by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Cells are treated with formaldehyde in vivo to cross-link proteins to DNA and enrichment of a protein of interest is done by subsequent immunoprecipitation. Upon reversal of the protein-DNA cross-links, the amount of coprecipitated DNA fragments can be detected by quantitative PCR. To perform ChIP on UV-damaged templates, we included an in vitro photoreactivation step prior to PCR analysis to ensure that all precipitated DNA fragments serve as substrates for the PCR reaction. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for both the DNA repair analysis and the ChIP approaches to study TCR in chromatin.

40|$|Cardiac {{troponin}} I (cTnI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} useful serum marker test for the determination of myocardial infarction (MI). The first commercial assay of cTnI was released for medical use in the United States and Europe in 1995. It is useful in determining if the source of chest pains, whose etiology may be unknown, is cardiac related. Cardiac TnI is released into the bloodstream following myocardial necrosis (cardiac cell death) as a result of an infarct (heart attack). In this research project the utility of cardiac troponin I as a potential marker for the determination of time of death is investigated. The approach of this research is not to investigate cTnI degradation in serum/plasma, but to investigate the proteolytic breakdown of this protein in heart tissue postmortem. If our hypothesis is correct, cTnI might show a distinctive temporal degradation profile after death. This temporal profile may have potential as a time of death marker in forensic medicine. The field of time of death markers has lagged behind the great advances in technology since the late 18502 ̆ 7 s. Today medical examiners are using rudimentary time of death markers that offer limited reliability in the medico-legal arena. Cardiac TnI must be stabilized in order to avoid further degradation by proteases in the extraction process. Chemically derivatized magnetic microparticles were covalently linked to anti-cTnI monoclonal antibodies. A charge capture approach was also used to eliminate the antibody from the magnetic microparticles given the negative charge on the microparticles. The magnetic microparticles were used to extract cTnI from heart tissue homogenate for further bio-analysis. Cardiac TnI was eluted from the beads with a buffer and analyzed. This technique exploits banding pattern on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by a western <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) paper for probing with anti-cTnI monoclonal antibodies. Bovine hearts were used as a model to establish the relationship of time of death and concentration/band-pattern given its homology to human cardiac TnI.

40|$|Screening of a {{bacteriophage}} lambda gt 11 cDNA expression library with a polyclonal anti-microtubule associated protein (MAP) antiserum {{resulted in the}} isolation of two non-cross-hybridizing sets of cDNA clones. One set was shown to encode MAP 2 (Lewis, S. A., A. Villasante, P. Sherline, and N. J. Cowan, 1986, J. Cell Biol., 102 : 2098 - 2105). To determine the specificity of the second set, three non-overlapping fragments cloned from the same mRNA molecule via a series of "walking" experiments were separately subcloned into inducible plasmid expression vectors in the appropriate orientation and reading frame. Upon induction and analysis by immunoblotting, two of the fusion proteins synthesized were shown to be immunoreactive with an anti-MAP 1 -specific antibody, but not with an anti-MAP 2 -specific antibody. Since these MAP 1 -specific epitopes are encoded in non-overlapping cDNAs cloned from a single contiguous mRNA, these clones cannot encode polypeptides that contain adventitiously cross-reactive epitopes. Furthermore, these cDNA clones detected an abundant mRNA species of greater than 10 kb in mouse brain, consistent with the coding requirement of a 350, 000 -D polypeptide and the known abundance of MAP 1 in that tissue. The MAP 1 -specific cDNA probes were used in <b>blot</b> <b>transfer</b> experiments with RNA prepared from brain, liver, kidney, stomach, spleen, and thymus. While detectable quantities of MAP 1 -specific mRNA were observed in these tissues, the level of MAP 1 expression was approximately 500 -fold lower than in brain. The levels of both MAP 1 -specific and MAP 2 -specific mRNAs decline in the postnatal developing brain; the level of MAP 1 -specific mRNA also increases slightly in rat PC 12 cells upon exposure to nerve growth factor. These surprising results contrast sharply with reported dramatic developmental increases {{in the amount of}} MAP 1 in brain and in nerve growth factor-induced PC 12 cells. The cDNA clones encoding MAP 1 detect a single copy sequence in mouse DNA, even under conditions of low stringency that would allow the detection of related but mismatched sequences. The cDNAs cross-hybridize with genomic sequences in rat, human, and chicken DNA, but not with DNA from frog, Drosophila, or sea urchin. These data are discussed in terms of the evolution and possible biological role of MAP 1...|$|E

In the competition radioimmunoassay only minimal cross-reactivities were detected between HTLV-III p 24 and both HTLV-I and HTLV-II. No cross-reactivity was detected with any other retrovirus.

Antiserum to HTLV-II recognized HTLV-III p 24, but the antiserum to HTLV-III did not recognize HTLV-II p 24.

A solid-phase radioimmunoassay, with dried sperm as antigen, was employed in McAb screening. The tissue and species specificity of monoclonal antibodies HS 2, 4 and 6 were evaluated after absorption of antibody preparations with heterolo-gous sperm, human serum or seminal plasma or cells from other human organs. The sensitivity of HS 2, 4 and 6 antigens to trypsin exposure was determined: HS 4 antigen was highly sensitive while HS 2 and 6 were not. The regional distribution of McAb 4 on intact sperm cells {{was determined by}} immunofluorescence staining. HS 4 may be a sperm-coating antigen based on its presence on sperm and in seminal plasma. This possibility led to an investigation of its role in sperm capacitation. HS 4 antibody binding was reduced when capacitated sperm were compared with noncapacitated cells. HS 4 antibody, when present during capacitation and insemination, was without effect on sperm motility or fusion with zona-free hamster eggs. Trypsin removal {{of as much as}} 60 % of HS 4 antigen from the cell population also did not impact on sperm function. To identify the molecular cor-relate of HS 4 antigen, membrane components were extracted from washed sperm with Nonidet P 40, concentrated by acetone precipitation and analyzed electrophoretically in SDS-urea on 10 % polyacrylamide slab gels.

DNA clones were radiolabeled and hybridized against southern <b>blot</b> <b>transfers</b> of genomic DNAs of different isolates of A. azollae digested with restriction endonucleases. Eight DNA probes were selected to identify the Anabaena strains tested. Two were strain specific and hybridized only to A. azollae strains isolated from Azolla microphylla or Azolla caroliniana. One DNA probe was section specific (hybridized only to anabaenas isolated from Azolla ferns representing the section Euazolla), and five other probes gave finer discrimination among anabaenas representing various ecotypes of Azolla species. These cloned genomic DNA probes identified 11 different genotypes of A. azollae isolates. These included three endosymbiotic genotypes within Azolla filiculoides species and two genotypes within both A. caroliniana and Azolla pinnata endosymbionts. Although {{we were not able to}} discriminate among anabaenas extracted from different ecotypes of Azolla nilotica, Azolla mexicina, Azolla rubra and Azolla microphylla species, each of the endosymbionts was easily identified as a unique genotype. When total DNA isolated from free-living Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 was screened, none of the genomic DNA probes gave detectable positive hybridization. Total DNA of Nostoc cycas PCC 7422 hybridized with six of eight genomic DNA fragments.

40|$|Hepatocytes are {{polarized}} {{cells with}} distinct sinusoidal, bile canalicular, and basolateral plasma membrane domains. Each domain contains proteins that are specific for it. We have isolated three cDNA clones encoding a rat liver bile canaliculus domain-specific glycoprotein with Mr 110, 000 (gp 110) by immunologically screening a rat kidney lambda gt 11 cDNA library with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against purified gp 110. The authenticity of these clones was verified as follows. (i) The antiserum recognizes specifically isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside-induced fusion proteins on electrophoretic <b>transfer</b> <b>blots</b> of total lysogen lysates containing these cDNA clones. (ii) Antibodies epitope-selected by these clones {{are able to}} interact with gp 110 on electrophoretic <b>transfer</b> <b>blots.</b> (iii) The amino acid sequencing derived from the DNA sequence was confirmed by amino acid sequencing of a tryptic peptide of gp 110. Rescreening of the same library with the cDNA clones identified a full-length cDNA clone for this glycoprotein. Sequence analysis indicates that the N-linked carbohydrate chains are concentrated on the N-terminal part of this highly glycosylated protein...|$|R
40|$|Spores of {{a strain}} of Bacillus subtilis in which ftsZ was {{under the control of}} the spac {{promoter}} were allowed to germinate and grow out in the presence of increasing concentrations of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Over the IPTG concentration range of 0 to 10 (- 3) M, the level of FtsZ from the time when the first nucleoid segregations were occurring, measured in Western <b>blot</b> (immunoblot) <b>transfer</b> experiments, varied between 15 and 100 % of that in the wild type. Septation was completely blocked (for at least several hours) when the amount of FtsZ was < 30 % of the wild-type level. At all levels of ftsZ induction, the timing and rate of segregation of nucleoids following the first round of replication were unaltered. It is concluded that FtsZ has no direct role in nucleoid segregation in this situation...|$|R
40|$|An {{expression}} library made in plasmids pUC 8 and pUC 9 with mRNA {{derived from}} the human hepatoma cell line HepG 2 was screened with a rabbit antiserum to human low density lipoprotein (LDL). Approximately 12, 000 clones were screened and five positives were identified. The cDNA inserts were all 1500 - 1600 base pairs in length. The insert from one clone, pB 8, was isolated, labeled by nicktranslation, and found to cross-hybridize strongly with the other four cDNA clones. The pB 8 clone produces a fusion protein of approximately equal to 37. 5 kDa that reacts in electrophoretic <b>transfer</b> <b>blot</b> analysis with rabbit anti-human LDL. This reactivity can be abolished by pretreatment of the antiserum with purified human LDL, p = 1. 025 - 1. 050 g/ml. A pB 8 -derived probe was used to demonstrate that apolipoprotein B (apo B) mRNA is present in HepG 2 cells and liver extracts but not in HeLa cells or extracts from small intestine, heart, aorta, spleen, brain, skeletal muscle, lung, kidney, or ovary. RNA <b>transfer</b> <b>blot</b> analysis revealed that HepG 2 cell apo B mRNA was approximately equal to 22 kilobases in length. These cDNA clones should allow {{the isolation of the}} apo B gene and ultimately the elucidation of the primary structure of this protein...|$|R
50|$|A blot, in {{molecular}} biology and genetics, {{is a method}} of transferring proteins, DNA or RNA, onto a carrier (for example, a nitrocellulose, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or nylon membrane). In many instances, this is done after a gel electrophoresis, transferring the molecules from the gel onto the blotting membrane, and other times adding the samples directly onto the membrane. After the <b>blotting,</b> the <b>transferred</b> proteins, DNA or RNA are then visualized by colorant staining (for example, silver staining of proteins), autoradiographic visualization of radioactive labelled molecules (performed before the blot), or specific labelling of some proteins or nucleic acids. The latter is done with antibodies or hybridization probes that bind only to some molecules of the blot and have an enzyme joined to them. After proper washing, this enzymatic activity (and so, the molecules we search in the blot) is visualized by incubation with proper reactive, rendering either a colored deposit on the blot or a chemiluminiscent reaction which is registered by photographic film.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, two {{biochemical}} approaches {{were used to}} characterize PAGs isolated from Bos indicus fetal cotyledons removed at different gestational ages. The first procedure included acidic and ammonium sulfate precipitations, anion and cation exchange chromatographies and the second included pepstatin-agarose affinity chromatography. A bovine PAG radioimmunoassay was used to monitor the immunoreactivity throughout the isolation procedures. The most immunoreactive fractions issued from cation exchange and affinity chromatographies were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western <b>blotting,</b> before <b>transfer</b> to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane for NH 2 -microsequence determination. Use SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, different isoforms of PAG with apparent molecular masses of 51 to 69 kDa and isoelectric points varying from 4. 4 to 6. 7 were identified in the placentas from different gestational ages. N-terminal microsequencing (10 to 25 aa long) indicates the expression of one single terminal amino acid sequence in the Bos indicus placenta, which is 100 % identical to the bovine PAG- 1.

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} TB drug resistant strains in absence of recent transmission evidence, highlights {{the need for}} an improved control program, coupled with a need to improve detection rate and early diagnosis. IS 6110 -RFLP is a means of genotyping TB clinical samples. In this study IS 6110 -RFLP was used for specification and quick tracking of TB infection source, transmission and reactivation of infection, in Iran. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on 258 TB patients from Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Shiraz and Ahwaz. DNA from positive cultures was extracted and digested by PVUII restriction enzyme. The digested sequences were separated based on the size on agar gel and then southern <b>Blot</b> was <b>transferred</b> on the membrane. IS 6110 probe was marked by HRD and hybridized to the target parts along genome. Results: Sixty-one strains (24 %) showed similar patterns (Recent transmission) and 197 strains (76 %) showed different IS 6110 patterns (Reactivation). Average number of IS 6110 copies was between 10 - 11 bands. Frequency of IS 6110 simila...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the expression of}} the alpha subunit of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs) in fibroblasts of subjects with pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type Ia by <b>transfer</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization and S 1 nuclease analyses. Six subjects with PHP type Ia showed decreased steady-state content of Gs alpha mRNA. S 1 nuclease analysis indicates that both long and short forms of Gs alpha mRNA are decreased, with no apparent change in the ratio of long to short forms in PHP compared with normal individuals. It appears likely that in some cases of PHP type Ia the genetic lesion affects the maintenance of mRNA levels for all forms of the Gs alpha subunit...|$|R
40|$|The {{lymphokine}} interleukin 2 is {{an important}} immune system regulatory glycopolypeptide. It is produced by antigen- or mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes and {{is required for the}} proliferation or clonal expansion of activated T lymphocytes. In this report, it is demonstrated by RNA <b>transfer</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization that the poly(A) + RNA population of the human placenta contains a 0. 85 -kilobase RNA transcript that specifically hybridizes to a human interleukin 2 cDNA probe. By using hybridization histochemistry in situ, it is further shown that interleukin 2 RNA transcripts are localized, primarily, to the syncytial (syncytiotrophoblast) layer of the human placenta. Possible roles for syncytiotrophoblast-produced interleukin 2 are suggested and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factors}} (IGFs) are {{single-chain}} polypeptides important for cell proliferation and growth. IGFs are produced in several tissues, {{suggesting that they}} function in a paracrine or autocrine fashion as well as functioning as endocrine hormones. We studied the hormonal regulation of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA in human steroidogenic tissues. In cultured human ovarian granulosa cells, follicle-stimulating hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, and dibutyryl cAMP increased IGF-II mRNA, but corticotropin [adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) ], chorionic somatomammotropin, growth hormone, prolactin, dexamethasone, estradiol, and progesterone had no effect. In cultured human fetal adrenal cells, ACTH and dibutyryl cAMP increased IGF-II mRNA accumulation, but human chorionic gonadotropin and angiotensin II did not. The same five size species of IGF-II mRNA were detected in <b>transfer</b> <b>blots</b> of RNA from granulosa cells and fetal adrenal cells, {{and all of these}} increased after hormonal stimuli. Dibutyryl cAMP also increased IGF-II mRNA accumulation in cultured human placental cells. Accumulation of mRNA for the cholesterol side-chain-cleavage monooxygenase [P 450 scc [corrected]; cholesterol, reduced-adrenal-ferredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (side-chain-cleaving), EC 1. 14. 15. 6] was regulated in parallel with IGF-II mRNA in all these steroidogenic tissues. IGF-I mRNA was not detected in <b>transfer</b> <b>blots</b> of these RNAs, and the minimal amounts detected in dot blots showed no detectable change after any of the hormonal stimuli studied. The data indicate that the IGF-II gene is expressed in human steroidogenic tissues and is regulated by cAMP. These data suggest that IGF-II may act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to stimulate the adrenal and gonadal growth stimulated by ACTH and gonadotropins, respectively...|$|R
