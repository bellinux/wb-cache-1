40|$|There the {{operating}} mock-up of <b>blower</b> <b>device</b> {{with the heat}} device has been developed, has been realized and has been tested. The analysis of thermodynamic cycle of <b>blower</b> <b>device</b> with the evaporator-condensation heat drive has been performed for the first time. The theoretical and experimental basis for the subsequent work {{for the creation of}} water-pumping devices with the evaporator-condencation heat drive has been created. The study results may be used at the designing of new blower devices with the heat drive in Georgia and in Arab Republic of EgyptAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityObstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) affects {{millions}} of American {{each year and}} {{is the most serious}} of the sleep disorders in terms of morbidity and mortality. Numerous studies have linked OSA to increased risk of hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, motor vehicle accidents, and cognitive and social impairment. OSA is caused by collapse or obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, which leads to frequent nocturnal arousals and sleep fragmentation. Patients usually present with a history of chronic snoring and daytime hypersomnolence. Children with OSA commonly snore but may not have daytime sleepiness. OSA can lead to poor growth and behavioral problems in children. Previous studies on adults have shown that daytime hypersomnolence, obesity, increased neck circumference, male gender, and hypertension are strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea. In the present study, 20 clinical indicators taken from a questionnaire completed by 131 patients referred for OSA, were analyzed and correlated to the apnea-hypopnea index, or degree of OSA. Neck circumference, male gender, hypertension, and daytime hypersomnolence were found to have statistically significant correlations to OSA, thus substantiating prior research. Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is based on overnight polysomnography, which measures sleep staging, the number of obstructive respiratory events per hour, and other physiological parameters. The treatment of choice for adults is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a mask and <b>blower</b> <b>device</b> that is worn during sleep and acts as a pneumatic splint. Though research has shown CPAP to be effective and safe, patient compliance remains an issue. Behavioral changes, particularly lateral positioning during sleep, weight loss, and avoidance of alcohol and sedatives are beneficial. Limited success has been achieved with pharyngeal surgery, medications, and dental appliances. In children, adenotonsillectomy is usually effective. Recommendations for the practitioner include particular awareness of these clinical indicators when making patient assessments, as well as patient education and supportive follow up in order to successfully treat patients suffering from this serious sleep disorder...|$|E
5000|$|The Coast Guard {{investigation}} {{revealed a}} lack of proper training by the crew or contractors in venting and cleaning benzene, which can explode if residual fumes {{come in contact with}} an electrical charge; such a charge may have come from a [...] "red devil" [...] <b>blower,</b> a <b>device</b> used to ventilate spaces.

50|$|The burner in the vertical, {{cylindrical}} furnace as above, {{is located}} in the floor and fires upward. Some furnaces have side fired burners, such as in train locomotives. The burner tile is made of high temperature refractory and is where the flame is contained. Air registers located below the burner and at the outlet of the air <b>blower</b> are <b>devices</b> with movable flaps or vanes that control the shape and pattern of the flame, whether it spreads out or even swirls around. Flames should not spread out too much, as this will cause flame impingement. Air registers can be classified as primary, secondary and if applicable, tertiary, depending on when their air is introduced.|$|R

40|$|Fans can {{be thought}} of as low {{pressure}} air pumps that utilize power from a motor to output a volumetric flow of air at a given pressure. A propeller converts torque from the motor to increase static pressure across the fan rotor and to increase the kinetic energy of the air particles. The motors are typically permanent split capacitor AC induction motors or brushless DC motors. We shall now look at this system in more detail. Types of Fans and <b>Blowers</b> Air moving <b>devices</b> are generally described as being either a type of fan (Fig. 1 a) or a centrifugal blower (Fig. 1 b). The main difference between fans and blowers is in their flow and pressure characteristics. Fans deliver air in an overall direction that is parallel to the fan blade axis and can be designed to deliver a high flow rate, but tend to work against low pressure. Blowers tend to deliver air in a direction that is perpendicular to the blower axis at a relatively low flow rate, but against high pressure. There are several types of fans, some of the most common being propeller, tube axial and vane axial styles. Propeller fans are the simplest type of fan, consisting of only a motor and propeller. One problem with propeller fans is that tip vortices are produced by the pressure differential across the airfoil section. A tube axial fan (the most common type in electronic cooling systems) is similar to a propeller fan, but also has a venturi around the propeller to reduce the vortices. The vane axial fan has vanes that trai...|$|R
