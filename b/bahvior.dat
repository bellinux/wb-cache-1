40|$|We {{proposed}} {{the use of}} a Toda-Rayleigh ring as a central pattern generator (CPG) for controlling hexapodal robots. We show that the ring composed of six Toda-Rayleigh units coupled to the limb actuators reproduces the most common hexapodal gaits. We provide an electrical circuit implementation of the CPG and test our theoretical results obtaining fixed gaits. Then we propose a method of incorporation of the actuator (motor) dynamics in the CPG. With this approach we close the loop CPG - environment - CPG, thus obtaining a decentralized model for the leg control that does not require higher level intervention to the CPG during locomotion in a nonhomogeneous environments. The gaits generated by the novel CPG are not fixed, but adapt to the current robot <b>bahvior.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Using first-principles calculations, the {{electronic}} and magnetic properties of orthorhombic BaFeO_ 3 (BFO) are investigated with local spin density approximation (LSDA). The calculations reveal {{that at the}} optimized lattice volume BFO has a lower energy in ferromagnetic state as compared with antiferromagnetic state. At the equilibrium volume, BFO shows metallic behavior, however, under a large tensile strain (∼ 25 %), BFO shows half-metallic behavior consistent with the integer magnetic moment of 4. 0 μ_B/fu mainly caused by the t_ 2 g and e_g electrons of Fe. Including a Hubbard-like contribution U (LSDA+U) on Fe d states induced half-metallic <b>bahvior</b> without external strain, which indicates that U {{can be used to}} tune {{the electronic}} structure of BFO. The magnetic moments remained robust against ∼ 10 % compressive and tensile strain. At large compressive (tensile) strain, the half-metallicity of BFO is mainly destroyed by the Fe-d (O-p) electrons in agreement with the non-integer value of the magnetic moments of BFO.

40|$|Fish eating {{behavior}} {{is the result}} of the interaction of several senses in fish depend on the habitat and the effect produced by the food. Bait as food is one form of the stimulus in the form of physical / chemical that can provide a response to fish of certain fish for fishing. This study describes the eating <b>bahvior</b> or Tiger kerapu Fish (Epinephelus fuscogutattus) by using natural bait during the day and evening. Parameters that observed are patterns of eating bahavior and eating response time of Kerapu Fish. The research method used is descriptive and experiment on laboratory scale. The obseravtion of bahavior responses by using a light condition pond and the dark condition pond. Bait that used was a natural bait, including shrimp, fish and sea urchins. Stage of eating behavior observations including arousal, searching and findingphase. The behavior of Kerapu fish to bait in bright condition is not different to arousal phase and finding phase. The behavior of Kerapu fish in dark condition to natural bait (sea urchin gonand, shrimp and fish) is not different to arousal phase, seraching phase and finding phase.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was based on}} observable fact about price discriminatory behavior towards people from different ethnic backgrounds among market retailers in two markets in Bandar Lampung City. The objective of this {{research was}} to analyze discriminative behavior and multiculturalism among market retaliers in two markets in Telukbetung Selatan, Bandar Lampung City. Data were collected using mainly depth- interviews towards retailers in two traditional markets in Bandar Lampung City which were Pasar Gudang Lelang and Pasar Cimeng. Research results show: (1) most market ratailers treated non-Tionghoanese buyers as their own group (wonge dhewe). This indicates the presence of stronger sense of belonging towards people with similar ethnic backgrounds than towards people with different ethnic backgrounds aming market retaliers; (2) buyers from Tionghoanese ethnic background were treated as others both from ethnic and class factors by the market retaliers; (3) different price structure practice was used as an instrument of distinguising ethnic sameness and ethnic differences by the market retailers with the buyers, and this indicate discriminative behavior; (4) this discriminative <b>bahvior</b> indicate the lack of multicultural awareness among market retailers in two traditional market in Bandar Lampung City. (5) discriminative behavior tends to appear stronger among ethnic group interact with large Chinese ethnic group; whilst low discriminative behavior was shown by ethnic groups interact with small Tionghoanese ethnic group...|$|E
40|$|This legal {{research}} entitled Review on the Omplementation of Dead Punishment in Indonesia {{from the}} Human Rights Perspective. By this problem background Indonesia {{state is a}} legal state of which protect and confess {{on the existence of}} human rights however in fact there is still the laws of which threat the crime bye dead punishment. Based on the problem background, thus the aouthor can formulate a problem, i. e. whether the implementation of dead punishment in Indonesia had been appropriate to the principle of human rights. Type of this legal writing used normative legal research. The data sources used were secondary data as main data comprising of primary legal material, secondary legal material, and tertiary legal material. The method of data collection used was literary study towards the regulation of which is related to this legal research/writing. Based on the result of this research and analysis conducted by outhor concerning on dead punishment in Indonesia from Human Right Perspective, the outhor concludes that the dead punishment against to Human Rights in particularly right to live of which is protected by the Constitution of 1945 Article 28 A and Article 28 I paragraph (1) and the Laws Number 39 of 1999 on Human Right. Dead Punishment is not appropriate as well to the intention of penalization in Indonesia, i. e. to improve the <b>bahvior</b> of the accused instead of reminding in order not to redo his action. The practice of dead punishment implementation on the consequence for resulting curative effect to the perpetrator, in fact brings no advantage. Thus it is better in order the dead punishment in Indonesia as soon as possible to be aliminated from the field of positive law in Indonesia...|$|E

In this experiment, a meter-wide stainless steel belt travels horizontally in a loop around two rollers with vertically oriented axes, which are separated by 7. 5 meters. This belt device is mounted inside a large water tank with the water level set just below the top edge of the belt. The belt, rollers, and supporting frame are contained within a sheet metal box to keep the device dry except for one 6 -meter-long straight test section between rollers. The belt is launched from rest with an acceleration of up to 3 -g in order to quickly reach steady state velocity. This creates a temporally evolving boundary layer analogous to the spatially evolving boundary layer created along a flat-sided ship moving at the same velocity, with a length equivalent to the length of belt that has passed the measurement region since the belt motion began. Surface profile measurements in planes normal to the belt surface are conducted using cinematic Laser Induced Fluorescence and quantitative surface profiles are extracted at each instant in time. Using these measurements, free surface fluctuations are examined and the propagation behavior of these free surface ripples is studied. It is found that free surface fluctuations are generated in a region close to the belt surface, where sub-surface velocity {{fluctuations in}}fluence the behavior of these free surface features. These rapidly-changing surface features close to the belt appear to lead to the generation of freely-propagating waves far from the belt, outside the influence of the boundary layer. Sub-surface PIV measurements are performed in order to study the modification of the boundary layer flow field due to the effects of the water free surface. Cinematic planar PIV measurements are performed in horizontal planes parallel to the free surface by imaging the flow from underneath the tank, providing streamwise and wall-normal velocity fields. Additional planar PIV experiments are performed in vertical planes parallel to the belt surface in order to study the <b>bahvior</b> of streamwise and vertical velocity fields. It is found that the boundary layer grows rapidly near the free surface, leading to an overall thicker boundary layer close to the surface. This rapid boundary layer growth appears to be linked to a process of free surface bursting, the sudden onset of free surface fluctuations. Cinematic white light movies are recorded from beneath the water surface in order to determine the onset location of air entrainment. In addition, qualitative observations of these processes are made in order to determine the mechanisms leading to air entrainment present in this flow...|$|E
