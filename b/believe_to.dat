As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.|$|E

Bioinformatics suggest that btmB, is an O-methyltransferase, {{while the other}} three, btmC, G and K, are radical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) methyltransferases. The radical SAM methyltransferases are <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> β-methylate amino acid residues within the precursor peptide. btmC is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> methylate phenylalanine, btmG is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> methylate both valines, and btmK is <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> methylate proline based on gene deletion studies.|$|R

5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} they <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> be {{pristine}} clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption {{lines in the}} spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed {{in the first few}} minutes after the Big Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|In early 2009, McCann {{received}} a brief {{to create a}} new campaign for the latest entrant into the Halo series, a first-person shooter called Halo 3: ODST. It would be the first game in the franchise not to feature the series' protagonist, the Master Chief. McCann returned with a pitch for a campaign in the same vein as Believe, aiming to humanize the soldiers featured in the Halo universe. The project was greenlit, and McCann brought back several collaborators from <b>Believe</b> <b>to</b> handle this new campaign, now given the working title of The Life.|$|E

Her home is searched, and {{it is found that}} she had uncovered Yaponchik's identity and attempted to appease him by sending him several icons.

5|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf {{believed}} Carnivàles religious aspects {{stemmed from}} the epic {{of good and evil}} as a major fabric of the 1930s, while executive producer Ronald D. Moore regarded religion as a way to express the struggle of good versus evil, faith, and the nature of humanity. Neither the audience nor the actors were given advice on how to interpret the show's biblical imagery. Clancy Brown, the actor who portrayed Brother Justin, did not know whether his character was the Creature of Light or Darkness during the first season. He however thought that the visions made Brother Justin <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> be on a righteous mission of God until late in the first season. Compared to Brother Justin, Brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Vijithapura fortress is uncertain. A village with the same name near the ancient Kalawewa reservoir {{may have been the}} place where the battle took place.

5|$|The {{unresolved}} larger narrative arc encourages {{speculation about}} future story events. According to Martin, {{much of the}} key to Ice and Fire future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful {{not to make the}} story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what the readers <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> be true may not necessarily be true.|$|E

Suddenly, the Shadow Man is destroyed by the magnetite being mined from the quarry.|$|E
5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E

Baltar signs the document. Meanwhile, Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) learns from Cavil (Dean Stockwell) that he only released her husband Saul (Michael Hogan) because the Cylons know he is leading the resistance. He informs Ellen that unless she tells the Cylons where the resistance leaders will be meeting next, he will imprison Saul once more. Reluctantly, Ellen discovers where the resistance plans to meet with members from the colonial fleet.|$|E
