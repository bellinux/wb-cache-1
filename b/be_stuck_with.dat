25|$|While the {{compromise}} {{was a success}} for the residents of Wheatley Hills, according to Robert Caro in The Power Broker, the $175,000 was a smokescreen {{for the fact that}} the land purchasing would cost $2.25million (1929USD) and rather than the locals, the taxpayers would <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> the majority (over 90%) of the bill from the acquisition. The $175,000 also was claimed by Moses to have been spending for the entire cost of the detour, rather than the land acquisition. Caro goes on to explain that the accommodations made for the citizens of Wheatley Hills denied Long Islanders some of the parks on the North Shore that had been proposed by Moses, pardoning Caumsett State Park. Caro also explained that along with the $10,000 bribe that Moses had accepted, the illegal purchases of the Taylor Estate would turn him into a beating stick for the politicians of New York to get him to stop fighting.|$|E
25|$|Groove recordings, first {{designed}} in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining {{the availability of the}} format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.|$|E

And obviously that's [...] Once he gets airborne, then what? So {{we had to have}} some goal for him to achieve that he had not yet gotten." [...] As a result, they added the plot of going to South America. The location was chosen due to both Docter's love of tropical locations, but also in wanting a location that Carl could <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> a kid due to the inability to leave him with an authority such as a police officer or social worker. They implemented a child character as a way to help Carl stop being [...] "stuck in his ways".|$|E

Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) says she knows Monica's (Courteney Cox) story, but Phoebe interrupts with a story about the time Joey (Matt LeBlanc) had a turkey stuck on his head. Monica tells of Thanksgiving 1987. Monica and Rachel are eighteen years old and seniors in high school, and an overweight Monica spends time comforting Rachel, after Chip ended their relationship. When Ross learns of Rachel's breakup, he asks Chandler to stay overnight in the hope of getting a date, but Chandler refuses, claiming that he doesn't want to <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> [...] "your fat sister" [...] Monica.

500|$|Rick Kogan, {{television}} critic {{with the}} Chicago Tribune, called the show [...] "wholly original" [...] and {{an example of}} how good television entertainment can be. He praised the ensemble cast and interesting characters, and said the show would be renewed [...] "if there's any justice in TV". Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News praised NBC for giving Homicide a second chance, comparing it to the days when NBC stuck with the comedy series Cheers even though it ranked last in the ratings during its first season. Richmond said of Homicide: [...] "This {{is also one of the}} final opportunities to see a television network stick with a struggling show for no better reason than it deserves to <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>with.</b> In the bottom line-driven 1990s, that's become as rare as quality itself. [...] " [...] Steven Cole Smith with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said of the evaluation period during Homicides second season: [...] "If you don't watch it, you may lose your right to complain that there's never anything good on TV." [...] He called it [...] "a gritty, atmospheric police series" [...] and complimented it for showing not only gratuitous violence but the consequences of it.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to praise for Iridions graphics, its actual gameplay was generally panned. IGN's Craig Harris wrote that [...] "Shin'en's shooter for the Game Boy Advance will impress {{with all its}} effects, but that's about it." [...] He noted that the player is limited to shooting and dodging, making gameplay repetitive. Harris and Concepcion complained that on a small screen distances are hard to judge; the player's ship is hit by bullets {{that appear to be}} in the distance. Bub and Game Informers Jay Fitzloff criticized the craft placement, as the player's view was often obscured by their own ship. Lopez also gave Iridion low marks, warning that [...] "after the initial 'wow' wears off, you'll <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> an empty experience." [...] Edge observed that Iridion is [...] "a sweet number that will entertain, if only for a week or so". Allgame's Skyler Miller said Iridion 3D {{was nothing more than a}} technology demo and awarded it two out of five stars. A more positive review came from GamePro, whose reviewer summed up his experience by writing that [...] "if you're looking for some classic shooter action on your new GBA, Iridion 3D will fit the bill nicely without blowing you away." ...|$|E

2500|$|Demographer Bernard Salt criticised the {{decision}} {{to focus on the}} eastern end of the project and said Melbourne's most pressing traffic issue was the second river crossing into the city from the west. He said West Gate Freeway traffic was growing by 2.1 percent a year, compared with 1.8 percent on the Eastern Freeway. Salt said Melbourne was rebalancing to the west, with Wyndham and Melton [...] "the fastest-growing development front anywhere in Australia at the moment, maybe 20,000 people a year". Anton Mayer, chief executive of LeadWest, an organisation that promotes economic development in the western suburbs, said the government's decision meant western suburbs residents and road users would <b>be</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> just one freeway into the city—the West Gate Freeway—for most of the next decade. He said residents in Footscray and Yarraville would have to endure heavy truck traffic on local roads for years until the western section of East West Link was built. G21 chairman Ed Coppe commended {{the decision}} to commit to the project, but said congestion on the West Gate Bridge and in the western suburbs had become a major and growing hindrance to commuter and business traffic between Geelong and Melbourne. He said G21 would maintain pressure on the government to urgently progress the western end of the link.|$|E
