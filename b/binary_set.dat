D., Dept. of Algebra Abstract: <b>Binary</b> equality <b>set</b> of two morphisms g, h : ⌃⇤ ! A⇤ {{is a set}} of all words w over two-letter alphabet ⌃ satisfying g(w) = h(w). Elements of this <b>set</b> are called <b>binary</b> equality words. One of the important results of research on <b>binary</b> equality <b>sets</b> is the proof of the fact that each <b>binary</b> equality <b>set</b> is generated by at most two words provided that both morphisms g and h are non-periodic. Moreover, if a <b>binary</b> equality <b>set</b> is generated by exactly two words, then the structure of both generators, and therefore of the whole set, is uniquely given. This work presents the results of our research on the structure of <b>binary</b> equality <b>sets</b> with a single generator. Importantly, these generators can be decomposed into simpler structures. Generators which can not be further decomposed are called simple equality words. First part of the presented work describes the structure of simple equality words and introduces their detailed classification. The main result of the first part is a precise characterisation of su ciently large simple equality words. In the second part, the work describes the iterative process which transforms a general generator of a binary [...] ...|$|R

Her “Alternative Model of Gender,” is a proposition that allows {{for the inclusion of}} intersexual individuals into the traditional gender labeling system. Anne Fausto-Sterling proposes that a body does not necessarily have to fit into the orthodox gender <b>binary</b> <b>set</b> by a society, but rather can be categorized under the possibility of male, female, merm, ferm, and herm, which are labels given to individuals born with a variation in sex characteristics. Fausto-Sterling’s “Of Gender and Genitals” discuses the fate of the individuals born with “ambiguous” genitalia and the need to surgically correct the deviations these individuals propel into a male-female society. She explores the need for allowing the body to be labeled as is, rather than configuring it into the expectations of society, as the traditional binary gender labeling calls for. The Alternative Model allows for this type of gender labeling.|$|E

The ambilateral set is a set of trees whose elements cannot be obtained from each other via an arbitrary number of reflections with respect to vertical axes passing through any of the nodes on the tree. For the unlabeled set we give an alternate derivation to the existing exact solution. Extending this technique for the ambilateral set, which is described by an infinite series of non-linear functional equations, we are able to give a double-exponentially converging approximant to the generating functions in a neighborhood of their convergence circle, and derive an explicit asymptotic form for the number of such trees.

In particular, we propose a new majorization loss function that we call the coherence function, and then devise a new multicategory margin-based boosting algorithm based on the coherence function. Analogous to deterministic annealing, the coherence function is characterized by a temperature factor. It is closely related to the multinomial log-likelihood function and its limit at zero temperature corresponds to a multicategory hinge loss function. ...|$|R
