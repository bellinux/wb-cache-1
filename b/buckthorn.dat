5|$|The {{golden jackal}} {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of <b>Buckthorn</b> (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden rain tree Cassia fistula.|$|E
25|$|In northwestern China, sea <b>buckthorn</b> shrubs {{have been}} {{planted on the}} bottoms of dry riverbeds to {{increase}} water retention of the soil, thus decreasing sediment loss. Because of increased moisture conservation of the soil and nitrogen-fixing capabilities of sea <b>buckthorn,</b> vegetation levels have increased in areas where sea <b>buckthorn</b> have been planted. Sea <b>buckthorn</b> was once distributed free of charge to Canadian prairie farmers by PFRA {{to be used in}} shelterbelts.|$|E

25|$|Sea <b>buckthorn</b> berries are edible and nutritious, though astringent, sour and oily, {{unpleasant}} to eat raw, unless 'bletted' (frosted {{to reduce}} the astringency) and/or mixed as a drink with sweeter substances such as apple or grape juice. Additionally, malolactic fermentation of sea <b>buckthorn</b> juice reduces sourness, thus in general enhances sensory properties. The mechanism behind this change is transformation of malic acid into lactic acid in microbial metabolism.|$|E
25|$|For {{its troops}} confronting {{extremely}} low temperatures (see Siachen), India's Defence Research Development Organization established {{a factory in}} Leh to manufacture a multivitamin herbal beverage based on sea <b>buckthorn</b> juice.|$|E

50|$|The biomes are {{diverse in}} these Mediterranean climate zones: Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub. Hinterlands are {{particularly}} distinctive {{on account of}} extensive sclerophyll shrublands known as maquis, or garrigues.The dominant species are Quercus coccifera (in drier areas) and Quercus ilex. These trees form monospecific communities or communities integrated with Pinus, Mediterranean <b>buckthorns,</b> Myrtus, Chamaerops humilis, junipers, Pistacia, Rosmarinus, Thymus, etc.|$|R
50|$|Rhamnus is a genus {{of about}} 110 {{accepted}} species of shrubs or small trees, {{commonly known as}} <b>buckthorns</b> in the family Rhamnaceae. Its species range from 1 to 10 meters tall (rarely to 15 m) and are native mainly in east Asia and North America, but found throughout the temperate and subtropical Northern Hemisphere, and also more locally in the subtropical Southern Hemisphere in parts of Africa and South America.|$|R
50|$|Both {{deciduous}} and evergreen species occur. The {{leaves are}} simple, 3 to 15 centimeters long, and arranged alternately or in opposite pairs, or almost paired (subopposite). One distinctive character of many <b>buckthorns</b> {{is the way}} the veination curves upward towards the tip of the leaf. The plant bears fruits which are black or red berry-like drupe. The name is due to the woody spine on the end of each twig in many species.|$|R
25|$|The {{seed and}} pulp oils have {{nutritional}} properties that vary under different processing methods. Sea <b>buckthorn</b> oils {{are used as}} a source for ingredients in several commercially available cosmetic products and nutritional supplements.|$|E
25|$|In ancient times, {{leaves and}} young {{branches}} from sea <b>buckthorn</b> were supposedly fed as a remedy to horses to support weight gain and {{appearance of the}} coat, thus leading to {{the name of the}} genus, Hippophae derived from hippo (horse), and phaos (shining).|$|E
25|$|Synthetic dyes {{are often}} derived from 9,10-anthraquinone, such as alizarin. Important {{derivatives}} are 1-nitroanthraquinone, anthraquinone-1-sulfonic acid, and the dinitroanthraquinone. Natural pigments that are derivatives of anthraquinone are found, inter alia, in aloe latex, senna, rhubarb, and cascara <b>buckthorn,</b> fungi, lichens, and some insects.|$|E
50|$|Arctic wild berries are distinctively {{featured}} in Finnish cuisine with their strong flavor and high nutrient content. Traditionally, they were eaten fresh {{in summer and}} dried at other times of year. It is still quite common to go picking berries straight from the forests. Wild raspberries, bilberries and lingonberries (cowberries) are found in almost every part of Finland, while cloudberries, cranberries, arctic brambles and sea <b>buckthorns</b> grow in more limited areas. The intensely flavored wild strawberry (metsämansikka) is a seasonal delicacy decorating cakes, served alone, with cream, or with ice cream.|$|R
50|$|The Cleopatra {{butterfly}} inhabits {{open woodland}} and scrub. The flight period is from May to August {{in most parts}} of its range, except Spain, where it is double brooded and may fly almost all year. The adult hibernates in evergreen trees and shrubs. The caterpillars feed on the <b>buckthorns</b> Rhamnus alaternus. When the green caterpillars are prepared to pass to the pupal stage, they tie themselves through a silk belt to the host plant, on the underside of a leaf. The green chrysalis became gradually yellow and red, revealing the colors on the wings of the adult close to flutter.|$|R
5000|$|Hurvat Itri (חורבת עתרי) {{also known}} as the Itri Ruins (alt. spellings: 'Ethri; Atari), refers to a {{sprawling}} archaeological site that features the remains of a restored Jewish village which dates back to the Second Temple period. The site sits upon an elevation of 406 m above sea level, wherein are preserved an ancient synagogue, wine presses, a theater, cisterns, ritual baths and stone ossuaries, as well as an underground system of public hiding places. The site is located in modern-day Israel and is situated in the Judean Hills, southeast of Bet Shemesh, within the Adullam-France Park — c. 35 km southwest of Jerusalem, 5 km southeast of the Elah Valley and 8 km northeast of Beth Guvrin. Formerly known in Arabic as Umm Suweid (the mother of the <b>buckthorns),</b> the modern name of the site was only applied in March 2001 by the Israel Official Names Commission, after a team of IAA archaeologists discovered an ostracon bearing the name [...] "Ethri," [...] thought to be a reference to the name of the city [...] "Caphethra" [...] (=Kefar Ethra) described by Josephus. The site stands out among other archaeological sites because of its formidable wall formations, with massive stones, which led Israeli archaeologist, Boaz Zissu, to believe that it may {{have been one of the}} fifty strongholds in Judea destroyed by Hadrian during the second Jewish revolt (the Great Revolt).|$|R
25|$|Hoxsey herbal {{treatments}} {{include a}} topical paste of antimony, zinc and bloodroot, arsenic, sulfur, and talc for external treatments, and a liquid tonic of licorice, red clover, burdock root, Stillingia root, barberry, Cascara, prickly ash bark, <b>buckthorn</b> bark, and potassium iodide for internal consumption.|$|E
25|$|Sea <b>buckthorn</b> is {{a popular}} garden and {{landscaping}} shrub with an aggressive basal shoot system used for barrier hedges and windbreaks, and to stabilize riverbanks and steep slopes. They have value in northern climates for their landscape qualities, as the colorful berry clusters are retained through winter. Branches may be used by florists for designing ornaments.|$|E
25|$|About 27 {{percent of}} Syracuse's land area {{is covered by}} 890,000 trees— a higher {{percentage}} than in Albany, Rochester or Buffalo. This is despite the Labor Day Storm of 1998, a derecho which destroyed approximately 30,000 trees. The sugar maple accounts for 14.2 percent of Syracuse's trees, followed by the Northern white cedar (9.8 percent) and the European <b>buckthorn</b> (6.8 percent).|$|E
40|$|Southern-Hemisphere {{terrestrial}} communities {{from the}} early Paleocene are poorly known, but recent work on Danian plant fossils from the Salamanca Formation in Chubut Province, Argentina are providing critical data on earliest Paleocene floras. The fossils described here come from a site in the Salamanca Formation dating to ca. 1 million years or less after the end-Cretaceous extinction event; {{they are the first}} fossil flowers reported from the Danian of South America, and possible the entire Southern Hemisphere. They are compressions and impressions in flat-laminated light gray shale, and they belong to the family Rhamnaceae (<b>buckthorns).</b> Flowers of Notiantha grandensis gen. et sp. nov. are pentamerous, with distinctly keeled calyx lobes projecting from the hypanthium, clawed and cucullate emarginate petals, antepetalous stamens, and a pentagonal floral disk that fills the hypanthium. Their phylogenetic position was evaluated using a molecular scaffold approach combined with morphological data. Results indicate that the flowers are most like those of extant ziziphoid Rhamnaceae. The associated leaves, assigned to Suessenia grandensis gen. et sp. nov. are simple and ovate, with serrate margins and three acrodromous basal veins. They conform to the distinctive leaves of some extant Rhamnaceae in the ziziphoid and ampelozizyphoid clades. These fossils provide the first unequivocal megafossil evidence of Rhamnaceae in the Southern Hemisphere, demonstrating that Rhamnaceae expanded beyond the tropics by the earliest Paleocene. Given previous reports of rhamnaceous pollen in the late Paleogene and Neogene of Antarctica and southern Australia, this new occurrence increases the possibility of high-latitude dispersal of this family between South America and Australia via Antarctica during the Cenozoic...|$|R
50|$|The park's main {{attraction}} is its pristine, unspoiled beauty; gently rolling limestone hills clad in natural Mediterranean vegetation of underbrush (Sarcopoterium), oak trees (Quercus ssp.), mastic trees (Pistacia lentiscus), carobs (Ceratonia siliqua) and <b>buckthorns</b> (Rhamnus lycioides), including seasonal flowers endemic to the Land of Israel (anemones, cyclamens, almond blossoms and asphodels), all within the purlieu of Jerusalem. The hills are interspersed with low-lying riverine brooks. A {{section of the}} park has been planted with pine forests by early Jewish immigrants who settled in the Lachish region at {{the founding of the}} State. The park is replete with a picnic area, a lookout point and marked trails for hikers and bikers. The main bike trail, known as the Kanim Single Track, is made {{in the form of a}} loop and extends to a full 23-kilometers, traversing the park from west to east, and is suitable for experienced cyclists with a moderate level of technical ability. The other bike trail is known as the Illegal Resident's Trail. Within the confines of the park are four principal archaeological sites of historical importance: Adullam, Hurvat Itri, Ḥurvat Burjin (Burgin ruins) and Ḥurvat Madras (Midras ruins), including two lesser known archaeological sites, Ḥurvat Kanim and Ḥurvat Rebbo, and the Adullam Grove Nature Reserve. Remnants of other ancient settlements are known to dot the hilltop landscape. The park is run jointly by the Jewish National Fund (JNF - KKL), the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) and the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), and has a visitors' center with guided tours run by the Kfar Etzion Field School. The park also caters to limited agricultural needs, such as in viniculture.|$|R
5000|$|Lillering Forest and {{surroundings}} {{has been}} known as a botanically interesting locality for many years with the earliest description dating back to 1877 (Zahrtmann 1877). Some 400 vascular plants have been registered, {{about a third of}} Danish plants. A number of plants primarily exist in south-eastern Denmark, and further south, with the northern boundary being at or around Aarhus and some of these are well represented in Lillering Forest. The most important might be hornbeam which has a significant presence. Others are plants such as dead-nettles, white butterbur, bitter-cress, wall barley, yellow and blue anemone and the endangered multicolored viola. In addition a total of nine species of orchids have been registered although in later years only six has been noted - these are the broad-leaved helleborine, green-flowered helleborine, early-purple orchid, western marsh orchid, early marsh-orchid, eggleaf twayblade and the greater butterfly-orchid. The border zone between Tåstrup Bog and Lillering Forest contains woodland geranium and mountain melick. The area contains several rare species of geometer moths associated with <b>buckthorns</b> that grow at the woodland edge or in Tåstrup Bog. The nearby meadows is home to a rare, small owl that lives on species of mouse-ear chickweed. The meadows in the forest has a number of moths such as the six-spot burnet which are endangered in Denmark. Some 6 species are registered of which 3 in Jutland are found only here and 4 are associated with hackberry at the woodland edge. The stream Bøgebakke Bæk has a large population of the uncommon mayfly siphlonurus aestivalis. == Natura 2000 == The Natura 2000 protected area includes Tåstrup Lake and adjoining wetlands (c. 20 ha.), Tåstrup Bog (c. 25 ha.), Lillering Forest (ca. 50 ha.) and Stjær Forest consisting of the forests Søskov and Stjær Stenskov (c. 20 ha). The four areas are not connected since former agricultural land separates Lillering Forest and Tåstrup Bog to the north and Tåstrup Lake and Stjær Forest to the south.|$|R
