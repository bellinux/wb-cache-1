50|$|Delco Electronics Corporation was the {{automotive}} electronics design and manufacturing subsidiary of General Motors based in Kokomo, Indiana. The name Delco {{came from the}} Dayton Engineering Laboratories Co., founded in Dayton, Ohio, by Charles Kettering and Edward A. Deeds in 1909. Delco was responsible for several innovations in automobile electric systems, including the first reliable <b>battery</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> and the first practical automobile self-starter.|$|E
50|$|Some {{aviation}} engines {{as well as}} {{some early}} luxury cars have had dual-plugged systems with one set of plugs fired by a magneto, and the other set wired to a coil, dynamo, and battery circuit. This was often done to ease engine starting, as larger engines may be too difficult to crank at sufficient speed to operate a magneto, even with an impulse coupling. As the reliability of <b>battery</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> improved, the magneto fell out of favour for general automotive use, but may still be found in sport or racing engines.|$|R

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} system include an engine-driven hydraulic pump, a hydraulic reservoir/accumulator, and filter. The electrical systems involve a 24-volt <b>battery,</b> a high-energy <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> generator, landing and taxi lamps, navigation lighting, and an anti-collision beacon. Pneumatic systems comprise a bleed air compressor, de-icing/de-misting measures, and {{elements of the}} environmental control system.|$|R
50|$|In time, the {{trembler}} coil {{system was}} seen as obsolete and was replaced, first by the ignition magneto and later by Kettering's <b>battery</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> using battery, coil and contact breaker. These systems used a single ignition coil for the engine, supplying the spark to each cylinder in turn. A device called the distributor (previously used with magnetos) was used to switch the high-voltage current to each plug in turn. The high voltage distributor evolved from the timer and it too was a rotary switch driven at camshaft speed. The first high voltage distributors likewise used a wiping-contact, but as the current was at such a high voltage, these gave trouble with arcing and erosion of the contacts leading to a poor connection. It was realised that a jump-spark distributor would work equally well at high voltages and would be less susceptible to problems from erosion.|$|E

50|$|The first {{reliable}} <b>battery</b> operated <b>ignition</b> {{was developed}} by Dayton Engineering Laboratories Co. (Delco) and introduced in the 1910 Cadillac. This ignition {{was developed by}} Charles Kettering and was considered a wonder in its day. Atwater Kent invented his Unisparker <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> about this time in competition with the Delco system. By {{the end of the}} 20th century mechanical ignitions were disappearing from automotive applications in favor of inductive or capacitive electronic ignitions fully controlled engine control units (ECU), rather than directly timed to the engine's crankshaft speed.|$|R
50|$|The Delco <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> {{also known}} as the Kettering <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> is a type of Inductive {{discharge}} <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> invented by Charles F. Kettering. It was first sold commercially on the 1910 Cadillac and was manufactured by Delco. Over time, this system was used extensively by all automobile and truck manufacturers until the development of capacitor discharge <b>ignition</b> (electronic <b>ignition)</b> <b>systems</b> in the 1960s. Delco <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> were also used by a number of early aircraft engines.|$|R

The Kettering <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> is a mechanically-switched version of a flyback boost converter; the transformer is the ignition coil.

Using Multisim software and experimental apparatus, the variation of secondary voltage along with discharge time interval was studied by taking simulation and experimental methods. The results show that dual-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> can enhance the secondary voltage, increase spark duration and accomplish multiple discharge under different discharge time interval compared with single-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> So the dual-coil <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> is conducive to reliable ignition for natural gas engine under different working conditions and it provides a way to optimize the <b>ignition</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Ballast {{was also}} a {{component}} used in early model automobiles engine [...] that lowered the supply voltage to the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> after the engine had been started. Starting the engine requires {{a significant amount of}} electrical current from the battery, resulting in an equally significant voltage drop. To allow the engine to start, the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was done to}} examine the effects of elevated initial tube pressure in the Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE). Measured parameters were the ignition time, deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) run-up distance, DDT times, and Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) velocity. Mixed with air, three fuels, i. e., aviation gasoline, ethylene, and hydrogen, were tested at various initial pressures and equivalence ratios. An aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was employed, along with two plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> to quantify the benefits of each. Measured results show a reduction in the ignition time of roughly 50 % and in the DDT distance of roughly 30 %, for all three fuels at an initial tube pressure of 3 atmospheres. With atmospheric initial tube pressure, the transient plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> yielded the shortest ignition times, followed by the thermal plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> and lastly the aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> At roughly 2 atmospheres of initial pressure the thermal plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> showed no benefit over the aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> C-J wave speeds have shown to increase with elevated initial pressure, and agree with numerical results. In addition to the experimental results, a brief Chemkin analysis was done to model the aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> to estimate <b>ignition</b> times of the mixtures at pressures that were not tested.

50|$|The term also {{referred}} to a (now obsolete) automobile engine component that lowered the supply voltage to the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> after the engine had been started. Because cranking the engine causes a very heavy load on the battery, the system voltage can drop quite low during cranking. To allow the engine to start, the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once cranking is finished, the normal operating voltage would overload the <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
