The v-SNARE vesicles, labeled with lipid and content markers of different color, dock and fuse with a planar t-SNARE <b>bilayer</b> supported on <b>glass.</b> A narrow (< 5 ms duration), intense spike of calcein fluorescence due to content release and dequenching coincides with inner-leaflet lipid mixing within 10 ms. The spike provides more sensitive detection of productive hemifusion events than do lipid labels alone. Consequently, many fast events previously {{thought to be}} prompt, full fusion events are now reclassified as productive hemifusion. Both full fusion and hemifusion occur with a time constant of 5 – 10 ms. At 60 % phosphatidylethanolamine lipid composition, productive and dead-end hemifusion account for 65 % of all fusion events. However, quantitative analysis shows that calcein is released into the space above the bilayer (vesicle bursting), rather than the thin aqueous space between the <b>bilayer</b> and <b>glass.</b> Evidently, at the instant of inner-leaflet mixing, flattening of the vesicle increases the internal pressure beyond the bursting point.

When {{used in conjunction with}} liposomes and supported lipid bilayers, they can recapitulate the biochemical activities occurring at the cytosol/plasma membrane interface of the cell that underlie remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. We use these in vitro systems to elucidate how membranes and proteins collaborate to make the appropriate actin structure at a given time and place. We have recently broadened the types of membrane substrate used, and also optimized protocols for preparation of Xenopus egg extracts for actin assembly assays from membranes. Tuning the lipid composition and curvature appropriately demands an appreciation of the native phospholipid and curvature environments that can form transiently in cells. Supported lipid <b>bilayers</b> on <b>glass</b> coverslips that contain phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PI(4, 5) P- 2) make actin bundles termed filopodia-like structures that contain fascin and have vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) at their growing tips, indicating that these resemble filopodia growing from the plasma membrane. The combination of PI(4, 5) P 2 and phosphatidylinositol 3 -phosphate in curved liposomes or supported <b>bilayers</b> on <b>glass</b> nanospheres uses Snx 9, Cdc 42, N-WASP (neuronal-Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein), and Arp 2 / 3 complex for actin polymerization suggesting that this membrane may mimic the progression from plasma membrane to endosomes. Here we describe how to prepare high-speed supernatant frog egg extracts and phosphoinositide-containing liposomes and supported lipid bilayers that can assemble actin structures.

40|$|The fusion and {{spreading}} of phospholipid <b>bilayers</b> on <b>glass</b> surfaces was investigated {{as a function}} of pH and ionic strength. Membrane fusion to the support was favorable at high ionic strength and low pH for vesicles containing a net negative charge; however, neutral and positively charged vesicles fused under all conditions attempted. This result suggests that van der Waals and electrostatic interactions govern the fusion process. Membrane spreading over a planar surface was favorable at low pH regardless of the net charge on the bilayer, and the process is driven by van der Waals forces. On the other hand membrane propagation is impeded at high pH or on highly curved surfaces. In this case a combination of hydration and bending interactions is primarily responsible for arresting the spreading process. These results provide a framework for understanding many of the factors that influence the effectiveness of scratches on planar supported bilayers as barriers to lateral diffusion and lead to a simple method to heal these scratches...|$|R

Here we report that phospholipid bilayers remain stable on solvent-cleaned ox-PDMS for at least 132 hours after preparation. Absent solvent cleaning, the bilayers were stable for only 36 hours. We characterized the phospholipid bilayers, i) through quantitative comparative analysis of the fluorescence intensity of phospholipid bilayers on ox-PDMS and phospholipid monolayers on native PDMS and, ii) through measurements of the diffusive mobility of the lipids through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The fluorescence intensity of the phospholipid layer remained consistent with that of a bilayer for 132 hours. The evolution of the diffusive mobility of the phospholipids in the bilayer on ox-PDMS over time was similar to lipids in control <b>bilayers</b> prepared on <b>glass</b> surfaces. Solvent cleaning was essential for the long-term stability of the bilayers on ox-PDMS. Without cleaning in acetone and isopropanol, phospholipid bilayers prepared on ox-PDMS surfaces peeled off in large patches within 36 hours. Importantly, we find that phospholipid bilayers supported on solvent-cleaned ox-PDMS were indistinguishable from phospholipid <b>bilayers</b> supported on <b>glass</b> for at least 36 hours after preparation. Our results provide a link between the two common surfaces used to prepare in vitro biomimetic phospholipid membranes-i) glass surfaces used predominantly in fundamental biophysical experiments, for which there is abundant physicochemical information, with ii) ox-PDMS, the dominant material used in practical, applications-oriented systems to build micro-devices, topographically-patterned surfaces, and biosensors where there is a dearth of information...|$|R
40|$|T cell {{receptor}} (TCR) engagement induces clustering and recruitment to the plasma membrane of many signaling molecules, including the protein tyrosine kinase zeta-chain associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP 70) and the adaptor SH 2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP 76). This molecular rearrangement results in {{formation of the}} immunological synapse (IS), a dynamic protein array that modulates T cell activation. The current study investigates the effects of apparent long-range ligand mobility on T cell signaling activity and IS formation. We formed stimulatory lipid <b>bilayers</b> on <b>glass</b> surfaces from binary lipid mixtures with varied composition, and characterized these surfaces with respect to diffusion coefficient and fluid connectivity. Stimulatory ligands coupled to these surfaces with similar density and orientation showed differences {{in their ability to}} activate T cells. On less mobile membranes, central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) formation was delayed and the overall accumulation of CD 3 f at the IS was reduced. Analysis of signaling microcluster (MC) dynamics showed that ZAP 70 MCs exhibited faster track velocity and longer trajectories as a function of increased ligand mobility, whereas movement of SLP 76 MCs was relatively insensitive to this parameter. Actin retrograde flow was observed on all surfaces, but cell spreading and subsequent cytoskeletal contraction were more pronounced on mobile membranes. Finally, increased tyrosine phosphorylation and persistent elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + were observed in cells stimulated on fluid membranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the physicochemical properties of lipid membranes is most important for understanding the structure, dynamics and function of biological membranes. One special feature of lipid membranes is the permeability for small molecules and especially for water. So far, this property has been studied for instance by isotope exchange [1], NMR relaxation [2], theoretical approaches [3] and pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR [4, 5, 6]. The latter technique has benefited from improvements {{in the preparation of}} macroscopically oriented lipid <b>bilayers</b> covering <b>glass</b> plates, which results in samples with an anisotropic diffusion coefficient for water and lipids. This anisotropy can be characterized by application of pulsed field gradients in different directions with respect to the bilayer normal. In this contribution we will examine the permeability of water through model bilayer systems consisting of phospholipids in the Lα phase. First, we will try to reproduce the observations of Filippov and coworkers [5, 6], who determined diffusion coefficients of water parallel to and across oriented lipid bilayers. The application of Tanner’s model for diffusion through permeable parallel barriers [7] then allows the calculation of the bilayer permeability. Furthermore, we will investigate the dependency of the permeability on several experimental parameters, e. g. temperature, degree of hydration and cholesterol content. References [1] M. Jansen, A.

40|$|Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) {{have contributed}} {{invaluable}} {{information about the}} physiochemical properties of cell membranes, but their compositional simplicity often limits the level of knowledge that can be gained about the structure and function of transmembrane proteins in their native environment. Herein, we demonstrate a generic protocol for producing polymer-supported lipid <b>bilayers</b> on <b>glass</b> surfaces that contain essentially all naturally occurring cell-membrane components of a cell line while still retaining transmembrane protein mobility and activity. This was achieved by merging vesicles made from synthetic lipids (PEGylated lipids and POPC lipids) with native cell-membrane vesicles to generate hybrid vesicles which readily rupture into a continuous polymer-supported lipid bilayer. To investigate the properties of these complex hybrid SLBs and particularly the behavior of their integral membrane-proteins, we used total internal reflection fluorescence imaging to study a transmembrane protease, β-secretase 1 (BACE 1), whose ectoplasmic and cytoplasmic domains could both be specifically targeted with fluorescent reporters. By selectively probing the two different orientations of BACE 1 in the resulting hybrid SLBs, {{the role of the}} PEG-cushion on transmembrane protein lateral mobility was investigated. The results reveal the necessity of having the PEGylated lipids present during vesicle adsorption to prevent immobilization of transmembrane proteins with protruding domains. The proteolytic activity of BACE 1 was unadulterated by the sonication process used to merge the synthetic and native membrane vesicles; importantly it was also conserved in the SLB. The presented strategy could thus serve both fundamental studies of membrane biophysics and the production of surface-based bioanalytical sensor platforms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of Saposin C (Sap C) with negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) {{is essential for}} its biological function. In this study, Sap C (initially protonated in a weak acid) was inserted into multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) consisting of either 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -[phospho-L-serine] (negatively charged, POPS) or 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (neutrally charged, POPC). The MLVs were then investigated using solid-state NMR spectroscopy under neutral pH (7. 0) conditions. The 2 H and 31 P solid-state NMR spectroscopic data of Sap C-POPS and Sap C-POPC MLVs (prepared under the same conditions) were compared using the 2 H order parameter profiles of the POPC-d 31 or POPS-d 31 acyl chains {{as well as the}} 31 P chemical shift anisotropy width and 31 P T 1 relaxation times of the phospholipids headgroups. All those solid-state NMR spectroscopic approaches indicate that protonated Sap C disturbs the POPS bilayers and not the POPC lipid bilayers. These observations suggest {{for the first time that}} protonated Sap C inserts into PS bilayers and forms a stable complex with the lipids even after resuspension under neutral buffer conditions. Additionally, 31 P solid-state NMR spectroscopic studies of mechanically oriented phospholipids on glass plates were conducted and perturbation effect of Sap C on both POPS and POPC bilayers was compared. Unlike POPC bilayers, the data indicates that protonated Sap C (initially protonated in a weak acid) was unable to produce well-oriented POPS <b>bilayers</b> on <b>glass</b> plates at neutral pH. Conversely, unprotonated Sap C (initially dissolved in a neutral buffer) did not interact significantly with POPS phospholipids allowing them to produce well-oriented bilayers at neutral pH...|$|R
40|$|Bamboo salt is a {{traditional}} medicine produced from sea salt. It is widely used in Oriental medicine and is an alkalizing agent with reported antiinflammatory, antimicrobial and chemotherapeutic properties. Notwithstanding, linking specific molecular mechanisms with these properties has been challenging to establish in biological systems. In part, this issue {{may be related to}} bamboo salt eliciting nonspecific effects on components found within these systems. Herein, we investigated the effects of bamboo salt solution on supported lipid bilayers as a model system to characterize the interaction between lipid membranes and bamboo salt. The atomic composition of unprocessed and processed bamboo salts was first analyzed by mass spectrometry, and we identified several elements that have not been previously reported in other bamboo salt preparations. The alkalinity of hydrated samples was also measured and determined to be between pH 10 and 11 for bamboo salts. The effect of processed bamboo salt solutions on the fluidic properties of a supported lipid <b>bilayer</b> on <b>glass</b> was next investigated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis. It was demonstrated that, with increasing ionic strength of the bamboo salt solution, the fluidity of a lipid bilayer increased. On the contrary, increasing the ionic strength of near-neutral buffer solutions with sodium chloride salt diminished fluidity. To reconcile these two observations, we identified that solution alkalinity is critical for the effects of bamboo salt on membrane fluidity, as confirmed using three additional commercial bamboo salt preparations. Extended-DLVO model calculations support that the effects of bamboo salt on lipid membranes are due to the alkalinity imparting a stronger hydration force. Collectively, the results of this work demonstrate that processing of bamboo salt strongly affects its atomic composition and that the alkalinity of bamboo salt solutions contributes to its effect on membrane fluidity...|$|R

Such SSV samples can be prepared at any desired size between 0. 3 and 10 microns. The 2 H-NMR measurements provide evidence for a strong dependence of the spectra and the transverse relaxation times on the curvature of the SSVs in a diameter range between 0. 5 and 1. 5 microns.

Specific attention is drawn to deviations in critical load (PR) data from ideal quadratic dependence on coating thickness (d), i. e. PRd 2, especially at low d values. It is postu-lated that these deviations are attributable {{to the existence of}} distributions in flaw size and location, in relation to the bell-shaped tensile stress fields responsible for initiation of the radial cracks at the coating lower surface. A statistics-based expression is derived for the mean values of PR in terms of flaw density and size distribution. Data from model <b>bilayers</b> consisting of <b>glass</b> plates of different thicknesses d bonded to polycar-bonate substrates are used as an illustrative case study. Controlled pre-abrasion flaws are introduced into the lower glass surfaces before joining into the bilayer configuration, to enable a priori characterization of distri-bution parameters by image analysis.

KIGAKI induces the formation of an isotropic phase for POPE/POPG bilayers, but only a slight change in the 31 P NMR CSA line shape for both POPE and POPG bilayers, indicating the synergistic roles of POPE and POPG lipids in the disruption of the membrane structure by KIGAKI. 2 H NMR powder spectra show no reduction of the lipid chain order for both POPG and POPE/POPG bilayers upon peptide incorporation, supporting the evidence that the peptide acts as a surface peptide. 31 P longitudinal relaxation studies confirmed that different dynamic changes occurred upon interaction of the peptide with the three different lipid bilayers, indicating that the strong electrostatic interaction between the cationic peptide KIGAKI and anionic POPG lipids is not the only factor in determining the antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, 31 P and 2 H NMR powder spectra demonstrated a change in membrane characteristics upon mixing of POPE and POPG lipids. The interaction between different lipids, such as POPE and POPG, in the mixed bilayers may provide the molecular basis for the KIGAKI carpet mechanism in the permeation of the membrane...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{study is}} made of {{fracture}} from cyclic loading of WC spheres on the top surfaces of thick (1 mm) brittle layers on polymeric substrates, as representative of repetitive occlusal contact on dental crown structures. The advantage of glass layers is that internal cracks can be followed in situ during the entire cyclic loading process. The glass surfaces are first given a surface-abrasion treatment to control the flaw state, such that the strengths match those of dental porcelains. Cyclic contact tests are carried out at prescribed maximum loads and frequencies, in water. In addition to conventional cone cracks that form outside the contact circle, additional, inner cone cracks form within the contact in the water environment. These inner cones are observed only in cyclic loading in water and are accelerated at higher frequencies, indicating a strong mechanical driving force. They tend to initiate after the outer cones, but subsequently catch up and penetrate much more rapidly and deeply, ultimately intersecting the underlying coating/substrate interface. Comparative tests on glass/polymer <b>bilayers</b> versus monolithic <b>glass,</b> in cyclic versus static loading, in water versus air environ-ment, on abraded versus etched surfaces, and with glass instead of WC indenters, confirm {{the existence of a}} dominant mechanical element in the inner-cone crack evolution. It is suggested that the source of the mechanical driving force is hydraulic pressure from intrusion and entrapment of liquid in surface fissures at the closing contact interface. This new type of cone cracking may limit dental crown veneer lifetimes under occlusal fatigue conditions, especially in thicker layers, where competing modes—such as undersurface radial cracks—are sup...|$|R
40|$|Electrophysiology is {{a central}} tool for {{measuring}} how different driving forces (e. g., ligand concentration, transmembrane voltage, or lateral tension) cause a channel protein to gate. Upon formation of the high resistance seal between a lipid <b>bilayer</b> and a <b>glass</b> pipette, the so-called “giga-seal”, channel activity can be recorded electrically. In this article, we explore the implications of giga-seal formation on the mechanical state of a lipid bilayer patch. We use a mechanical model for the free energy of bilayer geometry {{in the presence of}} glass-bilayer adhesion to draw three potentially important conclusions. First, we use our adhesion model to derive an explicit relationship between applied pressure and patch shape that is consistent with the Laplace-Young Law, giving an alternative method of calculating patch tension under pressure. With knowledge of the adhesion constant, which we find to be in the range 0. 4 – 4 mN/m, and the pipette size, one can precisely calculate the patch tension as a function of pressure, without the difficultly of obtaining an optical measurement of the bilayer radius of curvature. Second, we use data from previous electrophysiological experiments to show that over a wide range of lipids, the resting tension on a electrophysiological patch is highly variable and can be 10 – 100 times higher than estimates of the tension in a typical cell membrane. This suggests that electrophysiological experiments may be systematically altering channel-gating characteristics and querying the channels under conditions that {{are not the same as}} their physiological counterparts. Third, we show that reversible adhesion leads to a predictable change in the population response of gating channels in a bilayer patch. ...|$|R
5000|$|The term “black” bilayer {{refers to}} the fact that they are dark in {{reflected}} light because the thickness of the membrane is only a few nanometers, so light reflecting off the back face destructively interferes with light reflecting off the front face. Indeed, this was one of the first clues that this technique produced a membrane of molecular-scale thickness. Black lipid membranes are also well suited to electrical characterization because the two chambers separated by the bilayer are both accessible, allowing simple placement of large electrodes. For this reason, electrical characterization is one of the most important methods used in conjunction with painted lipid bilayers. Simple measurements indicate when a bilayer forms and when it breaks, as an intact bilayer has a large resistance (>GΩ) and a large capacitance (~2 µF/cm2). More advanced electrical characterization has been particularly important in the study of voltage gated ion channels. Membrane proteins such as ion channels typically cannot be incorporated directly into the painted bilayer during formation because immersion in an organic solvent would denature the protein. Instead, the protein is solubilized with a detergent and added to the aqueous solution after the bilayer is formed. The detergent coating allows these proteins to spontaneously insert into the bilayer over a period of minutes. Additionally, initial experiments have been performed which combine electrophysiological and structural investigations of black lipid membranes. In another variation of the BLM technique, termed the <b>bilayer</b> punch, a <b>glass</b> pipet (inner diameter ~10-40 µm) is used as the electrode on one side of the bilayer in order to isolate a small patch of membrane. [...] This modification of the patch clamp technique enables low noise recording, even at high potentials (up to 600 mV), at the expense of additional preparation time.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{flow cell}} has been {{developed}} to study the mechanisms of steady state, cocurrent, multiphase flow through porous media on a microscopic level. It consists of a rectangular capillary tube packed with a <b>bilayer</b> of monodisperse <b>glass</b> beads 109 microns in diameter. The pore sizes in the model are {{of the order of}} magnitude of those in actual petroleum reservoirs. An enhanced video microscopy and digital image processing system was used to record and analyze the flow data. Several pre-equilibrated fluid systems covering a wide range of interfacial tensions were studied using a syringe pump capable of producing superficial velocities of 0. 1 to 2, 000 ft/day. With this combination the capillary number Ca was studied from 10 - 7 to 1. 0. Displacement experiments were performed to investigate the qualitative behavior of flow in the novel micromodel. Nonwetting oleic phase was trapped at low Ca (< 10 - 3), and improved recovery was observed as Ca was increased. Complete recovery of nonwetting phase was obtained with both liquid crystalline and middle phase microemulsion/excess oil systems at high Ca = 0. 01. For the steady cocurrent flow experiments a volumetric injection ratio of 1 : 1 was primarily used, but experiments with various ratios up to 10 : 1 were performed, with no basic change in observed flow mechanism. At low capillary numbers, the expected stable continuous tortuous paths are observed. At a capillary number of about 0. 001 these continuous paths break down and the nonwetting phase starts flowing freely in large regions 10 - 20 pore diameters in length in the direction of flow. A steady state equilibrium mobile ganglion size is observed at a given capillary number. As the capillary number is increased, these regions become smaller until finally single pore size ganglia are flowing freely at a Ca of about 0. 01. If the capillary number is increased above this value, the size of the nonwetting phase ganglia continues to decrease, even falling below the pore throat diameter. Eventually the small drops stretch out into a filament type flow where viscous forces predominate and several filaments pass through a pore throat simultaneously...|$|R

Isotopically labeled samples of Vpu 2 – 30 +, a 36 -residue polypeptide containing residues 2 – 30 from the N-terminus of Vpu, were incorporated into large (q= 3. 2 or 3. 0) phospholipid bicelles composed of long-chain ether-linked lipids (14 -O-PC or 16 -O-PC) and short-chain lipids (6 -O-PC). The protein-containing bicelles are aligned in the static magnetic field of the NMR spectrometer.

The NMR experiments were performed at a 1 H resonance frequency of 900 MHz, and this resulted in improved data compared to lower-resonance frequencies. Analysis of the polarity-index slant-angle wheels and dipolar waves demonstrates the presence of a transmembrane α-helix spanning residues 8 – 25 in both 14 -O-PC and 16 -O-PC bicelles, which is consistent with results obtained previously in micelles by solution NMR and mechanically aligned lipid bilayers by solid-state NMR. The three-dimensional backbone structures were obtained by structural fitting to the orientation-dependent 15 N chemical shift and 1 H- 15 N dipolar coupling frequencies.

40|$|In recent years, silica {{films have}} emerged as a novel class of {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) materials. Several groups succeeded in epitaxial growth of ultrathin SiO 2 layers using different growth methods and various substrates. The structures consist of tetrahedral [SiO 4] building blocks in two mirror symmetrical planes, connected via oxygen bridges. This arrangement is called a silica bilayer {{as it is the}} thinnest 2 D arrangement with the stoichiometry SiO 2 known today. With all bonds saturated within the nano-sheet, the interaction with the substrate is based on van der Waals forces. Complex ring networks are observed, including hexagonal honeycomb lattices, point defects and domain boundaries, as well as amorphous domains. The network structures are highly tuneable through variation of the substrate, deposition parameters, cooling procedure, introducing dopants or intercalating small species. The amorphous networks and structural defects were resolved with atomic resolution microscopy and modeled with density functional theory and molecular dynamics. Such data contribute {{to our understanding of the}} formation and characteristic motifs of glassy systems. Growth studies and doping with other chemical elements reveal ways to tune ring sizes and defects as well as chemical reactivities. The pristine films have been utilized as molecular sieves and for confining molecules in nanocatalysis. Post growth hydroxylation can be used to tweak the reactivity as well. The electronic properties of silica bilayers are favourable for using silica as insulators in 2 D material stacks. Due to the fully saturated atomic structure, the bilayer interacts weakly with the substrate and can be described as quasi-freestanding. Recently, a mm-scale film transfer under structure retention has been demonstrated. The chemical and mechanical stability of silica bilayers is very promising for technological applications in 2 D heterostacks. Due to the impact of this <b>bilayer</b> system for <b>glass</b> science, catalysis and the field of 2 D materials, a large number of theoretical and experimental studies on silica bilayers have been reported in the last years.

40|$|Microfluorescence {{methods were}} used to examine monolayer-monolayer and bilayer-substrate {{coupling}} in <b>bilayers</b> deposited on <b>glass</b> substrates. In the first part, lateral diffusion of lipid probes in individual lipid layers {{was measured by the}} fluorescence recovery after photobleach technique. The aim was to evaluate viscous molecular friction (i) between monolayers that form a single bilayer and (ii) between a bilayer and an adjacent substrate based on a recent phenomenological theory for particle mobility in substrate-coupled membranes (Evans and Sackmann, J. Fluid Mech. 194 (1988) 553 [1]). To obtain coefficients for friction between monolayers, a bilayer was formed with the first (proximal) monolayer fixed to the glass substrate by Si-O-bonds (using silanes) or by ion bridges (using cadmium arachidate); then, probe diffusion was measured in the second (distal) monolayer formed by phospholipids. The coefficient for viscous friction (defined by b s-interfacial shear stress/interfacial « slip » velocity) between monolayers with fluid chains (DMPC or DOPC on silane) was calculated to be in the range bs = 106 - 107 dyn-sec/cm 3; between a fluid and a solid monolayer (DOPC on Cd-arachidate), the frictional coefficient was much larger, i. e. bs = 1 - 5 × 108 dyn-sec/cm 3. For two opposing monolayers with liquid chains, it was found that bs increased with the degree of interdigitation between the hydrocarbon chains. To investigate the effect of lubrication by a water film between a fluid bilayer and the substrate, the substrate was first Argon sputtered which acted to separate the proximal monolayer from the substrate by a thin lubricating water film (thickness in nm region). The frictional coefficient between the bilayer and the substrate was measured to be in the range bs = 2 x 103 - 3 × 105 dyn-sec/cm 3 which implied that the film thickness was from 1 - 50 nm. In the second part, we studied the effect of monolayer-monolayer and bilayer-substrate coupling on the acyl-chain crystallization transitions in monolayers of supported bilayers. Symmetric bilayers (separated from the substrate by a water film) exhibited sharp phase transitions at about the same transition temperature as the free bilayers. The transition temperature for asymmetric bilayers was between the transition temperatures for the individual monolayer components. Bilayers formed by phospholipid monolayers on silanes showed a concerted but continuous phase transition which appeared to be due to the constraint of fixed total area and interdigitation of the two monoalayers. By doping the monolayers with different fluorescent probes (NBD and Texas Red lipid analogs), it was demonstrated that, when the proximal layer was in a solid or liquid-solid coexistence state, a phase transition was induced in the superficial monolayer even if this layer was deposited from the fluid state. It was also observed that the patterns of fluid and solid domains in both layers were in complete register. On the other hand, a fluid monolayer of unsaturated lipids on tightly -packed crystalline proximal monolayer was able to undergo a separate phase transition...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive {{investigation of the}} formation of supported lipid membranes with vesicle hemifusion, their stability under detergents and organic solvents and their applications in molecular biology. In Chapter 3, we describe how isolated patches of DOPC <b>bilayers</b> supported on <b>glass</b> surfaces are dissolved by various detergents (decyl maltoside, dodecyl maltoside, CHAPS, CTAB, SDS, TritonX- 100 and Tween 20) at their CMC, as investigated by fluorescence video microscopy. In general, detergents partition into distal leafets of bilayers and lead to the expansion of the bilayers through a rolling motion of the distal over the proximal leaflets, in agreement with the first stage of the established 3 -stage model of lipid vesicle solubilization by detergents. However, solubilization pathways are different for different detergents. For decyl/dodecyl maltoside, CHAPS and SDS, dissolution of bilayers starts only once the bilayers reach a critical lipid:detergent ratio in the bilayers, whereas for CTAB, TritonX and Tween 20, dissolution starts once detergents partition into the bilayers. From the expansion dynamics of bilayers, we conclude that the energy loss due to the partitioning of detergents is balanced by the released heat and the increment of the planar bilayer 2 ̆ 7 s curvature energy. Moreover, in contrast to a previous view that detergents need to be present on both leaflets of bilayers to initiate solubilization, we find that detergents in the distal leaflets of bilayers are sufficient to induce micellization. Lastly, we estimate the energy barrier for detergents to partition into lipid bilayers and find it is on the order of 3 to 7 kT. Subsequently, we study the partitioning of organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, propanol, acetone and chloroform) into isolated <b>bilayer</b> patches on <b>glass</b> in Chapter 4 with fluorescence microscopy. The area expansion of bilayers due to the partitioning of organic solvents is measured. From the titration of organic solvents, we measured the rate of area expansion {{as a function of the}} volume fraction of organic solvents, which is proposed to be a measure of strength of interactions between solvents and membranes. From the same experiments, we also measure the maximum expansion of bilayers (or the maximum binding stoichiometry between organic solvents and lipids) before structural breakdown, which depends on the depth of penetration of solvents to the membranes. From the partitioning dynamics, it is observed that bilayers expand the area through the same rolling motion as described for detergent partitioning in Chapter 3. The energy loss due to the partitioning of organic solvents was balanced by the released heat and the increment of planar bilayer 2 ̆ 7 s curvature energy. Upon desorption of organic solvents, the bilayers shrink the area through the edges and by forming pores within the bilayers, concomitantly increase the contour length of bilayer edges, indicating self-healing is impossible for this system. In Chapter 5, we investigate the formation of sparsely-tethered bilayer lipid membranes (stBLMs) with vesicle hemifusion. In vesicle hemifusion, lipid vesicles in contact with a hydrophobic alkyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) deposit a lipid monolayer to the SAM surface, thus completing the bilayer. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy and Neutron reflectivity are used to probe the integrity of stBLMs in terms of their insulating and structural properties. Preparation conditions are screened for those that are optimal for stBLM formation. Concentrations of lipid vesicles, hydrophobicity of SAMs, the presence of calcium and high concentrations of salt are identified as the key parameters. We show that stBLMs can be formed with vesicles of different compositions. Vesicle hemifusion opens up a new route in preserving the chemical compositions of stBLMs and facilitating membrane proteins incorporation. In Chapter 6, we visualize the hemifusion pathway of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with planar hydrophobic surfaces at the single vesicle level with fluorescence video microscopy. When a GUV hemifuses to a surface, its outer leaflet breaks apart and remains connected to the surface presumably through a hemifusion diaphragm. Lipids from the outer leaflet are transferred to the surface as a lipid monolayer that expands radially outward from the hemifusion diaphragm, thereby forming the loosely packed outer hemifusion zone. The tension of the outer leaflet rises as lipids are transported to the outer hemifusion zone until it is large enough to rupture the GUV. Therefore, a pore forms near the hemifusion diaphragm through which the water encapsulated within the GUV is expelled. Additionally, lipids ipped from the inner to outer leaflet via the pore and are transferred to the surface. The hemifusion of lipids from both leaflets to the surface leads to the formation of the inner hemifusion zone densely packed with lipids. The inner and outer hemifusion zones expand radially as concentric discs with a rate of about 1000 m 2 =s, suggesting the expansion is driven by surface hydrophobicity. The spreading dynamics of the lipid monolayer is consistent with a model where the energy dissipated by friction between the monolayer and the surface is equal to the difference of surface energy when the surface is covered by a lipid monolayer. The mechanism revealed in this work provides insights into membrane reorganization and improves the understanding of vesicle-surface interactions. The tethering of membranes is a common process regulating membrane fusion throughout the secretory pathway. The Prof. Linstedt laboratory at the CMU Department of Biological Sciences has been focusing on the elucidation of the mechanism of Golgi membrane tethers, GRASP (Golgi Reassembly And Stacking Proteins), which are essential for the formation of the characteristic ribbon structure of the Golgi apparatus. Typically, such work involves in vivo expression of these proteins which tracks how specific mutations affect organelle morphology. However, it remains unclear in such investigations, whether a certain active protein is sufficient to trigger the formation of the characteristic structure or if other factors, for example auxiliary proteins, are involved. Therefore, in Chapter 7, we develop an in vitro assay employing stBLMs and lipid vesicles to examine the functionality of GRASP in membrane tethering. Membrane-bound GRASP on opposing membranes dimerizes and tethers fluorescently-labeled vesicles to stBLMs. The fluorescence intensity of images taken at stBLM surfaces is used to quantify the tethering activity. Both wild type and mutant proteins were studied to shed light on the molecular mechanism of tethering. We show that the GRASP domain is sufficient and necessary for membrane tethering. In addition, the tethering capability of GRASP is impaired when the internal ligands and the binding pockets participating in dimerization are deleted and mutated. Membrane anchors, sizes of vesicles and membrane compositions are explored for their influence on the outcomes of the assay. Furthermore, preliminary analysis from neutron reflectivity measurements shows that both the internal ligands and binding pockets are exposed instead of buried toward the membrane surface. In summary, we establish a functional assay for studying GRASP activity in vitro. This assay may also be used for studies of similar supramolecular structure formation processes in molecular biology...|$|R
