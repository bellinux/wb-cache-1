40|$|The {{majority}} of these machines fabricate from raw material in powder form using a directed energy beam to create a local melt zone. Total hip replacement is recommended {{for people who have}} medical issues related to excessive wear of the acetabular, osteoarthritis, accident or age. Researches have shown that large numbers of hip arthroplasties (where the articular surface of a musculoskeletal joint is replaced), hip remodelling, or realignment are carried out annually and will increase in the next few decades. Manufacturing of acetabular shells by using AM is a promising and emerging method that has a great potential to improve public health. Lost wax casting or investment casting is currently used to produce acetabular shells followed by lengthy and complex secondary processes such as machining and polishing. Living organs and medical models have intricate 3 D shapes that are challenging to identity in X-ray CT images. These images are used for preparing treatment plans {{to improve the quality of}} the surgeries regarding waiting and surgery time per procedure and care regime. For instance, a limited number of hip replacement procedures can be carried out on each acetabulum due to a decrease of bone thickness. Rapid prototyping is a suitable treatment planning tool in complex cases to enhance the quality of surgical procedure and provide long-term stability that can be used to customize the shape and size of the acetabular shell. In this paper, to analyse the manufacturing of a prosthetic acetabular shell, <b>built-up</b> <b>lines</b> resulting from a thermal stress flow and process stopping during the selective laser melting (SLM) AM process, with regarding Gibbs free energy, interfacial energy, and equilibrium temperature will be discussed.

40|$|For {{the design}} of {{underground}} structures in rocks, the initial stresses in the rock mass are a pre-requisite for any analysis. The hydraulic fracturing technique is the only practical method for determining these initial stresses at great depth. For vertical fractures, existing solutions for calculation of stresses are satisfactory. For horizontal or mixed-mode fractures, appropriate solutions are required.;Closed-form solutions for horizontal and mixed-mode fractures including strength anisotropy are developed and applied to several case histories. The reinterpreted horizontal stresses agreed with results derived from convergence measurements and they are also consistent with field observations of excavation performance, indicating that the stresses are correct and readily applicable to practice. Stress values obtained using the conventional method in these cases are too low and may lead to unsafe design.;With the initial stresses correctly determined, the stability of tunnels immediately after excavation may be evaluated. For this purpose, Closed-form solutions for the stresses and displacements around unlined circular tunnels in cross-anisotropic rocks such as shales are derived. For convenience of application, design charts are prepared for the determination of stresses and displacements for given values of initial stresses and the elastic parameters.;After the stability conditions during construction are satisfied, the long-term deformation and consequent stress <b>built-up</b> in the <b>lining</b> are important design considerations, so as {{to ensure that the}} structural integrity of the lining is not affected. An experimental study is carried out to investigate the characteristics of the time-dependent deformation of Queenston Shale. The study has shown that Queenston Shale exhibits long-term time-dependent deformation upon stress relief and that the deformation is non-linearly stress dependent. This deformation is represented by a model consisting of three Kelvin units connected in series. The predicted swelling deformations using this model are in good agreement with the measured values in laboratory tests.;Using the theory of viscoelasticity, closed-form solutions for the time-dependent stresses and displacements in the rock mass and the lining of tunnels driven in swelling rocks are derived. A semi-analytical approach is then developed to account for the increase of the values of the moduli of rock as the pressure <b>built-up</b> behind the <b>lining</b> increases with time. It is shown that this solution taking into account stress-dependency of swelling reduces significantly the final stresses and displacements in the lining and the final pressure <b>built-up</b> behind the <b>lining.</b> Therefore, use of the analytical method developed will lead to a more economical design...|$|R

40|$|Uncertainties in the {{properties}} of joints produce uncertainties in the dynamic response of <b>built-up</b> structures. <b>Line</b> joints, such as glued or continuously welded joints, have spatially distributed uncertainty and can be modeled by a discretized random field. Techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation {{can be applied to}} estimate the output statistics, but computational cost can be prohibitive. This paper addresses how uncertainties in joints might be included straightforwardly in a finite element model, with particular reference to approaches based on fixed-interface (Craig– Bampton) component mode synthesis and a stochastic reduced basis method with two variants. These methods are used to determine the output statistics of a structure. Unlike perturbation-based methods, good accuracy can be achieved even when the coefficients of variation of the input random variables are not small. Undamped as well as proportionally damped components are considered. Efficient implementations are proposed based on an exact matrix identity that leads to a significantly lower computational cost if the number of joint degrees of freedom is sufficiently small compared with the structure’s overall number of degrees of freedom. A numerical example is presented. The proposed formulation is an efficient and effective implementation of a stochastic reduced basis projection scheme. It is seen that the method can be up to orders of magnitude faster than direct Monte Carlo simulation, while providing results of comparable accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed implementation is more efficient when fewer joints are affected by uncertainty...|$|R
