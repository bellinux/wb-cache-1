5|$|Astley {{emerged during}} the Early Middle Ages as a {{township}} in the parish of Leigh. It was mentioned in documents in 1210, when Hugh of Tyldesley, Lord of the Manors of Tyldesley and Astley, granted land to Cockersand Abbey. In 1212, he was recorded as tenant of Astley Hall, the manor house for both Astley and Tyldesley, located just inside the Tyldesley township. After his death, his son Henry inherited the manors. He was succeeded by his son, another Henry, who, {{when he died in}} 1301, divided the lands between three of his six sons. It is from this division that the manors of Astley and Tyldesley were separated. Tyldesleys lived at the Astley manor until April 1353 when Richard Radcliff <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> 100 marks. The Radcliffs remained there until 1561 when William Radcliff died childless and the land passed to his half-sister Anne, who married Gilbert Gerard.|$|E
5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on local knowledge and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E

25|$|While the {{building}} was safe for the time being, its exterior, particularly the columns, were in an advanced state of decay.

25|$|On Saturday nights Perkins {{would listen}} to the Grand Ole Opry on his father's radio. Roy Acuff's {{broadcasts}} inspired him to ask his parents for a guitar.

25|$|Kennedy made {{huge profits}} from reorganizing and {{refinancing}} several Hollywood film studios. Film {{production in the}} U.S. was much more decentralized than it is today, with many different movie studios producing film product. One small studio was Film Booking Offices of America (or FBO), which specialized in Westerns produced cheaply. Its owner was in financial trouble and asked Kennedy to help find a new owner. Kennedy formed his own group of investors and <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> $1.5 million (about $ today).|$|E

500|$|The {{paintings}} {{fell into}} obscurity for centuries until 1886 when art historian W.H.J. Weale drew {{the connection between}} them and the Adornes will. William à Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury bought the Philadelphia painting sometime between 1824 and 1828 in Lisbon. At that time it was thought to be by Albrecht Dürer, but in 1857 the art historian Gustav Waagen attributed it to van Eyck. Heytesbury sold it to a dealer in November 1894; a month later the Philadelphia collector John G. Johnson <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> £700. [...] In 1917, he bequeathed his art collection to the City of Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|The Calimala's {{acquiescence}} {{is traditionally}} explained by Cossa's donation of the {{relic of the}} right index finger of John the Baptist (and 200florins for an appropriate reliquary) to the Baptistry. With this finger John was believed to have pointed to Jesus, saying [...] "Ecce Agnus Dei" [...] ("Behold the lamb of God") in [...] The long and complicated history of the relic would only have increased the legendary status of the finger: Philotheus Kokkinos, Patriarch of Constantinople presented it in 1363 to Pope Urban V, who passed it to his successors Gregory XI and Urban VI, who was dispossessed of it during the siege of Nocera, after which John XXIII <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> 800florins and wore it on his person before hiding it in the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli.|$|E
500|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the work}} contains many gaps, and even the better-documented periods are often complicated or [...] "murky", according to Dhanens. There is almost no record from the early 16th century through 1851, and the theft in 1877 leaves doubt for some as to what exactly was returned. Historian Léon de Laborde documented an altarpiece in a village near Nantes in 1851 – a Madonna in a church nave holding the Christ Child in her right arm – which he described as [...] "painted on wood, very well preserved, still in its original frame". The description contains a detailing of the frame's inscription. A document from 1855 records a Virgin in the Church thought to be by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, {{which may be the}} same painting. It belonged to a Monsieur Nau, who had <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> 50 francs from the housekeeper of Francois Cacault, a French diplomat who had acquired a number of paintings from Italy.|$|E
50|$|The trophy was {{subsequently}} lost {{and did not}} resurface again until 1997, when a Scottish antiques collector contacted Hallam F.C. {{to tell them that}} he was in possession of it - they subsequently <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> back <b>for</b> £1,600.
