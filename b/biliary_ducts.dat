25|$|The {{development}} of infection in definitive host {{is divided into}} two phases: the parenchymal (migratory) phase and the biliary phase. The parenchymal phase begins when excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the intestinal wall. After the penetration of the intestine, flukes migrate within the abdominal cavity and penetrate the liver or other organs. F. hepatica has a strong predilection for the tissues of the liver. Occasionally, ectopic locations of flukes such as the lungs, diaphragm, intestinal wall, kidneys, and subcutaneous tissue can occur. During the migration of flukes, tissues are mechanically destroyed and inflammation appears around migratory tracks of flukes. The second phase (the biliary phase) begins when parasites enter the <b>biliary</b> <b>ducts</b> of the liver. In <b>biliary</b> <b>ducts,</b> flukes mature, feed on blood, and produce eggs. Hypertrophy of biliar ducts associated with obstruction of the lumen occurs as a result of tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|In acalculous cholecystitis, no {{stone is}} in the <b>biliary</b> <b>ducts.</b> It {{accounts}} for 5–10% of all cases of cholecystitis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Acalculous cholecystitis is typically seen in people who are hospitalized and critically ill. Males {{are more likely to}} develop acute cholecystitis following surgery in the absence of trauma. It is associated with many causes including vasculitis, chemotherapy, major trauma or burns.|$|E
25|$|Discrete {{localized}} enlargements {{of normal}} structures (ureters, blood vessels, intrahepatic or extrahepatic <b>biliary</b> <b>ducts,</b> pulmonary inclusions, or gastrointestinal duplications) due to outflow obstructions or narrowings, or abnormal connections, may also present as a tumor. Examples are arteriovenous fistulae or aneurysms (with or without thrombosis), biliary fistulae or aneurysms, sclerosing cholangitis, cysticercosis or hydatid cysts, intestinal duplications, and pulmonary inclusions as seen with cystic fibrosis. It {{can be dangerous}} to biopsy a number of types of tumor in which the leakage of their contents would potentially be catastrophic. When such types of tumors are encountered, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, angiograms, and nuclear medicine scans are employed prior to (or during) biopsy or surgical exploration/excision {{in an attempt to}} avoid such severe complications.|$|E

40|$|Background: Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) {{has been}} used for a long time as {{traditional}} medicine but its side effect haven’t been known much. Liver is the main metabolism organ and <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> is the organ that transport bile that contains metabolite and drugs out from the liver. These functions made the two organs likely to be damaged. The objective of this research is to find out the effect of valerian extract to microscopic display of the liver and <b>biliary</b> <b>duct.</b> Method: This research was an experimental study using the post test only controlled grou design. The samples were 20 wistar rats, randomly divided into 4 groups. K was control group which was only given aquadest. P 1, P 2, and P 3 were treatment groups Which was given valerian extract 9 mg/kgBW, 18 mg/kgBw, and 36 mg/kgBW. The extract were given orally by using sonde. After the third month, the wistar rats was terminted, the liver was extracted for the observation of the microscopic appearance of the liver and <b>biliary</b> <b>duct.</b> Result: The Anova test showed there were significant difference in the microscopic appearance of the liver(p= 0, 000). Followed with Post Hoc test that showed significant difference between the control group (K) compared to the treatment groups (P 1,P 2, P 3) and among the treatment group. The anova test for the <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> showed there were no significant difference between groups (p= 0, 804) Conclusion: The use of valerian extract caused damage to the liver but didn’t cause damage the <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> Keywords: Valerian, liver microscopic, <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> microscopic...|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Immature {{eggs are}} {{discharged}} in the <b>biliary</b> <b>ducts</b> {{and in the}} stool 1. Eggs become embryonated in water 2, eggs release miracidia 3, which invade a suitable snail intermediate host 4, including the genera Galba, Fossaria and Pseudosuccinea. In the snail the parasites undergo several developmental stages (sporocysts The number 4a, rediae The number 4b, and cercariae The number 4c). The cercariae are released from the snail 5 and encyst as metacercariae on aquatic vegetation or other surfaces. Mammals acquire the infection by eating vegetation containing metacercariae. Humans can become infected by ingesting metacercariae-containing freshwater plants, especially watercress 6. After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum 7 and migrate through the intestinal wall, the peritoneal cavity, and the liver parenchyma into the <b>biliary</b> <b>ducts,</b> where they develop into adults 8. In humans, maturation from metacercariae into adult flukes takes approximately 3 to 4 months. The adult flukes (Fasciola hepatica: up to 30 mm by 13 mm; F. gigantica: up to 75 mm) reside in the large <b>biliary</b> <b>ducts</b> of the mammalian host. Fasciola hepatica infect various animal species, mostly herbivores.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Spontaneous rupture of the <b>biliary</b> <b>duct,</b> a rare {{condition}} in adults, {{is difficult to}} diagnose preoperatively and presents with acute abdominal symptoms. The treatment of this rare condition {{should be based on}} the individual’s clinical status. We present peripheric <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> rupture (segment three) treated with external segment III drainage and postoperative endoscopic removal of the stones. Presentation of case: An 82 -year-old male patient presented with abdominal pain and fever. An ultrasound (US) revealed a solid gall stone lesion, 3  cm in diameter, in liver segments three and four with additional intra-abdominal fluid accumulation without coexisting free air. A diagnostic laparotomy was then performed because the patient had signs of peritonitis. Exploration revealed a biliary leakage from the posterior surface of segment three. An external biliary drainage catheter was inserted to the perforated segment III duct via a 6 French (6 F) feeding catheter. He was discharged after 10 days and his intracholedocal stent was removed postoperative after three months. The patient continues to be monitored. Discussion: Spontaneous rupture of the intrahepatic <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> is a rare condition. Although occurrence is frequently reported as spontaneous, the majority of cases are related to choledocholithiasis. The role of surgical treatment in cases of spontaneous bile duct rupture is unclear. When biliary peritonitis is present, drainage of contaminated biliary fluid, T-tube drainage, closure of the <b>biliary</b> <b>duct,</b> as well as primary disease conditions, should be reviewed prior to treatment. Conclusion: Surgical treatment of spontaneous <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> rupture should be indicated only after careful consideration of the patient’s clinical and comorbidity status...|$|R

40|$|Bile duct {{injuries}} {{are the most}} frightening complications in laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery. It is thought that incomplete surgical field dissection causes these situations. In this case, cholelithiasis and minimal intrahepatic <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> dilatation were determined on ultrasonography. None of <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> variation was determined on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). According to these results, {{it was decided to}} perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery was performed according to the “Critical View of Safety” principles. Thus, the accessory bile duct could be seen and surgery was completed without any complication. It was aimed to demonstrate that the “Critical View of Safety” principles can prevent ductal complications in situations where preoperative MRCP cannot determine bile duct anomalies. Sensitivity of preoperative tests is not 100 % for <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> anomalies. Therefore, to prevent bile duct injuries, we should perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy according to the “Critical View of Safety” principles for all patients...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{acknowledged}} that total cyst excision {{is a safe}} and ideal surgical treatment for congenital <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> cyst, compared to simple internal drainage. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the optimal operation occasion and the effect of laparoscopy on congenital <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> cyst based upon total cyst excision. Methods From January 2002 to January 2011, 217 patients were admitted to Southwest Hospital for congenital <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> cyst. To determine the optimal surgery occasion, we divided these subjects into three groups, the infant group (age ≤ 3 years), the immaturity group (3 18 years), and then evaluated the feasibility, risk and long-term outcome after surgery in the three groups. To analyze the effect of laparoscopic technique on congenital <b>biliary</b> <b>duct</b> cyst, we divided the patients into the laparoscopy and the open surgery groups. Results Among the three groups, the morbidity from cholangiolithiasis before surgical treatment had obvious discrepancy (p 0. 05). Similarly, no significant discrepancy was observed in the morbidity from postoperative complications or long-term postoperative complications (p > 0. 05) between the laparoscopic and the open surgery groups. Conclusions We conclude that total cyst excision should be performed as early as possible. The optimal treatment occasion is the infant period, and laparoscopic resection may be a new safe and feasible minimally invasive surgery for this disease. </p...|$|R

Type II included patients with biliary-type abdominal pain associated with {{at least one of the}} following: altered liver enzymes on blood testing, dilated <b>biliary</b> <b>ducts</b> on imaging tests, and delayed bile clearance on HIDA scan. Biliary-type pain in the absence of any sign of biliary or pancreatic alteration was the so called Type III biliary SOD. The hypothesis that this pain could be linked to SOD has been studied in a large trial published in JAMA (2014) where patients where randomized to sphincterotomy or sham surgery. Contrary to expectations, patients who were not subjected to sphincterotomy fared better. Overall, the investigators found that only 23% of the patients who underwent sphincterotomy improved versus 37% of the control group.
