25|$|Dextrins can be {{produced}} from starch using enzymes like amylases, as during digestion {{in the human body}} and during malting and mashing, or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions (pyrolysis or roasting). The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during the <b>baking</b> <b>process,</b> contributing to flavor, color and crispness. Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins. The starch hydrolyses during roasting under acidic conditions, and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with α-(1,6) bonds to the degraded starch molecule. See also Maillard Reaction.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} breads {{on the market}} that boast having no high {{fructose}} corn syrup. [...] In lieu of high fructose corn syrup, however, one may find the production of special breads with a high inulin content, where inulin is a replacement in the <b>baking</b> <b>process</b> for the following: high fructose corn syrup, flour and fat. [...] Because of the caloric reduction, lower fat content, dramatic fiber increase and prebiotic tendencies of the replacement inulin, these breads are considered a healthier alternative to traditionally prepared leavening breads. [...] Though the touted health benefits may exist, sufferers of fructose malabsorption will likely find no difference between these new breads and traditionally prepared breads in alleviating their symptoms because inulin is a fructan, and, again, consumption of fructans should be reduced dramatically in those with fructose malabsorption {{in an effort to}} appease symptoms.|$|E
60|$|Something of this {{contrast}} {{was seen}} in the year's experience which had turned the brilliant, self-confident Gwendolen Harleth of the Archery Meeting into the crushed penitent impelled to confess her unworthiness where it would have been her happiness to be held worthy; while it had left her family in Pennicote without deeper change than that of some outward habits, and some adjustment of prospects and intentions to reduced income, fewer visits, and fainter compliments. The rectory was as pleasant a home as before: and the red and pink peonies on the lawn, the rows of hollyhocks by the hedges, had bloomed as well this year as last: the rector maintained his cheerful confidence in the good will of patrons and his resolution to deserve it by diligence in the fulfillment of his duties, whether patrons were likely to hear of it or not; doing nothing solely with an eye to promotion except, perhaps, the writing of two ecclesiastical articles, which having no signature, were attributed to some one else, except by the patrons who had a special copy sent them, and these certainly knew the author but did not read the articles. The rector, however, chewed no poisonous cud of suspicion on this point: he made marginal notes on his own copies to render them a more interesting loan, and was gratified that the Archdeacon and other authorities had nothing to say against the general tenor of his argument. Peaceful authorship!--living in the air of the fields and downs, and not in the thrice-breathed breath of criticism--bringing no Dantesque leanness; rather, assisting nutrition by complacency, and perhaps giving a more suffusive sense of achievement than the production of a whole Divina Commedia. Then there was the father's recovered delight in his favorite son, which was a happiness outweighing the loss of eighteen hundred a year. Of whatever nature might be the hidden change wrought in Rex by the disappointment of his first love, it was apparently quite secondary to that evidence of more serious ambition which dated from the family misfortune; indeed, Mr. Gascoigne was inclined to regard the little affair which had caused him so much anxiety the year before as an evaporation of superfluous moisture, a kind of finish to the <b>baking</b> <b>process</b> which the human dough demands. Rex had lately come down for a summer visit to the rectory, bringing Anna home, and while he showed nearly the old liveliness with his brothers and sisters, he continued in his holiday the habits of the eager student, rising {{early in the morning and}} shutting himself up early in the evenings to carry on a fixed course of study.|$|E

30|$|To {{obtain a}} 3 D ZnO {{structure}} {{by using the}} templating process, template removal is required after the infiltration process. On top of this, due to insufficient heat treatment, removal of the remaining ZnO precursor that infiltrated into the template is also necessary. Thus, post-baking serves a dual purpose: primarily, to remove the template and, consequently, {{to contribute to the}} pyrolysis of the precursor to serve as preparation for the ZnO. In this light, post-baking was done on the precursor-infiltrated template at 410  °C for 4  h in oxygen atmosphere [19]. Our previous research has shown that the pyrolysis temperature of the precursor is above 360  °C [40]. As mentioned above, this procedure has two different <b>baking</b> <b>processes</b> because the post-baking at temperatures greater than 400  °C after infiltration without pre-baking causes a structural collapse (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 a, b).|$|R
40|$|Myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP 6), is {{the main}} iron {{chelator}} in cereals and bread.

The sourdough process fully degraded IP 6 whilst the CBP and conventional processes reduced it by 75 % compared with wholemeal flour. The iron released in solution after a simulated digestion was 8 -fold higher in sourdough bread than with others but no difference in cellular iron uptake was observed. Additionally, when iron was added to the different breads digestions only sourdough bread elicited a significant ferritin response in Caco- 2 cells (4. 8 -fold compared to the other breads) suggesting that sourdough bread could contribute towards improved iron nutrition...|$|R

5000|$|Sprout {{damage is}} {{undesirable}} germination of wheat kernels that occurs on mature, unharvested wheat when wet field conditions persist {{just prior to}} and during the harvest. Mature wheat that has been cut and left lying in the field prior to threshing is particularly vulnerable to sprout damage. Early cold weather in Canada often forces wheat producers there to cut and windrow their crop to allow for drying. Wet conditions can then cause widespread sprout damage. If it has occurred, there is a dramatic increase of the enzyme alpha-amylase. The Falling Number test {{is a measure of}} the presence of this enzyme. A high falling number indicates that the wheat is sound and satisfactory for most <b>baking</b> <b>processes.</b> A low falling number indicates that harmful sprouting has occurred and is suggestive of reduced baking quality. In bread, too much alpha-amylase activity will cause wet sticky bread crumb with large voids in the loaf and too little causes dry crumble bread crumb and high loaf density.|$|R
