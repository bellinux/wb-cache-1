5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> did not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E
5|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> {{jumped out}} to an early lead via a Wenning to Snead touchdown, and led {{at the end of}} the first quarter 7–0. After the first quarter, due to Kennedy's ineffectiveness, Fredi Knighten took over at quarterback for Arkansas State, and in the second quarter, helped the team score 10 points while <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> scored only 3 – at half time, the teams were tied at 10. Arkansas State made two field goals in the third quarter, thus {{entering}} the fourth with a six-point lead. However, <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> scored via a field goal early in the quarter, and a touchdown with less than two minutes to play to retake the lead. Arkansas State promptly responded via a touchdown pass. Although <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> was able to move the ball into field goal range as time waned, their field goal try was blocked, and ultimately Arkansas State held onto win the game, 23–20.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, each team traded {{a pair of}} {{touchdown}}s with Toledo winning the game 28–16. Toledo scored on touchdown runs of two-yards by Parker and ten-yards by Meger. <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> scored touchdowns on a 19-yard Corey Croom run and on a 22-yard Scott Hammersley pass to Travis Moore. The victory improved Toledo's all-time record against <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> to 8–8.|$|E

5|$|Arkansas State got {{the ball}} to start the second half, and {{promptly}} drove down the field relying predominantly on Knighten, who threw six passes and attempted three rushes; ultimately, their drive stalled at the 2-yard line, and Davis kicked an 18-yard field goal to put the Red Wolves atop 13–10. <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> subsequently faced a fourth down and one (4th and 1) situation, on which they attempted a fake punt – Schmidt was tackled by Brock Barnhill on the play and lost three yards on the rush, and the Cardinals had to relinquish the ball in their own territory. Arkansas State {{took advantage of the}} field position, converting another field goal attempt, this one from 29 yards, to give them a 6-point lead. Once again, <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> turned the ball over on downs on their ensuing possession, this time doing so at the Arkansas State 32-yard line. This time, Arkansas State failed to take advantage, punting after achieving only one first down. At the end of the quarter, <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> {{was in the midst of}} a possession around their 25-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo's {{opponent}} in the 2008 MAC Championship Game would be the No.12-ranked <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> Cardinals, who had gone undefeated in winning the MAC West. <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> was a two-touchdown favorite entering the game; Buffalo in its history was 0–5 against the Cardinals. The Bulls struck first with a touchdown {{late in the first}} quarter; <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> responded with a touchdown and a field goal in the second quarter to take a 10–7 lead at the half. The two teams traded touchdowns early in the third quarter. Disaster then struck for Ball State: on two consecutive possessions late in the third quarter, after having driven into the red zone, the Cardinals fumbled the ball. Buffalo returned both of these fumbles for touchdowns and took a lead they would not surrender. The Bulls won the game 42–24, earning their first-ever MAC Championship as well as their first-ever win over a ranked {{opponent in}} nine attempts.|$|E

5|$|The {{victim of}} poor field position, <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> {{executed}} only three plays, {{the last of}} which was a sack that pinned them at their own 1-yard line. Nevertheless, Schmidt was able to punt the ball 52 yards, but a 10-yard return still gave Arkansas State the ball in Ball State's territory. They got on the score board on that drive via a 41-yard field goal kick by Brian Davis, making the score 7–3 <b>Ball</b> <b>State.</b> On their ensuing drive, <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> executed another extended drive, this one lasting 13 plays and totaling 67 yards (highlighted by another 20+ yard rush by Edwards); it failed to reach the end zone, but all was not lost, as Scott Secor made a 26-yard field goal to put the Cardinals up by seven points. The drive encompassed 6:09. Arkansas State responded, embarking on a 9-play, 63-yard drive that was highlighted by a 27-yard rush by R.J. Fleming, and climaxed when Sirgregory Thornton rushed for a 1-yard touchdown, tying the game in the waning seconds of the first half. The half time score was 10–10.|$|E
5|$|After Maryland {{suffered}} a fifth {{loss in the}} season closer against Boston College, it was very unlikely that the team's preferred postseason game, the Meineke Car Care Bowl, would extend an invitation. The game's selection committee in Charlotte, North Carolina was eager to secure nearby North Carolina (8–4). Meanwhile, the EagleBank Bowl, hosted by RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., {{not far from the}} Maryland campus, secured in-state rival Navy, but the game date conflicted with Maryland's final exams. Soon after Maryland's regular season finale, sportswriters and analysts speculated that the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, was the most likely postseason destination. Bowl officials there worked to secure a game of undefeated teams between the hometown team, Boise State, and <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> of the Mid-American Conference. However, <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> rejected the proposal to play at Boise State's homefield as unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the International Bowl following their victory over then-undefeated <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Although in past years the MAC champion had been invited to the Motor City Bowl, Buffalo preferred to go to the International Bowl due to Toronto being closer to the school than Detroit, the home of the Motor City Bowl. The game marked the first bowl for the Bulls after their first MAC Championship since moving to Division I-A and joining the MAC in 1999.|$|E

After a scoreless first quarter, Toledo took a 7–0 halftime lead after Kevin Meger {{scored on a}} two-yard run to complete a 75-yard drive. The Rockets then extended their lead to 14–0 early {{in the third quarter}} on a two-yard Troy Parker run before the Cardinals cut the lead to 14–3 on a 47-yard Kenny Stucker field goal late in the quarter.|$|E

Facing the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with a regular season record of 8–5, highlighted by an upset win over then-No.12 and undefeated <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> in the 2008 MAC Championship Game. Pre-game media coverage focused on the legacy of the 1958 Buffalo Bulls, the first team from the university to be invited to a bowl game. When told that the two African-American members of the team {{would not be allowed to}} play because of segregation, the team elected to refuse the bowl bid. Buffalo would not play in a bowl until this game, 50years later.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, media {{coverage}} focused on the achievements of the Buffalo Bulls. Buffalo had been one of the least-successful programs in college football from their transition to Division I-A in 1999 to 2006, during which they had a cumulative record of 12–79. In 2008, the Bulls had their first winning season since 1996, won five games in a row for the first time since 1986, beat a ranked team for the first time in program history with their upset victory over <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> in the MAC Championship Game, and would be making the first bowl appearance in school history. The turnaround of the Buffalo program brought acclaim to Bulls head coach Turner Gill, who had taken over the team in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Several radio {{stations}} {{were set to}} broadcast the game, including <b>Ball</b> <b>State</b> student radio WCRD, which featured Tyler Bradfield doing play-by-play and Sean Stewart as the analyst, and Ball State's flagship radio station WLBC-FM, which featured a four-person crew – Joel Gedett (play-by-play), Mark O'Connell (analyst), Luke Martin (sidelines), and Jeff Weiler (host). The GoDaddy Bowl Radio Network was also set to broadcast the game on over 400 affiliated {{radio stations}}, as well as Sirius XM.
