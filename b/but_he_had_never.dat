5|$|Hoping {{to prevent}} the {{outbreak}} of a wider war, American officials ordered the U.S. Army to arrest the Meskwakis who massacred the Menominees. General Gaines was ill, and so his subordinate, Brigadier General Henry Atkinson, received the assignment. Atkinson was a middle-aged officer who had ably handled administrative and diplomatic tasks, most notably during the 1827 Winnebago War, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen combat. On April 8, he set out from Jefferson Barracks in Missouri, moving up the Mississippi River by steamboat with about 220 soldiers. By chance, Black Hawk and his British Band had just crossed into Illinois. Although Atkinson did not realize it, his boats passed Black Hawk's band.|$|E

25|$|In 1185, the Lord of Ireland, John Lackland, {{granted the}} merge of the dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough. This was {{initially}} without effect as the charter lacked papal approval. When the bishop Macrobius died in 1192, a synod {{was held in}} Dublin {{under the direction of}} the papal legate Metthew O Enna. William Piro was elected as bishop of Glendalough and remained in office at least until 1212. Robert de Bedford was elected as successor in 1213 or 1214 <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> the opportunity to take possession of the diocesan seat. Instead, John, now King of England, reissued a grant to join Glendalough to Dublin which was finally approved by Pope Innocent III in 1216 and confirmed by his successor Honorius III in the same year.|$|E

500|$|Brooks {{began writing}} The Sword of Shannara in 1967 {{when he was}} twenty-three years old. He started writing the novel to {{challenge}} himself and {{as a way of}} staying [...] "sane" [...] while he attended law school at Washington and Lee University. Brooks had been a writer since high school, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> found 'his' genre: [...] "I tried my hand at science fiction, westerns, war stories, you name it. All those efforts ... weren't very good." [...] When he was starting college, he was given a copy of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to read for the first time. From then on, Brooks knew that he had found a genre he could write in. Writing Sword took seven years, as Brooks worked on it only sporadically while also completing his law school courses and rewrote it many times.|$|E
500|$|After the Australian forces {{moved to}} the Western Front in 1916, Blamey {{returned}} to the 1st Division as GSO1. At the Battle of Pozières, he developed the plan of attack which captured the town, for which he received another mention in despatches, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in the 1917 New Year Honours. He was considered as a possible brigade commander, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> commanded a battalion, which was usually regarded as a prerequisite for brigade command. He was therefore appointed to command the 2nd Infantry Battalion on 3 December 1916. On 28 December, Blamey, as senior ranking battalion commander, took over as acting commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade. On 9 January 1917, he went on leave, handing over command to Lieutenant Colonel Iven Mackay. However, when General Headquarters (GHQ) BEF found out about this use of a staff college graduate, it reminded I ANZAC Corps that [...] "it is inadvisable to release such officers for command of battalions unless they {{have proved to be}} unequal to their duties on staff".|$|E
500|$|... "The Lodger" [...] {{is based}} on a short comic strip of the same name, written by Gareth Roberts for Doctor Who Magazine issue 368 in 2006. The comic {{features}} the Tenth Doctor, who spends several days staying in Mickey Smith's flat, waiting for Rose Tyler and the TARDIS to catch him up in a few days, and by chance saving the Earth by hiding it from the passing space fleet of a violent alien race. The story was based on ideas that Roberts had since a child to imagine the Doctor experiencing everyday human life and his enjoyment of stories set on Earth rather than in space. Roberts' original comic strip appealed to new executive producer Steven Moffat, who enthused to Roberts that he had [...] "got to do" [...] "The Lodger" [...] as an episode. Roberts had previously had the idea to make the television version, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> mentioned it. [...] Roberts considered [...] "The Lodger" [...] less an adaptation than was previously done by Paul Cornell for [...] "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood", taken from Cornell's novel, and instead wrote most of the episode from scratch.|$|E

500|$|Having already traded Kyle Lowry {{and lost}} Goran Dragić to free agency, the Rockets made Lin {{the center of}} both their preseason [...] "A New Age" [...] {{publicity}} campaign {{as well as their}} initial ads on Comcast SportsNet Houston. Coming off his [...] "Linsanity" [...] performance in New York, Houston coach Kevin McHale said the expectations of Lin were undue. McHale said the public believed Lin would [...] "average 28 [...] and 11 [...] ", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> played a whole 82-game season before. Shortly before their regular-season opener in October, the Rockets acquired James Harden, who supplanted Lin as the face of the team. Throughout the season, though, Lin still placed pressure on himself {{to live up to the}} expectations from Linsanity. However, Harden was a ball-dominant, pick-and-roll player like Lin, and McHale chose to have the offense run through the more-proven Harden. The Rockets started the season with a 5–7 record and the youngest roster in the league. Lin was averaging 10 points and 6.3 assists, but was struggling shooting 33.3 percent and 22.9 percent of his 3-pointers. He was handling the ball less than he did with the Knicks, with Harden often controlling the ball on pick-and-rolls with Lin on the wing. In the Rockets' next game on November 23, Lin faced the Knicks for the first time since leaving as a free agent. The Knicks entered at 8–2 with the best record in the league, but Houston won at home 131–103 as Lin contributed 13 points, seven rebounds and three assists. He shot 6-for-12, making half of his shots for the first time in eight games, and breaking a personal five-game drought without a 3-pointer.|$|E

His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the [...] "Governator" [...] (referring to The Terminator movies, see above) and [...] "The Running Man" [...] (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election [...] "Total Recall" [...] (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger).

2500|$|At the conclusion, Poirot {{is forced}} to admit that Blunt does indeed stand in public life [...] "for {{all the things that}} to my mind are important. For sanity and balance and {{stability}} and honest dealing". Nevertheless, he adds: [...] "I am not concerned with the fate of nations, Monsieur. I am concerned with the lives of private individuals who have the right not to have their lives taken from them." [...] Stating that he does not feel that Blunt's claims to be needed in the world justifies the deaths that resulted from his plan, he turns Blunt over to the police. Later, he speaks with Howard Raikes and Jane Olivera, telling them that they now have the [...] "new heaven and the new earth" [...] that they desire, asking them only to [...] "let there be freedom and let there be pity". In the last chapter, Barnes tells Poirot that he took a strong interest in the case as his (Barnes's) own undercover sobriquet was Albert Chapman, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been married.|$|E
2500|$|Melkonian was an Armenian {{nationalist}} and {{a revolutionary}} socialist. Throughout {{his life he}} sympathized with Marxism–Leninism, which was also the ideology of ASALA. Vorbach wrote in 1994 that his writings [...] "expose him as an Armenian nationalist and a committed socialist of the Marxist-Leninist variety." [...] According to his brother he [...] "had not always been a communist, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been an ex-communist." [...] Melkonian hoped that the Soviet Union would [...] "reform itself, democratize, and promote personal freedoms" [...] and did not abandon hope in Soviet Armenia {{until the end of}} the Soviet era appeared inevitable. Philip Marsden wrote that his career [...] "reveals the profound shift in radical ideology—from revolutionary Marxism to nationalism." [...] Marsden adds that in the 1980s his ideology came into conflict with a growing nationalism: [...] "With ever greater difficulty, he squeezed the Armenian question into the context of left-wing orthodoxy, believing for instance that Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union would be a terrible error." [...] In the 1980s he advocated for the Soviet takeover of Turkey's formerly Armenian populated areas and its unification with Soviet Armenia. In the 1980s, while in a French prison, he called for the creation of a guerilla force in eastern Turkey which would unite Kurdish rebels, left-wing Turks, and Armenian revolutionaries. Vorbach summarized his views on Turkey: ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1952, while Stevenson {{was still}} {{governor}} of Illinois, President Harry S. Truman {{decided that he}} would not seek another term as president. Instead, Truman met with Stevenson in Washington and proposed that Stevenson seek the Democratic nomination for president; Truman promised him his support if he did so. Stevenson at first hesitated, arguing that he was committed to running for a second gubernatorial term in Illinois. However, a number of his friends and associates (such as George Wildman Ball) quietly began organizing a [...] "draft Stevenson" [...] movement for President; they persisted in their activity even when Stevenson (both publicly and privately) told them to stop. When Stevenson continued to state that he was not a candidate, President Truman and the Democratic Party leadership looked for other prospective candidates. However, each of the other main contenders had a major weakness. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee won most of the presidential primaries and entered the 1952 Democratic National Convention with the largest number of delegates, but he was unpopular with President Truman and other prominent Democrats. In 1950 Kefauver had chaired a Senate committee that traveled to several large cities and held televised hearings into organized crime. The hearings revealed connections between organized-crime syndicates and big-city Democratic political organizations, which led Truman and other Democratic leaders to oppose Kefauver's bid for the nomination: [...] "a machine politician and proud of it, [...] had no use for reformers who blackened the names of fellow Democrats." [...] Truman favored U.S. diplomat W. Averell Harriman, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> held elective office and was inexperienced in national politics. Truman next turned to his Vice-President, Alben Barkley, but at 74 years of age he was dismissed as being too old by labor union leaders. Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia was popular in the South, but his support of racial segregation and opposition to civil rights for blacks made him unacceptable to Northern and Western Democrats. In the end Stevenson, despite his reluctance to run, remained the most attractive candidate heading into the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.|$|E
