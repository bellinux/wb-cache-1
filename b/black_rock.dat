5|$|North of {{downtown}} Buffalo, I-190 follows {{the eastern edge}} of the <b>Black</b> <b>Rock</b> Canal (and passes the site of the former <b>Black</b> <b>Rock</b> toll barrier) before rejoining the banks of the Niagara near an exit with the Scajaquada Expressway (NY198, exit11). I-190 continues north through the northern extents of Buffalo, meeting multiple streets before separating from the Niagara and interchanging with NY266 and NY324 (exits15 and16) in quick succession. At exit16, NY324 joins I-190 northward through western Tonawanda. The two routes then meet I-290 and NY266 a second time prior to crossing the Niagara River on the South Grand Island Bridge. NY324 leaves the expressway shortly after arriving on Grand Island at exit18.|$|E
5|$|Gunfright is an arcade {{adventure}} {{video game}} developed by Ultimate Play the Game {{and published by}} U.S. Gold. It was first released for the ZX Spectrum in 1985 and was ported to the Amstrad CPC and the MSX later that year. In the game, the player takes {{the role of a}} sheriff in the town of <b>Black</b> <b>Rock</b> and is tasked with eliminating outlaws who are scattered throughout the settlement.|$|E
50|$|The old inlet at the <b>Black</b> <b>Rocks</b> {{was still}} open. A {{community}} of fishermen from the Bahamas had {{settled on the}} barrier island {{just north of the}} <b>Black</b> <b>Rocks,</b> and they periodically cleared the channel when it silted up. A storm closed the inlet at the <b>Black</b> <b>Rocks</b> in 1919, and the fishermen, who were squatting on the island, were forced off by its owners and moved to Riviera (now Riviera Beach).|$|R

50|$|The new inlet served its {{intended}} purpose well. The inlet tended to migrate south, however, {{with the current}} wearing away at the southern bank and depositing sand on the northern bank. By 1886 the inlet had migrated about a mile south of the <b>Black</b> <b>Rocks,</b> and closed up during a storm. An inlet was again dug through {{just south of the}} <b>Black</b> <b>Rocks.</b>|$|R

However, Hurley blows up the ship in order to prevent anymore risks; destroying all the dynamite supplies. After Hurley tells of his plan to talk to the Man in Black and Richard goes with his plan to destroy the plane, Frank joins Hurley, along with Jack, and Sun. Their group then merge with the Man in Black's camp.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format and set in the fictional town of <b>Black</b> <b>Rock.</b> The player takes {{on the role of}} Sheriff Quickdraw, and the main objective of the game is to track down and kill a gang of outlaws who are hiding in the town. The game begins with a first-person perspective targeting minigame in which vertically scrolling bags of money can be shot at using crosshairs. Shooting the bags give the player initial sums of money which can be used to purchase ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The {{size and}} whether they are counted as islands during any {{particular}} year depends mostly {{on the level of}} the lake. From largest to smallest, they are Antelope Island, Stansbury Island, Fremont Island, Carrington Island, Dolphin Island, Cub Island, and Badger Island, and various rocks, reefs, or shoals with names like Strongs Knob, Gunnison Island, Goose, Browns, Hat (Bird), Egg Island, <b>Black</b> <b>Rock,</b> and White Rock. Dolphin Island, Gunnison Island, Cub Island, and Strongs Knob are in the northwestern arm. The rest are in the southern portion of the Great Salt Lake.|$|E

5|$|An {{hour after}} the {{previous}} event caused destruction in Upstate New York, a new tornado family began producing significant damage in the adjacent state of Connecticut. The first tornado, {{which may have been}} three separate tornadoes, started its path of destruction in Cornwall, leveling a virgin forest known as Cathedral Pines. At the nearby Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, every ski lift was destroyed, with some lift chairs found miles away. The tornado continued south-southeast through Milton, leveling hundreds more trees, and destroyed the village of Bantam before dissipating. Strong downburst winds continued to cause damage and level trees after this tornado lifted: it was during this period between tornadoes that a 12-year-old girl was killed by falling trees in <b>Black</b> <b>Rock</b> State Park.|$|E
5|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Rock,</b> Antelope Island, White Rock, Egg Island, Fremont Island, and the Promontory {{mountain}} range are each {{extensions of the}} Oquirrh Mountain Range, which dips beneath the lake at its southeastern shore. Stansbury, Carrington, and Hat Islands are extensions of the Stansbury {{mountain range}}, and Strongs Knob {{is an extension of}} the Lakeside Mountains which run along the lake's western shore. The lake is deepest in the area between these island chains, measured by Howard Stansbury in 1850 at about 35 feet (10.7 meters) deep, and an average depth of 13 feet (four meters). When the water levels are low, Antelope Island becomes connected to the shore as a peninsula, as do Goose Islands, Browns Island, {{and some of the other}} islands. Stansbury Island and Strongs Knob remain peninsulas unless the water level rises well-above the average.|$|E
5|$|Located {{entirely in}} southeastern Millard County, SR-161 starts at a diamond {{interchange}} with the westernmost exit on I-70 before it terminates at I-15. The road continues northward {{until it reaches}} the historic Cove Fort and the associated visitors center. On {{the eastern side of}} the highway is a Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) maintenance center. SR-161 starts to make a gentle turn to the northeast, passing a filling station, which also serves as a rest area as part of a public–private partnership between UDOT and the owners of the station. The highway intersects I-15 and comes to an end at a cattle guard on <b>Black</b> <b>Rock</b> Road northwest of the interchange with I-15.|$|E

5|$|Unaware of the American intentions, the British and Canadians {{thought that}} King, Boerstler and Winder had been {{intended}} {{as the first}} wave of Smyth’s invasion rather than as a preparatory raid. The Canadian press praised the “gallant achievement” of the defenders in apparently repulsing the Americans and singled out Bisshopp for particular congratulation. In his dispatch to Prevost, Major General Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe, the British commander in Upper Canada, wrote that “Lieut.-Colonel Bisshopp deserves high commendation for the spirit and activity he displayed, and great credit is due the officers and men who acted under his orders.” Bisshopp was killed the following summer while leading the Raid on <b>Black</b> <b>Rock.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lakes may form in basins {{where there}} is {{sufficient}} precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above. They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low-lying areas. When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or hardpan behind. This area of deposited clay, silt or sand {{is known as a}} playa. The deserts of North America have more than one hundred playas, many of them relics of Lake Bonneville which covered parts of Utah, Nevada and Idaho during the last ice age when the climate was colder and wetter. These include the Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake and many dry lake beds. The smooth flat surfaces of playas have been used for attempted vehicle speed records at <b>Black</b> <b>Rock</b> Desert and Bonneville Speedway and the United States Air Force uses Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert as runways for aircraft and the space shuttle.|$|E
5|$|MGM lent Tracy to Twentieth Century-Fox for the Western film Broken Lance, {{his only}} {{appearance}} of 1954. The picture was well received. In 1955 Tracy turned down William Wyler's The Desperate Hours because {{he refused to}} take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility {{of a small town}} in Bad Day at <b>Black</b> <b>Rock</b> (1955), a film directed by John Sturges. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He had personally been unhappy with the picture, and threatened to leave it during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for the aging Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on Tribute to a Bad Man in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when the location shooting in Colorado gave him altitude sickness. The trouble caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955 he was the last remaining star of the studio's heyday, but with his contract up for renewal—Tracy opted to go independent {{for the first time in}} his movie career.|$|E

5|$|The British local commander, Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Bisshopp, was {{stationed}} at Chippawa, {{with a company}} of the 1st Battalion, 41st Regiment of Foot, two infantry companies of the 5th Lincoln Militia and a small detachment of Lincoln Militia Artillery. More of the 5th Lincoln Militia under Major Richard Hatt were posted nearby. In the area that would face attack on December 26, Bisshopp had several different detachments under his overall command. At Fort Erie were 80 of the 49th Regiment of Foot under Major Ormsby and 50 of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment under Captain Whelan. At <b>Black</b> <b>Rock</b> Ferry were two companies of Norfolk Militia under Captain John Bostwick. At the Red House, two-and-half miles from Fort Erie on the Chippawa Road, were 38 of the 49th Regiment under Lieutenant Thomas Lamont, some men of the Royal Regiment of Artillery under Lieutenant King, and some militia artillerymen. Lamont's battery mounted two guns: an 18-pounder and a 24-pounder; while King’s battery mounted a 6-pounder and a 3-pounder. Further along the Chippawa Road, about four-and-a-half miles from Fort Erie, lay the post at Frenchman’s Creek, garrisoned by 38 more men of the 49th Regiment under Lieutenant J. Bartley. Not far away were 70 of the light infantry company of the 41st Regiment under Lieutenant Angus McIntyre.|$|E
5|$|The {{counterculture}} was a youth {{movement that}} included political activism, especially {{in opposition to}} the Vietnam War, and the promotion of various hippie ideals. The hippies were associated primarily with two kinds of music: the folk-rock and country rock of people like Bob Dylan and Gram Parsons, and the psychedelic rock of bands like Jefferson Airplane and The Doors. This movement was very closely connected to the British Invasion, a wave of bands from the United Kingdom who became popular throughout much of the 1960s. The British Invasion initially included bands like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Zombies who were later joined by bands like the Moody Blues and The Who. The sound of these bands was hard-edged rock, with the Beatles originally known for songs that resembled classic <b>black</b> <b>rock</b> songs by Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, The Shirelles and the Isley Brothers. Later, as the counterculture developed, The Beatles began using more advanced techniques and unusual instruments, such as the sitar, as well as more original lyrics.|$|E
5|$|The terrain in the Trout Creek Mountains {{varies from}} broad, flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock escarpments cut by deep canyons. The canyons have steep walls with loose talus slopes at the bottoms. There are meadows around springs in the mountains, {{although}} most streams {{in the range}} do not flow year-round. Major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include (from west to east) Cottonwood Creek, Trout Creek, Willow Creek, and Whitehorse Creek. These streams all flow into endorheic basins in Harney County, Oregon. Trout Creek and Whitehorse Creek are {{the largest of the}} four. The Kings River and McDermitt Creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the Trout Creek Mountains. The Kings River begins in The Granites and flows south into Nevada, where it meets the Quinn River, which evaporates in the <b>Black</b> <b>Rock</b> Desert. McDermitt Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The Granites and flows generally east, crossing the Oregon–Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of McDermitt.|$|E
