25|$|In November 1942, a tram was accidentally set {{in motion}} whilst parked up overnight, taking two others with it. The {{unmanned}} convoy of trams was stopped by a lorry <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> was hurt. That incident caused some consternation locally, as saboteurs {{were thought to be}} responsible. It later emerged that the incident was due to a young boy playing on the trams.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the women}} of the royal family, Locrian Ajax {{violated}} Cassandra on Athena's altar while she was clinging to her statue, which since looks upward. She was awarded to Agamemnon. Neoptolemus got Andromache, wife of Hector and Odysseus took Priam's widow Hecuba (known in Greek as Hecabe). The ghost of Achilles appeared before the survivors of the war, demanding that the Trojan princess Polyxena be sacrificed <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> could leave, as either part of his spoil or because she had betrayed him. Neoptolemus did so.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Cole's statement, Atlas-Imperial, the primary company implicated in this affair, {{released a statement}} of its own saying that their facility had only five gallons of carbon tetrachloride in stock, which was contained in firefighting equipment. Atlas-Imperial officials also denied that any quantities of trichloroethylene (an industrial solvent used by Atlas) could be responsible for sickness in the town, reasoning {{that it would have}} taken significant quantities of the chemical to sicken the townspeople, and that factory workers would have experienced similar symptoms long <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> outside of the factory was affected.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll fix you for this!" [...] went on Haskett, {{putting one}} hand to his chin, where a lump was rising rapidly. [...] "I never <b>before</b> allowed <b>anybody</b> to hit me--leastwise a boy." [...] And he rushed at Walter with a fierceness which boded the youth no good.|$|R

25|$|The {{rules for}} the line of play often differ from one variant to another. In many rules, the doubles serve as spinners, i.e., they can be played on all four sides, causing the line of play to branch. Sometimes, the first tile is {{required}} to be a double, which serves as the only spinner. In some games such as Chicken Foot, all sides of a spinner must be occupied <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> is allowed to play elsewhere. Matador has unusual rules for matching. Bendomino uses curved tiles, so {{one side of the}} line of play (or both) may be blocked for geometrical reasons.|$|E
500|$|On June 29, 1940—a Saturday {{morning when}} few {{inquisitive}} studio executives would be around—Welles began filming Citizen Kane. After the disappointment of having Heart of Darkness cancelled, Welles followed Ferguson's suggestion and deceived RKO {{into believing that}} he was simply shooting camera tests. [...] "But we were shooting the picture," [...] Welles said, [...] "because {{we wanted to get}} started and be already into it <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> knew about it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I've {{done about}} three weeks with her, and we’re gonna do some more {{projects}} {{at the end of}} July. She’s just really cool. I think as far as artists reinventing themselves, she did it <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> else. She kind of began that trend of actually coming back with a whole new look and style and sound and winning it and hitting the top of the charts. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Quite dry," [...] said Dorothy. Then {{there came}} a peal of {{laughter}} from Mrs. MacHugh and Sir Peter, and Dorothy wondered whether <b>anybody</b> <b>before</b> had ever made those two steady old people laugh after that fashion.|$|R
500|$|In Dionysus (1976), Kerényi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, {{surviving}} from Minoan times (hence {{his association}} with Crete). Kerényi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word ὕρον - hyron, meaning [...] "beehive", which survives only in ancient dictionaries. From this association he turns Orion into {{a representative of the}} old mead-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for [...] "wine" [...] is oinos.) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> else knew how.|$|E
500|$|Fred Fielder, {{police chief}} in Helena–West Helena, Arkansas, said the alleged plot in Tennessee {{particularly}} concerned him {{due to the}} fact that 66 percent of the city's 12,200 population are African American; he said to reporters, [...] "Predominantly black school, take your pick." [...] Mark Potok, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, described the plans and weapons arsenal as frightening, but said, [...] "With the part about wearing top hats...it gets a bit hard to take them seriously." [...] Nevertheless, Potok said [...] "the reality is, they might have walked into a black high school and killed 20, 30, 40 people <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> knew who they were." [...] An editorial in The Daily News Journal in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, said the plot emphasized a dark undercurrent of racism still alive in the United States, but said their chances [...] of actually killing Obama were [...] "almost nil. Their plot was so disorganized they appear to be candidates for 'dumb criminals,' not calculating assassins." ...|$|E
500|$|... "This Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Jepsen, Kelly Covell, Matthew Koma, and Stefan Kendal Gordy, also known as Redfoo from electropop duo LMFAO, through e-mails, text {{messaging}} and telephone calls. Jepsen explained that she had [...] "never written a song that way before so I'd definitely say it was new," [...] adding that [...] "there was something really exciting about being {{on the phone and}} singing ideas to each other and then calling each other back and re-writing lyrics in your BlackBerry and iPhone and seeing it all being exchanged." [...] The singer also revealed that she was pleased with the creative process of the song, commenting that [...] "despite all this craziness, [...] remains the same. And that same exciting feeling that I had <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> knew me, when I was just beginning to work on 'Call Me Maybe', is the same feeling I had today with Redfoo from LMFAO. You can sense the people who really have it are about writing that right word or that right melody to make it lift and make you feel that perfect emotion." [...] "This Kiss" [...] was recorded at Party Rock Studio with Redfoo in 2012 after Redfoo recorded ideas at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza, Spain, and was released as the second single from Kiss on September 10, 2012. [...] "This Kiss" [...] is a mid-tempo dance-pop track which lyrically speaks about a kiss being something Jepsen can't resist and the lips of her beloved, featuring lyrics such as [...] "This kiss is something I can't resist/ Your lips are undeniable/This kiss is something I can't risk/Your heart is unreliable" [...] during the chorus. Carl Williot of Idolator compared the lyrics to the ones of Hall & Oates' [...] "Kiss on My List" [...] (1981).|$|E
6000|$|Amelius was obstinate; {{he went on}} {{with what}} he had to say. [...] "I should like to know," [...] he proceeded, [...] "that I am doing no wrong to <b>anybody,</b> <b>before</b> I give you my promise?" ...|$|R
60|$|Seiah {{looked at}} him again inquiringly. She had never <b>before</b> met <b>anybody</b> so curious, she fancied. 'Aren't you afraid of being seen sitting with me like this,' she said, 'on the Embankment benches? Some of your fine friends might come by and wonder who on earth you had got here with you.' And, indeed, Selah's dress had grown vory shabby and poor-looking during a long and often fruitless search for casual work or {{employment}} in London.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Helvanoise {{is furious}} {{to learn that}} Iris has been flirting with Rolandyl. King Paul tells Cynthia about her betrothal, and when she begins to cry, he gives her an [...] "extra special sweet" [...] {{to make her feel}} better. King Utops of Utopia arrives, {{accompanied}} by Mandamus and the Kings Bodyguard. Princess Cynthia is presented to him, and when he tries to kiss her hand, Charmis interrupts him and informs him that he must get a license <b>before</b> kissing <b>anybody.</b>|$|R
500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{with a number of}} honorific nicknames. She has been compared to American recording artist Madonna in many media outlets, with Madonna identified as Queen of Pop and Minogue as the Princess of Pop. Birmingham Post said in 2000; [...] "nce upon a time, long <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> had even heard of Britney, Christina, Jessica or Mandy, Australian singer Kylie Minogue ruled the charts as princess of pop. Back in 1988 her first single, I Should Be So Lucky, spent five weeks at number one, making her the most successful female artist in the UK charts with 13 successive Top 10 entries." [...] She is sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Pop/Pop Goddess. She has also been dubbed a Disco Queen. William Baker, co-author of her book , talking about her song [...] "Better the Devil You Know", commented, [...] "The track transferred well onto the dance-floor and heralded a long reign for Kylie as the new queen of disco... a pop princess." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic reviewed her box-set [...] and stated [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." [...] In November 2011, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Many celebrities have named Minogue as a role model. Many media outlets have said many people, particularly woman, have undergone regular checks for cancer symptoms since her breast cancer diagnosis. In December 2006, Sugar named her the Most Inspirational Celebrity as voted by teenage girls. Editor of the magazine Annabel Brog stated, [...] " [...] couldn't be any more inspirational. She's friendly, gorgeous, talented – and this year she's shown just how strong she is too." [...] Television host Giuliana Rancic cited Minogue's cancer story as [...] "inspirational" [...] when she too was diagnosed with cancer. She said, [...] "When you get diagnosed, you don't know what to do… you Google. I went online and I read your story, and it gave me the strength to go public as well." [...] Musical entertainers who have cited Minogue as an influence include September, Diana Vickers, Paris Hilton, and The Veronicas.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Laudrup: [...] "My brother {{started as}} an {{attacker}} but became an elegant attacking midfielder, {{perhaps the most}} complete there has ever been. His vision, speed of thought and passing were on a different level; he always {{knew what was going}} to happen <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> else did. If anyone had a 'football brain', it was him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 May 1950, the Pope again sent {{a message}} to the people of Portugal {{regarding}} Fátima: [...] "May Portugal never forget the heavenly message of Fátima, which, <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> else she was blessed to hear. To keep Fátima in your heart and to translate Fátima into deeds, is the best guarantee for ever more graces". In numerous additional messages, and in his encyclicals Fulgens corona (1953), and Ad Caeli Reginam (1954), Pius XII encouraged the veneration of the Virgin in Fátima.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have had}} no {{intercourse}} with anybody, sir. I came here last Friday, and I hadn't spoken a word to <b>anybody</b> <b>before</b> that. I didn't know that Caldigate had been in trouble at all. My people at Pollington {{were the first to}} tell me about it.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed even}} prettier than last night, in her simple white morning dress, a mere {{ordinary}} English gown, without affectation of any sort, yet touched with some faint reminiscence of a flowing Greek chiton. Its half-classical drapery exactly suited the severe regularity of her pensive features and her graceful figure. Alan {{thought as he}} looked at her he had never <b>before</b> seen <b>anybody</b> who appeared at all points so nearly to approach his ideal of womanhood. She was at once so high in type, so serene, so tranquil, and yet so purely womanly.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Sarrazin's {{professional}} experience {{of women and}} marriages failed to supply him with an answer. In this difficulty he exerted his imagination, and invented something that no woman ever did yet. [...] "She's waiting," [...] he said, [...] "to see how her marriage succeeds, <b>before</b> she tells <b>anybody</b> about it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Brando {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as a 'bad boy' for his public outbursts and antics. According to Los Angeles magazine, [...] "Brando was rock and roll <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> knew what rock and roll was." [...] His behavior during the filming of Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) seemed to bolster his reputation as a difficult star. He was blamed for a change in director and a runaway budget, though he disclaimed responsibility for either. On June 12, 1973, Brando broke paparazzo Ron Galella's jaw. Galella had followed Brando, who was accompanied by talk show host Dick Cavett, after a taping of The Dick Cavett Show in New York City. He reportedly paid a $40,000 out-of-court settlement and suffered an infected hand as a result. Galella wore a football helmet the next time he photographed Brando at a gala benefiting the American Indians Development Association.|$|E
2500|$|The SS Roamar was {{the next}} to be sunk. A 110-ton schooner, the Roamar belonged to a Colombian diplomat, and her sinking off San Andres by [...] on July 21, 1942, gave Colombia the {{political}} grounds to declare war on Germany. The Germans knew that Colombia was still neutral at this time, so they opted to sink the Roamar quickly, <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> could find out. Accordingly, the Germans fired only two shots before the ship was reduced to [...] "nothing but splintered debris." [...] U-505s engineer, Hans Goebeler, said the following about the incident: [...] "We couldn't leave the evidence [...] floating around, so we sank her with the deck gun." [...] This was not the last ship sunk by the Germans during Colombia's neutrality period. On the very next day, the U-505 sank the 153-ton Urious in the same area, killing thirteen of the Colombian sailors on board.|$|E
2500|$|Selig's {{testimony}} {{on the subject}} has been contradictory. [...] In 2005, Selig told reporters, [...] "I never even heard about them [...] until 1998 or 1999. [...] I ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and I never heard any comment from them. [...] It wasn't until 1998 or ’99 that I heard the discussion." [...] But a year later, testifying to Congress in 2006, Selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early: [...] "In 1994, <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> was really talking about steroids in baseball, we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the MLBPA. [...] As early as 1998, I began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing substances from the game." [...] During the 1988 ALCS, Oakland's Jose Canseco had been repeatedly taunted by Boston fans with a chant of [...] "ster-oids, ster-oids, ster-oids." [...] Speaking at the 2013 All-Star Game, Selig complained, [...] "People say, ‘Well, you were slow to react.’ We were not slow to react. In fact, I heard that this morning, and it aggravated me all over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe I'm in love. I've {{got it in}} the neck, {{only the}} feeling is really lower down. He's a second cousin-such a child, about six months older and ten years younger than I am. Boys always {{fall in love with}} their seniors, and girls with their juniors or with old men of forty. Don't laugh, but his eyes are the truest things I ever saw; and he's quite divinely silent! We had a most romantic first meeting in London under the Vospovitch Juno. And now he's {{sleeping}} in the next room and the moonlight's on the blossom; and to-morrow morning, <b>before</b> <b>anybody's</b> awake, we're going to walk off into Down fairyland. There's a feud between our families, which makes it really exciting. Yes! and I may have to use subterfuge and come on you for invitations--if so, you'll know why! My father doesn't want us to know each other, but I can't help that. Life's too short. He's got the most beautiful mother, with lovely silvery hair and a young face with dark eyes. I'm staying with his sister--who married my cousin; it's all mixed up, but I mean to pump her to-morrow. We've often talked about love being a spoil-sport; well, that's all tosh, it's the beginning of sport, and the sooner you feel it, my dear, the better for you.|$|R
60|$|Elfride, {{learning}} Knight more thoroughly, perceived that, {{far from}} having a notion of Stephen's precedence, {{he had no idea}} that she had ever been wooed <b>before</b> by <b>anybody.</b> On ordinary occasions she had a tongue so frank as to show her whole mind, and a mind so straightforward as to reveal her heart to its innermost shrine. But the time for a change had come. She never alluded to even a knowledge of Knight's friend. When women are secret they are secret indeed; and more often than not they only begin to be secret with the advent of a second lover.|$|R
60|$|Villa Kennan, with {{a pang of}} {{disappointment}} at such rebuff, forwent her overtures for the moment, and listened to what tale Jacob Henderson could tell of his dog. Harry Del Mar, a trained-animal man, had picked the dog up somewhere on the Pacific Coast, most probably in San Francisco, she learned; but, having taken the dog east with him, Harry Del Mar had died by accident in New York <b>before</b> telling <b>anybody</b> anything about the animal. That was all, except that Henderson had paid two thousand dollars to one Harris Collins, and had found the investment the finest he had ever made.|$|R
2500|$|... "Buffalo Chips was {{standing}} opposite me. [...] He {{was one of}} those long-haired scouts, and claimed to be a partner of Buffalo Bill’s. [...] He {{thought it was a good}} place to make name for himself, I suppose, for he told Big Bat that he was going to have one of the Indians’ scalps. [...] He had no more than got the words out of his mouth before he yelled, [...] "My God, I am shot." [...] I heard this cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where the Indians were hiding. [...] Bat was looking into the cave where the Indians were, and about five seconds afterwards jumped out with an Indian’s scalp in his hand, telling me that he had scalped one of the redskins alive, which I found out to be true. [...] He had seen the Indian that killed Buffalo Chips, and he jumped down onto him as the Indian was reaching to get White’s six-shooter. [...] Bat had jumped right down on top of him and scalped him and got out of the cave <b>before</b> <b>anybody</b> knew what he was doing." [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] White was a boyhood friend of Col. Cody and also a scout. He wanted to be like Buffalo Bill and acquired the sobriquet [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] when Gen. Phillip Sheridan said he was more like Buffalo Chips than Buffalo Bill. Major Bourke described him as a [...] "good-natured liar who played Sancho Panza to Buffalo Bill’s Don Quixote." [...] Gen.
