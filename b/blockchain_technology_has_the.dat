Besides the initial experiment or data acquisition, all remaining parts of the research cycle could take place within a blockchain system.

Currently, scientists must be trusted to provide a true and useful representation of their research results in their final publication; blockchain would make much larger parts of the research cycle open to scientific self-correction.

40|$|Industries and {{old ways}} of doing {{business}} have been reshaped or become entirely obsolete due to the new digitalization trends. The current technology to truly revolutionize and disrupt especially industries that rely on trust, such as the financial sector, is the blockchain technology. The core idea of this technol-ogy {{is that it is}} a public, shared and tamperproof ledger that allows people who do not know or even trust in each other to share information in a trustworthy ledger, where any sorts of immaterial infor-mation of value can be stored. This thesis is a literature review that provides a theoretical framework to examine how the blockchain technology affects particularly the financial sector. As this thesis acknowledges, the <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> ability to enhance efficiency, increase transparency, reduce risks when less assets are tied up during transactions and reduce expenditures, such as transaction costs in the financial sector. One of the most ambitious application of the blockchain technology is smart contracts, but there are other applications as well that can benefit the financial sec-tor. The technology has great potential to disrupt the current financial system, but since the technology is still in its initial stage of development, it is too early to say what the blockchain technology will exactly enable. The most extreme hypothesis is that the blockchain technology makes banks unnecessary. How-ever, this thesis argues that the financial institutions are more likely to take advantage of the blockchain technology than to become obsolete because of it. ...|$|E

40|$|The surging {{interest}} in <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> revitalized <b>the</b> search for effective Byzantine consensus schemes. In particular, <b>the</b> blockchain community <b>has</b> {{been looking for}} ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing various financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions. However, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their $O(n^ 2) $ message complexity. In this paper, we propose FastBFT, the fastest and most scalable BFT protocol to-date. At the heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret sharing primitives. Combining this technique with several other optimizations (i. e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT achieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks. Via systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that FastBFT has better scalability and performance than previous BFT protocols. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{technological}} {{revolution of}} digital and online computing {{combined with the}} information revolution {{paved the way for}} the emergence of innovations to reshape existing industries and the way we think about traditional services. Even one of the most traditional industries, the financial sector, is being actively disrupted through fintech and the sharing economy. Innovations such as mobile banking, peer-to-peer lending or crowdfunding are challenging existing models and practices. This paper aims to show that <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> potential to transform equity markets by offering valuable opportunities to create new products to overcome existing inefficiencies and frictions. The blockchain was first introduced as the technology behind the bitcoin cryptocurrency, and is a trustless, decentralized and secure ledger. It provides an unprecedented way to monitor and execute transactions with no need for intermediaries, and to keep a tamper-proof record of these transactions. This breakthrough technology has gradually gained traction and is now being explored far beyond the scope of bitcoin projects. Even traditional big players in the financial industry are looking for ways to benefit from the blockchain: Nasdaq launched Nasdaq Linq, a blockchain-based equity platform for private companies, and 42 international banks came together to join the R 3 consortium to explore blockchain's opportunities. by Mélodie Lamarque.

30|$|The {{emergence}} of cryptocurrencies {{has important implications}} for the global economy in general and emerging economies in particular. For instance, a study by Carrick (2016) argued that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have idiosyncratic features that make them suitable and complementary to the currencies of emerging markets. Furthermore, the risk to Bitcoin technologies can also be minimized and concomitantly, cryptocurrencies have an important role to play in emerging economies. Similarly, on the importance of Bitcoin, Polasik et al. (2015) highlighted the importance of Bitcoin for eCommerce and argued that {{it has the potential to}} play a significant role. A study by Pazaitis et al. (2017) argued that the bitcoin (<b>blockchain)</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> potential to enable a new system of value that will better support the dynamics of social sharing. Similarly, from the technological as well economic perspective, Goertzel et al. (2017) argued that blockchain technologies are useful in terms of transparency, humanizing global economic interaction, emotional resonance, and maximization of economic gain. Contrarily, some contemporary studies, for instance, Corbet et al. (2017), investigated the fundamental drivers of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) price behavior and reported that there are clear periods of bubble behavior; furthermore, as it stands, Bitcoin is in the bubble phase. Similarly, Jiang (2017) reported the existence of long-term memory and inefficiency in the Bitcoin market. Alvarez-Ramirez et al. (2018) analyzed the long-range correlation and informational efficiency of the Bitcoin market. They reported that the Bitcoin market exhibits periods of efficiency alternating with periods where the price dynamics are driven by anti-persistence. However, Bariviera et al. (2017), compared the dynamics of Bitcoin and standard currencies and focused on the analysis of returns using different time scales. They found that Hurst exponents changed significantly during the first years of Bitcoin’s existence, tending to stabilize in recent times. A later study by Bouri et al. (2018) reported that the global financial stress index could be useful for predicting Bitcoin returns. Nonetheless, in the debate (or controversy) around cryptocurrencies, important factors that have been fairly underappreciated are their determinants and predictability. On this aspect, a study by Feng et al. (2017) reported evidence of informed trading in the Bitcoin market prior to large events, which led them to argue that informed trading could be helpful in explaining Bitcoin behavior; however, this area requires further exploration, which is the objective of the current study.|$|E

30|$|Blockchain, {{regarded}} as a powerful weapon to settle privacy and reliability concerns {{in the era of}} IoT [54, 55], can be employed to automate and record the communications between MGMCs in a cyber-secure manner. In principle, blockchain is a type of secure chronological database technology that maintains a continuously growing list of data records (i.e., blocks) secured by cryptographic signatures [56]. The database {{in the form of a}} blockchain is guaranteed to be verifiable, auditable, and immutable. In fact, <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>have</b> already proven their merits in trustless peer-to-peer financial services that rely on Bitcoin [57] or other cryptocurrencies created with similar mechanisms.|$|R

30|$|Relating to this principle, <b>the</b> <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> {{extended}} its use cases by integrating fully programmable functions, using graph-like structures {{instead of a}} single chain, or providing possibilities for access control (permissioned blockchains).

This way, the DLT developed from being solely a technology for digital currencies, but can be used to store any kind of information, including executable computer code as smart contracts that are executed once certain defined conditions apply.|$|R
30|$|Smart {{contracts}} {{are considered the}} silver bullet needed by the blockchain for automating microgrid interactions. The public blockchain platform, Ethereum [61], provides a built-in Turing-complete language (which is proved to solve any problem exactly if provided with sufficient time and storage space) for programming automated applications based on smart contracts. In practice, smart contract-aided <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>have</b> shown disruptive potentials for securing decentralized energy management in ADN [62, 63]. A real-life peer-to-peer market for renewable energy trading was experimented in New York in April 2016, where the excess energy produced by solar panels was recorded securely on blockchain and traded with neighboring residents automatically via smart contracts. Accordingly, the integration of smart contracts with <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> presents a promising ADN strategy for optimizing and automating decentralized energy management (i.e., effected by MGMCs), while preserving the integrity and trustworthiness of data exchanges among MGMCs.|$|R

30|$|Recently, <b>the</b> <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> infused new {{hopes of}} decentralisation, {{promising}} to transform finance, money and even governments [1, 2].

The tremendous interest attracted by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies {{in the last few}} years show the potential impact of such a technology. However, the current debate on centralisation versus decentralisation often overlooks the complexity of the socio-technical ecology we inhabit, and the fact that it is ultimately dominated by human behaviour.

30|$|The {{distributed}} {{nature in}} a service relationship between technology and organization {{is an important}} aspect of the computing of blockchain-based sharing services. Distributed computing and distributed algorithms allow democratized nodes in a blockchain to reach a consensus. In a distributed system, different nodes need to prove that they are working toward the same goal and ensure consistency. Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto proposed the proof of work (POW) mechanism to create distributed consensus in a process of repeatedly running hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions, or so-called bitcoin mining (Nakamoto 2008). According to IBM (IBM 2015), adopting distributed computing to process hundreds of billions of IoT transactions that occur daily can significantly reduce costs associated with installing and maintaining large amounts of centralized data; thus, <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> democratized devices in terms of distributed computing, which will ensure the future of the IoT.|$|R

In fact, blockchain-based organizing and <b>the</b> resulting DAOs <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to replace centralized intermediaries in other applications requiring complex coordination such as asset ownership tracking, trade financing, digital identity provision, supply chain traceability, and more. Besides, in the last 3  years, more than 50 new ventures received seed funding using blockchain-powered “initial coin offerings”, thereby bypassing, at least partly, the use of venture capitalist intermediaries to obtain funding faster and at more favorable valuations (e.g., in 2014, Ethereum raised $ 18.4 million {{in a few days}} and is now valued at $ 34 billion). DAOs are on the rise, and it is an exciting time for management and organizational scholars to address this emerging phenomenon with new theory and solid empirical research.|$|R

In recent years, <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.

We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them.

The owner of a Slock can set a deposit amount and a price for renting his property, and a customer can pay the deposit through a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain to get permission to open and close the Slock. With Slock.it, locks are controlled by automatically executing business contracts in the blockchain, and businesses such as renting Airbnb apartments can become fully automated.|$|R
