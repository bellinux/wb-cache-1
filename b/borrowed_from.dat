40|$|When {{a central}} bank {{implements}} the LOLR policy in a financial crisis, bank creditors often infer a bank's quality from {{whether or not it}} <b>borrows</b> <b>from</b> the central bank. We establish a formal model to study the optimal LOLR policy in the presence of this signaling effect, assuming that the central bank aims to encourage central bank borrowing to avoid inefficiencies caused by contagion. In our model, {{there are two types of}} banks: a high quality type with high expected asset returns and a low quality type with lower returns. Both types of banks need to roll over their short-term debts. A central bank offers to lend to both types of banks. After private creditors observe whether banks <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> the central bank, banks try to <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> the private market. We find that there may exist a separating equilibrium where only low quality banks <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> the central bank; and two pooling equilibria where both types of banks do and do not <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> the central bank. Our major results are as follows: (1) Considering the signaling effect, the central bank should set its lending rate lower than the prevailing market rate to induce both types of banks to <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> the central bank. (2) Hiding the identity of banks <b>borrowing</b> <b>from</b> the central bank will encourage banks to <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> the central bank. (3) The central bank may serve as a coordinator for the realization of its favored equilibrium...|$|R

It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E

Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E

The Pan-African colors are <b>borrowed</b> <b>from</b> the Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. Green on some African flags represents the natural richness of Africa.|$|E

Giacometti had employed the device in The Nose (1947) and The Cage (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators. Writing on their use in Fragment, Zweite mentions that the diagonal lines transform the cross into a guillotine.|$|E
