5|$|An English folk tale {{tells how}} an old woman, a {{supposed}} witch, cursed her landlord {{and all his}} possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse. The toad was thrown into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. <b>By</b> <b>next</b> day, both toad and witch had died, and {{it was found that}} the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.|$|E
5|$|Hitmaker {{had tried}} to develop an on-line version of Crazy Taxi, to be called Crazy Taxi Next {{exclusively}} for the Xbox, which, besides multiplayer game modes, would have included night and day cycles, each with {{a different set of}} passengers and destinations, while reusing and graphically updating the maps from Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2. Ultimately, both multiplayer and day/night cycles were dropped and work on Crazy Taxi Next was transferred to Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller, which included some of the nighttime driving concepts suggested <b>by</b> <b>Next.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lemmings {{was one of}} the best-received {{video games}} of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was {{considered}} the eighth-greatest game of all time <b>by</b> <b>Next</b> Generation in 1996. Lemmings {{is also one of the}} most widely ported and best-selling video games, and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games.|$|E

The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were accidental, others a deliberate act of vengeance, and still others that the retreating Confederates burned bales of cotton {{on their way out}} of town.|$|E
5|$|The first college {{football}} game in Oklahoma Territory occurred on November 7, 1895 when the 'Oklahoma City Terrors' defeated the Oklahoma Sooners 34 to 0. The Terrors were {{a mix of}} Methodist college students and high schoolers. The Sooners did not manage a single first down. <b>By</b> <b>next</b> season, Oklahoma coach John A. Harts had left to prospect for gold in the Arctic. Organized football was first played in the territory on November 29, 1894 between the Oklahoma City Terrors and Oklahoma City High School. The high school won 24 to 0.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{continued}} {{to defy the}} Senate <b>by</b> <b>next</b> appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine in that state. Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination {{by a vote of}} 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated. Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.|$|E

As of 2007, it grossed to Â¥1.22 billion ($10.8 million) in the Japanese box office. It became the seventh most popular anime film released in Japan during 2005. In a theatrical chart from the same year, Conqueror of Shamballa ranked as the seventh best anime film from 2005, and as the 47th best film in overall.|$|E
5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle <b>by</b> <b>next</b> examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|Xgrid's {{original}} concept can {{be traced}} back to Zilla.app, found in the OPENSTEP operating system, created <b>by</b> <b>NeXT</b> in the late 1980s. Zilla was the first distributed computing program released on an end-user operating system and which used the idle screen-saver motif, a design feature since found in widely used projects such as Seti@Home and Distributed.net. Zilla won the national Computerworld Smithsonian Award (Science Category) in 1991 for ease of use and good design. Apple acquired Zilla, along with the rest of NeXT, in 1997 and later used Zilla as inspiration for Xgrid. The first beta version of Xgrid was released in January 2004.|$|E
