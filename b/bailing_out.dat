5|$|So many South Vietnamese {{helicopters}} {{landed on}} the TF76 ships that some 45 UH-1 Hueys {{and at least one}} CH-47 Chinook were pushed overboard to make room for more helicopters to land. Other helicopters dropped off their passengers and were then ditched into the sea by their pilots, close to the ships, their pilots <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats.|$|E
5|$|Only {{later did}} Pflanz {{find out that}} it was Wick he saw <b>bailing</b> <b>out.</b> Göring had ordered Kriegsmarine torpedo boats on a night-long search-and-rescue mission for Wick. The next day, other naval vessels and the Seenotdienst (air-sea rescue) service, escorted by fighters of JG2, {{continued}} in vain to search for him. He was never found, however, and the Luftwaffe declared him missing in action, presumed dead, on 4 December 1940, earning him his last reference in the daily Wehrmachtbericht. Wick, on his 168th combat mission, was the first Oak Leaves recipient to lose his life in combat.|$|E

5|$|The Brillanten (Diamonds) were {{presented}} by Hitler at the Wolfsschanze, near Kętrzyn (German: Rastenburg) on 19October1943. Nowotny immediately {{went on a}} short vacation to Vienna before returning to his front-line unit. On 29October1943, Nowotny presented the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to Oberfeldwebel Otto Kittel. In the days following, Nowotny flew as wingman to Karl Schnörrer, helping him accumulate further victories. On 11November, Anton Döbele was killed when he rammed an Il-2 Sturmovik. The next day, 12November1943, Schnörrer was severely injured after <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> at low altitude. Schnörrer was replaced as Nowotny's wingman by Unteroffizier Ernst Richter. With Richter, Nowotny claimed his final two aerial victories on the Eastern Front on 15November1943. In total, Nowotny had claimed 255confirmed kills plus a further 50unconfirmed, before he was taken off combat duty.|$|E
5|$|The {{capitulation}} of Italy {{also brought}} with it the real threat of an invasion by the Allies of the Dalmatian coast. As a result, on 9 September, orders were received by 1./(Kroat.)KG to execute two coastal reconnaissance sorties over the central and south Adriatic each morning and afternoon. On 10 October one of its Dornier Do 17Zs was intercepted by eight Spitfire Mk.VIII fighters of No. 92 Squadron RAF near the coast of Italy. All of the fighters made firing passes on the Dornier, which was shot down, the crew <b>bailing</b> <b>out.</b> One Spitfire was hit by return fire and crashed into the sea, killing its pilot. After this, reconnaissance sorties were confined to {{the vicinity of the}} Dalmatian coast.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{probably}} {{was hit by}} a Bf 109 flown by Müncheberg himself—the German fighter leader had reported his 26th victory as a Hurricane with the pilot <b>bailing</b> <b>out.</b> He was the only British pilot to bail out in the battle. The Hurricane crashed near Addolorata Cemetery near Paola. MacLachlan remained in hospital with a severely wounded left arm. He was pumped with saline solution to prevent blood clotting but his arm was too badly damaged and it was amputated below the elbow. His determination and reputation was as such, the nurses and squadron were already taking bets on whether or not he would return to action within a fortnight {{on the day of the}} operation. While in hospital he began speaking with Luigi Armanino, the pilot he had shot down days earlier. Among the topics of discussion were strengths of the Italian aircraft and Armanino's exploits piloting CR.42s during the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions <b>bailed</b> <b>out</b> of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that <b>bailed</b> <b>out</b> were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas <b>bailed</b> <b>out</b> after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters {{have the ability to}} <b>bail</b> <b>out.</b> After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v.

5|$|Nine days later, Hurricanes, {{escorted by}} a pair of Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, flew a patrol over the island of Rab and {{adjacent}} areas of the Adriatic, but were unable to positively identify any targets. On 4 November, aircraft from No. 351 Squadron, again escorted by two Spitfires, were tasked with interdicting road communications between Bihać and Knin. One aircraft developed engine trouble and had to return to base, but the rest continued with the mission. They ran into heavy anti-aircraft fire near Knin, and one aircraft was shot down, the pilot <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> and being captured by the Germans. The next mission, on 9 November, was hampered by extremely poor weather over the target area near Trebinje. One aircraft flew into a mountain, killing the pilot, and another suffered engine trouble and crash-landed near Trebinje, the pilot escaping unhurt.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wesley Rackstraw is {{a retired}} pilot and ex-convict who served on an army {{helicopter}} crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He {{came to the attention}} of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested in Iran and deported to the U.S. to face explosive possession and check kiting charges. Several months later, while released on bail, Rackstraw attempted to fake his own death by radioing a false mayday call and telling controllers that he was <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> of a rented plane over Monterey Bay. Police later arrested him in Fullerton on an additional charge of forging federal pilot licenses; the plane he claimed to have ditched was found, repainted, in a nearby hangar. Cooper investigators noted his physical resemblance to Cooper composite sketches (although he was only 28 in 1971), military parachute training, and criminal record, but eliminated him as a suspect in 1979 after no direct evidence of his involvement could be found.|$|E
5|$|With Yerkes as chairman, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was {{established}} in 1902 with a capitalisation of £5million, the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which, by 1903, raised a total of £18million (£ today) to be used across all of the UERL's projects. Yerkes died in December 1905, and Speyer took his place {{as chairman of the}} UERL. By 1907, the three new railways had opened and the electrification works had been completed. Despite the UERL's engineering success in carrying out the works in such a short time, the company was in a difficult financial position. The preliminary estimates of passenger numbers proved to be over optimistic and revenues were not covering operating costs. After <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> the company, Speyer, with Managing Director Albert Stanley, struggled {{for a number of years}} to restore its finances. This was finally achieved with the purchase of the London General Omnibus Company in 1912, as its profits could be used to offset losses elsewhere in the group. In November 1912, Speyer further consolidated the UERL's control of London's underground railways when he negotiated the purchase of London's two other main tube railways, the City and South London Railway and the Central London Railway.|$|E

5|$|Page and MacLachlan flew to No. 96 Squadron RAF {{which was}} then flying de Havilland Mosquito night fighters. He {{requested}} his old gunner, Les Davies, who now piloted Mosquitos to join them. Davies accepted but MacLachlan was killed before he could take up the offer. MacLachlan and Page flew to Tangmere on 15 July. On his next mission on 18 July 1943 MacLachlan's Mustang FD442 was probably hit by ground fire when crossing the French coast near Dieppe. Page noticed MacLachlan's Mustang suddenly pull up sharply from their tree-top height by about 1,000 feet. He saw MacLachlan pull back the canopy but apparently {{changed his mind about}} <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> as the aircraft leveled out and descended. The Mustang then headed towards a small field. MacLachaln touched down three-quarters the way across and the Mustang ploughed into an orchard at the field's edge which ripped off the wings. Page orbited the crash site several times and considered landing to rescue him but the space was too confined. Page dived at the wreck and took gun-camera footage but could see no signs of life and then headed home. The Operations Record was unable to determine the cause of the crash. MacLachlan made no radio broadcast. It was possibly the result of enemy small-arms fire or mechanical failure. On 30 July MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} the October meeting, JG50 was disbanded and its {{personnel}} absorbed into I./Jagdgeschwader 301, a Wilde Sau night-fighter unit. While operational, JG 50 had claimed 45 Allied four-engined bombers. Graf was promoted to Oberst (Colonel) and on 11 November, appointed Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of JG11, when Mader was transferred to JG54 in the Leningrad sector. Aside from Grislawski, who was kept on as Staka (the squadron commander) of 1./ JG1, he managed to take his soccer players and friends with him. Sunday 20 February marked the start of ”Big Week” – six consecutive days of concentrated bombing by the USAAF designed to overwhelm the German defences. JG11 was heavily involved and Graf shot down a B-24 Liberator for his 208th victory on the 24 February. His 209th aerial victory, west of Berlin on 6 March, was over another B-24 Liberator, of the 453d Bombardment Group. It was actually an Herausschuss (separation shot) – a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from its combat box and which the Luftwaffe counted as an aerial victory. On 29 March, Graf shot down two P-51 Mustangs that were making a fighter sweep ahead of their bomber stream. Chased and harried {{by the rest of}} their squadron, he tried to ram another before <b>bailing</b> <b>out.</b> Landing heavily, he broke both knees and fractured his arm. These would prove to be his final air victories. Prompt attention from the JG11 medic saved Graf from losing his arm. From April to early July he spent time recovering in a hospital in his home-town of Engen. On June 24, he married Jobst, whom he had been seeing over the past year.|$|E
5|$|In December, UN Command {{temporarily}} switched some of {{the responsibilities}} of Task Element 95.11 and the US Fifth Air Force. Consequently, Sydney was required to provide air support for convoys between Japan and Korea amongst the other duties of her fifth patrol, which commenced on 7 December. On 8 December, a second RAN pilot was killed; although successfully <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> from a flak-damaged Sea Fury, {{he was struck by}} the tail of his own aircraft, and died from wounds. Four other aircraft were damaged that day. Clear weather, which lasted until 14 December, allowed the carrier to maintain a high rate of attack against North Korean troop concentrations, railways, and coastal vessels, while providing air cover for the Task Element. Ending on 18 December, the fifth patrol was the most costly to Sydneys CAG, with one pilot killed, five aircraft destroyed, and another 25 aircraft heavily damaged. The carrier was in Kure for Christmas, and relieved USS Badoeng Strait on 27 December, the start of her sixth patrol. The remaining days of 1951 were spent providing air cover in the Inchon area for both UN ground forces and supply convoys returning to Japan. On New Year's Day 1952, Sydneys aircraft helped repel the North Korean invasion of the island of Yongho Do. The third RAN pilot to be lost in Korea died on 2 January while performing a combat air patrol around the carrier; personnel on the flight deck saw the aircraft fly into a cloud, but not emerge. No wreckage was found, and it was assumed that the plane dived into the Yellow Sea. For most of the patrol, RAN aircraft attacked artillery emplacements and concentrations of junks in the Cho Do-Sok To area, while also proving air support for South Korean Army and irregular forces.|$|E
