5|$|These types {{would now}} all <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> {{peculiar}} Type II supernovae, of which many more examples have been discovered, {{although it is}} still debated whether SN 1961V was a true supernova following an LBV outburst or an impostor.|$|E
5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{capitulation}} agreement, the Polish Home Army {{soldiers were}} to <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> regular POWs and the civilians of Warsaw evacuated.

5|$|Two other taxa that Czerkas and his co-authors named <b>were</b> later <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> junior {{synonyms}} {{by other}} authors. Czerkas' Cryptovolans <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> Microraptor, and his Scansoriopteryx <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> Epidendrosaurus. Czerkas described Omnivoropteryx, noting {{that it was}} similar to Sapeornis. Later specimens of Sapeornis with skulls demonstrated that the two were probably synonymous.|$|R
5|$|At least 150 {{black women}} were lynched between 1880 and 1965 in the American South. Historian Kerry Segrave {{highlights}} 115 recorded cases between 1851 and 1946. Ninety of the 115 were black, 19 white, and six Hispanic or uncertain. Women were usually not lynched alone, but tended to <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> accomplices {{of men who}} were being lynched. Of 97 incidents examined by Segrave, 36 were of women lynched alone.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} age of tournaments had ended, and {{physical}} crests largely disappeared. Their illustrated equivalents consequently began to <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> simply two-dimensional pictures. Many crests from this period are physically impossible to bear on a helm, e.g. the crest granted to Sir Francis Drake in 1581, which consisted of a disembodied hand issuing from clouds and leading a ship around the globe (representing God's guidance).|$|E
5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, they should not <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong {{because it is not}} empirical.|$|E
5000|$|The syntax for {{expressions}} let the {{multiplication operator}} be omitted, e.g. [...] <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> , and [...] <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> [...] if [...] {{was not an}} array.

5|$|During the 2003-04 NBA season, Webber {{was on the}} {{disabled}} list until February. When he returned, the NBA suspended him for three games for his guilty plea. In September 2005, Judge Edmunds ruled that the conviction should <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> a misdemeanor and that Webber should pay the maximum fine for such an offense, which was $100,000. This ruling came after Webber served 330 hours of public service and accumulated $78,000 of related out-of-pocket expenses.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1997, the Supreme Court {{delivered}} {{an order}} that since the award had not been officially conferred, it cannot be revoked and declared that the press communiqué <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> cancelled.

5000|$|Both {{approaches}} (via the Hilbert space, and via the Radon-Nikodym derivative) <b>treat</b> g <b>as</b> an {{equivalence class}} of functions; two functions g and g′ <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> equivalent, if g (X) = g′ (X) almost surely. Accordingly, the conditional probability P ( [...] Y ≤ 1/3 | X [...] ) <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> an equivalence class of random variables; as usual, two random variables <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> equivalent {{if they are}} equal almost surely.|$|R

5|$|Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 49 days to germinate. In the absence of further {{information}} specific to B.epica, George recommends that cultivated plants <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> for B.media and B.praemorsa, both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate only light pruning not below the green foliage.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{astronomy}} uses radiation {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter. Radio astronomy {{is different from}} most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Research in {{the early}} 2000s {{combining}} the use of phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences and more traditional morphology-based characters {{has resulted in a}} reshuffling of the species concept in Gomphus; as a result, G.clavatus is considered the only Gomphus species in North America. Comparison of the DNA sequences of species Gomphus brevipes and Gomphus truncatus has shown them to be genetically identical to G.clavatus, and they may <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> synonyms.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes {{in vitro}} {{fertilisation}} (IVF), saying that the artificial process replaces the love between a husband and wife. In addition, it opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who must <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> such. For this reason, the church also opposes abortion.|$|E
5|$|Some places, (for example, the Altiplano in Peru and Bolivia, or {{the plateau}} around Asmara (where the airport is) in Eritrea, and some {{mountain}} passes), are many thousand {{feet above sea}} level and travelling to such places after diving at lower altitude should <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> flying at the equivalent altitude after diving.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the {{taxonomy}} of the genus, {{as the number of}} accepted species varies from 13 to 30. The five domesticated species are Cucurbita argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.maxima, C.moschata, and C.pepo. All of these can <b>be</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> winter squash because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months; however, C.pepo includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.|$|E
50|$|In {{the logic}} of prophetic {{self-declaration}}s, a genuine prophecy <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> divine and infallible.

50|$|Density {{functional}} theory {{seeks to}} solve for an approximate {{form of the}} electronic density of a system. In general, atoms are split into ionic cores and valence electrons.
