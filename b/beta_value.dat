40|$|Background: The {{analysis}} of DNA methylation {{is a key}} component {{in the development of}} personalized treatment approaches. A common way to measure DNA methylation is the calculation of <b>beta</b> <b>values,</b> which are bounded variables of the form M = (M + U) that are generated by Illumina's 450 k BeadChip array. The statistical {{analysis of}} <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> is considered to be challenging, as traditional methods for the analysis of bounded variables, such as M-value regression and beta regression, are based on regularity assumptions that are often too strong to adequately describe the distribution of <b>beta</b> <b>values.</b> Results: We develop a statistical model for the analysis of <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> that is derived from a bivariate gamma distribution for the signal intensities M and U. By allowing for possible correlations between M and U, the proposed model explicitly takes into account the data-generating process underlying the calculation of <b>beta</b> <b>values.</b> Conclusion: The proposed model can be used to improve the identification of associations between <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> and covariates such as clinical variables and lifestyle factors in epigenome-wide association studies. It is as easy to apply to a sample of <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> as <b>beta</b> regression and M-value regression...|$|R

In the equilibrium at sufficiently low <b>beta</b> <b>value,</b> the saturation of a single mode and the following excitation of other single mode whose resonant surface is close {{to that of the}} saturated mode are slowly repeated. This sequence leads to the local deformation of the pressure profile.

By employing {{the idea of}} Fama and French (1992) three-factor model with investment strategy, the investment preference {{is a function of}} <b>beta</b> <b>value,</b> company size, book-market ratio and investment strategy. Our empirical results find that foreign institutional investors in all five industries adopt momentum strategies in their investment preference. Next, in each industry, investment preference has a long-run equilibrium relationship with <b>beta</b> <b>value,</b> company size, book-market ratio, and investment strategy. Moreover, in the electronic, financial, and steel industries, foreign institutional investors' investment preference has corrective power in the short-run. Further, the results of the Granger causality test reveal that the investment preference has a uni-directional leading relationship with <b>beta</b> <b>value</b> in the financial and textile industries. While in case of the steel industry, investment preference and <b>beta</b> <b>value</b> have a bi-directional causal feedback relationship. Industries where company size leads investment preference include electronics, finance, and steel. Book-market ratio leads investment preference only in the textile industry. Generally speaking, in each industry, company size is among the predominant factors that foreign institutional investors take into account when making decisions. The influences of <b>beta</b> <b>value</b> and investment strategy on investment preference do not appear significant.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the scaling laws derived so far for the normalised <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> {{at the onset of}} neoclassical tearing modes is limited as the results depend on the presence and magnitude of seed islands. Therefore power ramp down experiments have been performed on ASDEX Upgrade, allowing to find a scaling law for the critical β value at which the NTMs disappear. For (m,n) =(3, 2) NTMs these critical <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> have been found to scale nearly proportional to ρ*. As it has been recently found on ASDEX Upgrade, at high β N values there is a regime in which (3, 2) NTMs cause a much smaller confinement degradation as one would expect from the β dependence of the saturated island size. The transition to this regime allows high confinement (H = 1) at high <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> (β N > 2. 3) on ASDEX Upgrade in spite of the presence of (3, 2) NTMs. The plasma conditions for the transition into such a high confinement regime are discussed in detail.

Hence, the plasma density inside the coronal loop may have been larger than the average density of the LT region, while the magnetic field of the coronal loops did not vary largely from the emission measure weighted magnetic field because the coronal loops contained the majority of the emission measure. Therefore, the actual plasma beta of the LT region may be larger than the derived <b>beta</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

In the Large Helical Device (LHD), {{the volume}} {{averaged}} <b>beta</b> <b>value</b> of 5 %, {{which is the}} highest value in all of heliotron/stellarators and relevant to the reactor requirement, was achieved by optimizing the magnetic configuration {{from the viewpoint of}} magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) characteristics, transport and heating efficiency of the neutral beam. This <b>beta</b> <b>value</b> was instantaneously obtained by pellet injection and maintained for more than 10 τE, whereas the steady state plasma with a maximum of 4. 8 % was sustained for 85 τE by the gas-puff fueling.

40|$|This work aims {{to explore}} the {{application}} of specific exergy on macrophytes as an integrated index to assess ecosystem health in coastal lagoons, and to analyse its possible application {{in view of the}} implementation of the Water Framework Directive of the European Union.

Therefore, we have extended the calculation of <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> for 244 seaweed and seagrass species which are common in Mediterranean coastal lagoons. The estimated <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> have been then compared with macrophyte-based indicators which have been recently developed, namely the Ecological Evaluation Index and the IFREMER classification scheme.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature and}} significance of market betas on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The identity of market betas is determined by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on the returns of the FTSE/JSE Africa Index Series. A scree test shows two factors necessary {{for inclusion in the}} appropriate Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) model. Based on the promax rotated factor loadings, it is argued that the Financials (J 580) and Basic Materials (J 510) indices ought be used as the appropriate observable index proxies for the first and second factors respectively. Regarding the estimation of beta, this paper makes the case for the use of Reduced Major Axis (RMA) regression over the traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach. A number of characteristics are assessed when arriving at this conclusion. Importantly, it is shown that the traditional OLS regression method chronically underestimates the magnitude of the beta parameter whereas RMA regression does not. In addition, it is shown that, while OLS <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> are more stable in absolute terms than RMA <b>beta</b> <b>values,</b> the RMA values are more stable when adjusted for their magnitude. This paper does not make use of a thin trading filter to narrow the sample of stocks for empirical evaluation. Instead, an examination is made of the significance of <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> at the point at which they are estimated. This is accomplished by means of a rolling window of regressions. It is shown that, while most stocks do exhibit betas which are consistently significant over their listing period, many stocks do not. Some stock returns result in almost no significant <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> while some others exhibit <b>beta</b> <b>values</b> which are significant for only a portion of their listing period. It is shown that a median <b>beta</b> p-value <b>value</b> of 5 % is an appropriate 'significance filter' for limiting the sample of stocks to only those significant for the majority of their listing period. Using only these stocks, an empirical evaluation of beta is conducted using portfolios sorted on both OLS and RMA <b>beta</b> <b>values.</b> It is found that neither beta measure explains the cross-section of returns in the case of resource stocks. However, in the case of non-resource stocks the results show a clear divergence between the methods. In the case of OLS sorted portfolios, the results show a negative relationship between beta and returns. This surprising and counterintuitive result has also been arrived at by other researchers and is the opposite of what the APT would predict. However, in the case of RMA sorted portfolios, this pattern reverses itself, showing a positive relationship between beta and returns. For some holding periods, this is shown to be significant, providing evidence in support of the APT. As a result it is demonstrated that OLS regression not only underestimates the magnitude of beta, but that it distorts the results of empirical tests. On this basis it is argued that RMA regression ought replace OLS regression as the preferred method of beta estimation for the JSE...|$|R

40|$|The Mercier {{stability}} of the plasmas carrying bootstrap currents with different plasma collisionality is studied in the Large Helical Device (LHD). In the LHD conflguration, {{the direction of the}} bootstrap current depends on the collisionality of the plasma through the change in the sign of the geometrical factor. When the <b>beta</b> <b>value</b> is raised by increasing the density of the plasma with a fixed low temperature, the plasma becomes more collisional and the collisionality approaches the plateau regime. In this case, the bootstrap current can flow in the direction so as to decrease the rotational transform. Then, the large Shafranov shift enhances the magnetic well and the magnetic shear, and therefore, the Mercier stability is improved. On the other hand, when the <b>beta</b> <b>value</b> is raised by increasing the temperature of the plasma with a fixed low density, the plasma collisionality becomes reduced to enter the 1 /nu collisionality regime and the bootstrap current flows so that the rotational transform should be increased, which is unfavorable for the Mercier stability.
