40|$|Unsteady vortex-dominated flow around delta wings with {{oscillating}} leading-edge flaps {{represents an}} important classs of problems for supermaneuverability and flow control of advanced aircraft. The problem <b>is</b> <b>solved</b> using time accurate {{integration of the}} unsteady, compressible, thin-layer Navier-Stokes equations {{in conjunction with the}} unsteady, linearized, Navier-displacement equations. Starting with an initial configuration of the wing and its flaps, the Navier-Stokes equations <b>are</b> <b>solved</b> on an initial structured grid for the steady flow. The forced oscillation of the flaps is then applied, and the problem <b>is</b> <b>solved</b> accurately in time. The Navier-displacement equations <b>are</b> <b>solved</b> for the grid deformation and the Navier-Stokes equations <b>are</b> <b>solved</b> for the flowfield.
