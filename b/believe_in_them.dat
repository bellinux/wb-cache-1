2500|$|It is {{explained}} in the novel as follows: [...] "To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief {{in the existence of}} the world around you {{and the nature of the}} things in it, to instead embrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy – to imagine something is real simply because you wish it were. A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> you must abandon the most important thing you possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what you have at stake." ...|$|E

His reaction was praised by international media, including The Washington Post, while religious and conservative organizations in Romania have criticized his position on LGBT rights.|$|E

However, {{it is important that}} there are many who <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> {{and will continue to do}} so in spite of any official pronouncement which may be made. This whole affair has demonstrated that there is a fair proportion of our population which is mentally conditioned to acceptance of the incredible.

When an allegory is closer, Daisuke hiccups, so it is his way to detect an allegory but in every case he runs the risk of dying of the hiccups. The second is , a girl who in the legend haunts girls' school restrooms but now helps Daisuke to run his agency. She provides technological support by creating the [...] "anti-allegory program" [...] that can [...] "de-visualize" [...] the allegories, revealing their real form to its believers.

2500|$|When people {{converse}} with one another, {{according to the}} American philosopher John Searle, they're making moves, not {{in the real world}} which other species inhabit, but in a shared virtual realm peculiar to ourselves. Unlike the deployment of muscular effort to move a physical object, the deployment of illocutionary force requires no physical effort (except movement of the tongue/mouth to produce speech) and produces no effect which any measuring device could detect. Instead, our action takes place on a quite different level— that of social reality. This kind of reality is in one sense hallucinatory, being a product of collective intentionality. It consists, not of [...] "brute facts"— facts which exist anyway, irrespective of anyone's belief— but of [...] "institutional facts", which [...] "exist" [...] only if you <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> Government, marriage, citizenship and money are examples of [...] "institutional facts". One can distinguish between [...] "brute" [...] facts and [...] "institutional" [...] ones by applying a simple test. Suppose no one believed in the fact— would it still be true? If the answer is [...] "yes", it's [...] "brute". If the answer is [...] "no", it's [...] "institutional".|$|E
2500|$|In English Renaissance theatre, ghosts {{were often}} {{depicted}} in the garb of the living and even in armour. Armour, being out-of-date {{by the time of}} the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity. The sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 1800s because an armoured ghost had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators, and eventually became clichéd stage elements and objects of ridicule. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory, point out, [...] "In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'." [...] An interesting observation by Jones and Stallybrass is that [...] "at the historical point at which ghosts themselves become increasingly implausible, at least to an educated elite, to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> at all it seems to be necessary to assert their immateriality, their invisibility. [...] The drapery of ghosts must now, indeed, be as spiritual as the ghosts themselves. This is a striking departure both from the ghosts of the Renaissance stage and from the Greek and Roman theatrical ghosts upon which that stage drew. The most prominent feature of Renaissance ghosts is precisely their gross materiality. They appear to us conspicuously clothed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Legends tell of slighted kobolds {{becoming}} quite malevolent and vengeful, afflicting errant hosts with supernatural diseases, disfigurements, and injuries. Their pranks {{range from}} beating the servants to murdering those who insult them. One holyman visited {{the home of}} Heinzelmann and {{refused to accept the}} kobold's protests that he was a Christian. Heinzelmann threatened him, and the nobleman fled. Another nobleman refused to drink to the kobold's honour, which prompted Heinzelmann to drag the man to the ground and choke him near to death. When a kitchen servant got dirt on the kobold Hödekin and sprayed him with water each time he appeared, Hödekin asked that the boy be punished, but the steward dismissed the behaviour as a childish prank. Hodeken waited for the servant to go to sleep and then strangled him, tore him limb from limb, and threw him in a pot over the fire. The head cook rebuked the kobold for the murder, so Hodeken squeezed toad blood onto the meat being prepared for the bishop. The cook chastised the spirit for this behaviour, so Hodeken threw him over the drawbridge into the moat. According to Lüthi, these abilities reflect the fear of the people who <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> Thomas Keightley has attributed the feats of kobolds to [...] "ventriloquism and the contrivances of servants and others." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dawkins expresses {{concern about}} {{increasing}} religious influence in British schools with over 7,000 faith schools already {{and the government}} encouraging more, so {{over half of the}} new City Academies are expected to be sponsored by religious organizations. He says that the most worrying development is a new wave of private Evangelical schools that have adopted [...] the American Baptist Accelerated Christian Education curriculum, and as an example calls on Phoenix Academy in London. Dawkins is shown around the school by head teacher Adrian Hawkes and remarks on how the teaching material appears to mention God or Jesus on almost every page; such as a reference to Noah's Ark in a science textbook. Hawkes responds by saying that the stories could {{have a lot to do}} with science if you <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>them,</b> and that the science he was taught at school is laughable today. As an example, he mentions that he was taught that the moon came from the Earth's ocean and was [...] "somehow flung out into space" [...] during the early years of the Earth's life. Dawkins says that it should have been presented as a strong current theory. Another lesson talks about AIDS as being the [...] "wages of sin", so Dawkins inquires whether this might not be mixing health education with moralistic preaching. Hawkes responds that without a law-giver, [...] "Why is rape wrong? Why is pedophilia wrong?" [...] and that if people believe they can get away with committing bad deeds then they will tend to do them. Dawkins responds to this claim by asking Hawkes if the only reason he doesn't do these things is that he's frightened of God and subsequently suggests that this attitude is characteristic of the warped morality that religion tends to instill in people.|$|E
