25|$|Revolvers {{were not}} limited to handguns and as a longer <b>barrelled</b> arm is more useful in {{military}} applications than a sidearm, the idea was applied to both rifles and shotguns {{throughout the history of}} the revolver mechanism with mixed degrees of success.|$|E
25|$|The {{place of}} Kelly's capture has been commemorated {{by a small}} stone {{monument}} and plaque, inscribed with 'Early on the cold winter morning of Monday, June 28, 1880, the seriously wounded Edward (Ned) Kelly finally fell at this place and was captured, brought down by Sergeant Steele's double <b>barrelled</b> shot gun, fired from across the near by creek'.|$|E
25|$|Sweet married Edith Maud Walrond on 6 July 1887, and {{the pair}} had three children; George Charles, Dorothy Maud and Leonard Herbert, {{all of whom}} adopted the double <b>barrelled</b> surname Walrond Sweet. He was a {{minister}} in the Church of England, and acted as rector of Symondsbury, and as curate of St Nicholas Church in Winterborne Kingston. In 1902 he moved from a post as vicar of Milton Lilbourne, Wiltshire, to be vicar at Stourpaine, Dorset.|$|E
25|$|These {{types of}} American whiskey must be {{distilled}} {{to no more}} than 80% alcohol by volume, and <b>barrelled</b> at no more than 125 proof. Only water may be added to the final product; the addition of colouring or flavouring is prohibited. These whiskeys must be aged in new charred-oak containers, except for corn whiskey which {{does not have to be}} aged. If it is aged, it must be in uncharred oak barrels or in used barrels. Corn whiskey is usually unaged and sold as a legal version of moonshine.|$|E
25|$|The Light Fleets {{were the}} first British {{aircraft}} carriers where the ship's air group {{was seen as the}} 'main armament'; any mounted weapons were to be for close-range anti-aircraft defence. The Colossus design called for six quadruple <b>barrelled</b> 2 pounder gun mounts, and 16 twin Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Two 4-inch (102 mm) guns were originally included, but an increase in the design's flight deck length in March 1942 saw them displaced. The ships were unarmoured, as increasing the size of the vessels was deemed more important than protection.|$|E
25|$|At 9:30 pm, Donohoe and Ryan {{entered the}} car park of the Lordship Credit Union {{premises}} and they parked, as did another {{car that was}} accompanying them from another credit union branch. They both parked beside the car belonging to officials from Lordship. At this point a navy-blue coloured Volkswagen Passat - that had been waiting stationary on the hard shoulder of the road - drove across the road and blocked the entrance. Four members of the gang were hiding behind a wall surrounding the car park, all wearing balaclavas, while a fifth was driving the car. Two gang members approached the detectives' car from the rear, and as Donohoe opened his door and stepped out to investigate why the car had blocked the entrance, he was instantly shot at close range {{in the back of}} the head with a long <b>barrelled</b> shotgun by a masked raider. A single shot was fired. It was dark, and before Ryan could realise what was taking place he was held at gunpoint and ordered out of his car and onto the ground by a number of gang members possessing a shotgun, handgun and a hammer. Neither officer had time to draw their weapons. The raiders then broke into a car belonging to credit union staff from Lordship, threatening them, which was carrying cash and cheques to the value of about €40,000, but only took a bag with €4,000, mistakenly leaving behind more than €30,000. Ryan and the credit union staff were left physically uninjured as the gang of five fled the scene, but Ryan was dispossessed of his car keys in an attempt to hinder his reaction. It was only after the perpetrators had escaped that the alarm could be raised.|$|E
500|$|The Tiger II was the {{successor}} to the Tiger I, combining the latter's thick armour with the armour sloping used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost 70 tonnes, and was protected by [...] of armour to the front. It was armed with the long <b>barrelled</b> 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 anti-tank cannon. The chassis was also {{the basis for the}} Jagdtiger turretless tank destroyer.|$|E
500|$|Early in the Seven Years' War, under Dieskau's leadership, the {{companies}} were enlarged to 300, and the regiment included three battalions, adding two new companies. [...] One of Dieskau's design compromises, introduced in 1755, was the light 6pound gun on a four-horse team, and a longer <b>barrelled</b> 3pound gun. Guns were drawn on four-horse teams. Each pair of guns had three non-commissioned officers, and the battalion had 42 gunners, who were mounted {{and had been}} trained by dragoons; the gunners dismounted for battle, one man holding the horses and the remainder firing the weapons.|$|E
500|$|However, early cannon {{were not}} very effective, the main {{benefits}} being psychological, frightening men and horses. Short <b>barrelled,</b> large-calibre [...] "bombards" [...] were used up until the late 15th century in Europe, during which period they grew increasingly larger. [...] In the mid-15th century, mortars also appeared. [...] Various smaller weapons also existed, including the serpentine, ribaudequin and cropaudin. [...] The powder was of poor quality and was used in small quantities – to prevent explosion of the barrel – so the effective range of these cannon was rarely more than 200–250m.|$|E
500|$|The 6th MGB Flotilla {{was based}} at HMS Beehive in Felixstowe from April 1941, {{where they were}} tasked to engage German E boats raiding east coast convoys. At this stage in the war MGBs were armed {{with a mixture of}} weapons, which could be Lewis machine guns, Vickers machine guns, Oerlikon 20 mm cannon or four <b>barrelled</b> Boulton Paul gun turrets. The {{armament}} was soon standardized with two twin Vickers [...]50 machine guns each side of the bridge, an Oerlikon 20mm cannon mounted aft, and depth charges. The boats had a crew of 18, consisting of two officers, two petty officers and 14 ratings.|$|E
500|$|In the morning, fresh {{orders were}} issued {{to lead the}} 4th Brigade to the left flank of 1st Parachute Brigade. B Company were ordered to provide {{supporting}} fire from the flanks of A Company's advance, which they successfully did before returning to battalion HQ and following up the advance. Lieutenant Colonel Sir Richard des Voeux ordered Waddy to take B Company through A Company's positions and continue the advance to the high ground, believing {{that there was not}} much opposition. [...] In fact A Company had been nearly destroyed, and Waddy passed numerous bodies on his way forward. As the company advanced, they were held up by what Waddy believes was a twin <b>barrelled</b> 20mm flak gun. He led a small group to attack it, but was spotted by a German sniper as they moved forward. A companion was killed instantly and Waddy, without his machine gun, could only fire ineffectively with his pistol. The sniper shot him in the groin and tried to hit him again as he started to crawl away, forcing Waddy to lay doggo for a moment before one of his men, a [...] tall Rhodesian soldier, carried him back to Company HQ. [...] Faced with a heavy concentration of enemy armour, the attack stalled and was then called off; the battalion had taken such heavy casualties that it was reduced to the size of what was essentially a single company.|$|E

2500|$|The Single Action Army became {{available}} in standard barrel lengths of 4¾ inch, 5½ inch, {{as well as}} the Cavalry standard, original 7½ inch. The shorter <b>barrelled</b> revolvers are sometimes called the [...] "Civilian" [...] or [...] "Gunfighter" [...] model (4¾ inch) and the Artillery Model (5½ inch).

2500|$|... 1989 Terence Gooderham, an accountant, and his girlfriend, Maxine Arnold, {{who were}} both {{killed in a}} hit-man-style slaying whereby they were both shot with a double <b>barrelled</b> shotgun. Although unsolved, it has been {{reported}} in the press that James Moody, described as [...] "Britain's most notorious hitman" [...] may have been responsible for the killings, although he was also murdered a few years later. It has been further suggested in the press that Gooderham was targeted because he creamed off £250,000 in drugs money that he was involved in laundering and that the hit was order by the Adams Family criminal organisation, which is also known as the Clerkenwell crime syndicate.|$|E
2500|$|Under Kenya's Firearms Act, a Taser is {{considered}} a firearm, as per section 2 (a) (ii) of the Act. The section offers one of the descriptions for a firearm as [...] "a lethal <b>barrelled</b> weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged or which can be adapted for the discharge of any shot, bullet or other missile and includes... an electrical charge which when it strikes any person or animal is of sufficient strength to stun and temporarily disable the person or animal struck (such weapon being commonly known as a 'stun gun' or 'electronic paralyser' [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|The church, in the Gothic style, is of {{red brick}} {{with a minimum}} use of black brick and stone dressings; it has a tile roof. It {{consists}} of a Nave, with a hammer beam roof, large plate tracery, clerestory windows and low, narrow aisles to North and South, whose bays are demarcated each by buttresses with a single lancet window, a chancel, with a <b>barrelled</b> roof, [...] at the West end, vestries with a gallery above. In the South West corner there is a porch tower with a slated broach spire with 2 tiers of lucarnes it contains a bell bearing the date 1749. It was the former tannery bell, and was given to St Chad's, built by St Cyprian's and demolished in 1984, from where it went to St Cyprian's. In the South East corner is the Horsfall mortuary chapel, added in 1877 in memory of his daughter, Elizabeth Horsfall and now the resting place of James Horsfall and his family. This is in the tradition and position of a medieval chantry chapel for the saying of prayers or masses for the benefactor or founder of a church or abbey. In the tympanum above the entrance there is a sculpture of the transfiguration, or perhaps the Ascension.|$|E

60|$|This {{place is}} famous for the best and biggest oysters in all this part of England, which the people of Poole pretend to be famous for pickling; and they are <b>barrelled</b> up here, and sent not only to London, but to the West Indies, and to Spain and Italy, and other parts.

60|$|We found, {{according}} to our desire, a very good harbour, where we rode in seven fathom water, well defended from the weather, whatever might happen; and here we got fresh provisions, such as good hogs and some cows; and that we might lay in a little store, we killed sixteen cows, and pickled and <b>barrelled</b> up the flesh {{as well as we}} could be supposed to do in the latitude of eight degrees from the line.|$|E

60|$|Many other {{advantages}} {{might be}} enumerated: For instance, {{the addition of}} some thousand carcasses in our exportation of <b>barrelled</b> beef; the propagation of swine's flesh, and improvement {{in the art of}} making good bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs, too frequent at our tables, which are no way comparable in taste, or magnificence to a well-grown, fat yearling child, which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor's feast, or any other public entertainment.

60|$|Woodbridge {{has nothing}} remarkable, {{but that it}} is a {{considerable}} market for butter and corn to be exported to London; for now begins that part which is ordinarily called High Suffolk, which, being a rich soil, is for a long tract of ground wholly employed in dairies, and they again famous for the best butter, and perhaps the worst cheese, in England. The butter is <b>barrelled,</b> or often pickled up in small casks, and sold, not in London only, but I have known a firkin of Suffolk butter sent to the West Indies, and brought back to England again, and has been perfectly good and sweet, as at first.|$|E
60|$|Toward {{the end of}} November, {{though some}} of the sound ones are yet more mellow and perhaps more edible, they have generally, like the leaves, lost their beauty, and are {{beginning}} to freeze. It is finger-cold, and prudent farmers get in their <b>barrelled</b> apples, and bring you the apples and cider which they have engaged; for it is time to put them into the cellar. Perhaps a few on the ground show their red cheeks above the early snow, and occasionally some even preserve their color and soundness under the snow throughout the winter. But generally {{at the beginning of the}} winter they freeze hard, and soon, though undecayed, acquire the color of a baked apple.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} after this Mr Grant issued from the {{principal}} house, leaning on Mr Kennedy's arm, and followed by the senior clerk, Peter Mactavish, {{and one or two}} friends who had come {{to take part in the}} wolf-hunt. They were all armed with double or single <b>barrelled</b> guns or pistols, according to their several fancies. The two elderly gentlemen alone entered upon the scene without any more deadly weapons than their heavy riding-whips. Young Harry Somerville, who had been strongly advised not to take a gun, lest he should shoot himself or his horse or his companions, was content to take the field with a small pocket-pistol, which he crammed to the muzzle with a compound of ball and swan-shot.|$|E
60|$|Here we {{sold the}} sloop that I was in; and Captain Wilmot keeping his own ship, I took {{the command of}} the Spanish frigate as captain, and my comrade Harris as eldest lieutenant, and a bold enterprising fellow he was, as any the world afforded. One culverdine was put into the brigantine, so that we were now three stout ships, well manned, and victualled for twelve months; for we had taken two or three sloops from New England and New York, laden with flour, peas, and <b>barrelled</b> beef and pork, going for Jamaica and Barbados; and for more beef we went on shore {{on the island of}} Cuba, where we killed as many black cattle as we pleased, though we had very little salt to cure them.|$|E

For the cheer, my lord, a mess of white broth, a fat capon well larded, a dish of beef collops for auld Scotland's sake, and it may be a cup of right old wine, that was <b>barrelled</b> before Scotland and England were one nation--Then for company, one or two of our own loving countrymen--and maybe my {{housewife}} may find out a bonny Scots lass or so." ...|$|E

They are armed with rifles, and each carries a brace of double- <b>barrelled</b> pistols. They are dead shots, too, and you may reckon that it will cost you over a dozen lives were you to interfere with them. Moreover, the other muleteer and myself could give a fair account of ourselves. Rather than have trouble, however, two of you can come forward and see that my statement {{as to what the}} mule carries is correct. Its burden would not fetch fifty dollars at Lima." ...|$|E
6000|$|In a {{few moments}} the speaker succeeded in extricating a double- <b>barrelled</b> fowling-piece from among a {{multitude}} of trunks and bandboxes.

The appearance of the animal was sudden, and his flight inconceivably rapid; but the traveller appeared to be too keen a sportsman to be disconcerted by either. As it came first into view he raised the fowling-piece to his shoulder and, with a practised eye and steady hand, drew a trigger. The deer dashed forward undaunted, and apparently unhurt. Without lowering his piece, the traveller turned its muzzle toward his victim, and fired again. Neither discharge, however, seemed to have taken effect, ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a very}} rude table, {{a single}} board set up on sticks; and a bench or two, {{together}} with a wooden chest of some size, completed the furniture. Tools were suspended from the walls, it is true; and no less than three rifles, {{in addition to a}} very neat double- <b>barrelled</b> [...] "shot-gun," [...] or fowling-piece, were standing in a corner. These were arms collected by our hero in his different trips, and retained quite as much from affection as from necessity, or caution. Of ammunition, there was no very great amount visible; only three or four horns and a couple of pouches being suspended from pegs: but Ben had a secret store, as well as another rifle, carefully secured, in a natural magazine and arsenal, at a distance sufficiently great from the chiente to remove it from all danger of sharing in the fortunes of his citadel, should disaster befall the last.|$|E
