50|$|In appearance, {{the social}} flycatcher resembles a smaller <b>boat-billed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> or great kiskadee. The adult is 16 - 18 cm long and weighs 24 - 27 g. The head is dark grey {{with a strong}} white eyestripe and a usually {{concealed}} orange to vermilion crown stripe. The upperparts are olive-brown, and the wings and tail are brown with only faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white. Young birds have a paler eye mask, reduced crown stripe, and have chestnut fringes to the wing and tail feathers. The call is a sharp peeurrr and the dawn song is a chips-k’-cheery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boat-billed</b> <b>flycatchers</b> wait on a {{concealed}} perch {{high in a}} tree and sally out to catch insects in flight. They will also take invertebrates off the foliage and eat some berries.|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>boat-billed</b> <b>flycatchers</b> {{are one of}} {{the largest}} species of tyrant flycatcher, {{measuring}} 23 cm long and weighing 70 g. The head is black with a strong white eyestripe and a concealed yellow crown stripe. The upperparts are olive-brown, and the wings and tail are brown with only faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white.|$|R
60|$|The {{birds of}} New Guinea offer the {{greatest}} possible {{contrast to the}} Mammalia, since they are more numerous, more beautiful, and afford more new, curious, and elegant forms than those of any other island on the globe. Besides the Birds of Paradise, which we have already sufficiently considered, it possesses {{a number of other}} curious birds, which {{in the eyes of the}} ornithologist almost serves to distinguish it as one of the primary divisions of the earth. Among its thirty species of parrots are the Great Pluck Cockatoo, and the little rigid-tailed Nasiterna, the giant and the dwarf of the whole tribe. The bare-headed Dasyptilus is one of the most singular parrots known; while the beautiful little long-tailed Charmosyna, and the great variety of gorgeously-coloured lories, have no parallels elsewhere. Of pigeons it possesses about forty distinct species, among which are the magnificent crowned pigeons, now so well known in our aviaries, and pre-eminent both for size and beauty; the curious Trugon terrestris, which approaches the still more strange Didunculus of Samoa; and a new genus (Henicophaps), discovered by myself, which possesses a very long and powerful bill, quite unlike that of any other pigeon. Among its sixteen kingfishers, it possesses the carious hook-billed Macrorhina, and a red and blue Tanysiptera, the most beautiful of that beautiful genus. Among its perching birds are the fine genus of crow-like starlings, with brilliant plumage (Manucodia); the carious pale-coloured crow (Gymnocorvus senex); the abnormal red and black flycatcher (Peltops blainvillii); the curious little <b>boat-billed</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (Machaerirhynchus); and the elegant blue flycatcher-wrens (Todopsis).|$|R
50|$|The adult {{great kiskadee}} {{is one of}} the largest of the tyrant flycatchers. It can measure from 21 to 27 cm in length and weigh 52 to 68 g. The head is black with a strong white eyestripe and a {{concealed}} yellow crown stripe. The upperparts are brown, and the wings and tail are brown with usually strong rufous fringes. The bill is short, thick, and black in color. The similar <b>boat-billed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Megarynchus pitangua) has a more massive black bill, an olive-brown back and very little rufous in the tail and wings. A few other tyrant flycatchers — the social flycatcher (Myiozetetes similis), for example — share a similar color pattern, but these species are markedly smaller.|$|E
