Because of the sensitivity of measurement provided by DM3, each unit must be programmed and calibrated to accommodate the variation in Earth’s gravitational force.|$|E
40|$|Traditional finite-difference {{approaches}} for the simulation of wave motion in multi-dimensional {{systems have been}} used for many decades. Digital waveguide techniques for multi-dimensional acoustic modeling were first published by Van Duyne and Smith [1993] and have been actively explored over the past 10 years. In fact, the digital waveguide approach represents an alternative formulation of a finite difference scheme for multi-dimensional modeling. In general, these techniques involve significant computational demands and suffer from dispersion errors. 1. 1 A Rectilinear Two-Dimensional Plate Model • A two-dimensional grid of intersecting vertical and horizontal digital waveguides is shown in Fig. 1.

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to a single direction of motion alters perception of subsequent static or dynamic stimuli and induces substantial changes in behaviors of motion-sensitive neurons, but it remains unclear about an origin of neural adaptation and neural correlates of perceptual consequences of motion adaptation in human brain. Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), we measured motion adaptation tuning curves in a fine scale by probing changes in cortical activity after adaptation for a range of directions relative to the adapted direction. We found a clear dichotomy in tuning curve shape: cortical responses in early-tier visual areas reduced at around both the adapted and opposite direction, resulting in a bi-directional tuning curve, whereas response reduction in high-tier areas occurred only at around the adapted direction, resulting in a uni-directional tuning curve. We also found that the psychophysically measured adaptation tuning curves were uni-directional and best matched the cortical adaptation tuning curves in MT and MST. Our findings are compatible with, but not limited to, an interpretation in which direct impacts of motion adaptation occur in both uni-directional and <b>bi-directional</b> <b>units</b> in early visual areas, but its perceptual consequences are manifested in the population activity in MT and MST, which may inherit those direct impacts of adaptation from the directionally selective units...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCell-generated {{traction}} forces induce integrin activation, {{leading to}} focal adhesion growth and cell spreading. It remains unknown, however, whether integrin activation feeds back to impact {{the generation of}} cytoskeletal tension. Here, we used elastomeric micropost arrays to measure cellular traction forces in wildtype and integrin-null cells. We report that activation of β 1 but not β 3 integrin, by either increasing density of immobilized fibronectin or treating with manganese, elicited fibroblast spreading and cytoskeletal tension. Furthermore, this force generation required Rho kinase and myosin activity. These findings suggest that integrin activation and cell traction forces comprise a <b>bi-directional</b> signaling <b>unit</b> of cell adhesion...|$|R

For example, the West Coast Express commuter rail line runs trains only into Downtown Vancouver {{during the morning}} rush hour, {{and out to the}} suburbs during the evening rush hour. This mode of operation is, in many cases, simplified by ending the train with a special passenger carriage (referred to as a cab car), which has an operating cab and can control the locomotive remotely, to avoid having to turn the train around at each end of its route.

40|$|Transcription {{activation}} {{properties of}} the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) on minimal, TATA-box containing or depleted promoters have been tested. We show that a cluster of Glucocorticoid Responsive Elements (GRE), upon activation by the GR, is sufficient to mediate abundant RNA-polymerase II transcription. We find that in absence of a bona fide TATA-element transcription initiates {{at a distance of}} 45 - 55 bp from the activated GRE cluster with a marked preference for sequences homologous to the initiator element (Inr). Analyzing defined, <b>bi-directional</b> transcription <b>units</b> we demonstrate that the apparent reduction of specific transcription in strong, TATA-depleted promoters, is mainly due to loss of short-range promoter polarization.

Another factor was the closer proximity of cab 2 to the low voltage switch panel. The fact that the handbrake was located in cab 2 was not a deciding factor, but was considered an additional benefit.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{approach}} to automated audio captioning. We employ an encoder-decoder scheme with an alignment model in between. The input to the encoder is {{a sequence of}} log mel-band energies calculated from an audio file, while the output is a sequence of words, i. e. a caption. The encoder is a multi-layered, <b>bi-directional</b> gated recurrent <b>unit</b> (GRU) and the decoder a multi-layered GRU with a classification layer connected to the last GRU of the decoder. The classification layer and the alignment model are fully connected layers with shared weights between timesteps. The proposed method is evaluated using data drawn from a commercial sound effects library, ProSound Effects. The resulting captions were rated through metrics utilized in machine translation and image captioning fields. Results from metrics show that the proposed method can predict words appearing in the original caption, but not always correctly ordered.

5000|$|Most of the {{services}} on the line are now operated by <b>bi-directional</b> diesel multiple <b>unit</b> trains. Locomotive hauled trains from Tralee to Cork, Mallow and Dublin simply passed the station, stopped, then reversed into the platforms, then to continue {{on their way to}} Mallow with the engine always at the [...] "right-end" [...] - the reverse applied with trains from Mallow to Tralee which entered the station, reversed out and continued on their way, again with the locomotive at the right end without running round. The situation is different at Kilkenny where as direction was changed, locomotives had to be detached and put {{on the front of the}} train. A change of ends for locomotives was required. At Killarney there is also a facing crossover east of the station that allows trains in either direction to bypass Killarney Station, but it has been used for this purpose only rarely since freight trains to Tralee ended a few years ago.|$|R

We have established a polymer-based hybrid integration platform (polyboard), which provides flexible optical input/ouptut interfaces (I/Os) that allow robust coupling of indium phosphide (InP) -based active components, passive insertion of thin-film-based optical elements, and on-chip attachment of optical fibers. This work reviews the recent progress of our polyboard platform.

Given {{the importance of}} JmjC domain containing proteins in controlling {{a wide range of}} diverse biological functions, we undertook a comparative genomic analysis to gain further insights in Jmjd 6 gene organisation, evolution, and protein function. RESULTS: We describe here a semiautomated computational pipeline to identify and annotate JmjC domain containing proteins. Using a sequence segment N-terminal of the Jmjd 6 JmjC domain as query for a reciprocal BLAST search, we identified homologous sequences in 62 species across all major phyla.

Using expression studies, two novel Jmjd 6 splice variants were identified and validated in vivo. Analysis of the Jmjd 6 neighbouring gene 1110005 A 03 Rik revealed an incident deletion of this gene in two out of three earlier reported Jmjd 6 knockout mice, which might affect previously described conflicting phenotypes. To determine potentially important residues for Jmjd 6 function a structural model of the Jmjd 6 protein was calculated based on sequence conservation. This approach identified a conserved double-stranded beta-helix (DSBH) fold and a HxDxnH facial triad as structural motifs.

40|$|Leaders of European {{union and}} G 8 {{have set the}} target of 80 % {{reduction}} in greenhouse gases emissions by 2050 by decarbonizing the power and transport sector. There are several pathways to achieve this, some of them being a) use of renewable power and biomass b) improvement in transport and building energy efficiency and c) replacement of fossil based fuel with sustainable fuel. This thesis is focussed {{on some of the}} measures which can be taken by Air Transportation Industry to reduce GHG emissions and carbon footprint. Although, there are many ways in which air transport industry can achieve this goal, this work mainly discusses a) increase in power generation efficiency of aircraft systems b) use of sustainable fuels for aircrafts and c) some ways for sustainable fuel production for aircrafts in an efficient and economic way. However, it is only starting point for discussion and can be further extended to include more efficient and cheaper technologies with reduced carbon foot-print. In this study, use of bi-directional Solid-Oxide Cells (SOC) as auxiliary power unit (APU) on-board commercial aircraft is explored. These <b>bi-directional</b> SOC APU <b>units</b> can be used in the airport energy network either to produce cleaner energy or to produce sustainable fuels depending on the energy demand. This work focusses on use of these bi-directional SOCs as fuel cells during flight operations and as electrolysers to produce sustainable fuel at the airport when the aircrafts are parked. Hence, complete fuel production plant is designed to be situated at the airport. The scope of this thesis is limited to production of fuel for aircraft APU use only. Further extension of this project can include use of these bi-directional SOCs for providing electricity to the airport and fuel for other purposes. For analysis, medium range aircrafts like A 320 and B 737 are considered. This system is designed and dimensioned for producing 500 KW of electric power on-board aircarft. Jet fuel and ammonia are considered as fuel options for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine (SOFC-GT) based APU. Small scale airports like Eindhoven are studied to understand the flight frequency and parking duration for the aircrafts. These bi-directional SOCs are operational as Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) only when the aircraft is parked. Co-electrolysis is performed to produce syngas and steam electrolysis is done to produce hydrogen at the airport. Jet fuel is synthesized from syngas through Fischer Tropsch process and ammonia is synthesized from H 2 and N 2 through Haber Bosch process. Fuel synthesis plants are also designed as part of stationary fuel production plant at the airport. The fact that electrolyzer operates on excess available renewable electricity only, needs a special mention here. Intermittent nature of excess renewable electricity requires implementation of another source of sustainable syngas for fuel production so that sufficient capacity to supply all demand is ensured and robustness against delivery risks is achieved. Biomass gasification is one other method for generating fossil-free fuel. It uses biomass (birch wood) to produce syngas for sustainable fuel production at the aiport alongwith electrolysers. This leads to three cases of fuel production: - Case- 1 : Gasifier+fuel synthesis - Case- 2 : SOEC+fuel synthesis - Case- 3 : Gasifier+SOEC+Fuel synthesis ASPEN PLUS is used for modelling SOFC and stationary fuel production plant models with both jet fuel and ammonia. Modelling procedure for all the models is explained in detail with input parameters and process conditions. Thermodynamic analysis is carried out to compare the exergy efficiency of jet fuel and ammonia based SOFC-GT systems. It is observed that both jet fuel and ammonia based SOFC-GT systems give 62 % and 58 % exergy efficiency respectively which is higher than the conventional APU systems. Similarly, section by section exergy analysis is carried out for jet fuel and ammonia production plants to understand the exergy destructing processes. Comparison is made between exergy efficiency of jet fuel and ammonia production plants at the airport to understand thermodynamic behavior of both. Jet fuel synthesis produces significant amount of hydrogen and gasoline alongwith jet fuel as product. Therefore, two scenarios are analysed for exergy comparisons. a) Ammonia and jet fuel considered as product: Ammonia shows higher exergy efficiency than jet fuel production for all three cases enumerated above. b) Ammonia and (jet fuel, gasoline, hydrogen) are considered as useful products: For case- 1 and case- 3, jet fuel plant is exergetically more favorable than ammonia plant. However, for case- 2, ammonia plant has higher exergy efficiency than jet fuel plant. SPETProcess and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
