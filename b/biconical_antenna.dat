50|$|In radio systems, a <b>biconical</b> <b>antenna</b> is a broad-bandwidth antenna made of two roughly conical {{conductive}} objects, nearly touching {{at their}} points. Biconical antennas are broadband dipole antennas, typically exhibiting a bandwidth of three octaves or more.

5000|$|Biconical (or [...] "bicon") antennas {{are often}} used in {{electromagnetic}} interference (EMI) testing either for immunity testing, or emissions testing. While the bicon is very broadband, it exhibits poor efficiency at low frequencies, resulting in low field strengths {{when compared to the}} input power. Log periodic dipole arrays, Yagi-Uda antennas, and reverberation chambers have shown to achieve much higher field strengths for the power input than a simple <b>biconical</b> <b>antenna</b> in an anechoic chamber. However, reverberation chambers, especially, are poor choices when the goal is to fully characterize a modulated or impulse signal rather than merely measuring peak and average spectrum energy content.|$|E

Also, in most cases, the scatter paths have more contributions on the total received power than the direct path. In addition, in the LOS case, the NRPs become less dependent on the Tx-Rx separation owing to the combined effect of the antenna and the reflective environment. In the NLOS region, the contribution level of the strongest path becomes less dominant with increasing virtual TxRx separation.

40|$|Recently, {{encouraged}} by deregulation ultra-wideband (UWB) technology has attracted attention {{for use in}} communication and sensing applications in the commercial domain. In February 2002 the Federal Com~nunications Commission (FCC) in the United States conditionally waived unlicensed operation of the personal UWB products in the private sector. I n the meantime Various antennas {{have been developed to}} be used for UWB systems, such as double-ridged waveguide horn. log-periodic, <b>biconical,</b> and monocone <b>antennas.</b> None of their antennas, however, simultaneously meet omnidirectional and low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) requirements, essential for some rneasureinent applications such as UWB channel sounding. Double-ridged waveguide horn and log-periodic antennas are directional. Infinite <b>biconical</b> <b>antennas</b> (Fig. I(a)) have a self-similar structure and are, therefore, frequency-independent, and omnidirectional in azimuth. By replacing one of the cones with the infinite ground plane, the infinite biconicals are extended to infinite monocones (Fig. l(b)), which are also frequency-independent and omnidirectional. By truncating the ideal infinite monocone. a real finite inonocone (Fig. I(c)), widely known as a discone. can be obtained. This structure is omnidirectional in azimuth, but not frequency-independent anymore since the truncation causes reflected current {{from the base of the}} cone. A volcano smoke antenna I I I (Fig. I (d)) fulfills these two requirements simultaneously, but its shape is not well-defined. We proposed an antenna that is both omnidirectional i n azimuth and nearly frequency-independent and defined as a combination of simple structure [Zl.

40|$|In {{the scope}} of {{broadband}} radiators, the <b>biconical</b> <b>antenna,</b> or its monopole conical counterpart, is long {{known to be a}} proper choice. One common form of such radiator, the spherically capped conical antenna (SCCA), has closed-form solution to its input impedance, from which the broadband performance potential is easily verified.

This paper proposes a simple 10 -step sequence to derive conical or <b>biconical</b> <b>antenna</b> design charts. These charts provide straightforward information on the geometrical limits within which the required antenna impedance matching broadband performance is achieved.

To overcome these problems, we have to twist the antenna {{to get a good}} signal. Therefore, it will be made a <b>Biconical</b> <b>antenna</b> with 90 ° reflector angle to obtain a directional radiation pattern, which is integrated with the stepper motors and controlled by the microcontroller, so the antenna can be tracking to find areas that have the best signal by calculating the value of power level of each antenna degree in each TV channel, those are from 0 ° to 360 ° position with step 5 °. To make <b>Biconical</b> <b>antenna,</b> required appropriate dimensions, the length of each antenna cone is 15 cm with a 60 ° cone angle and 7. 5 cm cone diameter. Then for the length and width of the 90 ° reflector angle are 45 cm and 31. 8 cm. <b>Biconical</b> <b>antenna</b> is made of sheet copper, while the reflector angle is made of aluminum sheets. Further measurements were taken on each TV channel to obtain a power level that will be used to identify differences in the radiation pattern which use and do not use 90 ° reflector angle, side lobe level and the Half Power Beamwidth (HPBW). When using a 90 ° reflector angle antenna, the greatest HPBW is on Trans 7 channel, that is 94, and the smallest HPBW is on the SpaceT channel, that is 9. While for a antenna without 90 ° reflector angle, the largest HPBW is on TVOne channel, which is 88, while the smallest HPBW is on Metro TV channel, which is 16.

40|$|<b>Biconical</b> <b>antennas</b> are {{of great}} {{interest}} to those who deal with broadband applications including the transmission/reception of pulses. In particular, wide-angle conical antennas are an attractive choice in many applications including Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and the measurements of transient surface currents and charge densities on aircraft. ^ Dielectric loading in the interior region of a conical antenna can be used {{to reduce the size of}} the antenna especially at low frequencies and/or for structural strength. Therefore, having an analytical solution for the input impedance and the frequency response is very helpful in optimizing the design and understanding the behavior of the antenna. From the quasi-analytical solution for the input impedance and the electric field of a wide-angle conical antenna, it can be seen that the dielectric loading in the antenna region improves the input impedance at low frequencies, but increases the number of resonance points and the magnitude of these peaks. ^ When an inhomogeneous dielectric load is used, the magnitude of the resonance peaks is decreased (depending on the way the load is distributed), improving the input impedance of the antenna significantly. ^ Introducing a dielectric load in the interior region of an electrically short receiving cone makes the antenna behave as an electrically longer antenna. However, this is not true for the case for electrical 1 y long antennas. For the case of pulse transmission, the dielectric load affects only the amplitude. Of course, if the dielectric fills the whole space, both transmitting and receiving antennas behave as electrically longer antennas. ...|$|R
40|$|In a {{reverberation}} chamber {{the direct}} (unstirred) path between two antennas is the aggregation of the line-of-site path {{and a number}} of unstirred specular wall reflections. Ideally these latter reflections should be eliminated in order to control the direct path for multi-path radio simulation applications (Pirkl et al., 2011). This work describes an experimental programme undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that the contribution of the specular wall reflections to the unstirred energy in a reverberation chamber can be reduced by wave diffusers placed around the specular reflection points on the chamber walls. The wave diffusers will scatter the reflected energy over a wide angular spectrum and increase the energy that is stirred by the chamber’s stirrer. Periodic wave diffusers were used optimized for a frequency of 3 GHz. The method is based on a past research method for increasing the mode density in a reverberant screened room. That study found that the electromagnetic field was scattered in many directions by the use of binary pseudo-random phase reflection gratings {{on the wall of the}} screened room, while in the absence of the gratings the field was concentrated in particular directions (Clegg et al., 1996). The suggested approach in the present research is to create a grating formed by a binary sequence diffuser which causes diffuse reflection. Experiments were initially conducted in an anechoic and then in a reverberation chamber. The technique was tested while varying the antennas’ heights, polarization and elevation angles, and additionally the orientation of the grating. Furthermore, the power of the line-of-sight component was measured in the anechoic chamber by placing absorbers on the grating and was then subtracted from the total received signal, toleave the scattered components remaining. The power of the signal reflected from the grating could thus be calculated and compared at the receiving antenna with the power in specular reflection which is observed by using a plane reflector. In the reverberation chamber the research was based on the effect of the diffusers on the unstirred energy. For this reason the transmitting signal between two <b>biconical</b> <b>antennas</b> was measured, with and without the diffusers placed around the specular reflection points of the room. Parameters like the heights, the polarization and the distance of the antennas as well as the orientation of the diffusers were tested.

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of the {{propagation}} medium is essential in the design of efficient multi-antenna wireless communications systems. Ultra-wideband (UWB) intentional radia- tion offers great potential for short-range applications. However, due to the wideband charac- teristics of these signals, in-band frequency variation may impact system performance. This thesis addresses this issue and builds on the characterisation of the frequency dependence of multi-antenna UWB channels in local area network (LAN) and body area network (BAN) scenarios. Here, the frequency dependence of channel capacity and sub channel correlation properties are characterised for multi-antenna UWB channels. The LAN channel measurements were preformed in office environments using arrays of <b>biconical</b> <b>antennas,</b> under line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) channel conditions, over a frequency range of 4 to 10 GHz. The BAN measurements were performed in an office environment, using two different types of antennas located at several locations on the user's body, and covering the band from 4 to 9 GHz. For the LAN deployment, analysis reveals that, as frequency increases, the channels' spatial diversity potential increases at a faster rate in LOS channels than in NLOS channels, even though the overall diversity measure was still, on average, 31 % higher in the NLOS channels. The channel capacity characteristics are found to be dependent on the method of power control used to normalise the channel. If the channels are normalised to equal power in subbands then the capacity is found to be higher for the NLOS channels. However, when the path loss is included in the channel, the channel gain is found to dominate the capacity estimations. A comparison of channel measurements taken using virtual and physical arrays, shows that the use of virtual arrays (common in the literature) out performed the channel capacity of physical array measurements in 77 % of the cases tested. A novel antenna mounting method was developed to enable reliable BAN characterisation. This technique was shown to significantly decrease the electromagnetic coupling between the antenna and user, creating a non-user dependent antenna. The multi-antenna BAN measure- ments highlight an increased variability in the properties compared to the LAN measurements, with variations in the BAN capacity up to eight times higher over the UWB bandwidth than NLOS LAN measurements. The higher variation in capacity was caused by propagation paths travelling over the user's body; these paths were often found to increase the power difference and correlation between subchannels. However, when the channel gains were included into the capacity estimations, this propagation around the user was found to increase the received power, and again showed that the capacity is strongly linked to the received power.
