40|$|A thin {{metallic}} sheet was {{bonded to}} the outer surface of a laminated composite curved beam as a <b>bumper</b> <b>layer.</b> It was believed that a metallic <b>bumper</b> <b>layer</b> such as an aluminum thin sheet {{would be able to}} intercept any lateral impacting force and absorb impact energy through plastic deformation. Since aluminum is comparatively light weight, a thin sheet will not result in a significant increase in structural weight. Results showed that impact damage occurred primarily in the <b>bumper</b> <b>layer,</b> thereby resulting in a much higher residual bending strength compared to the control specimen...|$|E
40|$|While {{orbital debris}} of ten centimeters or more are tracked and catalogued, the {{difficulty}} of finding and accurately accounting for forces acting on the objects near the ten centimeter threshold results in both uncertainty of their presence and location. These challenges result in difficult decisions for operators balancing potential costly operational approaches with system loss risk. In this paper, {{the assessment of the}} feasibility of protecting a spacecraft from this catalogued debris is described using numerical simulations and a test of a multi-shock shield system against a cylindrical projectile impacting normal to the surface with approximately 15 MJ of kinetic energy. The hypervelocity impact test has been conducted at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) with a 598 g projectile at 6. 905 km/s on a NASA supplied multi-shock shield. The projectile used is a hollow aluminum and nylon cylinder with an outside diameter of 8. 6 cm and length of 10. 3 cm. Figure 1 illustrates the multi-shock shield test article, which consisted of five separate bumpers, four of which are fiberglass fabric and one of steel mesh, and two rear walls, each consisting of Kevlar fabric. The overall length of the test article was 2. 65 m. The test article was a 5 X scaled-up version of a smaller multi-shock shield previously tested using a 1. 4 cm diameter aluminum projectile for an inflatable module project. The distances represented by S 1 and S 1 / 2 in the figure are 61 cm and 30. 5 cm, respectively. Prior to the impact test, hydrodynamic simulations indicated that some enhancement to the standard multi-shock system is needed to address the effects of the cylindrical shape of the projectile. Based on the simulations, a steel mesh bumper has been added to the shield configuration to enhance the fragmentation of the projectile. The AEDC test occurred as planned, and the modified NASA multi-shock shield successfully stopped 598 g projectile using 85. 6 kg/m(exp 2). The fifth <b>bumper</b> <b>layer</b> remained in tact, although it was torn free from its support structure and thrown into the first rear wall. The outer Kevlar layer of the first rear wall tore likely from the impact of the fifth bumper's support structure, but the back of the rear wall was intact. No damage occurred to the second rear wall, or to the witness plate behind the target...|$|E

40|$|A report {{describes}} improvements {{over the}} conventional Whipple shield (two thin, spaced aluminum walls) for protecting spacecraft against high-speed impacts of orbiting debris. The debris in question arise mainly from breakup of older spacecraft. The improved shields include exterior <b>bumper</b> <b>layers</b> composed of hybrid fabrics woven from combinations of ceramic fibers and high-density metallic wires or, alternatively, completely metallic outer layers composed of high-strength steel or copper wires. These shields {{are designed to}} be light in weight, yet capable of protecting against orbital debris with mass densities up to about 9 g/cm 3, without generating damaging secondary debris particles. As yet another design option, improved shields can include sparsely distributed wires made of shape-memory metals that can be thermally activated from compact storage containers to form shields of predetermined shape upon arrival in orbit. The improved shields could also be used to augment shields installed previously...|$|R

40|$|A {{family of}} user-friendly, DOS PC based, Microsoft BASIC {{programs}} written to provide spacecraft designers with empirical predictions of space debris damage to orbiting spacecraft are described. Spacecraft wall temperatures and condensate formation is also predicted. The spacecraft wall configuration {{is assumed to}} consist of multilayered insulation (MLI) placed between a Whipple style bumper and the pressure wall. Impact damage predictions are based on data sets of experimental results obtained from simulating debris impacts on spacecraft using light gas guns on earth. A module of the program facilitates {{the creation of the}} database of experimental results that is used by the damage prediction modules to predict damage to the bumper, the MLI, and the pressure wall. A finite difference technique is used to predict temperature distributions in the pressure wall, the MLI, and the <b>bumper.</b> Condensate <b>layer</b> thickness is predicted for the case where the pressure wall temperature drops below the dew point temperature of the spacecraft atmosphere...|$|R
