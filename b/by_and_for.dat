5|$|The {{manuscript}} for {{the book}} stayed in the White family until 1895, when it was auctioned at Sotheby's. The purchaser was Stuart M.

Rosenbach in 1923, and passed into the collection of Arthur A. Houghton. The Houghton collection was auctioned by Christie's in 1980, where the manuscript was purchased <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> Gilbert White's museum at The Wakes, Selborne, where it is displayed.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or, if of Scottish descent, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. This process was quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the heralds in Britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> Canadians.|$|E
5|$|Following the Stonewall riots, lesbian {{themes in}} {{literature}} {{became much more}} diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> lesbians. Feminist magazines such as The Furies, and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian. Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values {{are evident in the}} writings of Dorothy Allison, who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian sadomasochism themes.|$|E

The junior prom, lectures from {{a wide array of}} speakers, and faculty-led skits all took place beneath the building's roof. Vassar's yearbook, the Vassarion, as well as its weekly newspaper, The Miscellany News, were also headquartered in the Students' Building. An annual Christmas party, complete with students clad as reindeer pulling a sled on which sat political science professor Charles Gordon Post dressed as Santa Claus, once occurred within the building as well.|$|E

In 1854 Birdsall had purchased The Lily, the first U.S. newspaper edited <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> women, from its founder, Amelia Bloomer, and moved it to Richmond, Indiana. The newspaper had begun as a temperance newspaper but was later used to campaign for women's suffrage and rights.|$|E

5|$|Water-borne {{trade has}} been practiced {{since at least}} the dawn of civilization, when Sumeria was {{connected}} to Harappan India. Around 2000 BC, the Minoans of Crete established the earliest thalassocracy, a maritime empire heavily dependent upon its trade and naval power. The city-states of the Phoenicians and Greeks then replaced them in the centuries after 1200 BC, ultimately establishing far-flung colonial empires which spread from the Sea of Azov to the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Under the Romans, commerce continued to thrive. In the first centuries BC, steppe nomads' interruption of India's access to Siberian gold caused them to open up maritime routes to Malaysia and Indonesia, exposing them first to Hindu and then Muslim traders. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, European trade dwindled but it continued to flourish elsewhere. The Tamil Chola dynasty thrived on trade between Tang China, the Javanese Srivijaya Empire, and the Abbasid Caliphate in the west. Following further conquests, Arabians came to dominate maritime trade in the Indian Ocean, spreading Islam along the East African coast and, eventually, Southeast Asia. A major effect of the Age of Discovery was the unification of the world's regional trade networks into a single world market, largely run <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> the European monarchs and the merchants of Amsterdam, London, and other Atlantic ports. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, about 13 million people were shipped across the Atlantic to be sold as slaves in the Americas. The Hales Trophy was an award for the fastest commercial crossing of the Atlantic and was won by the SS United States in 1952 for a crossing that took three days, ten hours, and forty minutes.|$|E
