5|$|This was {{the last}} use {{of the death penalty}} in Spain; {{following}} the death of Francisco Franco, two months later, no further executions took place. The 1978 Spanish Constitution largely abolished the death penalty, with the exception of limited cases in times of war, and these exceptions were abolished in 1995. In 2012, a <b>Basque</b> <b>Government</b> commission found that the processes used to convict two of those executed had violated their rights and awarded compensation to their families.|$|E

5|$|The {{families}} of those executed continued to seek the overturning of the sentences and compensation, based on the irregularity of the processes used to convict their relatives. In 2004, they appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain, which rejected their application {{on the grounds that}} it did not have the power to deal with cases prior to December 1978, when the Constitution came into effect. In September 2005, the European Court of Human Rights rejected their petition on similar grounds: that Spain had not been a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights in 1975. In November 2012, a <b>Basque</b> <b>Government</b> commission found that the processes used to convict Txiki and Otaegui had violated their right to a fair trial and awarded €135,000 in compensation to their families. Flor Baena, the sister of José Humberto Baena, continued to campaign for her brother, stating that she wanted to clear his name, not financial compensation.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 the {{construction}} plans were altered {{and a new}} project was created. Finally in 1987 the <b>Basque</b> <b>Government</b> approved the plan to build and finance the Bilbao Metro.|$|E
25|$|After the war a {{telegram}} sent from Franco’s headquarters was found revealing {{that he had}} asked for a Condor Legion attack on Guernica. His goals were to discourage the Basque people and take over the <b>Basque</b> <b>Government.</b> Hermann Goering also confessed in 1946 that Germany had considered Guernica as a testing ground.|$|E
5000|$|In {{parallel}} to [...] Bilbao Ria 2000 , the Bilbao Metropoli-30 association was constituted in 1991 by the City council of Bilbao, the Biscay and <b>Basque</b> <b>Governments</b> and diverse {{public and private}} organizations for the regeneration of Metropolitan Bilbao.|$|R
50|$|The {{establishment}} of the Company resulted from negotiations engaged with the <b>Basque</b> <b>governments</b> {{in the aftermath of}} the bloody military campaign ordered by Philip V of Spain over the western <b>Basque</b> districts. The <b>government</b> of Gipuzkoa in particular came up with a proposal for the re-{{establishment of}} commerce with Venezuela that would suit the Basque interests and those of the Spanish king alike. The plan was approved, with the Basques getting total exclusivity on that commerce.|$|R
50|$|Jaime Mayor Oreja (born 12 June 1951) is a Spanish {{politician}} of the People's Party.

25|$|Republican forces {{attempted}} {{to establish a}} front at Buruntza. Eventually the front stabilized temporarily on the western fringes of Gipuzkoa (Intxorta) during October 1936, when the Basque Statute of Autonomy was passed in Madrid, and the <b>Basque</b> <b>Government</b> was rapidly organized. As military rebels advanced, panicking civilians from the occupied areas fled towards Bilbao {{by the tens of}} thousands.|$|E
25|$|Basques: They were gudaris (Basque nationalists {{and other}} <b>Basque</b> <b>Government</b> battalions) who had {{escaped from the}} siege of Santander and, {{transferred}} by sea to the Republican side, had continued fighting outside of their homeland. Due to the proximity of Gurs to their homeland, practically all managed to find local backing that permitted them to abandon the camp and find work and refuge in France.|$|E
25|$|Basque nationalists have {{advocated}} {{that the picture}} should {{be brought to the}} Basque country, especially after the building of the Guggenheim Bilbao Museum. Officials at the Reina Sofía claim that the canvas is now thought to be too fragile to move. Even the staff of the Guggenheim do not see a permanent transfer of the painting as possible, although the <b>Basque</b> <b>government</b> continues to support the possibility of a temporary exhibition in Bilbao.|$|E

25|$|Exceptions were Biscay and Gipuzkoa {{where the}} Christian Democratic Basque Nationalist Party, after some hesitation, {{supported}} the Republic while halting persecution {{in the areas}} held by the <b>Basque</b> <b>Government.</b> All Catholic churches in the Republican zone were closed. The desecration {{was not limited to}} Catholic churches, as synagogues and Protestant churches were also pillaged and closed, but some small Protestant churches were spared. The rising Franco's regime would keep Protestant churches and synagogues closed, as he only permitted Catholic church.|$|E
25|$|The attack gained {{controversy}} {{because it}} involved {{the bombing of}} civilians by a military air force. The number of victims is still disputed; the <b>Basque</b> <b>government</b> reported 1,654 people killed at the time, while local historians identified 126 victims (later revised by {{the authors of the}} study to 153). A British source used by the Air War College claims 400 civilians died. Soviet archives claim 800 deaths on 1 May 1937, but this number may not include victims who later died of their injuries in hospitals or whose bodies were discovered buried in the rubble.|$|E
25|$|Advances by Nationalist troops led by Generalísimo Francisco Franco {{had eaten}} into the {{territory}} {{controlled by the}} Republican Government. The <b>Basque</b> <b>Government,</b> an autonomous regional administrative body formed by Basque nationalists, sought to defend Biscay and parts of Guipuzcoa with its own light Basque Army. At {{the time of the}} raid, Guernica represented a focal strategic point for the Republican forces. It stood between the Nationalists and capture of Bilbao. Bilbao was seen as key to bringing the war to a conclusion in the north of Spain. Guernica also was the path of retreat for the Republicans from the northeast of Biscay.|$|E

25|$|After Nationalist forces led by General Emilio Mola's forces {{took the}} town three days later, the Nationalist side claimed that {{no effort to}} {{establish}} an accurate number {{had been made by}} the opposite side. The <b>Basque</b> <b>government,</b> in the confused aftermath of the raids, reported 1,654 dead and 889 wounded. It roughly agrees with the testimony of British journalist George Steer, correspondent of The Times, which estimated that 800 to 3,000 of 5,000 people perished in Guernica. These figures were adopted over the years by some commentators. These figures are represented in a majority of the literature from that period and up to the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{university in}} the Basque Country was the University of Oñati, founded in 1540 in Hernani and moved to Oñati in 1548. It lasted in various forms until 1901. In 1868, {{in order to fulfill}} the need for college graduates for the thriving industry that was flourishing in the Bilbao area, there was an unsuccessful effort to establish a Basque-Navarrese University. Nonetheless, in 1897 the Bilbao Superior Technical School of Engineering (the first modern faculty of engineering in Spain), was founded as a way of providing engineers for the local industry; this faculty is nowadays part of the University of the Basque Country. Almost at the same time, the urgent need for business graduates led to the establishment of the Commercial Faculty by the Jesuits, and, some time thereafter, the Jesuits expanded their university by formally founding the University of Deusto in Deusto (now a Bilbao neighbourhood) {{by the turn of the}} century, a private university where the Commercial Faculty was integrated. The first modern Basque public university was the Basque University, founded 18 November 1936 by the autonomous <b>Basque</b> <b>government</b> in Bilbao in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. It operated only briefly before the government's defeat by Francisco Franco's fascist forces.|$|E

5000|$|The Government of Spain {{has been}} {{involved}} in a long-running campaign against Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA), an armed secessionist organization founded in 1959 in opposition to Franco and dedicated to promoting Basque independence through violent means, though originally violence was not a part of their method. They consider themselves a guerrilla organization but are considered internationally as a terrorist organisation. Although the <b>government</b> of the <b>Basque</b> Country does not condone any kind of violence, their different approaches to the separatist movement are a source of tension between the Central and <b>Basque</b> <b>governments.</b>|$|R

[...] The government stated that financing for commercial development must come from the private sector and that the <b>Basque</b> <b>Government</b> was willing to continue participating with venture capital funds once the Hiriko obtained official industrial approval for production.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{historical}} debate over whether a market was being held that particular Monday as, prior to the bombing, the <b>Basque</b> <b>government</b> had ordered a general halt to markets to prevent congestion of roads, and restricted large meetings.

2500|$|On February 21, 2007, the <b>Basque</b> <b>Government</b> {{announced}} {{a project for}} the construction of a third metro line, which in the future will be expanded to Bilbao Airport.

At the same time, the University of the Basque Country requested the construction of [...] "Line 6" [...] in order to connect Leioa (where the university is located) and Getxo with Asua Valley (where the airport is located) [...] going through the university campus.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} {{home rule}} in 1839-1841, the <b>Basque</b> <b>governments</b> started a mutual {{approach}} out of common concerns in face of their exposure to Spanish centralism. The movement intensified after 1866, and a motto was coined, the [...] "Laurac bat", 'the four make one', echoing the [...] "Irurac bat" [...] of the Royal Basque Company, which in turn crystallized in a coat of arms including the four historic Basque districts in Spain (called variously the Sister Provinces, the Chartered Territories, the Basque Country, the Basque-Navarrese Country, etc.), to represent their common bonds, as claimed during that period by the chartered provincial governments, or the [...]|$|R
50|$|Since 1991, as {{time has}} eased the bitter split (helped {{by the fact}} that both Arzalluz and Garaikoetxea have gone into {{political}} retirement), both parties agreed to form an electoral coalition in a number of local elections as a means to maximize the nationalist votes, which eventually led to reunite both candidatures in a joint list again for the regional governments of Navarra and the Basque Autonomous Community in 1998. Thus, EA has participated in several PNV-led <b>Basque</b> <b>governments,</b> including the 2006 government of President Juan José Ibarretxe Markuartu.
