40|$|The Superpave gyratory {{compactor}} (SGC) is used {{to compact}} asphalt specimens for mixture testing in the Superpave system. Five companies currently manufacture SGCs {{for use in the}} United States, offering a total of eight different models. Each model employs a unique method of setting, inducing, and maintaining the specified angle of gyration. Calibration systems are required for each device for the angle of gyration. All angle measurements are made externally relative to the mold and none of the calibration systems can be universally used on all of the models. The specified external angle of gyration under load (α) is 1. 25 degrees, with a tolerance of ± 0. 02 degrees. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in partnership with the TestQuip Corporation (New Brighton, MN), developed an angle validation kit (AVK) that measures the dynamic internal angle (DIA) of gyration. The DIA accounts for equipment compliance issues, which are not apparent in measuring the external angle.

40|$|Durability of an asphalt {{mixture is}} {{directly}} related to the optimum asphalt binder content, which guarantees coverage of the aggregate particles and suitable volumetric properties to ensure a good performance in service, producing an asphalt mixture that is less susceptible to aging and moisture damage. Previous research has shown that the polygon-of-voids tool, or polyvoids, is an analytical technique to determine the optimum asphalt binder content of asphalt mixtures with virgin aggregates based on the specification limits of voids, allowing a saving in time and material. However, current trends to develop new asphalt mixtures which incorporate reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) have created additional challenges given the nature of the design of a mixture containing aggregates with residual asphalt that make the property measurement of the <b>bulk</b> <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of the RAP aggregate difficult. This paper aims to demonstrate the application of the polygon-of-voids tool for the design of recycled hot-mix asphalt.

However, limited studies {{were conducted to}} analyze the influence of fibers on the percent voids in mineral aggregate in bituminous mixture (VMA) during the mixture design. This study analyzed the effect of different fibers and fiber contents on the VMA in SMA mixture design. A surface-dry condition method test and Marshall Stability test were applied on the SMA mixture with four different fibers (i. e., flocculent lignin fiber, mineral fiber, polyester fiber, blended fiber). The test {{results indicated that the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of SMA mixtures and asphalt saturation decreased with the increasing fiber content, whilst the percent air voids in bituminous mixtures (VV), Marshall Stability and VMA increased. Mineral fiber had the most obvious impact on the <b>bulk</b> <b>specific</b> <b>gravity</b> of bituminous mixtures, while flocculent lignin fiber had a minimal impact. The mixture with mineral fiber and polyester fiber had significant effects on the volumetric properties, and, consequently, exhibited better VMA over the conventional SMA mixture with lignin fiber. Modified fiber content range was also provided, which will widen the utilization of mineral fiber and polyester fiber in the applications of SMA mixtures. The mixture evaluation suggested no statistically significant difference between lignin fiber and polyester fiber on the stability. The mineral fiber required a much larger fiber content to improve the mixture performance than other fibers. Overall, the results can be a reference to guide SMA mixture design...|$|E
