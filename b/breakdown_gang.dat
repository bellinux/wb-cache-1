25|$|Now, as it happened, I had {{confined}} myself {{strictly to}} the business of clearing the line, which was entrusted to me, and although I do not pretend that I considered the matter in its legal aspect at the time, the fact remains that I did not give a shot, nor was I armed when captured. I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>gang,</b> whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, the Empire State {{must learn}} to wait, [...] And the Cannon-ball go hang! [...] When the West-bound's ditched, and the tool-car's hitched, [...] And it's 'way for the <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Gang</b> (Tare-ra!) [...] 'Way for the Breakdown Gang!" ...|$|E
60|$|The task of {{clearing}} the line would not, perhaps, in ordinary circumstances {{have been a}} very difficult one. But the <b>breakdown</b> <b>gang</b> and their tools were scattered to the winds, and several had fled along the track or across the fields. Moreover, the enemy's artillery fire was pitiless, continuous, and distracting. The affair had, however, to be carried through.|$|E
50|$|<b>Breakdown</b> <b>gangs</b> {{from the}} {{locomotive}} and Permanent way departments attended with a crane and tool vans. The tender was uncoupled and pulled clear, but the locomotive itself weighed 35 tons and getting it out {{would be a}} massive task. The hole had appeared just 45 minutes before a Barrow-Carnforth passenger was due, and rumours soon went round that a whole passenger train had been swallowed up and scores of people had been killed and injured. People flocked to look, but were kept from going too close by railway staff and police.|$|R
5000|$|Conduit is {{described}} as being more consistently heavy than their previous releases, as they have all varied in style. Conduit {{is seen as the}} band returning to their musical roots, this is reflected in how it is some of the band's heaviest material and that raw music featured on the album captures the energy of a younger band. Much like their previous work the album is considered as post-hardcore. The album features a combination of metalcore guitar riffs, metallic <b>breakdowns,</b> <b>gang</b> vocals, 'emotionally charged hooks' and melodic choruses. Matthew Davies has summarised the record neatly by saying [...] "it's a post-hardcore record that is not afraid to drop into some hardcore for good measure." [...] Saying elements of it are [...] "extremely direct and gritty".|$|R
50|$|Surve was {{finished}} after systematic police operations {{led to a}} <b>breakdown</b> of his <b>gang's</b> activities. After the arrest of his cohort Uday, {{he was the only}} remaining member of the gang who was not in prison.|$|R

I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>gang,</b> whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E
60|$|To {{those who}} were in the rear truck there was only a {{tremendous}} shock, a tremendous crash, and a sudden full stop. What happened to the trucks in front of the engine is more interesting. The first, which contained the materials and tools of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>gang</b> and the guard who was watching the line, was flung into the air and fell bottom upwards on the embankment. (I do not know what befell the guard, but it seems probable that he was killed.) The next, an armoured car crowded with the Durban Light Infantry, was carried on twenty yards and thrown over on its side, scattering its occupants in a shower on the ground. The third wedged itself across the track, half on and half off the rails. The rest of the train kept to the metals.|$|E
60|$|No {{sooner had}} I reached Pretoria than I demanded my {{release from the}} Government, {{on the grounds that}} I was a Press {{correspondent}} and a non-combatant. So many people have found it difficult to reconcile this position with the accounts which have been published of what transpired during the defence of the armoured train, that I am compelled to explain. Besides the soldiers of the Dublin Fusiliers and Durban Light Infantry who had been captured, there were also eight or ten civilians, including a fireman, a telegraphist, and several men of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>gang.</b> Now {{it seems to me that}} according to international practice and the customs of war, the Transvaal Government were perfectly justified in regarding all persons connected with a military train as actual combatants; indeed, the fact that they were not soldiers was, if anything, an aggravation of their case. But the Boers were at that time overstocked with prisoners whom they had to feed and guard, and they therefore announced that the civilians would be released as soon as their identity was established, and only the military retained as prisoners.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Christopher Hume, a {{journalist}} with the Toronto Star, wrote that Rexdale [...] "has become shorthand for suburban blight, social <b>breakdown</b> and <b>gang</b> violence. In 2005 alone, five {{young men were}} shot dead in the area, a grey landscape of highways and highrises, shopping malls and churches." [...] Hume wrote that children who lived in Rexdale had nothing to do, and were [...] "wandering around the anonymous streets of this place". The vision of Rexdale's planners, Hume wrote, was a patchwork of separate precincts for working, living, shopping and playing, connected by expressways. However, this single-use zoning, separation, industrial-scale development and reliance on cars contributed to Rexdale's problems.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{like the}} band's {{previous}} work, There Is a Hell is primarily considered metalcore. Bring Me the Horizon commonly use technical guitar riffs, dark lyrics, heavy <b>breakdowns,</b> and <b>gang</b> vocals in their music. The album develops Bring Me the Horizon's experimental, electronic tendencies, taking their original sound and infusing it with female vocals, choral vocals, orchestral sounds, emotive guitars, and [...] "jarring" [...] electronics. The album also blends aesthetics from electronica, classical, pop, classic rock, psychedelia, hardcore punk, and technical metal genres. In their {{review of the}} album, Metal Hammer wrote that the album {{is influenced by the}} works of The Red Chord, Killswitch Engage, and Pink Floyd.|$|R
50|$|Young {{people are}} fleeing El Salvador to the United States, fearful of gang violence.. Since the <b>breakdown</b> of the <b>gang</b> peace {{agreement}} in 2012, {{the number of}} these Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) encountered in the U.S. has risen dramatically. Between 2009 and 2012, less than 2,000 UACs were encountered annually. In the 2014 fiscal year, over 16,000 were encountered. The fiscal years 2012 through 2016 saw an average of nearly 8,000.|$|R
50|$|A {{goods train}} had left Toowoomba {{on the night}} of 29 January 1913, and had derailed near the Murphys Creek railway station on the Main line, about one mile from the station yard limits, on the range side near the 84-mile (139 km) mark. No members of the crew were injured, but a {{considerable}} amount of damage was caused to the goods vehicles and the track. A <b>breakdown</b> <b>gang</b> was sent from Toowoomba and breakdown trains were also despatched from Brisbane and Toowoomba to clear wreckage from the line. The spot where the derailment had taken place was in a relatively inaccessible area and workers had to prise the wreckage apart. Several trips were made by breakdown trains to the derailment site.|$|E

5000|$|New Found Glory {{are widely}} {{recognized}} for their fast and energetic pop punk music. They have since developed a more rounded rock sound, including alternative rock, and melodic hardcore styles. The band's traditional sound {{has been described}} as [...] "chunky and melodic", with Rolling Stone noting their penchant for [...] "catchy, riffy punk-rock." [...] Consequence of Sound writer Megan Ritt called the band [...] "paragons" [...] of the pop punk genre and noted how [...] "the seasoned Floridian rockers are renowned for their heartfelt guitar anthems." [...] The band's music typically builds upon verse-chorus song structures, combining pop-influenced melodies with fast punk rock tempos, hardcore-tinged <b>breakdowns,</b> and often <b>gang</b> vocals. The quintets fifth studio album, Coming Home was however marked as a change in direction for the band. Its more layered and mid-tempo sound is regarded as their most mature work and {{has been described as}} a [...] "somber, honest, polished and alternative record." ...|$|R
