40|$|Two {{detection}} methods {{for the little}} fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), both employing the pheromone attractant 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -(2 -methylbutyl) pyrazine (2 -MeBu-diMePy), were compared with peanut butter based detection, in order to evaluate differences in species specificity and detection reliability. Trapping was conducted using a transect through a macadamia orchard {{on the island of}} Hawaii. The transect consisted of a series of three–tree plots, each plot contained a peanut <b>butter</b> <b>coated</b> stick (the most common detection method used for W. auropunctata in Hawaii), a one–way trap treated with 2 -MeBu-diMePy, and a piece of double–sided tape treated with 2 -MeBu-diMePy. While there were no differences in the number of W. auropunctata counted with each detection method, and no differences in detection reliability (detecting the known presence of W. auropunctata in a plot), the pheromone– incorporating methods showed greater species specificity, retaining W. auropunctata almost exclusively. These results demonstrate the potential of pheromone–{{detection methods}} to selectively capture target ant species even when other ants are present and abundant. Combined data from all three detection methods and a previous visual survey along the transect showed...|$|R

Freshly harvested just ripe fruit of pawpaw carica papaya was <b>coated</b> with shea <b>butter</b> and stored {{at room temperature}} (27 C± 1 C), refrigeration temperatureo o (10 C± 1 C) and freezing temperature (- 5 C± 1 C) for 8 days. The proximate, sugar (glucose, fructose ando o o o galactose) and minerals (Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn) were subsequently determined. The result of the study shows that the moisture content increases significantly (P< 0. 05) (85. 25 - 95. 25 %) while other nutrients reduce significantly (P< 0. 05) in storage, the sugar and the minerals content also reduce significantly (P< 0. 05) in storage. The storage temperature of freezing temperature recorded the highest mineral content (Ca- 113. 33 mg/ 100 g, Mg- 53. 33 mg/ 100 g, Fe- 2. 33 mg/ 100 g and Zn- 7. 00 mg/ 100 g) {{at the end of}} the storage period which was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than other storage temperatures. At the end of the storage period, there was no significant difference (P< 0. 05) in the glucose and fructose content of the pawpaw at the different storage temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Perfluorinated {{alkylated}} compounds (PFAA) {{have been}} identified in milk and dairy products at sub ppb levels, however, knowledge on the impact of industrial milk processing on PFAA levels is rare. This study examined industrial milk processing first by analytical screening of products of a cooperating dairy, which varied in kind and number of processing steps. Second, amounts of PFAA in raw milk, cream, skim milk, butter milk, and butter were mass balanced in industrial production. For migration testing, unpacked butter was sampled from the production and exposed to original packaging at 5 °C for 45 days. Screening identified dairy products with high fat contents to bear higher loads of PFAA. The mass balance of butter production revealed a significant impact of phase separation processes on concentrations in fat rich and aqueous phases. Storage of <b>butter</b> in packaging <b>coated</b> with a fluorinated polymer increased butter levels of both PFAA and FTOH...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho reúne resultados promissores sobre uma via alternativa de reparo em dutos e tubulações em operação com pequena espessura remanescente, envolvendo a recuperação prévia da parede do tubo por amanteigamento por processos de aspersão térmica. Avaliou-se a instabilidade apresentada pelo arco voltaico e alteração do perfil da zona fundida quando da deposição de solda por eletrodos revestidos sobre chapas de aço carbono previamente amanteigadas, com camadas de composição similar, pelos processos de aspersão térmica a chama e a arco-elétrico. Os resultados permitiram correlacionar a estabilidade do arco com o nível de oxidação das camadas aspergidas. (Medidas de temperatura do revestimento aspergido mostraram que, desde que o processo de aspersão ocorra de forma ininterrupta até a espessura final do revestimento, a temperatura {{superficial}} é crescente com a espessura do depósito, o que resulta num maior teor de óxidos, associado tanto à uma instabilidade do cordão como à uma maior penetração da poça fundida). Difratogramas de raios-X nas camadas aspergidas e análises do teor de oxigênio na zona fundida dos cordões de solda comprovaram a influência desse elemento na alteração do perfil da zona fundida. Como alternativa ao uso de ar comprimido, foi avaliada sua substituição pelo argônio como gás de arraste, verificando-se efeitos muito benéficos - redução significativa da penetração e boa estabilidade do arco voltaico - admite-se que advindos da redução da oxidação da camada aspergida pelo efeito protetor do gás inerte. A avaliação dos resultados permitiu estabelecer critérios de soldagem com menor risco de perfuração se comparados a uma condição sem revestimento prévio por aspersão térmica. This work brings promising results {{about an}} alternative way of welding in-service repair of pipes with low reminiscent thickness, which involves a previous <b>buttering</b> <b>coating</b> {{of the pipe}} wall by thermal spraying. The characteristics of buttering layers deposited by two thermal spraying processes (arc and conventional flame) were compared, in special the influence of their degree of oxidation in dependence of the carrying gas (pressurized air or argonium) on the arc stability and penetration of weld beads SMAW over plain carbon steels previously buttered with similar composition layers. The results allowed to correlate {{the stability of the}} arc to the level of oxidation of the sprayed layers. (Temperature measurements {{on the surface of the}} sprayed layers showed that, since the process of thermal spray occur in an non-stopped way until the final thickness of the coating, the superficial temperature is increased with the thickness of the deposit, what results in a higher content of oxides, which is associated to an arc instability and a greater penetration of the molten pool.) X-ray diffractrogams and oxygen analysis proved the influence of this element in the changing profile of the fusion zone. As an alternative to the use of compressed air, its substitution by the inert gas argon as carrying gas was evaluated, verifying very benefic effects - significant reduction of penetration e good arc stability - believed coming from the reduction of oxidation in the sprayed layer by the protective effect of the inert gas. The evaluation of the results permitted to establish criteria of welding with lower risks of burn-through compared to a condition without buttering layers...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} employing starch-protein hydrolysate of amaranth flour to produce protective edible coatings on butter. Tests were run on 3 types of coating solutions. The first {{was made in}} such manner that to hydrolysate of 40 -% dry matter content, 30 -% (w/w) plasticiser (glycerol) was added and also 3 -% (w/w) emulsifying agent (lecithin). The second and third contained an extra 2 -% (w/w) antioxidant (ascorbic acid) and the third an extra 2 -% (w/w) cross-linking agent (dialdehyde starch). Protective layers on butter were produced by coating with <b>coat</b> solutions. <b>Butters</b> were stored {{for a total of}} 96 days in refrigerator at a temperature of 7 ± 1. 5 °C and relative humidity of 36 ± 3 %. The objective was to investigate the oxidation course of butter with protective coatings, butter wrapped in original wrapping and butter without wrapping/coat. Determined values were peroxide value, acid value and anisidine value. Results of butters with protective and edible polymer coatings displayed a similar oxidation course to that of butter in standard wrapping. <b>Butter</b> with a <b>coat</b> containing antioxidant exhibited slightly lower levels of peroxide value during storage than butter in original wrapping, which confirms good barrier properties to oxygen of the coating thus prepared...|$|R
