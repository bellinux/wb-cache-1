50|$|Levopropylhexedrine (Eventin) is a {{psychostimulant}} {{used as an}} anorectic in Germany and {{patented by}} Smith Kline & French in 1947. It has also {{been used in the}} anticonvulsant preparation <b>barbexaclone</b> in combination with phenobarbital to offset sedation. Levopropylhexedrine is the S-enantiomer of propylhexedrine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Barbexaclone</b> (Maliasin) is a salt {{compound}} of phenobarbital and levopropylhexedrine. It {{was introduced in}} 1983. It {{has been reported to}} be as effective as phenobarbital but better tolerated; however, as of 2004, these [...] "promising results" [...] had not yet been confirmed nor denied in controlled trials.|$|E
50|$|Propylhexedrine {{has also}} seen use in Europe as an {{appetite}} suppressant under the trade name Obesin {{and in the}} anticonvulsant preparation <b>barbexaclone</b> its S-isomer (levopropylhexedrine or L-propylhexedrine) is bonded with phenobarbital {{for the purpose of}} offsetting the barbiturate-induced sedation. Levopropylhexedrine is also used as an anorectic under the brand name Eventin.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} <b>barbexaclone</b> on the frequency of seizures {{in a group of}} 40 epileptics, previously treated with phenobarbital. The effect of <b>barbexaclone</b> compared with phenobarbital on vigilance was assessed by means of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, visuomotor reaction times in lateralized vision, and a subjective scale. After four and eight months of <b>barbexaclone</b> therapy, serum phenobarbital levels were substantially unchanged, while the frequency of seizures was reduced by at least half in 25 % of the patients examined. In the level of vigilance, patients reported less drowsiness, confirmed by improvements in performance of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. No specific correlation with reaction times was observed, howeve...|$|E
40|$|The Lennox-Gastaut {{syndrome}} {{has been}} a source of interest for many workers both from a clinical and electroencephalographic view point. Treatment has always posed problems. Without suggesting an ideal medication for this syndrome, the authors have obtained good results with <b>barbexaclone.</b> Taking into consideration the convulsive manifestations, psychic changes and electroencephalographic details as parameters the therapeutic efficacy of this drug was studied in seven cases...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} reasons to change the drugs in {{epilepsy}} patients such as inadequate seizure control, adverse effects which cannot be tolerated, pregnancy, comorbid disease, etc. Difficulty of finding the drug is another rare reason for treatment change, even if the seizures are well controlled. In this article, we presented and discussed appropriate approaches for changing treatment in three different epileptic patients who have good seizure control with <b>barbexaclone</b> until discontinuation...|$|E
40|$|Os autores fazem um ensaio clínico aberto em pacientes epilépticos com <b>barbexaclone</b> que é associação de fenobarbital com leve estimulante do sistema nervoso central i-I-cicloIiexil- 2 -metil-aminopropano). Foram estudados 40 casos de pacientes de 0 - 12 anos de idade, de ambos os sexos. Todos os pacientes apresentavam crises convulsivas tipo Grande Mal, associadas ou não a outras manifestações epilépticas. Após analisar diversos aspectos do grupo, os autores consideram satisfatório o resultado conseguido: muito bom ou bom em 82, 5 % dos casos. A open clinic assay with <b>barbexaclone</b> {{which is}} an {{association}} of phenobar-vital with light stimulant of the central nervour system (i-l-ciclohexil- 2 -methilaminopropane) {{for the treatment of}} epileptic disorders is reported. The authors have studied 40 patients aged between 0 - 12 years of age, of both sexes, all of them having convulsive seizures of the Grand Mal type associated or not to other epileptic manifestations. After analysing the different aspects of the group they consider satisfactory the results obtained: very good or good in 82, 5 % of the cases...|$|E
