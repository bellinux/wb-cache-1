His mother's kindred had brought him in contact with the Roman Catholic priests who circulated in England, at the utmost peril of their lives, to keep up the faith of the gentry, and in many cases to intrigue for Queen Mary. Among these plotters he fell in with Cuthbert Langston, a Jesuit of the third order, though not a priest, {{and one of the most}} active agents in corresponding with Queen Mary. His small stature, colourless complexion, and insignificant features, rendered him almost a <b>blank</b> <b>block,</b> capable of assuming any variety of disguise. He also knew several languages, could imitate different dialects, and counterfeit male and female voices so that very few could detect him. He had soon made himself known to Babington as the huckster Tibbott of days gone by, and had then disclosed to him that Cicely was certainly not the daughter of her supposed parents, telling of her rescue from the wreck, and hinting that her rank was exalted, and that he knew secrets respecting her which he was about to make known to the Queen of Scots. With this purpose among others, Langston had adopted the disguise of the woman selling spars with the password [...] "Beads and Bracelets," [...] and being well known as an agent of correspondence to the suite of the captive Queen, he had been able to direct Gorion's attention to the maiden, and to let him know that she was the same with the infant who had been put on board the Bride of Dunbar at Dunbar.|$|E

This new procedure is very suitable for housing parts with high surface qualities at the outside and narrow tolerances or threads at the inside. The patented procedure combines the milling process with the casting of 2 k plastics. A tool half of th e component, to be manufactured, is milled in a <b>blank</b> <b>block</b> and subsequently filled with plastics. Since the plastics cannot whirl and it is thus able to shrink freely, no air enclosures emerge. After the hardening of the casting material the inner contour is milled.

50|$|For example, {{assuming}} an exposure area of 1 cm2, {{a dose of}} 10−3 coulombs/cm2, and a {{beam current}} of 10−9 amperes, the resulting minimum write time would be 106 seconds (about 12 days). This minimum write time does not include time for the stage to move back and forth, as well as time for the beam to be <b>blanked</b> (<b>blocked</b> from the wafer during deflection), as well as time for other possible beam corrections and adjustments {{in the middle of}} writing. To cover the 700 cm2 surface area of a 300 mm silicon wafer, the minimum write time would extend to 7*108 seconds, about 22 years. This is a factor of about 10 million times slower than current optical lithography tools. It is clear that throughput is a serious limitation for electron beam lithography, especially when writing dense patterns over a large area.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{a simple}} technique for flat-osmicating and flat-embedding of immunolabelled vibratome sections. The technique is particularly useful for large specimens such as whole cross-sections of rat spinal cord. After the vibratome section has been flat-osmicated {{on a flat}} surface under a glass cover slip, it is dehydrated and then embedded by placing it in a small drop of epoxy resin on a flat base of polypropylene plastic and overlaying a small square piece of cellulose acetate cut from heat-resistant overhead projector transparency film for photocopying. The thin layer of resin containing the flat-embedded vibratome section is then separated from the base and glued onto the flat end of a pre-polymerised <b>blank</b> <b>block</b> of resin. The method produces flat-embedded vibratome sections and thus allows serial large uniformly labelled semithin and ultrathin sections to be obtained of the whole cross-section of the rat spinal cord. This facilitates the observation and quantification of labelled cells in the specimen.

40|$|With {{the large}} number of {{existing}} documents and the increasing speed in the production of new documents, finding efficient methods to process these documents for their content retrieval and storage becomes critical. Tables are a popular and efficient document element type. Therefore, table structure understanding is an important problem in the document layout analysis field. This paper presents a table structure understanding algorithm using optimization methods. It includes steps of column style labeling, large horizontal <b>blank</b> <b>block</b> equivalence subsets location, statistical refinement, iterative updating optimization and table decomposition. The column style labeling, statistical refinement and iterative updating optimization steps are probability based, where the probabilities are estimated from geometric measurements made on the various entities with which the algorithm works in a large training set. Each step of our table structure understanding algorithm has some tuning parameters. We initially set the parameters with some conjectural values. Then with a global parameter optimization scheme, we update these values using a line search optimization algorithm. We use a performance evaluation protocol employing an area overlapping measure. With this scheme, we can obtain statistically satisfactory tuning parameter values on the fly. Large data sets with ground truth are essential in assessing the performance of a computer vision algorithm. Manually generating document ground truth proved to be very costly and prone to involve subjective errors. We address this problem by using an automatic table ground truth generation system which can efficiently generate a large amount of accurate groun...|$|E

40|$|Interference {{is a major}} {{performance}} bottleneck in Heterogeneous Network (HetNet) due to its multi-tier structure. We propose almost <b>blank</b> resource <b>block</b> (ABRB) for interference {{control in}} HetNet. When an ABRB is scheduled in a macro BS, a resource <b>block</b> (RB) with <b>blank</b> payload is transmitted and this eliminates the interference from this macro BS to the pico BSs. We study a two timescale hierarchical radio resource management (RRM) scheme for HetNet with dynamic ABRB control. The long term controls, such as dynamic ABRB, are adaptive to the large scale fading at a RRM server for co-Tier and cross-Tier interference control. The short term control (user scheduling) is adaptive to the local channel state information at each BS to exploit the multi-user diversity. The two timescale optimization problem is challenging due to the exponentially large solution space. We exploit the sparsity in the interference graph of the HetNet topology and derive structural properties for the optimal ABRB control. Based on that, we propose a two timescale alternative optimization solution for user scheduling and ABRB control. The solution has low complexity and is asymptotically optimal at high SNR. Simulations show that the proposed solution has significant gain over various baselines...|$|R

40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopic (TEM) {{observation of}} human chromosome ultrastructure may provide useful information on various abnormalities. Due to {{the difficulties in}} detaching metaphase chromosome spreads from the glass slide, this approach has been restricted. We introduce a simplified protocol in which the metaphase chromosome spreads are made on a flexible thermoplastic membrane (Aclar film) glued to the routine microscopic glass slides. The chromosome spreads are then impregnated with 1 % osmium tetroxide, stained with freshly prepared 2 % tannic acid, dehydrated, and flat-embedded in epoxy resin. After polymerization, the epoxy resin sheet is easily detached from the Aclar film and all chromosome spreads retain on the resin sheet. Each chromosome spread is identified under a light microscope, demarcated, trimmed then attached to a pre-polymerized <b>blank</b> epoxy resin <b>block.</b> Ultrathin sections are cut and observed under a transmission electron microscope.

40|$|Solid-state drives (SSDs) are {{inherently}} different from traditional drives, as they incorporate data-optimization mechanisms to over-come their limitations (such as {{a limited number}} of program-erase cycles, or the need of <b>blanking</b> a <b>block</b> before writing). The most common optimizations are wear leveling, trimming, compression, and garbage collection, which operate transparently to the host OS and, in certain cases, even when the disks are disconnected from a computer (but still powered up). In simple words, SSD controllers are designed to hide these internals completely, rendering them inaccessible if not through direct acquisition of the memory cells. These optimizations {{have a significant impact on}} the forensic analysis of SSDs. The main cause is that memory cells could be pre-emptively blanked, whereas a traditional drive sector would need to be explicitly rewritten to physically wipe off the data. Unfortunately, the existing literature on this subject is sparse and the conclusions are seemingly contradictory. In this paper we propose a generic, practical, test-driven method-ology that guides researchers and forensics analysts through a series of steps that assess the “forensic friendliness ” of a SSD. Given a drive of the same brand and model of the one under analysis, our methodology produces a decision that helps an analyst to determine whether or not an expensive direct acquisition of the memory cells is worth the effort, because the extreme optimizations may have rendered the data unreadable or useless. We apply our methodology to three SSDs produced by top vendors (Samsung, Corsair, and Crucial), and provide a detailed description of how each step should be conducted. 1...|$|R

The finishing license was therefore a manufacturing license, and according to Univis, was within the protected dispensation of the General Talking Pictures case. But the Supreme Court held {{that even though the}} lens blanks were unpatented their sale by the patentee triggered exhaustion of the patent. The Court considered that the blanks [...] "embodied essential features of the patented device", they were not used for anything else, and that was sufficient to trigger the exhaustion doctrine. Since Univis's patent rights were exhausted by the sale of the lens blanks, the post-sale price and other restrictions that Univis imposed on the finishers were held illegal and in violation of the antitrust laws.|$|R
2500|$|Resilver (repair) of a crashed disk in a ZFS RAID {{can take}} a long time (this is not unique to ZFS, it applies to all types of RAID, in one way or another). This means that very large volumes can take several days to repair or to being back to full {{redundancy}} after severe data corruption or failure, and during this time a second disk failure may occur, especially as the repair puts additional stress on the system as a whole. In turn this means that configurations that only allow for recovery of a single disk failure, such as RAIDZ1 (similar to RAID5) should be avoided. Therefore, with large disks, one should use RAIDZ2 (allow two disks to crash) or RAIDZ3 (allow three disks to crash). [...] It should be noted however, that ZFS RAID differs from conventional RAID by only reconstructing live data and metadata when replacing a disk, not the entirety of the disk including <b>blank</b> and garbage <b>blocks,</b> which means that replacing a member disk on a ZFS pool that is only partially full will take considerably less time compared to conventional RAID.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Custis Harrison became University of Pennsylvania provost in 1894, and {{immediately}} removed Frank Furness as unofficial campus architect, replacing {{him with the}} young firm of Cope and Stewardson. Beginning with the Quadrangle Dormitories, Harrison and his architects remade the campus in an exuberant Neo-Jacobean Collegiate Gothic style. Maene's workshop provided expert architectural carving for the exteriors of the new buildings, including 69 grotesques (bosses) for the Quadrangle. These caricatures of people and animals were carved in situ - <b>blank</b> limestone <b>blocks</b> had been mortared in above the second story, and his crew stood upon scaffolding to carve them:Take, for instance, a boss of a man holding a tankard. The architect makes a rough charcoal sketch of the figure and sends the sketch to the sculptor. The sculptor models it in clay. He makes, in clay, a boss {{of the same size}} and the same relief as the real stone boss on the dormitory building is to be. Of course, the charcoal sketch is not much to go by. The sculptor must use his brain in his work. It is not mechanical; it is real creative work on his part, this making of a model from a sketch. After the model has been finished and approved by the architect it is sent out to the University, and the carver sets it up beside him and gets to work on the stone. He measures here and there, makes nicks here and there, and then he proceeds to copy his model. It takes him three or four days to finish one of the fourteen inch bosses. The work must be done with care, delicacy and tact. Only the most skillful carvers are fit to do such jobs.Maene's team for the Quadrangle grotesques included Henry F. Plasschaert (of the Philadelphia School of Industrial Art), who modeled the figures in clay; William John Kaufmann and August Zeller (a former student of Thomas Eakins), who carved most of the grotesques; and Edmund T.

Then they were washed by phosphate-buffered solution (PBS, pH 7.4) three times. Then {{the cells were}} incubated at 20  mmol/L glycine in PBS for 5  min, and rinsed by chilled PBS 3  ×  5  min. DAB Kit (CWBIO) was used to stain cells for 15  min, followed by 3  ×  2  min rinses in chilled PBS. The formation of DAB polymer could be checked by transmission light microscope. The cells were further post-fixed and stained by 2 % osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Science) for 30  min, and rinsed by distilled water 3  ×  5  min. Then 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences) was placed on cells overnight. Thereafter, cells were gradient-dehydrated in ethanol series (30 %, 50 %, 70 %, 80 %, 95 %, 100 %) and 100 % acetone. During the dehydration process of using 100 % acetone, cells were transferred from ice temperature to room temperature. Cells were embedded by diluted Epon 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in acetone (25 %, 50 %, 75 %) for 2  h each and then by 100 % resin three times with each time for 2  h. Before the resin polymerization step, the plastic coverslip with cells was transferred to a six-well plate coated with aluminum foil: the aluminum foil {{on the bottom of}} plate needs to be as flat as possible. The surface of plastic coverslip with cells was upward, and fresh resin with accelerator was added into the plates to cover the cells. The polymerization was performed at 60  °C for 48  h. Then the blocks could be taken out from the six-well plate and carefully separated from the aluminum foil and plastic coverslip. The cells should be near the surface of the blocks. Before the following steps, the block could be observed under a light microscope and the areas with significant staining signals should be cut off and stuck on the tip of a <b>blank</b> resin <b>block</b> that was polymerized in standard flat embedding mold (Electron Microscopy Sciences).|$|R

Additionally, to remove the “pinches” Bremsstrahlung and 3 rd generation peaks, a 500  µm Al filter was used. In order to improve the detection of the lighter elements (Z[*]<[*]Ti), additional measurements were performed without the Al filter and at lower voltage (13  kV) and higher current (40  µA).
