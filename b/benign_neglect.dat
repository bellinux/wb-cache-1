On the other hand, elective nephrectomy is done for both benign and malignant diseases of the kidney. This study has been performed to know the different causes of nephrectomy in a rural, tertiary care center of India. In our series, we have studied all the elective nephrectomies done in our hospital during a period of eight years. We have analyzed 88 cases of nephrectomies regarding their age, sex, laterality of disease, and histopathologic report of the nephrectomy specimens. Out of 88 cases, 61 were males and 27 were females. In our series, 62. 5 % cases of nephrectomies were done for benign causes and 37. 5 % cases for malignant causes. Among the <b>benign</b> causes, <b>neglected</b> pelviureteric junction obstruction was the leading cause, followed by calculus disease resulting in obstruction. On the other hand, renal cell carcinoma was the most common malignant pathology requiring nephrectomy...|$|R
30|$|Beyond their mistaken identity, {{in terms}} of {{economic}} agency, the Soqotran pastoralists have always made up {{the majority of the population}} enduring the hinterland's austere living conditions, as if in a state of permanent socio-economic orphanage from external assistance, a situation that persists today. The economic exploitation of pastoralists during the Sultanate has mutated into a <b>benign</b> economic <b>neglect</b> from the political authorities at the local and national levels. Today, the pastoralists are the least integrated in the cash economy. This is partly due to a tradition of strong attachment to their lifestyle as well as a chronic absence of, or delayed and inadequate, interventions (e.g., schools, or employment generation schemes) in their territorial domain by governmental agencies until recently. The end result is the rise of a peculiar cultural-economic category, namely the transitional pastoralist, drawn by the pull of the cash economy of the town into the calling of an itinerant odd-jobber and driven by the push of an increasingly uneconomic pastoralist livelihood due to the vagaries of the environment and the seasonally constrained local market, and the lack of export opportunities for their livestock. Yet the pastoralist is unable to abandon one for the other, as both occupations are subject to the seasonal variability of economic opportunities on the island.|$|R

25|$|Pope Paul VI faced {{criticism}} {{throughout his}} papacy from both traditionalists and liberals for steering a middle course during Vatican II {{and in the}} course of the implementation of its reforms thereafter. His passion for peace during the Vietnam War was not understood by all. The urgent task of overcoming World poverty and start real development resulted partly in <b>benign</b> <b>neglect</b> of papal teachings by the influential and the rich. On basic Church teachings, this pope was unwavering. On the tenth anniversary of Humanae Vitae, he strongly reconfirmed his teachings. In his style and methodology, he was a disciple of Pius XII, whom he deeply revered. He suffered under the attacks of his predecessor for his alleged silences, knowing from personal association with the late pope the real concerns and compassion of Pius XII. Pope Paul is not credited to have had the encyclopaedic culture of Pius XII, nor his phenomenal memory, his amazing gift for languages, his brilliant style in writing, nor did he have the Charisma and outpouring love, sense of humor and human warmth of John XXIII. He took on himself the unfinished reform work of these two popes, bringing them diligently with great humility and common sense and without much fanfare to conclusion. In doing so, Paul VI saw himself following in the footsteps of the Apostle Paul, torn to several directions as Saint Paul, who always said, I am attracted to two sides at once, because the Cross always divides.|$|E

40|$|Background The Plasmodium vivax Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (PvAMA 1) is a {{promising}} malaria vaccine candidate, however {{it remains unclear}} which regions are naturally targeted by host immunity and whether its high genetic diversity will preclude coverage by a monovalent vaccine. To assess its feasibility as a vaccine candidate, we investigated the global population structure of PvAMA 1. Methodology and Principal Findings New sequences from Papua New Guinea (PNG, n =  102) were analysed together with published sequences from Thailand (n =  158), India (n =  8), Sri Lanka (n =  23), Venezuela (n =  74) {{and a collection of}} isolates from disparate geographic locations (n =  8). A total of 92 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified including 22 synonymous SNPs and 70 non-synonymous (NS) SNPs. Polymorphisms and signatures of balancing (positive Tajima&# 039;s D and low FST values) selection were predominantly clustered in domain I, suggesting it is a dominant target of protective immune responses. To estimate global antigenic diversity, haplotypes comprised of (i) non-singleton (n =  40) and (ii) common (≥ 10 % minor allele frequency, n =  23) polymorphic amino acid sites were then analysed revealing a total of 219 and 210 distinct haplotypes, respectively. Although highly diverse, the 210 haplotypes comprised of only common polymorphisms were grouped into eleven clusters, however substantial geographic differentiation was observed, and this may have implications for the efficacy of PvAMA 1 vaccines in different malaria-endemic areas. The PNG haplotypes form a distinct group of clusters not found in any other geographic region. Vaccine haplotypes were rare and geographically restricted, suggesting potentially poor efficacy of candidate PvAMA 1 vaccines. Conclusions It may be possible to cover the existing global PvAMA 1 diversity by selection of diverse alleles based on these analyses however it will be important to first define the relationships between the genetic and antigenic diversity of this molecule. Author Summary Traditionally misclassified as <b>benign</b> and <b>neglected</b> as a research priority, it is now understood that P. vivax is an increasingly important cause of human malaria. This important human pathogen poses an enormous obstacle to malaria control and elimination efforts due its broad geographic distribution, ability to cause recurring episodes of malaria after long periods of inactivity and extreme biodiversity. Vaccines are an essential component of global malaria control and elimination campaigns but the diversity of malaria antigens is thought to be a major cause of vaccine failure. Furthermore, at present the majority of current vaccine research is directed toward P. falciparum. The aims of this study were to investigate the global diversity of the P. vivax vaccine candidate, Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (PvAMA 1), to determine the feasibility of designing a globally effective PvAMA 1 vaccine and to determine which region of PvAMA 1 is targeted by host immune responses, in order to identify the most promising vaccine candidates. We report that PvAMA 1 diversity is extremely high, and that PvAMA 1 domain I is a dominant target of host immune responses. These analyses of PvAMA 1 diversity from several geographic regions provide a framework to guide development of a broadly efficacious P. vivax vaccine...|$|R
