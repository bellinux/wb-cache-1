40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} impact of using the Sherali-Adams {{procedure}} on highly symmetric integer programming problems. Linear relaxations of the extended formulations gen-) many variables for the level-d erated by Sherali-Adams can be very large, containing O ((n d closure. When large amounts of symmetry are present in the problem instance however, the symmetry can be used to generate a much smaller linear program that has an identical objective value. We demonstrate this by computing the bound associated with the level 1, 2, and 3 relaxations of several highly symmetric binary integer programming problems. We also present a class of constraints, called counting constraints, that further improves the bound, and in some cases provides a tight formulation. A major advantage of the Sherali-Adams formulation over the traditional formulation is that symmetry-breaking constraints can be more efficiently implemented. We show that using the Sherali-Adams formulation in conjunction with the symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>tool</b> isomorphism pruning can lead to the pruning of more nodes early on in the branch-and-bound process...|$|E

At present, guards on {{woodworking}} machine tools have to undergo an impact test with a 100 g projectile and an impact speed of 70 m/s {{to protect the}} operator against <b>breaking</b> <b>tools.</b> At the moment, only sheet metal housings and plastic elements of polycarbonate as well as particular safety curtain systems meet these requirements regarding the retention capacity of machine enclosures for woodworking centres according to EN 848 - 3.

40|$|Abstract. Tool {{monitoring}} is {{an important}} factor to restrict the improvement of production efficiency, machining quality and automation level. The monitoring of the tool wear and breakage conditions on YCM-V 116 B machining center was studied, and the acquired milling sound signals were analyzed in detail. By means of the classical time-frequency analysis, it was discovered that the wear sound had its own characteristic frequency band, and the frequency component within the frequency band would change according to the change of wear conditions. So that the frequency component within the frequency band will be a good indicator to monitor the tool wear conditions excellently. On the other hand, the tool breakage sound is a random signal that a transient change in amplitude is produced probably when <b>tool</b> <b>breaks.</b> The <b>tool</b> breakage conditions can be detected exactly by the advantages of wavelet decomposition techniques. The analysis implies that the sound generated during the machining process can be used to monitor tool conditions, which provides a new approach to the sound applications in tool monitoring domain...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{survey the}} {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} hand-arm vibration syndrome symptoms (HAVS), and to estimate past and current exposure to hand held vibrating tools {{in a sample of}} gas distribution operatives breaking and re-instating road surfaces. METHODS: 153 gas distribution operatives (participation rate 81 %) from three company districts were assessed by an administered questionnaire, a clinical examination, and a simple cold challenge test to the hands. Exposure histories were taken aided by a picture album of past and current tools. Information was obtained from several sources on the likely vibratory characteristics of those tools. Estimates were thus obtained of the frequency of blanching and neurological complaints in operatives, and of their lifetime hours of exposure and lifetime dose of vibration. RESULTS: On average, the sample had spent 16 years in employment involving use of vibratory tools. 24 % had symptoms or signs of blanching after use of tools in the industry; 46 % had troublesome persistent complaints of paraesthesiae or numbness, and these symptoms extended into the hands or arms in 18 % of workers. In 5. 9 % the distribution of symptoms was suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome; and of ulnar nerve entrapment in a further 3. 9 %. The risks of blanching and neurological complaints rose significantly with lifetime hours of use of vibrating tools and lifetime dose of vibration. Symptoms were generally mild and apparent only after a prolonged interval, but there were exceptions, and cases had occurred after lower recent exposures. CONCLUSIONS: It has been suggested that aspects of the gas distribution operative's work mitigate against the risk normally anticipated from use of pneumatic road <b>breaking</b> <b>tools.</b> By contrast our data suggest that symptoms of HAVS do occur, given sufficient exposure, a finding relevant not only to gas supply workers, but also to workers from other industries who break and repair road surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Titanium alloys are {{attractive}} materials for aerospace industry {{due to their}} exceptional strength to weight ratio that is maintained at elevated temperatures and their good corrosion resistance. Major applications of Titanium alloys were military aerospace industry, but since last decade the trend has now shifted towards commercial industry. On the other hand Titanium alloys are notorious for being poor thermal conductor that leads to them being difficult materials for machining. In this experimental study brazed carbide end mill of grade 5 is used for rough down milling of Ti 6 Al 4 V for large depth of cut under different combinations of parameters and application of high pressure coolant. The machining performance was evaluated in terms of tool wear, tool life, thermal crack and <b>tool</b> <b>breaking.</b> The <b>tool</b> wear was mostly observed at the tool tip and at bottom part of tool thermal cracks were observed which propagated with respect to time. Flank wear due to scratching of the cutting chips and diffusion wear because of high thermal stresses were observed specially {{at the bottom of}} the cutting tool. At cutting speed of 38 m/min tool wear couldn’t be observed due to tool failure because of fracture under high thermal stresses. It was found that maximum tool life is obtained at the speed of 25 m/min, feed rate of 150 mm/min and depth of cut of 10 mm. In the end it was concluded that machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V is a thermally dominant process which leads to high thermal stresses in machining zone that results in increasing tool wear rate and fracture propagation...|$|R

Atomic radii are now determined using the definitions by Tsai et al. ((JMB 1999, 290 : 253). The old classifier is still available as the variable freesasa_oons_classifier. 	Atomic radii are determined when a structure is read and stored with the structure. This means {{that they do not have}} to be calculated explicitly as before. It also means that the signature of a few of the central functions have changed. The default behavior is to guess the radius of unrecognized atoms, but the user can pass an option to specify that they should be skipped or that reading should halt when this happens. 	When memory allocation fails, the library attempts to clean up as much memory as possible. When emulating this error in the file tests/broken_malloc. c Valgrind detects no memory leaks from within the library. 	Two scripts have been added to facilitate generating classifiers, see the files for explanations of what they do. Internal changes: 	The default classifier is stored the same way as the classifiers generated from config-files. This reduces code size slightly, and makes configuring easier. The default classifier is stored statically in src/protor. c. This code has been generated automatically using the scripts added in this release...|$|R
