40|$|We derive the {{fraction}} of <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{in a sample of}} clusters at z < 0. 11 and the general field at the same redshift. The value of the blue fraction is observed to depend on the luminosity limit adopted, cluster-centric radius and, more generally, local galaxy density, but it does not depend on cluster properties. Changes in the blue fraction are due to variations in the relative proportions of red and <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> but the star formation rate for these two galaxy groups remains unchanged. Our results are most consistent with a model where the star formation rate declines rapidly and the <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> tend to be dwarfs and do not favour mechanisms where the Butcher-Oemler effect is caused by processes specific to the cluster environment...|$|R
40|$|Galaxies grow {{through both}} {{internal}} and external processes. In about 10 % of nearby red galaxies with little star formation, gas and stars are counter-rotating, demonstrating the importance of external gas acquisition in these galaxies. However, systematic studies of such phenomena in <b>blue,</b> star-forming <b>galaxies</b> are rare, leaving uncertain the role of external gas acquisition in driving evolution of <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Based on new measurements with integral field spectroscopy of a large representative galaxy sample, we find an appreciable fraction of counter-rotators among <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> (9 out of 489 galaxies). The central regions of blue counter-rotators show younger stellar populations and more intense, ongoing star formation than their outer parts, indicating ongoing growth of the central regions. The result offers observational evidence that the acquisition of external gas in <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> is possible; the interaction with pre-existing gas funnels the gas into nuclear regions (< 1 kpc) to form new stars.

Luminosity density jB has fallen by 0. 6 dex for <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> but has remained nearly constant for red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass of <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> have been substantially constant since z ∼ 1, whereas those of red galaxies (near L*) have been significantly rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a "mixed" scenario is proposed in which star formation in <b>blue</b> cloud <b>galaxies</b> is quenched, causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in {{a small number of}} stellar mergers. This mixed scenario matches the local boxy-disky transition for nearby ellipticals, as well as red sequence stellar population scaling laws such as the color-magnitude and Mg-σ relations (which are explained as fossil relics from <b>blue</b> progenitors). <b>Blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> enter the red sequence via different quenching modes, each of which peaks at a different characteristic mass and time. The red sequence therefore likely builds up in different ways at different times and masses, and the concept of a single process that is "downsizing" (or upsizing) probably does not apply.

40|$|We {{present a}} method to study the {{photometric}} properties of galaxies in filaments by stacking the galaxy populations between pairs of galaxy clusters. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, this method can detect the inter-cluster filament galaxy overdensity with a significance of ∼ 5 σ out to z= 0. 40. Using this approach, we study the g-r color and luminosity distribution of filament galaxies {{as a function of}} redshift. Consistent with expectation, filament galaxies are bimodal in their color distribution and contain a larger <b>blue</b> <b>galaxy</b> population than clusters. Filament galaxies are also generally fainter than cluster galaxies. More interestingly, the observed filament population seems to show redshift evolution at 0. 12 <z< 0. 40 : the <b>blue</b> <b>galaxy</b> fraction has a trend to increase at higher redshift: a filament "Butcher Oemler Effect". We test the dependence of the observed filament density on the richness of the cluster pair: richer clusters are connected by higher density filaments. We also test the spatial dependence of filament galaxy overdensity: this quantity decreases when moving away from the inter-cluster axis between a cluster pair. This method provides an economical way to probe the photometric properties of filament galaxies and should prove useful for upcoming projects like the Dark Energy Survey.

Using data from Phase 1 of GAMA, taken over three observing seasons, and correcting for various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands. At low redshift, z < 0. 1, we find that <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies,</b> defined according to a magnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fitted over a range of more than 10 magnitudes by simple Schechter functions in all bands. Red galaxies, and the combined blue plus red sample, require double power-law Schechter functions to fit a dip in their LF faintwards of the characteristic magnitude M* before a steepening faint end. This upturn is at least partly due to dust-reddened disc galaxies. We measure {{the evolution of the}} galaxy LF over the redshift range 0. 002 < z < 0. 5 both by using a parametric fit and by measuring binned LFs in redshift slices.

40|$|Cosmological {{constraints}} from galaxy clusters rely on {{accurate measurements}} of the mass and internal structure of clusters. An important source of systematic uncertainty in cluster mass and structure measurements is the secure selection of background galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by clusters. This issue {{has been shown to}} be particular severe for faint <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies.</b> We therefore explore the selection of faint <b>blue</b> background <b>galaxies,</b> by reference to photometric redshift catalogs derived from the COSMOS survey and our own observations of massive galaxy clusters at z~ 0. 2. We show that methods relying on photometric redshifts of galaxies in/behind clusters based on observations through five filters, and on deep 30 -band COSMOS photometric redshifts are both inadequate to identify safely faint <b>blue</b> background <b>galaxies.</b> This is due to the small number of filters used by the former, and absence of massive galaxy clusters at redshifts of interest in the latter. We therefore develop a pragmatic method to combine both sets of photometric redshifts to select a population of <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> based purely on photometric analysis. This sample yields stacked weak-lensing results consistent with our previously published results based on red galaxies.

A model is presented which satisfies the recently measured constraints on all 3 correlation functions (galaxy/galaxy, background/background and galaxy/background).

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{luminosity}} and color properties of galaxies selected from a sample of 57 low-redshift Abell clusters. We utilize the non-parametric dwarf-to-giant ratio (DGR) and the <b>blue</b> <b>galaxy</b> fraction (fb) to investigate the clustercentric radial-dependent changes in the cluster galaxy population. Composite cluster samples are combined by scaling the counting radius by r 200 to minimize radius selection bias. The separation of galaxies into a red and blue population was achieved by selecting galaxies relative to the cluster color-magnitude relation. The DGR of the red and blue galaxies is found to be independent of cluster richness (Bgc), although the DGR is larger for the blue population at all measured radii. A decrease in the DGR for the red and red+blue galaxies is detected in the cluster core region, while the <b>blue</b> <b>galaxy</b> DGR is nearly independent of radius. The fb is found not to correlate with Bgc; however, a steady decline toward the inner-cluster region is observed for the giant galaxies. The dwarf galaxy fb is approximately constant with clustercentric radius except for the inner cluster core region where fb decreases. The clustercentric radial dependence of the DGR and the galaxy blue fraction, indicates that it is unlikely that a simple scenario based on either pure disruption or pure fading/reddening can describe the evolution of infalling dwarf galaxies; both outcomes are produced by the cluster environment.

The significant amount of cold gas in low-z early-type galax-ies found in simulations, in agreement with recent observations (Thom et al.) is intriguing, so is the dominance of hot gas at large radii in <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Subject headings: hydrodynamics — shock waves — supernovae: general — galaxies: halos — intergalactic medium — cosmology: theory 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{measure the}} mass growth rate by merging {{for a wide}} range of galaxy types. We present the {{small-scale}} (0. 014 < r < 11 h 70 ^- 1 Mpc) projected cross-correlation functions w(rp) of galaxy subsamples from the spectroscopic sample of the NYU VAGC (5 × 10 ^ 5 galaxies of redshifts 0. 03 < z < 0. 15) with galaxy subsamples from the SDSS imaging (4 × 10 ^ 7 galaxies). We use smooth fits to de-project the two-dimensional functions w(rp) to obtain smooth three-dimensional real-space cross-correlation functions ξ(r) for each of several spectroscopic subsamples with each of several imaging subsamples. Because close pairs are expected to merge, the three-space functions and dynamical evolution time estimates provide galaxy accretion rates. We find that the accretion onto massive <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> and onto red galaxies is dominated by red companions, and that onto small-mass <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies,</b> red and <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> make comparable contributions. We integrate over all types of companions and find that at fixed stellar mass, the total fractional accretion rates onto red galaxies (∼ 1. 5 h 70 percent per Gyr) is greater than that onto <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> (∼ 0. 5 h 70 percent per Gyr). Although these rates are very low, they are almost certainly over-estimates because we have assumed that all close pairs merge as quickly as dynamical friction permits.

40|$|The DEEP 2 and COMBO- 17 {{surveys are}} used to study the {{evolution}} of the luminosity function of red and <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> to z ∼ 1. Schechter function fits show that, since z = 1, M ∗ B dims by ∼ 1. 3 mag per unit redshift for both color classes, φ ∗ of <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> shows little change, while φ ∗ for red galaxies has formally nearly quadrupled. At face value, the number density of <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> has remained roughly constant since z = 1, whereas that of red galaxies has been rising. Luminosity densities support both conclusions, but we note that most red-galaxy evolution occurs between our data and local surveys and in our highest redshift bin, where the data are weakest. We discuss the implications of having most red galaxies emerge after z = 1 from precursors among the blue population, taking into account the properties of local and distant E/S 0 s. We suggest a “mixed ” scenario in which some <b>blue</b> <b>galaxies</b> have their star-formation quenched in gas-rich mergers, migrate to the red sequence with a variety of masses, and merge further on the red sequence in one or more purely stellar mergers. E/S 0 s of a given mass today will have formed via different routes, in a manner that may help to explain the fundamental plane and other local scaling laws.
