40|$|International audienceThere is {{presently}} very little information available concerning long term operation with group <b>B</b> <b>oxygen</b> carriers for the Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) process. It is therefore {{difficult to predict}} the attrition at industrial scale based on existing tools and methodologies for the different oxygen carriers available. The CLC process is similar in its configuration to the Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) process with particles circulating in a loop between different reactors. Therefore for the CLC process development perspectives, {{it is interesting to}} compare the different oxygen carriers with a FCC catalyst of which data at industrial scale are available. A method to compare the mechanical resistance to attrition of solids from different fluidization groups was developed in this work. In order to deal with small amount s of particle samples, experiments are conducted using lab scale testing with a Jet Cup rig. Two solids of interest were considered in this study, a Group <b>B</b> <b>oxygen</b> carrier with a density of 3600 kg/m 3 and a mean particle diameter (dp 50) of 180 microns, and a group A FCC equilibrium catalyst with a particle density of 1450 kg/m 3 and a mean particle diameter (dp 50) of 70 microns. First, we defined a new attrition index that does not depend upon a given particle size. This index is based on the total percentage of particles generated by attrition and it is called TPGI (Total Particles Generated Index). This index also gives the possibility to estimate the maximum diameter of particles generated by attrition. It was found that attrition in the jet cup is proportional to the contact frequency between the air jet and the particles. Therefore it is necessary to estimate the particles circulation within the air jet for each solid tested in order to make sure that particles go through the same mechanical stress. For this purpose, a CFD study using Barracuda™ was carried out on the two solids of interest. CFD results showed that in order to have the same circulation of particles in the air jet, therefore the same mechanical stress, tests should be carried out with the same initial volume of particles. It is important to notice that this conclusion is valid for the two solids of interest, another CFD study should be done for solids with different properties. Finally, the particles mechanical resistance is characterized by the TPGPI increase rate with respect to the test duration. This parameter is then be used to compare the solids tested, the oxygen carrier being more resistant than the FCC catalyst in this study case...|$|E

40|$|We {{search for}} OVI {{absorption}} in a Keck HIRES {{spectrum of the}} z= 3. 62 quasar Q 1422 + 231. Comparison of CIV measurements to cosmological simulations shows that forest absorbers with N_HI > 10 ^ 14. 5 have [C/H] =- 2. 5, for the UV background spectrum of Haardt & Madau (HM). Lower column density absorption arises in lower density gas, where OVI is the most sensitive metal tracer. Since OVI lines lie at wavelengths contaminated by Lyman series absorption, we interpret our Q 1422 results by comparing to artificial spectra drawn from an SPH simulation of a Lambda-dominated CDM model. A search for deep, narrow features in Q 1422 yields only a few candidate OVI lines, statistically consistent with the number in artificial spectra with no metals; spectra generated with the HM background and [O/H] >= - 2. 5 predict too many narrow lines. However, applying the optical depth ratio technique of Songaila (1998), we DO find significant OVI associated with CIV systems; matching Q 1422 requires [O/C] =+ 0. 5, implying [O/H] =- 2. 0.

40|$|The bivalve Arctica islandica is {{extremely}} long lived (> 400 years) and can tolerate {{long periods of}} hypoxia and anoxia. European populations differ in maximum life spans (MLSP) from 40 years in the Baltic to > 400 years around Iceland. Characteristic behavior of A. islandica involves phases of metabolic rate depression (MRD) during which the animals burry into the sediment for several days. During these phases the shell water oxygen concentrations reaches hypoxic to anoxic levels, which possibly support the long life span of some populations. We investigated gene regulation in A. islandica from a long-lived (MLSP 150 years) German Bight population and the short-lived Baltic Sea population, experimentally exposed to different oxygen levels. A new A. islandica transcriptome enabled the identification of genes important during hypoxia/anoxia events and, more generally, gene mining for putative stress response and (anti-) aging genes. Expression changes of a) antioxidant defense: Catalase, Glutathione peroxidase, manganese and copper-zinc Superoxide dismutase; <b>b)</b> <b>oxygen</b> sensing and general stress response: Hypoxia inducible factor alpha, Prolyl hydroxylase and Heat-shock protein 70; and c) anaerobic capacity: Malate dehydrogenase and Octopine dehydrogenase, related transcripts were investigated.

40|$|The Middle Miocene Climate Transition (~ 15 - 13. 7 Ma) {{is one of}} {{the major}} steps in Cenozoic climate evolution. The rapid {{expansion}} of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet at ~ 13. 9 – 13. 7 Ma caused important climate changes on a global scale. The aim of this PhD research has been to study the effects of the Middle Miocene Climate Transition in the Mediterranean area and to improve the age models for this crucial time interval. Sediments from the Adriatic coast near Ancona (Italy) and from the Maltese Islands (Malta and Gozo) record the Middle Miocene Climate Transition in the Mediterranean. Bulk and foraminiferal carbonate isotope records have been constructed to record the major ? 18 O isotope event and the ? 13 C carbon excursions associated with the Monterey Carbon Excursion (CM-events). The benthic and bulk carbonate isotope records show a shift in ? 18 O between ~ 13. 92 and 13. 76 Ma which can be related to the Mi 3 <b>b</b> <b>oxygen</b> isotope event. The ? 13 C carbon excursions CM 5 a, CM 5 b and CM 6 are observed in the benthic and planktic records. A divergence between the planktic and benthic isotope signals points to an enhanced contrast between surface and deep water possibly related to increased run-off and decreased ventilation. Geochemical records show precession controlled enrichments in Ti/Al and Zr/Al, which suggests eolian dust input. Dust input becomes more significant during and after the MMCT, which may evidence aridification of North Africa. From 13. 8 Ma onwards, distinct quadruplet cycles containing sapropelitic sediments are observed, suggesting a causal connection between the main Middle Miocene cooling step, and sedimentation and circulation in the Mediterranean. Alternation between sediments enriched in eolian dust and the occurrence of sapropels suggest that the African monsoon system was already operative in the middle Miocene. Benthic assemblages from the Maltese Islands point to a mesotrophic and well ventilated environment before 13. 8 Ma. The rapid increase in terrestrial clay influx at ~ 13. 76 Ma, related to enhanced river runoff, caused an increase in food availability and lower bottom water oxygen levels. The benthic assemblage responded by an increase in infaunal taxa. Ongoing environmental changes, related to restriction in circulation, after the MMCT are inferred from the successional increase in infaunal species and the occurrence of the first sapropelitic sediments. Comparing the astronomically tuned age models of the Mediterranean sections and Open Ocean records revealed several discrepancies. This is partly the consequence of a poor magnetobiostratigraphic framework causing misinterpretation of orbitally forced cycles in sedimentary records. The transition from the Globigerina Limestone Formation to the Blue Clay Formation on Malta is possibly not continuous and might contain a hiatus. Nevertheless, the major step in the climate transition remains concomitant with a 1. 2 Myr minimum in obliquity amplitudes and a ~ 400 kyr minimum in eccentricity, which confirms the proposition that this orbital configuration triggered extensive ice sheet growth...|$|E

40|$|Diamond and its {{thin films}} have {{acquired}} an extraordinary attractiveness and large potential industrial applications {{because of their}} highly valuable characteristics such as high carrier mobility, large energy gap making them good insulators with high thermal conductivity. Moreover, doping of various elements such as boron, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus in diamond further enhances its usefulness into applications of electronics and electrochemical devices. Such interesting characteristics have significantly {{attracted the attention of}} researchers and opened new ways for handling conductivity issues caused by impurity-induced metallization in diamonds. That's why, present study on the characterization of diamond thin films under various conditions/morphologies has been performed and divided into two parts: Experimental work as well as computational calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) using pseudopotential method involving spin-polarized GGA-PW 91 functionals on plane wave basis sets using VASP codes. Micro- and nano-crystalline diamond films have been deposited on silicon (100) wafers using hot filament chemical vapour deposition (HFCVD) method using source gases (CH 4 + H 2) as well as by doping different elements like boron (<b>B),</b> <b>oxygen</b> (O 2) and nitrogen (N 2) under different deposition conditions involving chamber pressure, doping concentration and gas flow rate. These films have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and van der pauw technique to measure and analyze structure, crystal quality, morphology and electrical resistivity of the deposited diamond films. Results have shown that diamond growth rate decreases at low methane concentrations but increases (3 orders) at high methane content in the deposition chamber. It also decreases on increasing chamber pressure, showing improvement in the quality of diamond crystals. The optimum CH 4 content for well faceted crystals is 3. 0 ml/min with minimum resistivity of 1. 79 x 107 ?-cm. Effect of doping on diamond characteristics demonstrates that as concentration of O 2 or B increases, high quality large sized 111 grains are deposited yielding low resistivity (105 ?-cm). However, such good quality micro-diamond grains are noticed at low N 2 concentrations. In addition, superposition of both nano- and micro-sized grains is observed at higher N 2 content. Resistivity of such films decreased significantly to 107 ?-cm due to increased sp 2 bonds. Theoretical aspects of doped diamond films demonstrate that both O 2 and B-atoms support the splitting of diamond energy band by forming impurity states near/at Fermi level and hence enhance conductivities of these thin films, this fact supports our experimental results of doped diamond films. Moreover high doping concentration affects significantly on atomic charge making it positive (1. 89 eV). On the other hand, transition metals (TMs) dopants become spin polarized by magnetizing p electrons of C-atoms through p-d hybridization. Such hybridization is strong for Cu-doping as compared to other TM dopants and involves FM coupling state rather than AFM. The appearance of specific O (2 p) band at - 18 eV in the energy band spectrum of Odoped diamond signifies the existence of donor levels between valence and conduction bands which were very deep and lead to reduction of the energy gap (0. 865 eV).

The following four observations suggest that early admission may improve outcome: a) during the past decade, decreased mortality was observed in association with earlier ICU admission [11]; <b>b)</b> receiving <b>oxygen</b> at a flow higher than 1 liter/min is significantly associated with subsequent need for mechanical ventilation and death [73]; c) performing high-risk procedures in severely ill patients (i.e., bronchoscopy and BAL in hypoxemic patients) may be less harmful if performed in the ICU (sometimes under NIV) [40, 51, 74, 75]; and d) there is a linear relationship between the number of organ dysfunctions and patients' survival, suggesting that patients should best be admitted as early as possible rather than at a time of multiple organ failure where survival remains marginal.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to detect the effect of training of inspiratory muscle on respiratory failure patients. Method: Thirty patients with respiratory failure were selected from Cairo university hospital (critical care department). These patients were divided equally into two groups, study Group A and control Group B. Each patient of Group A received inspiratory muscles training using threshold inspiratory muscle trainer (IMT), while patients of Group B received only chest physiotherapy. Oxygen level and respiratory muscles strength for each group were measured. Result revealed significant improvement in both groups, improvement was higher in Group A more than Group <b>B</b> regarding <b>oxygen</b> level and respiratory muscles strength. Conclusion: Training of respiratory muscles using threshold inspiratory muscle trainer could be a useful in improving oxygen level and respiratory muscles power in patients with respiratory failure, this study revealed that, respiratory muscles training could be a helpful tool to improve oxygen level and inspiratory muscle strength for respiratory failure patients...|$|R
40|$|Background. Monocytes {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{to play a role}} in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) -positive vasculitis, but their state of activa-tion in vivo in patients is still unknown. Methods. Twelve consecutive patients with acute anti-proteinase 3 (PR 3) -positive vasculitis were included prospectively, and blood samples were drawn at diagnosis. As controls, peripheral blood was obtained from a group of patients with acute infection (n 12) and from healthy controls (n 12). Monocyte activation was estimated from the expression of adhesion molecules (CD 62 L and CD 11 <b>b),</b> production of <b>oxygen</b> radicals and serum concentrations of soluble inflammation markers and adhesion molecule...|$|R

Phenomenological agreements with neutron and Raman experiments suggest that this mode is the <b>B</b> 1 g <b>oxygen</b> bond-buckling phonon. A theoretical calculation based on this assignment reproduces the electronic renormalization seen in the data. Comment: 4 Pages, 4 Figures Updated Figures and Tex...|$|R
