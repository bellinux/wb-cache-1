50|$|Embleton {{village and}} civil parish in the English county of Northumberland is about 0.5 mi {{from the bay}} that carries its name. The sandy beach is backed by dunes where a variety of flowers bloom: bluebells, cowslips, burnet roses and, to give it its common name, <b>bloody</b> <b>cranesbill,</b> amongst others. Dunstanburgh Castle stands at the {{southern}} end of Embleton Bay. Close by, to the south, is the fishing village of Craster.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{diversity}} of plants, especially in the meadow area. Some recently seen plants include Birdsfoot trefoil, <b>Bloody</b> <b>cranesbill,</b> Corncockle, Cowslip, Dog rose, Evening primrose, Field speedwell, Lesser periwinkle, Michaelmas daisy, Oxeye daisy, Vipers bugloss, Sweet violet, Lucerne, Wild gladiolus, Green alkanet, Herb robert, Lesser celandine, Marsh marigold, Purple loosestrife, Yellow flag, Wild strawberry, Yarrow and many others. Some of these have been introduced, others found their own way here.|$|E

50|$|A {{large part}} of the site is covered by broadleaved {{woodland}} with sessile oak, ash and sycamore among the dominant tree species. Notable plants in the woods include stinking hellebore, green-flowered helleborine and wayfaring tree. There are also areas of calcareous grassland with plants such as <b>bloody</b> <b>cranesbill</b> and lesser meadow-rue. Much of the site lies on an escarpment of Carboniferous limestone and there are three cave systems: Ogof Hesp Alyn, Ogof Hen Ffynhonnau and Ogof Nadolig. Lead ore, zinc ore, limestone and calcite were formerly mined in the area.|$|E
50|$|The rugged {{cliff face}} {{supports}} diverse flora mainly {{due to the}} nature of the rock formations. Species found lower down are: sea pink - Thrift armeria maritima, scurvygrass - Cochlaria officinalis, sea campion - Silene maritima, sea spleenwort - Asplenium marinum, rock samphire - Crithmum maritimum and the rare rock sea lavender - Limonium binervosum. Near the cliff top is <b>bloody</b> <b>cranesbill</b> - Geranium sanguineum, Wood vetch - Viccia sylvatica, Orpine - Sedum telephium and soft shield-fern - Polystichum setiferum.Along the cliff top, there can be found Dyerâ€™s greenweed - Genista tinctoria, western gorse - Ulex gallii, heather - Calluna vulgarisand bracken - Pteridium aquilinum.|$|E
50|$|All the {{fittings}} {{were designed}} by Paley and Austin, other than the lectern. The east window and the window {{on the north side}} of the chancel (the latter dated 1911), are by Heaton, Butler and Bayne; the window on the south side, dated 1906, is by Seward and Company. On the north side of the church is a memorial window to Norman Nicholson, a local poet who died in 1987. It was designed by Christine Boyce, inserted in 2000, and includes depictions of a bee orchid, a <b>bloody</b> <b>cranesbill,</b> Halley's Comet, and quotations from Nicholson's work. The original organ was built in about 1877 by Alfred Kirkland. It was replaced in 1972 with an organ by Keates that was moved from Morley. There is a ring of six bells, all cast by John Warner & Sons; the oldest dates from 1876, and the other five from 1921.|$|E
50|$|The Great Orme has a {{very rich}} flora, {{including}} most notably the only known site of the critically endangered wild cotoneaster (Cotoneaster cambricus), of which only six wild plants are known. Many of the flowers growing in shallow lime-rich earth on the headland have developed from the alpine sub-Arctic species that developed following the last ice-age. Spring and early summer flowers include <b>bloody</b> <b>cranesbill,</b> thrift and sea campion, clinging to the sheer rock face, while pyramidal orchid, common rockrose and wild thyme carpet the grassland. The old mines and quarries also provide suitable habitat for species of plants including spring squill growing on the old copper workings. The white horehound (Marrubium vulgare), which is found growing on the western-most slopes of the Orme {{is said to have}} been used, and perhaps cultivated, by 14th-century monks, no doubt to make herbal remedies including cough mixtures. The rare horehound plume moth (Wheeleria spilodactylus) lays her eggs amongst the silky leaves and its caterpillars rely for food solely upon this one plant.|$|E
50|$|North Queensferry is {{bounded by}} two sites of special {{scientific}} interest (SSSIs), one being the shoreline of the Firth of Forth, an SSSI for its entire extent on both {{north and south}} shores, and the other the Carlingnose Point Nature Reserve. The Forth shoreline is an SSSI both on account of its geology and its biological habitats, such as its mudflats which support numerous species of sea birds, {{many of which are}} to be seen and heard in and around North Queensferry. Carlingnose is designated on account of its exceptional plant life. The rare dropwort, field gentian and <b>bloody</b> <b>cranesbill</b> are all found here, along with some notable species of millipede and centipede. The reserve is also a good place to observe sea birds; fulmars nest on the old quarry cliffs at {{the north side of the}} reserve. Killer whales or orcas have been known to come up the Firth of Forth as far as Queensferry and have been observed from the coastal path which passes through the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Three {{quarters}} of Ireland's species of flowers {{are found in}} The Burren. The grikes (crevices) provide moist shelter, supporting {{a wide range of}} plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel, many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found, when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil, patches of grass are seen, interspersed with herbaceous plants. Among the flowers recorded from The Burren is the spring gentian, an alpine plant with bright blue flowers that are used as a symbol for the area by the tourist board. The Irish orchid (Neotinea intacta) and <b>bloody</b> <b>cranesbill</b> (Geranium sanguineum) also occur there. The area sports 22 species of orchids and numerous other flowers such as Anacamptis pyramidalis, Platanthera chlorantha, Neotinea maculata and Dryas octopetala. Another prominent presence in limestone grikes are around 24 types of fern, such as the Mediterranean Adiantum capillus-veneris. The area is notable for the unusually close vicinity of both plants that hate lime and those that do well on it. Acid-loving plants such as Calluna grow well on patches of acidid peat that effectively isolates them from the underlying basic limestone.|$|E
50|$|In 2014 the North Ayrshire Ranger Service {{carried out}} {{a survey of the}} plants growing on the rocky shore, whinstone dyke, {{saltmarsh}} and 'machair-like' seaside vegetation. Species recorded included sea arrowgrass (Triglochin maritima); sea sandwort (Honkenya peploides); scurvy-grass (Cochlearia officinalis); common orache (Atriplex patula); sea club-rush (Scirpus maritimus); sea milkwort (Glaux maritima); salt mud-rush (Juncus gerardii); lesser sea spurrey (Spergularia marina); cliff sand spurrey (Spergularia rupicola); sea aster (Aster tripolium); red bartsia (Odonitites verna); silverweed (Potentilla anserina); bird's foot trefoil (Lotus geniculatus); sea pink/thrift (Armeria maritima); eyebright (Euphrasia nemorosa); yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor); sea plantain (Plantago maritima); meadow cranesbill (Geranium pratense); purple loosetrife (Lythrum salicalia); pineapple weed (Matricaria matricariodes); curled dock (Rumex crispus); scentless mayweed (Matricaria maritima); corn sowthistle (Sonchus arvensis); marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre); lady's bedstraw (Galium verum); mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris); celery-leaved crowfoot (Ranunculus scleratus); ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi); yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus); parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii); greater woodrush (Luzula sylvatica); amphibious bistort (Polygonum amphibian); crow garlic (Allium vineale var. compactum); Japanese rose (Rosa rugosa); alder (Alnus glutinosa); sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides); wood sage (Teucreum scorodonia); hemlock water-dropwort (Oenanthe crocata); sticky groundsel (Senecio viscosus); <b>bloody</b> <b>cranesbill</b> (Geranium sanguineum); bracken/brake (Pteridium aquilinium); yellow splash lichen (Xanthoria parietina); crab's eye lichen (Ochrolechia parella); sea ivory (Ramalina siliquosa).|$|E
