Previously the Gulfton area was served by the Southwest Patrol division, {{headquartered}} on <b>Beechnut</b> Street. A June 1999 report entitled the Gulfton Community Five Year Plan, produced by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, stated that the sudden changes [...] in Gulfton's population exceeded the police department's ability to adapt. The establishment of the Gulfton Storefront Station augmented the police department's presence in Gulfton. This station, located near the Napoleon Square Apartments, opened {{in the summer of}} 1990 with the City of Houston paying one dollar a month to the real estate company managing the complex. The Gulfton Area Action Council paid the utility bills, estimated at $5,000 per month in 1990 ($ in today's money). The Civic Association of Shenandoah also provides support for the establishment of the sub-station. By 1998 the Fondren Patrol division was established with responsibility for the area.|$|E

To save on kerosene, the clocks were all put ahead one hour on 30 April 1916 so that better use could be made of daylight. The oil shortage was mitigated somewhat by organized gathering of <b>beechnuts.</b> Schoolchildren managed to gather up some 100 kg to sell to the Royal Forest Administration, and were allowed to keep half their <b>beechnuts.</b> On 4 December 1916, the churchbells were set ringing on His Majesty’s orders {{on the occasion of}} the victory on the river Argeş.

2500|$|A [...] boar needs around 4,000–4,500 {{calories}} of food per day, {{though this}} required amount increases during winter and pregnancy, {{with the majority}} of its diet consisting of food items dug from the ground like underground plant material and burrowing animals. Acorns and beechnuts are invariably its most important food items in temperate zones, as they are rich in the carbohydrates necessary for the buildup of fat reserves needed to survive lean periods. In Western Europe, underground plant material favoured by boars includes bracken, willow herb, bulbs, meadow herb roots and bulbs, and the bulbs of cultivated crops. Such food is favoured in early spring and summer, but may also be eaten in autumn and winter during <b>beechnut</b> and acorn crop failures. Should regular wild foods become scarce, boars will eat tree bark and fungi, as well as visit cultivated potato and artichoke fields. Boar soil disturbance and foraging have been shown to facilitate invasive plants. Boars of the vittatus subspecies in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java differ from most other populations by their primarily frugivorous diet, which consists of 50 different fruit species, especially figs, thus making them important seed dispersers. The wild boar can consume numerous genera of poisonous plants without ill effect, including Aconitum, Anemone, Calla, Caltha, Ferula, and Pteridium.|$|E

These simple methods {{can be used with}} little equipment in forest nurseries and are suggested to be accompanied with more advanced techniques, like restricting moisture content during moist cold stratification period to gain maximum benefit. Previous reports from European beech and the results from the effect of endocarp removal suggest a possible role of other agents in dormancy in oriental <b>beechnuts.</b> Water soluble phenolics extracts from the seed coats, significantly suppress the germination of radish seed. The endocarp may act as a barrier against exudation of these germination inhibitors. The deep embryo dormancy presents problems when assessing the viability of oriental beech nuts. It is therefore possible to test germination performance in semi-dormant nuts to predict the nut viability in this species. A dormant seedlot was stored in sub-chilling conditions for 15 months and a series of germination tests were conducted during the dormancy breakage period of stored and fresh nuts. The results showed that mean germination times for both nut groups were almost the same, but germination capacity was statistically different only for semi-dormant nuts. Non-dormant stored and fresh nuts showed no significant differences, which indicate the complexity of dormancy release in oriental beech nuts. Abscisic acid (ABA) contents of embryonic axes of stored and fresh nuts were measured during the dormancy breakage period, and results indicated a close correlation between ABA levels and increment in germination capacity as dormancy was released. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with partial least squares regression (PLS) were used as rapid and non-destructive methods for discrimination of sound and deteriorated single <b>beechnuts.</b> NIRS-PLS is a promising method for quality improvement of nearly all agricultural products and in this study showed 100 % accuracy in separation of viable and non-viable nuts...|$|R
