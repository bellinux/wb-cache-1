5|$|It {{is unknown}} if riders tried {{crossing}} the Sierra Nevada in winter, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> crossed central Nevada. By 1860 {{there was a}} telegraph station in Carson City, Nevada. The riders received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor {{at the time was}} about $0.43–$1 per day.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the long {{secondary}} periods is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> aren't due to radial pulsations. Interferometric observations of Betelgeuse have shown hotspots that {{are thought to be}} created by massive convection cells, a significant fraction of the diameter of the star and each emitting 5–10% of the total light of the star. One theory to explain long secondary periods is that they are caused by the evolution of such cells combined with the rotation of the star. Other theories include close binary interactions, chromospheric magnetic activity influencing mass loss, or non-radial pulsations such as g-modes.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, the {{production}} of weapons and equipment was highly centralised (and presumably standardised) {{in a number of}} major state-run arms factories, or fabricae, documented in the Notitia. It is unknown when these were first established, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> existed by the time of Diocletian. In the 2nd century, there is evidence of fabricae inside legionary bases and even in the much smaller auxiliary forts, staffed by the soldiers themselves. But there is no evidence, literary or archaeological, of fabricae outside military bases and staffed by civilians during the Principate (although their existence cannot be excluded, as no archaeological evidence has been found for the late fabricae either). Late fabricae were located in border provinces and dioceses. Some were general manufacturers producing both armour and weapons (fabrica scutaria et armorum) or just one of the two. Others were specialised in {{one or more of the}} following: fabrica spatharia (sword manufacture), lanciaria (spears), arcuaria (bows), sagittaria (arrows), loricaria (body armour), clibanaria (cataphract armour), and ballistaria (catapults).|$|E

500|$|Gilruth said, [...] "I {{remember}} that Piccard was very, very {{hurt by the}} National Geographic that would not give them a dime....Both he and Jeanette {{said that they were}} discriminated against by the National Geographic. That's not a good word. They were not aided in any way by the National Geographic, and they felt it was not really warranted. They felt they should have gotten some help from them.... didn't say why, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> didn't feel they'd been handled fairly." [...] The Piccards struggled to gain financial support until the Grigsby-Grunow Radio Company advanced them several thousand dollars. The Detroit Aero Club and People's Outfitting Company also backed them. To supplement their sponsorship, Jeannette designed and sold commemorative stamps and souvenir programs and folders. She also raised a good deal of money by selling their story in press releases to the North American Newspaper Alliance.|$|E
500|$|They both {{appeared}} in I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus and Just for Kicks, {{both of which}} were family films that received a direct-to-video release. David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews said of their acting in Just for Kicks that the brothers [...] "aren't the worst child actors I've ever seen,... <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> leave a lot to be desired." [...] Dylan and Cole were later cast in the Disney Channel original series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, where they portrayed identical twins Zack and Cody Martin, respectively. The series, which debuted in March 2005, became a ratings success. As part of their involvement with Disney, the brothers also became part of the 11-member group, the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, and sang the song [...] "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] along with the members of the circle, for a video that was released as bonus material in the special edition version of the Disney film Cinderella. They also participated in the Disney Channel Games.|$|E
2500|$|Nine of his kills on Malta were Italian pilots.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of Africa, he {{believed}} that, except for the small stretch {{of land in the}} vicinity of Suez, the continent was in fact surrounded by water. However, he definitely disagreed with his predecessors and contemporaries about its presumed circular shape. He based his theory on the story of Pharaoh Necho II, the ruler of Egypt between 609 and 594 BC, who had sent [...] Phoenicians to circumnavigate Africa. Apparently, it took them three years, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> did prove his idea. He speculated that the Nile River started as far west as the Ister River in Europe and cut Africa through the middle. He was the first writer to assume that the Caspian Sea was separated from other seas and he recognised northern Scythia as one of the coldest inhabited lands in the world.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Barbeau moved to New York City and worked [...] "for the mob" [...] as a go-go dancer. She made her Broadway {{debut in the}} chorus of Fiddler on the Roof, and later took the role of Hodel, Tevye's daughter; Bette Midler played her character's sister. She left Fiddler in 1971 to play the leading role of Cookie Kovac in the off-Broadway nudie musical Stag Movie. Barbeau, as Cookie Kovac, and Brad Sullivan, as Rip Cord, were [...] "quite jolly and deserve to be congratulated {{on the lack of}} embarrassment they show when, on occasion, they have to wander around stark naked. They may not be sexy <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> keep cheerful," [...] wrote The New York Times theater critic Clive Barnes in an {{otherwise}} negative review. Barbeau went on to star in [...] more than 25 musicals and plays, including Women Behind Bars, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and Grease. She received a Theater World Award and a 1972 Tony Award nomination for her portrayal of tough-girl Rizzo in Grease.|$|E
