But everywhere the People of the Sea told him the same things. Seals had come to those islands once upon a time, but men had killed them all off. Even when he swam thousands of miles out of the Pacific and got to a place called Cape Corrientes (that was when he was coming back from Gough's Island), he found a few hundred mangy seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too.|$|R
25|$|At between 52° – 57° {{south of}} the equator, Campbell Island group, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, <b>Bouvet</b> <b>Island,</b> South Georgia Group, Macquarie Island, and South Sandwich Islands are also located in the Furious Fifties.

25|$|The Norvegia expeditions were a {{sequence}} of Antarctic expeditions financed by the Norwegian shipowner and whaling merchant Lars Christensen during the late 1920s and 1930s. Ostensibly their goal was scientific research and the discovery of new whaling grounds, but Christensen also requested permission from the Norwegian Foreign Office to claim for Norway any uncharted territory that was found. By {{the end of the}} second expedition, two small islands in the Southern Ocean, <b>Bouvet</b> <b>Island</b> and Peter I Island, had been annexed. In 1929 Christensen decided to include aeroplanes in the next expedition and appointed Riiser-Larsen its leader. Riiser-Larsen then supervised and took part in mapping most of the Antarctic in this and three further expeditions. More territory was also annexed, this time the large area of the continent known as Queen Maud Land.|$|E
25|$|The Second Norvegia Expedition {{arrived in}} 1928 {{with the intent}} of {{establishing}} a manned meteorological radio station, but a suitable location could not be found. By then both the flagpole and hut from the previous year had been washed away. The Third Norvegia Expedition, led by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, arrived the following year and built a new hut at Kapp Circoncision and on Larsøya. The expedition carried out aerial photography of the island and was the first Antarctic expedition to use aircraft. The Dependency Act, passed by the Parliament of Norway on 27 February 1930, established <b>Bouvet</b> <b>Island</b> as a dependency, along with Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land. The eared seal was protected on and around the island in 1929 and in 1935 all seals around the island were protected.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} Norwegian whaling {{industry}} to Antarctica {{in the early}} 20th century motivated Norway, right after its independence from Sweden in 1905, to pursue territorial expansion {{not only in the}} Arctic claiming Jan Mayen and Sverdrup Islands, but also in Antarctica. Norway claimed <b>Bouvet</b> <b>Island</b> and looked further south, formally inquiring with Foreign Office about the international status of the area between 45° and 65° south latitude and 35° and 80° west longitude. Following a second such diplomatic démarche by the Norwegian Government dated 4 March 1907, Britain replied that the areas were British based on discoveries made {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and issued the 1908 Letters Patent incorporating the British Falkland Islands Dependencies with a permanent local administration in Grytviken established in 1909.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, the First Norvegia Expeditionled by Harald Horntvedt and {{financed by}} Lars Christensenwas {{the first to}} make an {{extended}} stay on the island. Observations and surveying were conducted on the islands and oceanographic measurements performed in the sea around it. At Ny Sandefjord, a small hut was erected and, on 1 December, the Norwegian flag was hoisted and the island claimed for Norway. The annexation was established by a royal decree on 23 January 1928. The claim was initially protested by the United Kingdom, {{on the basis of}} Norris's landing and annexation. However, the British position was weakened by Norris's sighting of two islands and the uncertainty as to whether he had been on Thompson or Liverpool (i.e. <b>Bouvet)</b> <b>Island.</b> Norris's positioning deviating from the correct location combined with the island's lack of a natural harbour and small size made the UK accept the Norwegian claim. This resulted in diplomatic negotiations between the two countries, and in November 1929, Britain renounced its claim to the island.|$|E

500|$|The primary {{bases for}} the {{annexation}} were the Norwegian explorations {{and the need}} to secure the Norwegian whaling industry's access to the region. Scientific operations were also a basis, with Norwegian contributions to international polar science extending back to the late 19th century. Norway was in addition forced to contend with competing claims made by the United Kingdom and other countries in the years prior to the Norwegian claim, including the new threat of German claims in Queen Maud Land. The Norwegian claim was sometimes referred to as the [...] "Bouvet sector", drawing from the previously annexed <b>Bouvet</b> <b>Island.</b> During 1946 and 1947, vast areas of Queen Maud Land were photographed during the Richard Evelyn Byrd expedition.

500|$|Morrell's journal {{indicates}} that Wasp reached South Georgia on November 20, and then sailed eastwards towards the isolated <b>Bouvet</b> <b>Island,</b> which lies approximately midway between Southern Africa and the Antarctic continent {{and is known}} as the world's remotest island. It had been discovered in 1739 by the French navigator Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier, but his plotting of its position was inaccurate; Captain James Cook, in 1772, had been unable to find it and had assumed its nonexistence. It had not been seen again until 1808, when the British sealing captains James Lindsay and Thomas Hopper reached it and recorded its correct position, though they were unable to land. Morrell, by his own account, found the island without difficulty—with [...] "improbable ease", in the words of historian William Mills— before landing and hunting seals there. In his subsequent lengthy description, Morrell does not mention the island's most obvious physical feature, its permanent ice cover.

500|$|After leaving <b>Bouvet</b> <b>Island,</b> Wasp {{continued}} eastward, {{reaching the}} Kerguelen Islands on December 31, 1822, where she remained for 11 days. The voyage then evidently continued {{to the south}} and east until February 1, 1823, when Morrell records his position as 65°52'S, 118°27'E. Here, Morrell says he took advantage of an eleven-knot breeze and turned the ship, to begin a passage westward. Apart from one undated position at 69°11'S, 48°15'E, Morrell's journal is silent until February 23, when he records crossing the Greenwich (0°) meridian. Historians have doubted whether such a long passage from 118°E, about , could have been made so quickly in ice-strewn waters and against the prevailing winds. Although some writers, including former Royal Navy navigator Rupert Gould, have argued that Morrell's claims as to speed and distance are plausible, Morrell's undated interim latitude was later shown to be well inside the Antarctic mainland territory of Enderby Land. Gould, writing in 1928 before the continental boundaries of this sector of Antarctica were known, based his support for Morrell on the premise that Enderby Land was an island with a sea channel south of it.
