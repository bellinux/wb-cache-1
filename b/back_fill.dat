40|$|<b>Back</b> <b>filling</b> of mine voids is {{mandatory}} to avoid subsequent ground stability {{problems in the}} form of subsidence. Mill tailings and river sand are being extensively used since a long time as mine <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> materials. However strict regulation and unavailability of river sand has created a huge problem for mining industry in India. The need to develop alternative engineering material which can substitute sand has gained prominence. Large quantities of fly ash discharged from coal-fired power stations are a major problem {{not only in terms of}} scarcity of land available for its disposal, but also in psychology as well as environmental aspects. Amount of fly ash available can be recycled, mainly by adding fly ash to cement. However, the addition of fly ash to cement is limited because the production rate of cement is limited, and also the concentration of fly ash in cement is limited. In the present study three fly ash composite materials (FCMs) were developed from the fly ash obtained from a nearby captive thermal unit. The main constituent of the composite were fly ash, lime, gypsum and cement. Detailed physical and engineering properties were determined for the FCMs. Significant increases in the compressive strength were obtained after 28 days of curing time and it was observed that the fly-ash composite developed has potential to be used as substitute to sand for <b>back</b> <b>filling</b> the mine voids...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{entrance to}} the docks is 80 ft wide, with two wrought-iron gates operated by direct acting hydraulic cylinders.This sea entrance leads into the Basin, (rarely called No.3 dock), that is 600 by 500 ft and covers 7 acre. At its north-west end, the Basin is connected to No.1 dock by an 80 ft wide passage with another pair of wrought iron lock gates, so that when required, the Basin {{can act as a}} lock, with the water level adjusted according to the rising tide, so wide-beamed vessels can leave the basin before high water and can enter the basin after high water. In its twilight years of vessel movements, the Basin sea locks were only used for vessels of 'above normal' beam as unlike the Lady Windsor lock width of 65 feet, and opened on 4th January 1898, {{to the west of the}} Basin, the Basin entrance was 80 feet wide as was its north-west lock channel to & from No.1 dock.The walls of the basin are vertical apart from a sharply curved batter at the base, which makes the toe very strong.The foundations are solid and the <b>back</b> <b>fill</b> is high quality so that the pressure on the walls is minimised.The walls are built of mountain limestone faced with hard red sandstone. They are 50 ft high, 17 ft thick at the base just above the curve, and 7 ft thick at the top. They rest on solid rock.The Basin gates contain many sluices, so water can be quickly drained out or let in according to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices. In the early days, the dock operators would often run the water down to bring in a single ship having a wider beam than the Lady Windsor lock could handle.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper describes the tsunami damage to tide walls observed using aerial photographs and field investigations at 13 locations {{along the coast}} of Iwate Prefecture, where significant tsunami damage occurred {{as a result of the}} Great East Japan Earthquake. This paper also summarizes the characteristics of the damage. The tide walls in Iwate Prefecture were constructed on a ria (hilly type) coast, this geographical feature of Iwate being different from that of the other disaster areas, primarily Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures. The tide walls constructed in Iwate Prefecture can largely be classified into two types, i. e. sloping and vertical. The vertical type can be subdivided according to whether or not there is a back slope. The results of our investigations show that all the devastated tide walls suffered from overflow before being damaged. In particular, the sloping and vertical type tide walls with slope protection were damaged by scouring of the infill sand or <b>back</b> <b>fill</b> soil due to the overflow of the tsunami. In the case of vertical type tide walls without slope protection, damage was caused by scouring of the <b>back</b> <b>fill</b> soil...|$|E

The pozzolanic activity of fly ash imparts additional strength and very little settlements, making it more suitable for embankment material. Bottom ash can also be used as a construction material for highway and pavements. The MSW possess adequate shear strength which can enhance the stability of highway embankments.|$|E
