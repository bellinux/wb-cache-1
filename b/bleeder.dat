He went on to play marginalized, often comic roles in popular Danish movies. In 1999, Mikkelsen had a leading role as Lenny, a shy film expert who suffers from avoidant personality disorder, opposite Kim Bodnia in Refn's <b>Bleeder</b> (1999). In 2000, Mikkelsen played a gangster opposite Søren Pilmark, Ulrich Thomsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas in Anders Thomas Jensen's Copenhagen gangster movie, Flickering Lights. The following year, he gained wider popularity when he starred in the gay comedy Shake It All About (2001).|$|E

500|$|On July 13, 1944, the {{day that}} the E. A. Bryan docked at Port Chicago, the ship's [...] winch brakes were found stuck in the [...] "off" [...] position, meaning that the winch could be {{operated}} freely, but lacked the critical stopping capability if steam pressure was interrupted. The ship's chief mate and chief engineer were called to examine the winch but it was never determined whether the brake was made operational. During loading operations on July 15 the winch at [...] hold began making a hammering noise. A steady application of grease quieted it through the night until its main bearing could be replaced the next morning on July 16. On the afternoon of July 17, a <b>bleeder</b> valve on winch [...] required immediate repair. Albert Carr, a civil service plumber from Pittsburg, California, was called to replace it; it was his first day at Port Chicago. Carr pulled a broken nipple out of the <b>bleeder</b> valve and replaced both the nipple and the valve from new stock taken from Port Chicago's shop. While at work he witnessed a man accidentally drop a naval artillery shell two feet onto the wooden pier but there was no detonation. Carr waited until the African-American winch operator tested the newly repaired winch then hurriedly left the pier, thinking that the whole operation appeared unsafe.|$|E

The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Venice Film Festival and a limited release the following year, receiving unanimous critical acclaim. Variety wrote in its review: [...] "Slightly out of place as the feisty bartender who gives Wepner a second chance at his downest and outest, a spirited Naomi Watts nonetheless gives proceedings her best Amy Adams in The Fighter." [...] Also in 2016, she headlined the thriller Shut In, playing a psychologist insolated with her child in a rural house during a winter storm. The film received largely negative reviews and made US$8 million worldwide.|$|E

The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a <b>bleeder</b> valve to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the rack by a slide gear, which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large hand wheel is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached {{to the top of the}} rack and is raised 2.7 metres.|$|E

To determine the proportion of CRC patients presenting with bleeding-related symptoms, to compare <b>bleeders</b> and nonbleeders and to explore the role of anticoagulants in <b>bleeders.</b> This was a nationwide, population-based, retrospective study, investigating all patients diagnosed with CRC in Iceland from 2008 to 2011. Bleeding-related symptoms were defined as overt bleeding, iron deficiency anaemia or a positive faecal occult blood test. Obstructive symptoms were defined as a confirmed diagnosis of ileus or dilated intestines on imaging. Data were available for 472 / 496 (95 %) patients, males 51 %, mean age 69 (± 13) years. In all, 348 (74 %) patients had bleeding-related symptoms; of these 348 patients, 61 % had overt bleeding. <b>Bleeders</b> were less likely than nonbleeders to have metastases at diagnosis, 19 % vs. 34 % (P <  0. 001). Overt <b>bleeders</b> were less likely than nonbleeders to have obstructive symptoms, 2 % vs. 16 % respectively (P <  0. 0001). Occult <b>bleeders</b> were more likely to have proximal cancer (69 %) than both overt (17 %) and nonbleeders (44 %) (P <  0. 0001); however, they were less likely than nonbleeders to have metastases (22 % vs. 35 %, P <  0. 05). <b>Bleeders</b> were more likely to use warfarin than nonbleeders (9 % vs. 3 %, P <  0. 05); the use of low-dose aspirin was the same (24 %). The majority of patients with CRC present with bleeding-related symptoms. <b>Bleeders</b> with CRC present earlier than nonbleeders. Warfarin use may induce bleeding in some patients, resulting in an earlier diagnosis...|$|R

But, you see, they're so scattered; you'll never get the public to look at them.

I can't lay too much stress upon that.

And this stands to reason, for if a man's a collector he doesn't want people to smell at the canvas to find out whom his pictures are by; he wants {{them to be able to}} say at once, 'A capital Forsyte!'

50|$|Because of the speed/power tradeoff, high-powered {{circuits}} may use {{two separate}} <b>bleeder</b> circuits. A fast bleed circuit is switched out during normal operation {{so that no}} power is wasted; when power is switched off, the fast <b>bleeder</b> is connected, rapidly bleeding down the voltage. The switch controlling the fast <b>bleeder</b> can fail, either by connecting when it shouldn't (and overheating) or by not connecting when it should (and thereby failing to bleed off the voltage quickly). To avoid the risk of not having an operational <b>bleeder,</b> a secondary, slower (and less lossy) <b>bleeder</b> is usually permanently connected {{so that there is}} always some bleed-down capability.|$|E

40|$|To {{assist in}} the {{prediction}} of variceal bleeding we examined 12 clinical, endoscopic and haemodynamic variables in 126 patients with portal hypertension (72 <b>bleeders</b> and 54 non-bleeders). Multiple regression and discriminant analysis were utilised for 101 patients. Stepwise regression among the 12 variables explained only 54 % of the variability existing between <b>bleeders</b> and non-bleeders. Six of the 12 variables accounted for 51 % of the total bleeder/non-bleeder variability. A predicting equation was evolved [Yp = - 0. 60 + 0. 19 X 1 (colour of varices) + 0. 16 X 2 (cherry red spots) + 0. 03 X 3 (red wale, markings) + 0. 01 X 4 (haematocystic spots) + 0. 15 X 5 (Conn's grading of variceal size) + 0. 03 X 6 (intravariceal pressure) ]. Of the six variables used, variceal size indicated 35 %, and intravariceal pressure accounted for 12 %, of the explained variability between <b>bleeders</b> and non-bleeders. The presence of the three red colour signs and the colour of the varices accounted for only 3 % and 1 % respectively of the total explained variation. Using the discriminant function analysis, {{we were able to}} correctly identify 85 % of the <b>bleeders</b> and 81 % of the non-bleeders.

40|$|To explore {{relevant}} changes in unexplained intraoperative bleeding, we evaluated {{elements of the}} final steps of the coagulation cascade in 226 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery. Patients were stratified for the occurrence of unexplained intraoperative bleeding according to predefined criteria. Twenty patients (8. 8 %) developed unexplained bleeding. The median intraoperative blood loss was 1350 mL (<b>bleeders)</b> and 400 mL (nonbleeders) (P < 0. 001). Fibrinogen and Factor XIII (F. XIII) were more rapidly consumed in <b>bleeders</b> (P < 0. 001). Soluble fibrin formation (fibrin monomer) was increased in <b>bleeders</b> throughout surgery (P < or = 0. 014). However, F. XIII availability per unit thrombin generated was significantly decreased in <b>bleeders</b> before, during, and after surgery (P < or = 0. 051). Computerized thrombelastography showed a parallel, significant reduction in clot firmness. We suggest that mild preexisting coagulopathy is not rare in surgical patients and probably can result in clinically relevant intraoperative bleeding. This hemostatic disorder shows impaired clot firmness, probably secondary to decreased cross-linking (due {{to a loss of}} F. XIII, both in absolute measures and per unit thrombin generated). We suggest that the application of F. XIII might be worthwhile to test in a prospective clinical trial to increase clot firmness in patients at risk for this intraoperative coagulopathy...|$|R
