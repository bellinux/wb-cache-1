Thus, the mixed-flow <b>pump</b> with cylindrical <b>casing</b> is adopted in some occasions. Due to the different characteristics between the special cylindrical casing and the common <b>pump</b> <b>casing,</b> {{the influence of the}} special casing on a mixed-flow pump characteristics was numerically investigated to obtain better performance and flow structure in the casing. The results show that the models with cylindrical casing have much worse head and efficiency characteristics than the experimental model, and this is caused by the flow in the <b>pump</b> <b>casing.</b> By moving the guide vanes half inside the <b>pump</b> <b>casing,</b> the efficiency gets improved while the low pressure zone at the corner of outlet pipe and <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> disappeared. When the length of <b>pump</b> <b>casing</b> increases from the size equal to the diameter of outlet pipe to that larger than it, the efficiency drops obviously and the flow field in the outlet pipe improved without curved flow.

A significant decrease in the HCF life was observed with an increase in the tensile mean stress, irrespective of the defect size. Further, a considerable drop in the HCF life was observed with an increase in the size of defects and proximity of the defects to the surface.
