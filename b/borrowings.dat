5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some signs are produced further {{away from the body}} than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some <b>borrowings</b> from African American English.|$|E
5|$|The IFC {{fulfills}} a treasury role {{by borrowing}} international capital to fund lending activities. It is usually {{one of the}} first institutions to issue bonds or to do swaps in emerging markets denominated in those markets' local currencies. The IFC's new international <b>borrowings</b> amounted to $8.8 billion in 2010 and $9.8 billion in 2011. The IFC Treasury actively engages in liquidity management in an effort to maximize returns and assure that funding for its investments is readily available while managing risks to the IFC.|$|E
5|$|Yerkes {{also did}} not {{live to see the}} UERL's {{financial}} struggle during the first years after the opening of the new lines. Because of greatly over-optimistic pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers, the lines failed to generate the income expected and needed to fund the interest payments on the UERL's substantial <b>borrowings.</b> In the Bakerloo Tube's first twelve months of operation, it carried 20.5million passengers, less than sixty per cent of the 35million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The Piccadilly Tube achieved 26million of a predicted 60million and the Hampstead Tube managed 25million of a predicted 50million. For the DR, the UERL had predicted an increase to 100million passengers after electrification, but achieved 55million. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the UERL's lines and those of the other tube and sub-surface railway companies, and the further spread of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The low price of tickets also depressed income.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Cleveland's {{return to}} office, hard times struck {{the nation with}} the Panic of 1893. A {{businessman}} in Youngstown, Robert Walker, had lent money to McKinley in their younger days; in gratitude, McKinley had often guaranteed Walker's <b>borrowings</b> for his business. The governor had never kept track {{of what he was}} signing; he believed Walker a sound businessman. In fact, Walker had deceived McKinley, telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones. Walker was ruined by the recession; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893. The total owed was over $100,000 and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney. Instead, McKinley's wealthy supporters, including Hanna and Chicago publisher H. H. Kohlsaat, became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid. Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property {{in the hands of the}} fund's trustees (who included Hanna and Kohlsaat), and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money. All of the couple's property was returned to them by the end of 1893, and when McKinley, who had promised eventual repayment, asked for the list of contributors, it was refused him. Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley, whose popularity grew. He was easily re-elected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|Eugene Helimski has {{suggested}} that the Andronovo people spoke a separate branch of the Indo-Iranian group of languages. He claims that <b>borrowings</b> in the Finno-Ugric languages support this view. Vladimir Napolskikh has proposed that <b>borrowings</b> in Finno-Ugric indicate that the language was specifically of the Indo-Aryan type.|$|E

25|$|Chinese in Xinjiang and Russian {{elsewhere}} had {{the greatest}} influence on Uyghur. Loanwords from these languages are all quite recent, although older <b>borrowings</b> exist as well, such as <b>borrowings</b> from Dungan, a Mandarin language spoken by the Dungan people of Central Asia. A number of loanwords of German origin have also reached Uyghur through Russian.|$|E
25|$|Words {{indicated}} (II) are <b>borrowings</b> from Indo-Iranian languages (in Brahui's case, from Persian).|$|E

25|$|Somali's main lexical <b>borrowings</b> {{come from}} Arabic. Soravia (1994) noted {{a total of}} 1,436 Arabic loanwords in Agostini a.o. 1985, a {{prominent}} Somali dictionary. Most of the vocabulary terms consisted of commonly used nouns. These lexical <b>borrowings</b> {{may have been more}} extensive in the past since a few words that Zaborski (1967:122) observed in the older literature were absent in Agostini's later work.|$|E
25|$|Urdu's {{vocabulary}} has <b>borrowings</b> {{from various}} languages. A corpus-based quantitative {{survey of the}} etymological origins of basic Urdu vocabulary {{is shown in the}} adjacent table. Many of the words of Arabic origin have been adopted through Persian and have different pronunciations and nuances of meaning and usage than they do in Arabic. There are also a smaller number of <b>borrowings</b> from Chagatai, and Portuguese.|$|E

25|$|The {{conservation}} of archaic phonological {{features of the}} Arabic <b>borrowings</b> furthermore suggests that Arabic-incorporated Persian was absorbed into pre-Ottoman Turkic at an early stage, when the speakers were still located to the northeast of Persia, prior to the westward migration of the Islamic Turkic tribes. An additional argument {{for this is that}} Ottoman Turkish shares the Persian character of its Arabic <b>borrowings</b> with other Turkic languages that had even less interaction with Arabic, such as Tatar and Uyghur. From the early ages of the Ottoman Empire, <b>borrowings</b> from Arabic and Persian were so abundant that original Turkish words were hard to find. In Ottoman, one may find whole passages in Arabic and Persian incorporated into the text. It was however not only extensive loaning of words, but along with them much of the grammatical systems of Persian and Arabic.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{original}} vocabulary {{of the language}} was Siculo-Arabic, it has incorporated {{a large number of}} <b>borrowings</b> from Romance sources of influence (Sicilian, Italian, and French), and more recently Germanic ones (from English).|$|E
25|$|In <b>borrowings</b> from English, many English consonants are {{simplified}} to {{the nearest}} available Māori consonant. For example, the English fricatives /tʃ/, /dʒ/, /s/ are transcribed as h, English /f/ as p, and English /l/ as r.|$|E
