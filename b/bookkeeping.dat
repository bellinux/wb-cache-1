5|$|As of May 2015, {{the federal}} {{government}} in conjunction with UNSOM was working toward establishing a comprehensive, international standards and obligations-compliant ammunition and weapons management system. To this end, capacity-building for the physical management of arms and <b>bookkeeping</b> was being developed, and new storage facilities and armouries for weapons and explosives were being constructed.|$|E
5|$|By 1956, Sanders had six {{or eight}} franchisees, {{including}} Dave Thomas, who eventually founded the Wendy's restaurant chain. Thomas developed the rotating red bucket sign, was an early advocate of the take-out concept that Harman had pioneered, and introduced a <b>bookkeeping</b> form that Sanders rolled out across the entire KFC chain. Thomas sold his shares in 1968 for US$1 million (around US$7 million in 2013), and became regional manager for all KFC restaurants east of the Mississippi before founding Wendy's in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{eventually}} {{returned to}} New Zealand in early 1903. Shortly {{after his return}} he married Minnie Renall, {{the daughter of a}} farmer. The couple would have four children, one of whom died in infancy. He resumed working at his uncle's business and eventually became a director of the company. However, rather than pursue <b>bookkeeping</b> as a career, he commenced legal studies. He qualified as a solicitor in 1907, becoming a partner in a Carterton practice which he had joined the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{was born}} at Taratahi, a small {{community}} near Carterton in the Wairarapa region. His father, William, was a farm labourer and the grandson of John Hart, a three-time Premier of South Australia. One of four children, he was educated firstly at Dalefield School, and then Carterton School. After finishing his formal education he worked for his uncle, an auctioneer and land broker, while also studying <b>bookkeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{previous}} season, several other wing players left the team. Caris LeVert graduated. Aubrey Dawkins transferred {{to play for}} the UCF Knights. Kameron Chatman announced his intention to transfer. He mostly came off the bench, although he did start one game due to a <b>bookkeeping</b> error on December 17 against Maryland Eastern Shore. Late in the season, he began producing The Dak and Dunc Show podcast with teammate Andrew Dakich for WCBN-FM Sports, which was available on iTunes. The team won the 2017 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament and reached the sweet sixteen round of the 2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the bridge}} {{would be the}} only road from the {{mainland}} to the archipelago, tolls could be collected in only one direction. The tolls were set to NOK40 for semitrailers, NOK30 for buses, NOK20 for trucks, NOK12 for cars, NOK5 for motorcycles, NOK4 for bicycles, NOK2 for adults and 1 for children. Discounts were available at the same rates as for ferries. The four people who had worked the longest on the ferry were offered the job as toll plaza employees. From 1972, the <b>bookkeeping</b> of the company was transferred from the company's secretary to Bergens Privatbank's branch in Sotra, while the auditing was placed at Hordaland County Auditing.|$|E
5|$|The {{first nine}} {{products}} in the series were announced on April 4, 2007 and the first five were released on July 5, 2007; the last DS:Style release was on February 3, 2011. Several of the products were named after other non-software products, such as the Lonely Planet series of travel guides, the Japanese Legal Mind (LEC) test preparatory company, or the Japanese Tipness yoga studio chain. While {{not a part of}} the DS:Style series, <b>bookkeeping</b> and real estate certification products (Honki de Manabu: LEC de Goukaku - DS Hishou Boki 3-Kyū and Honki de Manabu: LEC de Goukaku - DS Takuchi Tatemono Torihiki Shuninsha) were also released on the PlayStation Portable in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} Madonna and Maverick sued Warner Music Group and its former parent company Time Warner, {{claiming}} that mismanagement {{of resources and}} poor <b>bookkeeping</b> had cost the company millions of dollars. In return, Warner filed a countersuit alleging that Maverick had lost {{tens of millions of}} dollars on its own. The dispute was resolved when the Maverick shares, owned by Madonna and Ronnie Dashev, were purchased by Warner. Madonna and Dashev's company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music, but Madonna was still signed to Warner under a separate recording contract.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{elementary}} schools located in Žirmūnai: Antoni Wiwulski, Emilia Plater, and St. Christopher. Šarūnas Marčiulionis Basketball School and Vilnius Sports School offer physical education. The Vilnius School of Radioelectronics and Precision Mechanics (Lithuanian: Vilniaus radioelektronikos ir tiksliosios mechanikos mokykla) {{was established in}} 1965 to prepare workers for Vilma, a manufacturer of electrical products still operating in Žirmūnai. The Vilnius School of Tourism and Commerce (Lithuanian: Vilniaus turizmo ir prekybos verslo mokykla) offers certificates in retailing, basic <b>bookkeeping,</b> hotel and restaurant services, and other business areas. Vilnius Gija Youth School serves those students who have special needs and do not succeed in traditional classroom settings. Žirmūnai also {{has one of the}} three Children's Foster Homes in Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's <b>bookkeeping</b> {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} {{she arrived in}} Paris to attend the École Normale de Neuilly. The school {{provided}} its female pupils with classes in chemistry and <b>bookkeeping,</b> in addition to traditionally feminine arts such as embroidery. Her roommate was Noémie, the daughter of Henri Rochefort, who had been imprisoned in New Caledonia for his support of the Paris Commune. The girls shared tales of their parents' political exploits, and remained good friends for years. Pankhurst was so fond of Noémie and the school that after graduating she returned with her sister Mary as a parlour boarder. Noémie had married a Swiss painter and quickly found a suitable French husband for her English friend. When Robert Goulden refused to provide a dowry for his daughter, the man withdrew his offer of marriage and Pankhurst returned, miserable, to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Dennie {{was born}} on August 30, 1768, in Boston, Massachusetts to Joseph Dennie, {{a member of a}} well-to-do {{merchant}} family, and his wife Mary Green, whose father was Bartholomew Green, Jr. The Greens were a prominent printing family in colonial America; the progenitor of the family, Samuel Green, emigrated from England with John Winthrop {{and was one of the}} first printers in the colonies. Having moved to Lexington at the age of seven, Dennie returned to Boston in 1783 to study <b>bookkeeping</b> and later clerk in a counting house. He began preparing to enter Harvard College in 1785, under the guidance of Reverend Samuel West. West had a significant impact on Dennie, fostering his pupil's interest in literature, as well as instilling in Dennie a decidedly pro-British mindset.|$|E
5|$|The academy was {{primarily}} a boarding school. Students came from Illinois, the surrounding states, Texas, and Mexico. A few day students came from the Lisle area. In 1947 enrollment averaged 75students. Enrollment grew from 120 in 1953 to 300 in 1958, and remained at that level until 1966. Day student enrollment also grew and in 1962 the academy stopped accepting boarding school students. By 1964, the last year in which boarding school students were enrolled, alumni had hailed from all US states, South America, France, Mexico, and Guam. Day students from 1964 to 1968 came from Lisle and the neighboring communities. Unlike St. Procopius Academy, Sacred Heart Academy offered a business curriculum from 1953 to 1966. Courses included shorthand, typewriting, and <b>bookkeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{he was a}} boy, {{his family}} moved to Moravia, New York, and in 1851 to Owego, New York, where he {{attended}} Owego Academy. In 1853, {{his family moved to}} Strongsville, Ohio and he attended Cleveland's Central High School, the first high school in Cleveland and the first free, public high school west of the Alleghenies. Then, he took a ten-week business course at Folsom's Commercial College, where he studied <b>bookkeeping.</b> Despite his father's absences and frequent family moves, young John was a well-behaved, serious, and studious boy. His contemporaries described him as reserved, earnest, religious, methodical, and discreet. He was an excellent debater and expressed himself precisely. He also had a deep love of music and dreamed of it as a possible career.|$|E
5|$|According to its May 1853 {{advertisement}} in the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, {{the institute}} provided instruction {{to the following}} grades during its summer session: fifth grade for $5, fourth grade for $8, third grade for $10, second grade for $12, and first grade (its highest grade) for $15. Boarding, including laundry, meals, and lighting, was $45, and music lessons with use of the piano were $25. An additional fee of 25 cents was charged if a student was suspended. The fifth grade was taught by the institute's Primary Department, and lessons included spelling, reading and elementary arithmetic. The fourth grade was taught by the institute's Junior Department and included courses in writing and preparatory English grammar and geography. The third grade was instructed by the English Department and offered studies in geography and English; and the second grade was also taught by the English Department with courses in history and natural philosophy. The school's highest grade, first grade, was instructed by the Classical and Mathematical Department and offered studies in Greek, Latin, French, geometry, algebra, trigonometry, surveying, mensuration, navigation, astronomy, and <b>bookkeeping.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along {{with her}} classmates, she {{was chosen by}} Kamehameha III to be {{eligible}} for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii. She was taught in English by American missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and his wife, Juliette Montague Cooke, alongside her royal cousins. She was taught reading, spelling, penmanship, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, physics, geography, history, <b>bookkeeping,</b> singing and English composition by the missionary couple. In the classroom students were divided by their age and/or length of time at the school. The older group consisted of Moses Kekūāiwa, Lot Kapuāiwa, Alexander Liholiho, William Charles Lunalilo, Jane Loeau, Bernice Pauahi, Abigail Maheha and Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau who had attended the school since 1839. The next class consisted of Emma Rooke, James Kaliokalani, Peter Kaʻeo and David Kalākaua. Due to her late attendance, Mary Paʻaʻāina was placed in the youngest class together with Victoria Kamāmalu, Lydia Kamakaʻeha (Liliʻuokalani), and John William Pitt Kīnaʻu. During their Sunday procession to church it was customary for boys and girls to walk side by side, Paʻaʻāina would walk beside her first cousin Peter Kaʻeo.|$|E
5|$|George Villiers (23 November 1759 – 21 March 1827), styled The Honourable, was a British courtier and {{politician}} {{from the}} Villiers family. The youngest {{son of the}} diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal Family and his father's influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers {{was more interested in}} the operation of the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his <b>bookkeeping</b> as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to the Crown by more than £250,000. This exposure touched off a public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, {{and he was able to}} retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827.|$|E
25|$|The Italian Luca Pacioli, {{recognized}} as The Father of accounting and <b>bookkeeping</b> {{was the first}} person to publish a work on double-entry <b>bookkeeping,</b> and introduced the field in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Although Luca Pacioli did not invent double-entry <b>bookkeeping,</b> his 27-page {{treatise}} on <b>bookkeeping</b> contained {{the first known}} published work on that topic, and {{is said to have}} laid the foundation for double-entry <b>bookkeeping</b> as it is practiced today. Even though Pacioli's treatise exhibits almost no originality, it is generally considered as an important work, mainly because of its wide circulation; it was written in the vernacular Italian language, and it was a printed book.|$|E
25|$|Second Year. — Arithmetic, Algebra, Modern History, Rhetoric, Philosophy, Physiology, <b>Bookkeeping,</b> Latin and French continued.|$|E
25|$|In <b>bookkeeping,</b> {{amounts owed}} are often {{represented}} by red numbers, or a number in parentheses, {{as an alternative}} notation to represent negative numbers.|$|E
25|$|Between the 4th {{millennium}} BC and the 3rd millennium BC, {{the ruling}} leaders and priests in ancient Iran had people oversee financial matters. In Godin Tepe (گدین تپه) and Tepe Yahya (تپه يحيی), cylindrical tokens {{that were used}} for <b>bookkeeping</b> on clay scripts were found in buildings that had large rooms for storage of crops. In Godin Tepe's findings, the scripts only contained tables with figures, while in Tepe Yahya's findings, the scripts also contained graphical representations. The invention of a form of <b>bookkeeping</b> using clay tokens represented a huge cognitive leap for mankind.|$|E
25|$|Ragusan {{economist}} Benedetto Cotrugli's 1458 treatise Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto {{contained the}} earliest known manuscript of a double-entry <b>bookkeeping</b> system. His manuscript {{was first published in}} 1573.|$|E
25|$|Zélie was so {{successful}} in manufacturing lace that by 1870 Louis had sold his watchmaking shop to a nephew and handled the traveling and <b>bookkeeping</b> end of his wife's lacemaking business.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{time when}} it was all done by hand: attendance, <b>bookkeeping,</b> filing and {{everything}} else. By the 1980s and 1990s, new technology was here to stay. From custodians to secretaries, all classified employees were impacted by new technology.|$|E
25|$|Debits and credits occur {{simultaneously}} in every financial transaction in double-entry <b>bookkeeping.</b> In the accounting equation—Assets = Liabilities + Equity—if an asset account increases (a debit), then either another asset account must decrease (a credit), or a liability or equity account must increase (a credit).|$|E
25|$|Hanson {{worked at}} Woolworths before {{working in the}} office {{administration}} of Taylors Elliotts Ltd, a subsidiary of Drug Houses of Australia (now Bickford's Australia), where she handled clerical <b>bookkeeping</b> and secretarial work. She left Taylors Elliotts after {{the beginning of her}} first pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{and girls}} had {{separate}} classes until about 1870. Boys learned useful {{skills such as}} woodshop, surveying, and <b>bookkeeping,</b> and girls had classes like sewing. However, Westtown eventually recognized that students of both genders should know basic academic subjects such as reading, penmanship, grammar, mathematics, geography, and science.|$|E
25|$|A third {{consequence}} of popularization of printing {{was on the}} economy. Printing press was associated {{with higher levels of}} city growth. Publication of trade related manuals and books teaching techniques like double-entry <b>bookkeeping,</b> increased reliability of trade and led to decline of merchant guilds and rise of individual traders.|$|E
25|$|The CCE {{was also}} {{influential}} in urging {{its members to}} centralize their operations, expanding through satellite branches rather than spinning off independent cooperative entities to alternate locations. In this way <b>bookkeeping</b> and purchasing operations could be consolidated and streamlined and the learning curve shortened for the administrators of new cooperative shops.|$|E
25|$|Jack and Norah Seccombe owned a {{milk bar}} in Ipswich, Queensland, in which Hanson and her {{siblings}} worked {{from a young}} age. Hanson herself worked in the shop, preparing meals and taking orders. At an older age, she assisted her parents with more administrative work in <b>bookkeeping</b> and sales ledging.|$|E
25|$|Between 2000 and 2004, Pombo {{used his}} {{campaign}} and PAC {{funds to pay}} his brother Randall $272,000, and his wife (between 2003 and 2004) $85,000. In that 2003–04 campaign cycle, Pombo paid more to his family members—$217,000—than his opponent, Jerry McNerney, spent on his entire campaign. The two were paid for duties listed as <b>bookkeeping,</b> fundraising, consulting and other unspecified services.|$|E
25|$|Ragusan {{economist}} Benedetto Cotrugli's 1458 treatise Della mercatura e del mercante perfetto {{contained the}} earliest known manuscript of a double-entry <b>bookkeeping</b> system, however Cotrugli's manuscript was not officially published until 1573. In fact even {{at the time of}} writing his work in 1494 Pacoili was aware of Cotrugli’s efforts and credited Cortrugli with the origination of the double entry book keeping system.|$|E
25|$|Incentive staff {{represents}} {{only a small}} fraction of the refugee population. The work opportunities available from the UNHCR, the WFP or partner agencies usually consist of jobs involving physical labour (construction and security) or low-level clerical work, including <b>bookkeeping</b> and nursing. Positions are filled through personal networks and influence. Incentives are vital to the survival of the population – they ensure that some money is injected into the camp economy.|$|E
25|$|After {{the chaos}} of the Civil War, the Treasury Department was disorganized and needed reform. The {{controversy}} between President Johnson over Reconstruction and the impeachment trial in the Senate in 1868, forestalled any reforms in the Treasury Department. As Treasury Secretary, Boutwell's primary achievements were reorganizing and reforming the Treasury Department, improving <b>bookkeeping</b> by customs houses, incorporating the United States Mint into the Treasury and reducing the national debt.|$|E
