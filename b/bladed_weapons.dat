5|$|An osteological {{examination}} of the bones showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, {{which may have been}} destroyed by Victorian building work. It was immediately apparent that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The skull shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base {{of the back of the}} skull had been completely cut away by a bladed weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another bladed weapon had been thrust through the right side of the skull, striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on the skull, a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. <b>Bladed</b> <b>weapons</b> had clipped the skull and sheared off layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in the skull and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s skull indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a sharp implement, as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered arm that afflicted the character in William Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E

However, it was later reported that the kirpans were ceremonial, and {{there was no mention of}} their playing any part in the incident—the men were arrested on suspicion of trespass, not carrying knives.|$|E
25|$|To make {{possible}} the establishments of settlements, military force became {{necessary to protect}} the friars and whatever basic settlement structures were beginning to emerge. Thus military outposts were of utmost importance, especially with the friars trying to convert fierce head-hunting tribes with spears and <b>bladed</b> <b>weapons.</b> It was around this time, during the term of Governor General Fausto Cruzat y Gongora (July 25, 1690 to December 8, 1702), that he established the military outpost he named Nueva Ecija. At this time, however, Nueva Ecija was still part of upper Pampanga.|$|E

25|$|Arnis, also {{referred}} to as Eskrima and Kali, is an indigenous Philippine martial art involving the use of sticks, knives and other <b>bladed</b> <b>weapons.</b> Like most other knife fighting traditions, Eskrima is learned by constant practice, using sparring encounters between two or more opponents in order to hone a practitioner's physical skills and mental concentration. This martial art flourished for hundreds of years as part of a society with a blade culture, and the system's already impressive indigenous techniques were later directly influenced by Spanish and Andalusian fencing and knife fighting systems with the introduction of the angles of attack and the use of espada y daga (the word eskrima is a Filipinization of the Spanish word esgrima, meaning a fighting or fencing school).|$|E

500|$|A {{nephew of}} Henry, Samuel Nock, was an {{apprentice}} under him. Samuel also {{proved to be}} inventive, holding a patent himself. Samuel became Gunmaker-in-Ordinary in succession to George III, George IV, William IV and Victoria and in 1836 became a Master of the Gunmakers Company. [...] However, Henry Nock's own business was continued by his foreman and son-in-law James Wilkinson. [...] Wilkinson became Gunmaker-in-Ordinary to the king in 1805. [...] Contracts with the East India Company ensured {{the success of the}} business. [...] The name became James Wilkinson & Son around 1818 when James' son Henry joined. Henry died in 1864 but the company continued making firearms and <b>bladed</b> <b>weapons</b> and became known as Wilkinson Sword. A series of new laws in the UK, starting with the Pistols Act 1903, restricted the sale of firearms to the public. That pushed the company into changing direction and it henceforth concentrated on razor blades and other domestic products. It continued to produce swords for the British Army and for royal ceremonial purposes until 2005 [...] when the sword manufacturing plant in Acton, West London, was closed. The company continues to make shaving and gardening products.|$|E
2500|$|The spear {{has been}} in use since the Lower Paleolithic and {{retained}} its central importance well into the 2nd millennium CE.

2500|$|The most {{significant}} and traditional rivalry for Genoa, is the inner-city {{one with the}} club with whom they share a ground; Sampdoria. The two clubs compete together in the heated Derby della Lanterna ("Derby of the Lantern"); {{a reference to the}} Lighthouse of Genoa. Genoa's supporters also have a strong distaste for AC Milan. After a clash between opposing supporters in January 1995 resulted in the death of Genoese Vincenzo Spagnolo, who was stabbed to death by Milanese Simone Barbaglia. The assailant was a member of an informal group of football hooligans dubbed [...] "The Barbour Ones", who used to routinely carry <b>bladed</b> <b>weapons</b> to matches, a practice made possible by the leaky security measures of the time.|$|E

2500|$|Just as de Camp {{attempted}} {{to do in the}} fantasy genre with his Pusadian stories for the Hyborian Age tales of Robert E. Howard, the Viagens tales represent both a tribute to contemporary space opera and sword and planet fiction and an attempt to [...] "get them right", reconstructing the premises logically, without what he regarded as their technological, biological and anthropological absurdities. De Camp intended the stories as [...] "pure entertainment in the form of light, humorous, swashbuckling, interplanetary adventure-romances - a sort of sophisticated Burroughs-type story, more carefully thought out than their prototypes." [...] Thus he discarded such impossible but commonplace notions such as interfertility of human beings with humanoid alien races, civilizations possessing flying machines but no ground transport, <b>bladed</b> <b>weapons</b> and advanced gunnery coexisting in the same society, and faster than light travel.|$|E
2500|$|During the Qing dynasty, a {{man named}} Wang Yuanwai living in Beipinggao village (about [...] east of Chenjiagou), was {{threatened}} with death by a gang of highwaymen with <b>bladed</b> <b>weapons,</b> unless he surrendered his valuables. He sent for assistance from Chen Suole (see the lineage tree above), who was away according to his sons Chen Shenru and Chen Xunru – despite their being only around fifteen and sixteen years old, the boys volunteered their own help instead. They convinced the messenger to tell Wang Yuanwai to give the bandits liquor, discussed a plan and that night, traveled to the Wang residence in Beipinggao, where they jumped over the fence of the rear garden and there found Wang Yuanwai. He {{told them that the}} highwaymen, numbering around twenty, were drunken in his guest hall. While peeping in, Shenru pushed Xunru into the hall and extinguished several candles by throwing a bunch of peas at them. Xunru leapt onto beam and taunted, the panicked bandits who had seemingly started fighting each other, saying, [...] "So you still will not hand over your weapons and surrender? Gods number one and two are here." [...] Some tried to escape the frenzy, but were attacked by Shenru, who was still at the door.|$|E

5000|$|For those enlisted {{personnel}} who are subsequently commissioned as officers and are shipboard SWO's the enlisted surface warfare specialist badge is replaced. Unlike other warfare pins available to both enlisted and officers, the ESWS and SWO pins differ {{by more than}} just color (gold for officers and silver for enlisted is a common theme in U.S. Navy uniforms). The <b>blade</b> <b>weapons</b> behind the hull on the SWO pin are swords. The <b>blade</b> <b>weapons</b> on the enlisted pin are cutlasses. This can clearly {{be seen in the}} curvature of the blades and the shape of the handguards. This derives from the sword being a symbol of naval officers and their authority, while cutlasses were traditionally issued for battle to enlisted sailors during the age of sail.|$|R
