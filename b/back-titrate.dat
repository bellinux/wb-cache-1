40|$|Dibutyltin- 3 -hydroxyflavone bromiide, Bu 2 Sn(of), is a {{fluorescent}} probe inhibitor of mitochondrial F 1 F 0 ATPase which reacts with and titrates {{a component of}} F 0 with marked fluorescence enhancement and reacts similarly with chloroplast CF 1 CF 0 and V-ATPases. Its use to monitor the interactions of other F 0 inhibitors (venturicidin, oligomycin, DCCD) with F 1 F 0 ATPase, both membrane-bound and purified by solubilization is described. Trialkyltins (Bu 3 SnCl) <b>back-titrate</b> all Bu 2 Sn(of) interaction sites; whereas the macrolide inhibitor venturicidin backtitrates 60 +/- 5 % and oligomycin only 30 +/- 3 % of Bu 2 Sn(of) interaction sites.

40|$|CD and uv {{absorption}} {{data showed}} that high molecular weight poly(dA-dT) poly(dA-dT), at 298 K, undergoes an acid-induced transition from B-double helix to random coil in NaCl solutions of different concentrations, ranging from 0. 005 to 0. 600 M. Similarly, titration of the polynucleotide with a strong base causes duplex-to-single strands transition. The base- and acid-induced transitions were both reversible by back-titration (with an acid or, respectively, with a base) : the apparent pKa were the same in both directions. However, the number of protons per titratable site (adenine N 1) required to reach half-denaturation was in great excess over the stoichiometric value; to a much larger extent, the same effect was observed also for the deprotonation of the N 3 H sites of thymine. Moreover, in the basic denaturation experiments, at low salt concentrations ([NaCl] 0. 300 M) less acid than calculated was needed to <b>back-titrate</b> the base excess to half-denaturation. Both effects could be qualitatively justified {{on the basis of}} the counterion condensation theory of polyelectrolytes and considering the energy barrier created by the negatively charged phosphodiester groups to the penetration of the OH ions inside the double helix and the screening effect of the Na ions on such charges, in the deprotonation experiments...|$|E

50|$|A catalyzed {{endpoint}} {{procedure to}} determine trace amounts of metal ions in solution (down to approximately 10 mg/L) employs 0.01 mol/L EDTA. This {{has been applied}} to the determination of low level Cu(II) in specialized plating baths, and to the determination of total hardness in water. The reaction enthalpies of EDTA with most metal ions are often quite low, and typically titrant concentrations around 1 mol/L are employed with commensurately high amounts of titrand in order to obtain sharp, reproducible endpoints. Using a catalytically indicated endpoint, very low EDTA titrant concentrations can be used. A back-titration is used. An excess of EDTA solution is added. The excess of EDTA is <b>back-titrated</b> with a suitable metal ion such as Mn2+ or Cu2+. At the endpoint, the first excess of metal ion catalyzes a strongly exothermic reaction between a polyhdric phenol (such as resorcinol) and hydrogen peroxide.|$|R

40|$|The acidic {{functional}} {{groups on}} carbon are measured {{through use of}} four kinds of bases different in strength; the acidic groups on carbon surfaces are determined by adding excess standard base and <b>back-titrating</b> with standard hydrochloric acid after equilibration. In this method, however, the trends in being accompanied with systematic errors are pronounced.

In consequence it often takes more than one hour to titrate the base with the acid carefully.

40|$|Two {{different}} humic materials, {{one from}} a forest soil and the other from wormcasts, were used to study the influence of mineral and organic acids on the conformational properties of humic substances. The macromolecular changes were followed by low pressure gel permeation chromatography after titrating humic material to low pHs with acids. All organic acids (mono-, di-, tricarboxylic, and oxy-acids), added to humic solution prior to a gel permeation in an alkaline buffer, were able to shift the totality of absorbance of the humic chromatographic peak from high to low molecular sizes. Mineral acids, phenol, alcohols, dipolar aprotic solvents, could not produce the same shift and gave total absorbance at the column void volume {{as in the case}} of humic substances alone. The chromatographic peak shifted back to elution volumes proper of higher size molecules when the humic-organic acid mixture was <b>back-titrated</b> to high pHs before gel permeation. Elution in a much stronger alkaline buffer did not change the overall macromolecular behaviour. These results suggest that humic substances behave as micelles in solution and that hydrophobic bondings play an important role in holding humic molecules together. The organic acids enter the interior of the humic micelle-like aggregates and alter the stereochemical hydrophobic arrangement of the humic material. In alkaline conditions the negative charges developed disrupt the apparent high molecular size configuration and disperse the humic aggregates into small micelles.

40|$|The organotin complex dibutyltin- 3 -hydroxyflavone bromide [Bu 2 Sn(of) Br] {{has been}} shown to bind to the 16 kDa proteolipid of Nephrops norvegicus, either {{in the form of the}} native protein or after {{heterologous}} expression in Saccharomyces and assembly into a hybrid vacuolar H(+) -ATPase. Titration of Bu 2 Sn(of) Br against the 16 kDa proteolipid results in a marked fluorescence enhancement, consistent with binding to a single affinity site on the protein. Vacuolar ATPase-dependent ATP hydrolysis was also inhibited by Bu 2 Sn(of) Br, with the inhibition constant correlating well with dissociation constants determined for binding of Bu 2 Sn(of) Br complex to the proteolipid. The fluorescence enhancement produced by interaction of probe with proteolipid can be <b>back-titrated</b> by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), which covalently modifies Glu 140 on helix- 4 of the polypeptide. Expression of a mutant proteolipid in which Glu 140 was changed to a glycine resulted in assembly of a vacuolar ATPase which was inactive in proton pumping and which had reduced ATPase activity. Co-expression studies with this mutant and wild-type proteolipids suggest that proton pumping can only occur in a vacuolar ATPase containing exclusively wild-type proteolipid. The fluorescent enhancement of affinity of Bu 2 Sn(of) Br for the mutant proteolipid was not significantly altered, with the organotin complex having no effect on residual ATPase activity. Interaction of the probe with mutant proteolipid was unaffected by DCCD.

40|$|Summary [...] A rapid {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the determination of}} hypophosphite by oxidation with permanganate in acid medium {{in the presence of}} fluoride to prevent formation of insoluble oxides of manganese. The optimum conditions for visual and potentiometric end-point detection are given. Hypo-phosphite is oxidized to H 2 PO~. Under optimum conditions the titrations are fast and exhibit a reasonable potential change at the end-point. The method demonstrates the feasibility of determining amounts of H 2 PO 2 corresponding to 0. 08 - 7 mg of phosphorus. Several titrimetric methods ~- 7 have been reported for the determination of hypophosphorous acid and hypophosphite, based upon their tendency to be oxi-dized to phosphite or phosphate. Pound 7 described an indirect method for the determination of hypo-phosphite by oxidation with permanganate in acid solution, but the reaction was found to be markedly slow. The direct titration with permanganate was, however, found very difficult. Pound's method 7 includes the addition of a small amount of potassium bromide as catalyst and even then the hypoposphite is only determined indirectly after the addition of an excess of permanganate in sulphuric acid medium and in the presence of potassium bromide, whereby after 2 - 3 hr the manganese oxides are dissolved in the acid and the excess of permanganate is <b>back-titrated</b> with iron(II). Hypophosphorous acid is known to reduce per-manganate in alkaline medium but the reaction has not been studied quantitatively. 6 In the present investigation we studied the oxi-dation of hypophosphite (or hypophosphorous acid) with permanganate in acid medium in the presence of fluoride ions in order to overcome the difficulties encountered by Pound v and to establish the con-ditions favouring quantitative and direct permangano-metric determination of hypophosphite...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{acids and}} bases can be {{determined}} in a single procedure by first precipitating protein and removing carbonate with concentrated HCI, then adding Ca(OH) 2 to precipitate phosphate and create an alkaline medium, removing ammonia by heat and suction, then finally titrating from pH 10. 5 to 2. 7 with dilute HCI. HE RECENT EMPHASIS on disorders of acid-base metabolism has neces-sitated a reappraisal of those urinary constituents which represent elimination of acid or base. The conventional expression for urinary acid excretion (“net acid excretion”) is titratable acid- bicarbonate + ammonia (T. A. - CO 2 + NH 4) (1). It has been the contention of this laboratory that acid excretion is more inclusively represented by the expression T. A. - CO 2 + NH 4 - O. A. + O. B., where O. A. indi-cates organic acid and O. B. indicates organic base, respectively (2). According to this concept, the excretion of citrate, the anion of an organic acid, may be considered equivalent {{to the loss of}} bicarbonate. Likewise, the excretion of lysine 11 +, a hydrogen ion conjugate of an organic base, may be considered equivalent to the excretion of NH 4 +, also the hydrogen ion conjugate of an organic base (NH 3). Methods have been previously described for determination of both organic acids and organic bases. The standard method for organic acid is that of Van Slyke and Palmer (3), who precipitated the phosphates and carbonates with Ca(OH) 2 and then titrated from pH 2. 7 to 8. 0 using phenolphthalein as an indicator. Dawson et al. (4) applied a simi-lar technic to the determination of organic bases by first adjusting the urine plus Ca(OH) 9 to pH 8. 0 with 0. 1 N.

Titrimetric method is applicable over a range 4 - 15 mg and the reaction stoichiometry is found to be 1 : 2 (ZDV : NBS).

30|$|First, {{the soil}} and biochar samples were ground to < 2  mm. For total element, NH 4 NO 3 {{extractable}} trace elements and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analyses, soils and biochar samples were milled with a planetary ball mill to achieve a homogeneous fine powder (Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany). The pH of biochar in water was determined in 1 : 20 (w/v) ratio after occasionally stirring over 1  h (Cheng et al. 2006). The pH of the soils in water suspensions were determined in 1 : 2.5 (w/v) ratio after shaking over 2  h. The EC of biochar was determined after 1  h equilibration of 1  g of biochar with 20  ml of distilled water. The EC of the soil was determined after 2  h equilibration of 1  g of soil with 2.5  ml of distilled water. Soil Particle size distributions were determined by laser diffraction using an Analysette 22 MicroTec plus (Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany) with a wet dispersion unit. For total element analysis, 0.25  g of biochar and soil were placed into 50  ml vessels, followed by addition of 10  ml concentrated HNO 3. The mixtures were left to cold digest in a fume cupboard over night and then heated in 1.6 KW microwave oven for 30  min. After cooling to room temperature, 10  ml of double distilled water was added into the vessel and filtered via a 0.45  µm cellulose nitrate filter paper. Finally, the filtrate was subjected to the total element analysis using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany). Olsen-P (available P) were extracted by placing 1  g of soil and biochar in 20  ml of NaHCO 3 for 30  min. The suspension was vacuum filtered via a 0.45  µm cellulose nitrate filter paper and analyzed using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany). For C and N analyses, about 3.5  mg of biochar and 40  mg of soil were weighted into sample boats and determined using C and N analyzer (Elementar Analyse GmbH, Hanau, Germany). Acetanilide was used as calibration standard. Total surface acidity was determined by adding 0.15 gm of biochar into 15  ml of 0.1  N NaOH and shaken for 30  h. The suspension was vacuum filtered and 5  ml of 0.1  N NaOH aliquot was transferred to 10  ml of 0.1  N HCl to completely neutralize the unreacted base. The solution was <b>back-titrated</b> with 0.1  N NaOH using a Metrohm 725 Dosimat (Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland) fitted with a 691 pH meter (Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland). Similarly, the surface basicity was measured by shaking 0.15  g of biochar with 15  ml of 0.1  N HCl for 30  h. The slurry was vacuum filtrated (0.45  µm) and an aliquot of 5  ml of 0.1  N HCl was mixed with 10  ml of 0.1  N NaOH to neutralize the unreacted acid. The solution was <b>back-titrated</b> with 0.1  N HCl. The total surface acidity and basicity were determined by calculating the base and acid uptake of biochars (Goertzen et al. 2010). For dissolved organic carbon (DOC) determination, extract was prepared by shaking biochar with 0.01  M CaCl 2 at 1 : 25 ration (w/v) for 1  h. The suspension was vacuum filtered and measured by a Dimatoc 2000 (DIMATEC Analysentechnik GmbH, Essen, Germany). The exchangeable cations and CEC of biochar were determined using BaCl 2 method. Briefly, 2.5 gm of biochar was weighted into 50  ml centrifuge tube, followed by addition of 30  ml of 0.1  M BaCl 2. The tube was shaken for 1  h and then centrifuged at 5500  rpm for 10  min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted into a 100  ml volumetric flask. This procedure was repeated three times. The collected supernatants were made up to 100  ml with 0.1  M BaCl 2 solution. The Na, Mg, Ca, K and Al concentrations of the solution were determined using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany). The same procedure was followed to determine the water soluble Na, Mg, Ca, K and Al concentrations of biochar. Finally, the concentration of exchangeable cations and CEC of biochar was computed by subtracting the concentration of water soluble cations (Na, Mg, Ca and K) to the concentration of cations extracted by 0.1  M BaCl 2. For FTIR analyses of biochars, pellets were prepared by mixing biochars with KBr powder and then analyzed using a Tensor 27 FTIR Spectrometer (Bruker optik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). Spectra were collected {{in the range of}} 400 – 4000  cm− 1 at 4  cm− 1 and 120 scans per sample. Surface areas of the biochars were determined using adsorption data of the adsorption isotherms of N 2 at − 196  °C and calculated by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) equation (Brunauer et al. 1938). For biochar and post harvest soil samples, NH 4 NO 3 (1  M) extractable fraction of Cd was determined following the extraction procedure proposed by the German national standard (DIN 19730 2009). A milled plant sample was analyzed for total Cd, P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn concentrations as previously described.|$|R
