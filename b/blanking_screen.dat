40|$|Change {{blindness}} is {{a failure}} of explicitly detecting changes between consecutively presented images when separated, e. g., by a brief <b>blank</b> <b>screen.</b> There is {{a growing body of}} evidence of implicit detection of even explicitly undetectable changes, pointing to the possibility of the implicit change detection as a prerequisite for its explicit counterpart. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) of the electroencephalography in adults during an oddball-variant of change blindness flicker paradigm. In this variant, rare pictures with a change were interspersed with frequent pictures with no change. In separate stimulus blocks, the <b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> between the change and no-change picture was either of 100 ms or 500 ms in duration. In both stimulus conditions the participants eventually explicitly detect the changed pictures, the <b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> of the longer duration only requiring in average 10 % longer exposure to the picture series until the ability emerged. However, during the change blindness, ERPs were displaced towards negative polarity at 200 – 260 ms after the stimulus onset (visual mismatch negativity) only with the <b>blank</b> <b>screens</b> of the shorter ISI. Our finding of ‘implicit change blindness’ for pictorial material that, nevertheless, successfully prepares the visual system for explicit change detection suggests that implicit change detection may not be a necessary condition for explicit change detection and that they may recruit at least partially distinct memory mechanisms...|$|R

30|$|To begin each trial, a <b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> {{appeared}} for 500  ms and {{was followed}} by a central fixation point for 500  ms. The T and L stimuli were then presented randomly within an invisible 6 [*]×[*] 6 matrix. All stimuli were presented randomly in one of four orientations (0 °, 90 °, 180 ° or 270 °) with equal probability. Participants were asked to indicate the direction in which the stem of the target T was pointing, by pressing “m” if the stem faced right and “z” if the stem faced left. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly but as accurately as possible. If no response was made within 10  s, the trial “timed out” and the next trial automatically started. Following a response or time-out, the <b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> was again displayed before the next fixation point and trial. There were 90 trials in each condition (30 for each set size).|$|R
40|$|Closing {{the eyes}} helps memory. We {{investigated}} the mechanisms underlying the eyeclosure effect by exposing 80 eyewitnesses to {{different types of}} distraction during the witness interview: <b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> (control), eyes closed, visual distraction, and auditory distraction. We examined the cognitive load hypothesis by comparing any type of distraction (visual or auditory) with minimal distraction (<b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> or eyes closed). We found recall to be significantly better when distraction was minimal, providing evidence that eyeclosure reduces cognitive load. We examined the modality-specific interference hypothesis by comparing the effects of visual and auditory distraction on recall of visual and auditory information. Visual and auditory distraction selectively impaired memory for information presented in the same modality, supporting the role of visualisation in the eyeclosure effect. Analysis of recall in terms of grain size revealed that recall of basic information about the event was robust, whereas recall of specific details was prone to both general and modality-specific disruptions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In three experiments, we used face–name {{learning}} {{to examine the}} puzzling feedback delay benefit—the tendency for feedback {{to be more effective}} when it is delayed rather than presented immediately. In Experiment 1, we found that feedback presented after a 3 -s <b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> was more effective than feedback presented immediately, even after controlling for the exposure time to the material. In Experiment 2, we replicated the benefit of a feedback delay even when participants were given extra time to view the feedback or to try to retrieve the answer, indicating that this benefit is specific to a delay before feedback. Finally, in Experiment 3, we showed that the 3 -s delay is beneficial only if it involves a <b>blank</b> <b>screen,</b> not if the delay is filled with an unrelated distracter task. These results suggest that the feedback delay benefit in this paradigm could arise from an active anticipatory process that occurs during the delay...|$|R
40|$|Finn and Roediger and {{collaborators}} (2011, 2012) {{found that}} emotionally arousing negative pictures presented to {{subjects in the}} period immediately following a retrieval of a veracious memory enhances subsequent cued-recall test performance in comparison to non-arousing neutral pictures or <b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> had been shown. This finding suggests that the period just after retrieval, called reconsolidation, together with negative emotion influence, {{plays a significant role}} in enhancing memory performance. In the present study, we investigated whether such effect would be valid for the phenomenon of false memories. Participants studied lists of associated words (DRM lists). On a subsequent free-recall test, participants’ generation of non-presented critical items (false memories) was immediately followed by pictures inducing a negative or neutral emotion or by a <b>blank</b> <b>screen.</b> Although we did not observed the expected significant memory enhancement for false memories followed by arousing images the results revealed less decline of memory retention (less forgetting effect) for those items compared to other retrieved words followed by neutral pictures or blanks.

40|$|Visual {{perception}} {{is based on}} information processing during periods of eye fixations that are interrupted by fast saccadic eye movements. The ability to sample and relate information on task-relevant objects across fixations implies that correspondence between presaccadic and postsaccadic objects is established. Postsaccadic object information usually updates and overwrites information on the corresponding presaccadic object. The presaccadic object representation is then lost. In contrast, the presaccadic object is conserved when object correspondence is broken. This helps transsaccadic memory but it may impose attentional costs on object recognition. Therefore, we investigated how breaking object correspondence across the saccade affects postsaccadic object recognition. In Experiment 1, object correspondence was broken by a brief postsaccadic <b>blank</b> <b>screen.</b> Observers made a saccade to a peripheral object which was displaced during the saccade. This object reappeared either immediately after the saccade or after the <b>blank</b> <b>screen.</b> Within the postsaccadic object, a letter was briefly presented (terminated by a mask). Observers reported displacement direction and letter identity in different blocks. Breaking objec...|$|R

40|$|Listeners {{are able}} to extract {{important}} linguistic information by viewing the talker’s face – {{a process known as}} ‘speechreading’. Previous studies of speechreading present small closed sets of simple words and their results indicate that visual speech processing engages a wide network of brain regions in the temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes that are likely to underlie multiple stages of the receptive language system. The present study further explored this network in a large group of subjects by presenting naturally-spoken sentences which tap the richer complexities of visual speech processing. Four different baselines (<b>blank</b> <b>screen,</b> static face, non-linguistic facial gurning, and auditory speech) enabled us to determine the hierarchy of neural processing involved in speechreading and to test the claim that visual input reliably accesses sound-based representations in the auditory cortex. In contrast to passively viewing a <b>blank</b> <b>screen,</b> the static-face condition evoked activation bilaterally across the border of the fusiform gyrus and cerebellum, and in the medial superior frontal gyrus and left precentral gyrus (P < 0. 05, whole brain corrected) ...|$|R

40|$|Conversation is {{supported}} by the beliefs that people have in common and the perceptual experience that they share. The visual context of a conversation has two aspects: the information that is available to each conversant, and their beliefs about what is present for each other. In our experiment, we separated these factors {{for the first time and}} examined their impact on a spontaneous conversation. We manipulated the fact that a visual scene was shared or not and the belief that a visual scene was shared or not. Participants watched videos of actors talking about a controversial topic, then discussed their own views while looking at either a <b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> or the actors. Each believed (correctly or not) that their partner was either looking at a <b>blank</b> <b>screen</b> or the same images. We recorded conversants’ eye movements, quantified how they were coordinated, and analyzed their speech patterns. Gaze coordination has been shown to be causally related to the knowledge people share before a conversation, and the information they later recall. Here, we found that both the presence of the visual scene, and beliefs about its presence for another, influenced language use and gaze coordination...|$|R
