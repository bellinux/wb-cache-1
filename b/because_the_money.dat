5|$|Although a 17-page {{petition}} with 298 signatures {{in favor}} of a public referendum was presented at the meeting, the board felt that OSI funds would not be available by the proposed November referendum. Opponents of the board's decision protested it by placing signs near the mountain deriding the purchase as an unwise expenditure. The town was not legally obligated to hold a referendum, regardless of public sentiment, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> budgeted for the purchase was not borrowed; board members planned to tap a $340,000 surplus fund, generated by the 2010 sale of town land to the OSI, which intended to allow bouldering on the property. The $340,000 fund was originally intended for capital improvements, specifically {{the construction of a new}} town hall, but a June 2011 audit of the town's 2010 budget found that a large part of the surplus had already been used to offset budget and tax shortfalls; only $79,000 remained available.|$|E

This was settled in favor of concrete and paving began in spring of 1957.|$|E
25|$|Cornelia Otis Skinner {{wrote that}} one of La Païva's conquests was Adolphe Gaiffe, a banker of whom she demanded twenty {{banknotes}} of one thousand francs each -- which, she stipulated, he must burn one by one during a scheduled 30 minutes of lovemaking. The banker decided to substitute counterfeit banknotes. Even so, the sight of their incineration was so unnerving {{that he could not}} accomplish his part of the tryst. Another source, however, states that the courtesan burned the notes, one by one, during her sexual congress with Gaiffe, who bet his friends {{he would be able to}} access her favors without payment -- and so he did, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was fake.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{began to}} fail in October 1930 (one {{year after the}} crash) when farmers {{defaulted}} on loans. There was no federal deposit insurance during that time as bank failures were considered quite common. This worried depositors {{that they might have}} a chance of losing all their savings, therefore, people started to withdraw money and changed it into currency. As deposits taken out from the bank increased, the money supply decreased <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> multiplier worked in reverse, forcing banks to liquidate assets (such as call in loans rather than create new loans.) This caused the money supply to shrink and the economy to contract and a significant decrease in aggregate investment. The decreased money supply further aggravated price deflation, putting further pressure on already struggling businesses.|$|E
500|$|In January 1999, Javie was {{the only}} one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not {{reporting}} income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. [...] Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. [...] He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally do anything wrong. [...] Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, [...] "My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the most important thing. I had to fight for my name." [...] During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. [...] He later described the trial as [...] "the hardest two weeks" [...] of his life.|$|E

McCartney got past customs by saying [...] "You know who I am", {{but he and}} Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they [...] "didn't look the part", and had to eat dinner in Evans' room. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when {{the manager of the}} club arrived demanding that we pay immediately. On explaining who Paul was and what had happened, he answered, 'You either pay the bill, or I call the police.' It certainly looked like {{we were going to get}} thrown in jail. It was ironical, sitting in a club with a millionaire, unable to pay the bill." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Vik {{municipality}} found {{a loophole}} in the Municipality Act and invested borrowed {{money in the}} stock market, by first investing and then seeking permission later. This utilization of the loophole was confirmed by the Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development in 2002, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> borrowed was secured in future income.

2500|$|Inventory {{proportionality}} is {{the goal}} of demand-driven inventory management. The primary optimal outcome is to have the same number of days' (or hours', etc.) worth of inventory on hand across all products so that the time of runout of all products would be simultaneous. In such a case, there is no [...] "excess inventory," [...] that is, inventory that would be left over of another product when the first product runs out. Excess inventory is sub-optimal <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> spent to obtain it could have been utilized better elsewhere, i.e. to the product that just ran out.|$|E

2500|$|Very soon these limits {{were widely}} exceeded. False {{documents}} were circulated with indulgences surpassing all bounds: indulgences of hundreds or {{even thousands of}} years. In 1392, {{more than a century}} before Martin Luther published the 95 Theses, Pope Boniface IX wrote to the Bishop of Ferrara condemning the practice of certain members of religious orders who falsely claimed that they were authorized by the pope to forgive all sorts of sins, and obtained money from the simple-minded faithfuls by promising them perpetual happiness in this world and eternal glory in the next.

He can run, he can throw, and he's got good power at the plate. he takes a level cut and hits the ball very sharply." [...] A sportswriter suggested to Gallinger it might be better for him to try for an outfield position since the Red Sox's current shortstop Johnny Pesky was considered the league's best. Gallinger confidently replied that Pesky [...] "beat out somebody else for the job, didn't he?" [...] However, Gallinger turned down the baseball opportunities, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> offered was too small.|$|E
2500|$|Although she {{canceled}} the bridge, Palin spent $25 {{million from the}} $223 million earmark to build the road on Gravina Island to an empty beach where the bridge would have gone. State officials said [...] "they were going ahead with the $25 million road <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> would otherwise have {{to be returned to}} the federal government." [...] The cancellation of the bridge did not lead Palin to return any of the remaining $197 million in the earmark to the Federal Government. Palin's Ketchikan campaign coordinator Mike Elerding, says, [...] "She said 'thanks but no thanks,' but they kept the money." [...] According to Palin’s communications director Bill McAlister, the bridge [...] "isn't necessarily dead"; it may still be built with [...] "a less costly design". Palin changed her mind on the bridge, he said, when [...] "she saw that Alaska was being perceived as taking from the country and not giving, and that impression bothered her and she wants to change it. [...] I think that Sarah Palin is someone who has the courage to re-evaluate situations as they developed." [...] Palin said through her spokesperson that the road would open territory for development. A McCain-Palin spokesperson said that [...] "because the contract for the road was already signed before she got into office, the governor was left no viable alternative." [...] The Alaska Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration state that the contract could have been cancelled at minimal cost and that the federal money could have been returned to Congress for other uses, if the road had been cancelled when Palin took office in December 2006, but the bridge to the island was not cancelled until September 2007.|$|E

60|$|Yet when {{he arrived}} at Stone Court he could not see the change in Raffles without a shock. But for his pallor and feebleness, Bulstrode would have called the change in him entirely mental. Instead of his loud tormenting mood, he showed an intense, vague terror, and seemed to deprecate Bulstrode's anger, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was all gone--he had been robbed--it had half of it been taken from him. He had only come here because he was ill and {{somebody}} was hunting him--somebody was after him he had told nobody anything, he had kept his mouth shut. Bulstrode, not knowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted this new nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true confessions, and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not told anything, since he had just told the man who took him up in his gig and brought him to Stone Court. Raffles denied this with solemn adjurations; the fact being that the links of consciousness were interrupted in him, and that his minute terror-stricken narrative to Caleb Garth had been delivered under a set of visionary impulses which had dropped back into darkness.|$|E
