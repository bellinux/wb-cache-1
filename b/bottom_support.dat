It is worth stressing that the 1990 paper {{was published in the}} Journal of Statistical Physics, the first paper {{of its kind in the}} journal.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} developments of exploiting {{oil and natural}} gas in deep water and harnessing renewable (wave and wind) energy in the sea, mooring lines and risers are widely deployed to position the related floating structures. Subject to environmental loads, a mooring line or riser connected to floating structure, moves up and down, back and forth, and sometimes from the left to the right. In computation of the dynamics of a mooring line or riser, it is often modeled as a flexible slender rod. While the bending moment of a chain or a rope is neglected, that of a riser is considered and specified by characteristics of the riser. Existing numerical codes for simulating the dynamics of a slender rod, such as CABLE 3 D, allow for the vertical support force and longitudinal (along the direction of the rod) friction from soils of the seabed while the transverse (in the direction transverse to the slender rod) friction between the rod and the seabed soils is not considered. In this study, we extend the current version of CABLE 3 D to allow for the transverse friction applied on the portion of a slender rod contacting the seabed soil, which is time-varying when it is moving. The friction between a slender rod and the seabed soil is computed based upon a Coulomb model originally developed for the simulation of the friction in all dry contact mechanical systems. In applying the Coulomb model, the transverse friction depends on the transverse displacement and/or velocity of a slender rod contacting the seabed. In addition, vertical <b>bottom</b> <b>support</b> of the seabed soil is calculated based on the shear stress of the seabed soil.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{cumulative}} work based on four independent manuscripts. All studies use tephrostratigraphy and geochemistry as tools for identifying the emplacement processes and/or provenance of marine tephra layers. The study areas are {{located at the}} Pacific Ring of Fire and used drill core samples from ODP and IODP Legs. Papers 1 and 2 (Schindlbeck et al., 2013 and Kutterolf et al., 2014) deal with tuffaceous sandstones, which were recovered during IODP Expedition 322 in the Nankai Trough. These packages {{are part of the}} Late Miocene middle Shikoku Basin Facies. Geochemical homogeneity and density-graded structures (pumice enrichment at the top, lithic enrichment at the <b>bottom)</b> <b>support</b> the emplacement by large volume, high-energy turbidity currents, which are each the product of a major volcanic eruption. Major and trace element, and isotope compositions of glass shards indicate a Japanese mainland source. Therefore we propose the collision zone of Paleo-Honshu and the Izu-Bonin-arc as possible source region, which implies 350 km transport distance from the source to Site 322. Manuscripts 3 and 4 (Schindlbeck et al., submitted and Schindlbeck et al., in preparation) study ODP and IODP cores offshore {{the southern part of the}} Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA). Six sites offshore Costa Rica recovered a well-preserved tephrostratigraphy from the Miocene to the Pleistocene. The subduction-related volcanism at the CAVA is known for highly explosive Plinian eruptions. These eruptions generate eruption columns, which rise up to 40 km into the stratosphere. When reaching their level of neutral buoyancy, they spread laterally with the prevailing wind and generate widely dispersed ash deposits covering areas up to > 106 km 2. If an ash cloud travels over oceans, the ash is deposited as marine ash layers, which are best preserved, since the marine environment is relatively non-erosive. The marine tephra inventory is therefore a very good archive for highly explosive Plinian eruptions. ODP and IODP cores recovered a well-preserved stratigraphy of Plinian eruptions derived from the CAVA from Miocene to Pleistocene, but also an extensive record of mainly Miocene tephra layers originated at the Galápagos hotspot. These layers from Plinian eruptions from the Galápagos are particularly interesting, since such abundant Plinian eruptions from this oceanisland setting were not described before, and the onland tephra record on the Galápagos islands is limited to Quaternary deposits. To conclude, the manuscripts presented in this study emphasize the advantage of marine tephrostratigraphy as a useful tool in volcanology. The well-preserved marine tephra layers (1) complement onland volcanic records, (2) expose previously undiscovered volcanic activity (e. g., Galápagos), (3) provide insights and comprehension of geological processes and (4) help to understand the reasons of variability of volcanic activity in time...|$|E
40|$|Seaway Heavy Lifting is an {{offshore}} contractor, {{involved in the}} wind energy market. Nowadays SHL is preparing on expanding T&I capabilities to include WTGs, after the experiences with foundations, platforms and met-masts. The company desires to enter in this market with innovative and highly efficient solutions. In order to achieve this goal, Oleg Strashnov HLV, SHL’s flagship, has been selected as the ideal means for this path. Indeed, the potential of such a vessel is seen, by the offshore experts, as possibly being applied to the T&I of WTGs in single pieces, including the nacelle. Current practice is to perform the scope in parts, by means of jack-up vessels, addressing {{a great amount of}} the work offshore. Offering an integrated solution would definitely mark a turning point for the market, providing that this new proposal has the economical and efficiency characteristics required. The main challenge for such a proposal, from the structural point of view, is to provide a proper sea-fastening for safe and stable logistical procedures, ensuring structural integrity of both vessel and transported elements. The goal of this thesis is to propose a sea-fastening solution able to meet such requirements. An articulated and detailed path has been followed, from general to more detailed analyses, in order to reach the proposed objectives. Firstly, the definition of the boundary conditions and company’s choices took place, according to the specific needs of the chosen vessel and the solution effectiveness requirements. Current offshore wind energy market situation and trends have been investigated and analysed, in order to find specific WTG designs to use for the study. After the definition of sea state conditions, vessel accelerations have been quantified and the most critical load combination for the WTGs was found. Then, possibilities of sea-fastening arrangements have been analysed, through a conceptual study. In order to deal with the destructive bending moment effects on the WTGs, the concept providing a free moment connection at foundation level has been selected. It was required to provide additional external structures, clamping the WTGs at a certain height, in order to doubly support the transported elements. A parametric study has been carried out to compare the best achievable solution using such a hinged bottom connection, against the best achievable solution adopting a fixed connection. Higher requirements in stiffness, for the external supporting structures, have been found in the case of fixed connection. Among other advantages, important steel savings resulted and it was ensured that final solution did not exceed them. Detailed design has been provided for <b>bottom</b> <b>support,</b> due to its challenges from a structural point of view. Besides rotation, main requirements were vertical and horizontal loads constraint. After a dedicated conceptual analysis, a combination of rubber and steel elements was found to be most effective for the purpose. Linear structural analysis have been carried out, supported by parametric studies. The unusual utilization of rubber for sea-fastening has been analysed and proven to be feasible. Starting from the defined model, additional studies for linear buckling and free vibration analyses followed. Subsequently, focus moved to the intermediate support connection. Where design was less detailed, {{because of the presence of}} features more related to mechanical engineering, considerations and suggestions have been proposed. An innovative flexible clamping connection has been designed and proven to be effective; this involved rubber fenders, steel rings and bracings. Finally, the design was carried out for the bottom grillage system, connecting the above sea-fastening to the vessel deck. Practical considerations led to a conservative solution, able to meet the structural integrity requirements and available for further optimisations. Once all the individual parts were designed, adaptation of initial assumptions and solution final assessment were proposed. With its 8050 tonnes of total weight, such a system is proven to provide safe and efficient T&I activities for six WTGs per voyage. Among the selected models, the ALSTOM 6 MW is chosen for the analysis, because of its most onerous configuration. Structural feasibility and integrity are assessed through hand calculations and FEAs. Boundary conditions are all met and effective features are finally pointed out. Because of the choice of taking advantage of flexibility and the unusual application of rubber elements, the final solution demonstrates clear innovative features. According to the initial conditions, such a sea-fastening system provides a solution for extremely critical sea-states, probably unlikely to appear in real operations.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades it has become {{increasingly}} clear that the use of renewable energy sources is indispensable {{in order to reduce the}} excessive use of fossil fuels. One of the focus points of recent investigations has been in the field of organic photovoltaic devices, which converts light directly into a current. Due to their ease of processing and mechanical flexibility these solar cells would be cheap and applicable on almost any substrate. An organic solar cell consists of an active layer sandwiched between two dissimilar electrodes. Upon the illumination of such a device, a so-called exciton (a bound hole-electron pair) is created and in the presence of an electron acceptor this exciton is separated into positive and negative charges. When using electrodes with different work-functions, the charges are then transported towards the electrodes, which causes the flow of a current. The short exciton lifetime and therefore its short diffusion length make organic solar cells extremely sensitive to the active layer morphology. The interface between donor and acceptor moieties needs to be as large as possible and at the same time continuous pathways for both positive and negative charges towards the electrodes have to be assured. To get a better understanding of the processes involved in such organic or polymer solar cells and eventually optimize the performance of devices, it is vital to control the active layer material both on a molecular and on a macroscopic scale. In this thesis the use of block copolymers as self-organizing materials for solar cells was investigated. Block copolymer self-assemble due to the incompatibility of the two blocks, which are chemically linked to each other. The type of nanostructuring, taking place at the lengthscale of the two blocks, depends on this incompatibility (χ), the total length of the polymer (N) and on the volume fraction of the two blocks. A material that is suitable for application in a photovoltaic device, should contain a block with electron donating (D) and another block with electron accepting (A) moieties. For a good phase separation, it is important to control the molecular structure in order to ensure the presence of only well-defined block copolymer. This in itself is not evident, since the synthesis of such block copolymers requires many steps, each of which should give a well controlled structure. The synthesis strategy employed in this thesis can be essentially divided in three steps: (1) the synthesis of a conjugated polymer that acts as light absorbing and electron donating material, (2) the chain extension of this rigid rod-like polymer to give a rod-coil block copolymer and (3) the functionalization of the second block with electron accepting functionalities (e. g. C 60). In this thesis it is attempted to control the first two steps in terms of polymer length and polydispersity (PD), which should be low in order to enhance the self-organizational properties and the last step to avoid crosslinking and to ensure a known amount of electron acceptors that are actually covalently bonded to the polymer chain. The synthesis of a PPV (poly(p-phenylene vinylene)) derivative with branched solubilizing side-chains, poly[(2, 5 -di(2 ’-ethyl) hexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylene vinylene] (DEH-PPV), was performed via a Siegrist polycondensation. This polymerization is based on the self-condensation between an aldehyde (activated with aniline) and a methyl group. The influence of several reaction parameters on the degree of polymerization (DPn) and the polydispersity was investigated. An increase in reaction temperature or reaction time gives a slight increase of the molecular weight, which ranges from 4 - 8 kg∙mol- 1. Due to a decrease in reactivity with growing polymer chain length, the PD is already quite low, but it can be reduced even further (to ~ 1. 1) by using low monomer concentration or column chromatography as a method of purification. The Siegrist polycondensation of a PTV (poly(2, 5 -thienylene vinylene)) derivative, which has a better overlap with respect to the solar spectrum, was unsuccessful and only very short oligomers could be obtained. A new method for the synthesis of a PTV derivative with a single functional aldehyde end-group was therefore designed. Good results were obtained when using a Wittig-Horner-Emmons polycondensation, the self-condensation between a phosphonate and aldehyde group. By varying the amount of monofunctional end-capper employed, the polymer length could be controlled perfectly and polymer lengths ranged from 2 to > 20 monomer units. The relatively high polydispersities could be reduced (to ~ 1. 5) by precipitating the polymer. An adaptation of literature procedures permitted the transformation of these polymers into a macroinitiator for nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMRP). NMRP is a controlled radical polymerization technique that should allow for the direct chain extension of the conjugated polymer with a second polymer, such as polystyrene or polyacrylate. The length of the second block can thus be controlled by adapting the polymerization time or the amount of monomer employed. This controlled/”living” polymerization technique also leads to rather low polydispersities. Since only very few copolymerizations using this technique are described in literature, a full investigation of the “living” character of both homo-, co- and block copolymerizations was performed. In this way very well-defined block copolymers with low polydispersity could be obtained for copolymerizations of styrene and methylacrylate. After purification, the final block copolymers showed a monomodal size-exclusion chromatogram, indicating the absence of homopolymers, with low polydispersity (PD = 1. 3). The (co) polymerization of n-butylacrylate gave somewhat less controlled polymerizations and the use of functional acrylic comonomers lead to complete loss of control. As a functional comonomer 4 -chloromethylstyrene (CMS) was used. The covalent incorporation of fullerene[60] (or C 60) in the second block poses some problems, due to the presence of multiple functional groups on the polymer chain and the fact that C 60 can react multiple times, leading to crosslinking. Three grafting methods were investigated and the most promising results were obtained when the chlorine is exchanged for an azide and a condensation reaction with C 60 is performed at relatively low temperatures (60 ºC). The formed triazoline compound is converted into a stable azafulleroid by extrusion of N 2 at high temperature. In this way around 100 % functionalization could be obtained, which is necessary in order to prevent crosslinking and the presence of pristine C 60 in the sample, which is almost impossible to remove. The final products were characterized in many different ways to correlate the physical properties and the self-organization in solution and in thin films to the device performances. PPV-PS based block copolymers show some kind of phase separation on the nanometric scale, although no highly ordered structures could be detected. The large window between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the liquid-crystalline-to-isotropic transition temperature (TLC-I) for PPV-PBA and PPV-PMA based block copolymers allows for a much better phase separation. This phase separation into elongated structures is enhanced even further upon annealing and features as long as a micron can be obtained for relatively long coil blocks. These structures are most likely lamellae oriented perpendicular to the <b>bottom</b> <b>support</b> surface. This self-organization leads to relatively high hole mobilities, but a correlation study between the conductivity of a thin polystyrene film with varying amounts of C 60 it contained, showed that in all cases the surrounding polystyrene prevents the formation of a good percolation path and therefore electron mobilities were quite low. Device functions are therefore also very poor and an optimization of both the active layer morphology, through annealing or adaptation of the block copolymer, and the electron mobility in the acceptor layer are necessary. A major drawback of organic solar cells is their relative instability towards oxidation by (singlet) oxygen. The presence of singlet oxygen (created by energy transfer from the polymer in the triplet excited state) induces bond-breaking of the vinyl bond in the conjugated polymer. Earlier reports on mixtures of electron donating and accepting compounds in thin films, showed a reduction of the degradation in the presence of a derivative of C 60. It was implied that the presence of C 60 reduces the amount of singlet oxygen through competition of the energy transfer to triplet oxygen with charge transfer from the conjugated polymer to the C 60. Investigation of these processes in solution can only be done when both functionalities are combined in one molecule or polymer, since decay processes are to fast to investigate the energy transfer in dilute solutions of non-covalently bonded compounds. The influence of the presence of C 60 covalently bonded to the conjugated polymer on the creation of singlet oxygen was investigated by laser flash photolysis. In this thesis it was demonstrated that charge transfer to C 60 indeed takes place even in solution, but that, contrary to the previous report, this charge transfer increases the amount of singlet oxygen produced rather than to decreases it. A likely explanation for the beneficial effect of C 60 on the degradation of PPV in thin films, has more likely to do with the slow diffusion of oxygen into films containing many fullerene crystallites. In conclusion, the synthesis of very well-defined block copolymers containing an electron donating and accepting part was fully elaborated and all steps were well controlled. Some (preliminary) morphology and device results were obtained, indicating that the active layer morphology, together with its physical and electronic properties, should be fine-tuned. This new well-defined block copolymer allowed for the investigation of the singlet oxygen formation in solution. ...|$|E
50|$|The dock {{entrance}} {{was on the}} River Hull {{just south}} of North Bridge, and the dock itself built west-south-west along {{the path of the}} North Wall as far as the Beverley Gate. The dock walls were of local brick, with Bramley Fall stone coping piece. Cement for the lock wall's front construction was rendered waterproof through the use of pozzolana imported from Italy. Piling for the walls consisted of piles narrowing from 12 by 9 in to 3 in at the <b>bottom</b> <b>supporting</b> sleepers 12 by 6 in wide by deep trenailed to the piles. The alluvium excavated during the dock construction was deposited mostly on land to the north, raising the ground by 5 ft—the land was later sold for building upon.|$|R
