40|$|A multi-gas sensor is {{provided}} which modulates a polarized light beam over a broadband of wavelengths between two alternating orthogonal polarization components. The two orthogonal polarization {{components of the}} polarization modulated beam are directed along two distinct optical paths. At least one optical path contains one or more spectral discrimination element, with each spectral discrimination element having spectral absorption features {{of one or more}} gases of interest being measured. The two optical paths then intersect, and one orthogonal component of the intersected components is transmitted and the other orthogonal component is reflected. The combined polarization modulated beam is partitioned into one or more smaller spectral regions of interest where one or more gases of interest has an absorption band. The difference in intensity between the two orthogonal polarization components is then determined in each partitioned spectral region of interest as an indication of the spectral emission/absorption of the light beam by the gases of interest in the measurement path. The spectral emission/absorption is indicative of the concentration of the one or more gases of interest in the measurement path.

40|$|We aim to {{analytically}} {{arrive at}} a <b>beam</b> <b>splitter</b> formulation for electron waves. The electron <b>beam</b> <b>splitter</b> is {{an essential component of}} quantum logical devices. To arrive at the <b>beam</b> <b>splitter</b> structure, the electrons are treated as waves, i. e. we assume the transport to be ballistic. Ballistic electrons are electrons that travel over such short distances that their phase coherence is maintained. For mesoscopic devices with size smaller than the mean free path, the phase relaxation length and the Fermi wavelength of electrons in the medium, the transport can be considered to be coherent and hence ballistic. In such a case the electron motion can be completely described by the Schrodinger's wave equation with an effective mass assigned to the electron. To design a <b>beam</b> <b>splitter,</b> we draw inspiration from an electromagnetic <b>beam</b> <b>splitter,</b> where the Maxwell's equations (and subsequently the Helmholtz equation) are used to describe the splitting of light across a thin slab of dielectric material.
