40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{estimate}} Krasnoyarsk region <b>budget</b> <b>losses</b> due to the shortfalls of taxes from businesses related with a temporary disability of smoking employees and the reduction of labor intensity due to the smoking breaks in 2011. In our work we used the method of economic losses estimation, developed by Conference Board of Canada. The following results were obtained. The estimation of tax shortfalls due to a temporary disability of smoking employees and decrease of labor intensity due to smoking breaks was carried out. It was obtained that Krasnoyarsk region <b>budget</b> <b>losses</b> {{as a result of}} the tax shortfalls are equal to 532. 8 million rubles – due to increased sick absence risks among smokers and 3   414. 3 million rubles – due to the lack of workers on the workplace during smoking breaks. Thus, it was found that the total <b>budget</b> <b>losses</b> of Krasnoyarsk region in 2011 reach 0. 34 % of the gross regional product. The obtained results can be used for the assessments of the economic losses. DOI:  [URL] </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A truly passive long-reach, {{symmetric}} 40 -Gb/s {{time and}} wavelength division multiplexed {{passive optical network}} (TWDM-PON) with a high <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> is demonstrated, using direct modulation and direct detection in both upstream and downstream directions. Thermally tuned directly modulated lasers (DMLs) are employed to serve as both upstream and downstream transmitters, not only owing to their low cost, but also, as a carrier-less modulation method, where the signal generated by direct mod-ulation is demonstrated to be more robust to high launch power induced fiber nonlinearities compared with external intensity mod-ulation formats with strong carrier power. Therefore, DML is suitable for applying in TWDM-PON to achieve a high loss bud-get. Moreover, the frequency chirp induced dispersion of directly-modulated signal is managed thanks to the combination of optical spectral reshaping and dispersion supported transmission effects, which {{makes it possible for}} the directly-modulated signal to reach a distance of 100 km and still with a good quality. As a result, a system <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> of 53 dB is achieved, supporting more than 1000 users with 100 -km purely passive reach, which is the first demon-stration of high <b>loss</b> <b>budget,</b> long reach TWDM-PONs to our best knowledge.

50|$|As with bit rate, the {{standards}} describe several optical power budgets, most common is 28 dB of <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> for both BPON and GPON, but products have been announced using less expensive optics as well. 28 dB corresponds to about 20 km with a 32-way split.

Although both the GPON and EPON protocols permit large split ratios (up to 128 subscribers for GPON, up to 32,768 for EPON), in practice most PONs are deployed with a split ratio of 1:32 or smaller.|$|R

In cyclic operations such as drilling and blasting, losing time in each cycle will cause a delay in operation for all cycles and can impose huge amounts of <b>budget</b> <b>loss</b> because of the significance of fixed costs. Therefore, this investigation tries to minimise the mucking time in drilling and blasting operations of the Alborz Tunnel in Iran via controlling the topsize of muckpile in order to eliminate the need for time consuming secondary blasting. Using the Split-Desktop system, the size distribution curve for 25 blasting rounds in Alborz Tunnel were obtained from which the topsize of the muckpile for each round was calculated. 16 datasets were used to develop a multiple linear regression model. The other nine datasets were used to validate the model. Comparing the actual and predicted values of topsizes, R 2 and RMSE for the model were obtained as 0. 73 and 0. 14 respectively, showing that the proposed model can be used for controlling topsize of muckpile.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the study of characteristics of commercial Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers-SOAs and their employment in GPONs for the purpose of packet equalization of upstream bursts in order to provide additional <b>loss</b> <b>budget.</b> Additional <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> is aimed at facilitating the extension of GPONs to provide not only longer distance between central office and end user, but is also expected {{to increase the number of}} maximum users that can be connected to a single central office. The problem and the requirements of optical networks are described. After careful investigation into legal and technical dimensions of the situation such as use of certain wavelengths and EDFA’s inabilities, it is concluded that instead of EDFA or an Opto-electronic amplifier, an SOA should be considered for the purpose of employing as an optical amplifier installed in front of burst mode receiver at the central office. Commercial SOAs are used in order to investigate the limitations of SOA so that a suitable solution can be looked for within the functional constraints of the amplifier. The results of parametric measurements including input/output signal power, Gain and saturation are discussed; four different commercial SOAs are assessed with special emphasis on input power dynamics and gain response. The bit error rate -BER analysis is performed on SOAs in the context of the findings of parametric analysis of the SOAs. The effect of varying the input signal power on BER was observed. The receiver sensitivity for BER of 10 - 9 was measured for various SOA input power values. Power penalty imposed on receiver’s sensitivity, by saturation effects and noise is analysed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{probe the}} limits, both {{experimentally}} and analyt-ically, of {{passive optical network}} (PON) monitoring using peri-odic coding technology. The experimental demonstration focuses on a 16 customer PON with a 20 km feeder fiber followed by ei-ther a single cluster or a tiered hierarchy. A directly modulated laser modulated at 1 GHz was used to generate the monitoring probe signals. The measured data from the experimental setup was fed to a reduced complexity maximum likelihood sequence estima-tion (RC-MLSE) algorithm to detect and localize the customers. Three different PON deployments were tested. We demonstrate improved monitoring robustness when using a variable threshold for networks with a tiered geographic distribution. While only a 16 customer PON was tested, our experimental setup had 18 dB margin in the total <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> corresponding to splitting losses for 64 customers. We investigate analytically the total permissible <b>loss</b> <b>budget</b> of the monitoring system operating in the 1650 nm wave-band {{as a function of}} receiver specifications. We examine the effect of resolution in the analog-to-digital conversion on the correlation peaks that form sufficient statistics for the RC-MLSE algorithm. Resolution affects both the RC-MLSE algorithm and the use of signal averaging to improve signal-to-noise ratio. We find that the monitoring system is able to monitor current PON standards with inexpensive, commercially available electronics.
