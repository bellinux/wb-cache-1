Our agents explore via Thompson sampling, drawing Monte Carlo samples from a Bayes-by-Backprop neural network. Our algorithm learns much faster than common exploration strategies such as ϵ-greedy, Boltzmann exploration, and <b>bootstrapping-based</b> approaches. Additionally, we show that spiking the replay buffer with experiences from just a few successful episodes can make Q-learning feasible when it might otherwise fail. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
30|$|Next {{to direct}} {{approaches}} aiming to correct for the bias of the FEM (see, e.g. Kiviet 1995, Everaert and Pozzi 2007, {{and the related}} literature for analytical or <b>bootstrapping-based</b> correction factors), the most widely applied approaches of dealing {{with this kind of}} endogeneity typically applies instrumental variable (IV) and generalized methods of moments (GMM) based techniques. While the first generation of models used transformations in first differences, latter extensions also account for the information in levels, when setting up proper estimators. A common tool is the system GMM estimator by Blundell and Bond (1998) as weighted average of first difference and level GMM.|$|E
40|$|Advances in data {{collection}} and storage technologies have resulted in large and dynamically growing data sets at many organizations. Database and data mining researchers often use sampling with great effect to scale up performance on these data sets with small cost to accuracy. However, existing techniques often ignore the cost of computing a sample. This cost is often linear {{in the size of}} the data set, not the sample, which is expensive. Furthermore, for data mining applications that leverage progressive sampling or <b>bootstrapping-based</b> techniques, this cost can be prohibitive, since they require the generation of multiple samples. To address this problem, we present a solution in the context of a state-of-the-art data analysis center. Specifically, we propose a scalable service that supports sample generatio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to selecting the initial seed set using stratified sampling strategy in <b>bootstrapping-based</b> semi-supervised learning for semantic relation classification. First, the training data is partitioned into several strata according to relation types/subtypes, then relation instances are randomly sampled from each stratum to form the initial seed set. We also investigate different augmentation strategies in iteratively adding reliable instances to the labeled set, and find that the bootstrapping procedure may stop at a reasonable point to significantly decrease the training time without degrading too much in performance. Experiments on the ACE RDC 2003 and 2004 corpora show the stratified sampling strategy contributes more than the bootstrapping procedure itself. This suggests that a proper sampling strategy is critical in semi-supervised learning. ...|$|E
30|$|In general, due to {{the many}} iterations, <b>bootstrapping-based</b> {{extraction}} systems suffer from semantic drift [28, 69], which occurs when errors in labeling accumulate and the learned concepts drift from what was intended. Carlson et al. [17] proposed that this problem could {{be dealt with by}} coupling the semi-supervised learning of categories and relations. The authors describe the use of the CBL algorithm (Coupled Bootstrap Learner), which takes as input an initial ontology and a large corpus from Web pages. Motivated by the fact that these systems return a significant number of errors or low relevance relation instances, a graph-based method to rank the returned relation instances of bootstrapping Relation Extraction system is proposed in [64]. Ordering the extracted examples by the relevance to the given seeds is helpful to filter out irrelevant instances.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{estimate}} and compare shifts in (technical) efficiency across OECD countries, caused by the global financial crises and heterogeneity. Technical efficiency of OECD countries is estimated by applying the panel model with arbitrary temporal heterogeneity in time and factor structures (a model with unobservable individual effects) that fits the stochastic frontier analysis. Because of missing values in observations, the <b>bootstrapping-based</b> algorithm allowing for trends in data across observations within a cross-sectional unit is applied for imputations. The parameters are estimated in a semi-parametric way. The proposed estimation derives sufficient results regardless of any assumption on the temporal pattern of country individual effects and contributes to the development of a tool for better understanding of unobserved factors that drive fluctuations in OECD countries...|$|E
40|$|Several <b>bootstrapping-based</b> {{relation}} extraction algorithms {{working on}} large corpora {{or on the}} Web have been presented in the literature. A crucial issue for such algorithms is to avoid the introduction of too much noise into further iter-ations. Typically, this is achieved by applying appropriate pattern and tuple evaluation measures, henceforth called fil-tering functions, thereby selecting only the most promising patterns and tuples. In this paper, we systematically compare different filtering functions proposed across the literature. Al-though we also discuss our own implementation of a pattern learning algorithm, the main contribution of the paper is actu-ally the extensive comparison and evaluation of the different filtering functions proposed in the literature with respect to seven datasets. Our results indicate {{that some of the}} com-monly used filters do not outperform a trivial baseline filter in a statistically significant manner...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer’s {{disease is}} {{the most common form of}} age-related dementia. Early-stage {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer is of major importance for the following reasons: Also easily curable conditions like depression, poor nutrition and drug side effects may cause symptoms like early-stage Alzheimer. Moreover, recently some medications have been developed which successfully attenuate the symptoms and delay the progression of Alzheimer, but to be effective, they need to be applied as soon as possible. However, early-stage diagnosis of Alzheimer is very difficult since the symptoms are very mild and can easily be confounded with effects of normal aging. In this paper, we introduce a <b>bootstrapping-based</b> feature extraction technique to identify early-stage Alzheimer’s disease from resting-state functional resonance images. Our experiments demonstrate that subjects with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease can be distinguished with an accuracy of 79 % from age-matched healthy subjects using a support vector machine on the extracted features...|$|E
40|$|An {{iterative}} <b>bootstrapping-based</b> data over-sampling {{strategy is}} {{presented in this paper}} together with an adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to deal with a severely imbalanced data modelling problem. As real industrial data are often very large, containing hundreds of process variables and a huge number of data records, the selection of a compact set of input variables becomes critical for any successful modelling and analysis operations. Significant efforts have been devoted to identifying the most relevant input variables through correlation analysis and neural network based forward input selection. An optimal majority to minority class data ratio, which controls the level of data imbalance for model training, is then determined through the iterative bootstrapping process such that the combined sensitivity and specificity performance is optimised. The iterative bootstrapping ANFIS modelling strategy is then applied to a real industrial case study for rail quality classification, with the original data being provided by Tata Steel Europe. Preliminary results show a good overall performance through the iterative bootstrapping data over-sampling ANFIS modelling...|$|E
40|$|Description Amelia II ``multiply imputes' ' {{missing data}} in a single {{cross-section}} (such as a survey), from a time series (like variables collected for each year in a country), or from a time-series-cross-sectional data set (such as collected by years for each of several countries). Amelia II implements our <b>bootstrapping-based</b> algorithm that gives essentially the same answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches, is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can handle many more variables. Unlike Amelia I and other statistically rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please let us know if you find to the contrary!). The program also generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series across observations within a crosssectional unit,as well as priors that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values of missing cells in their data. Amelia II also includes useful diagnostics of the fit of multiple imputation models.

40|$|Purpose: Our study {{proposes a}} <b>bootstrapping-based</b> method to {{automatically}} extract data-usage statements from academic texts. Design/methodology/approach: The method for data-usage statements extraction starts with seed entities and iteratively learns patterns and data-usage statements from unlabeled text. In each iteration, new patterns are constructed {{and added to}} the pattern list based on their calculated score. Three seed-selection strategies are also proposed in this paper. Findings: The performance of the method is verified by means of experiments on real data collected from computer science journals. The {{results show that the}} method can achieve satisfactory performance regarding precision of extraction and extensibility of obtained patterns. Research limitations: While the triple representation of sentences is effective and efficient for extracting data-usage statements, it is unable to handle complex sentences. Additional features that can address complex sentences should thus be explored in the future. Practical implications: Data-usage statements extraction is beneficial for data-repository construction and facilitates research on data-usage tracking, dataset-based scholar search, and dataset evaluation. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to address the important task of automatically extracting data-usage statements from real data. ...|$|E
40|$|As an {{important}} and challenging problem in computer vision, zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims at automatically recognizing the instances from unseen object classes without training data. To address this problem, ZSL is usually {{carried out in the}} following two aspects: 1) capturing the domain distribution connections between seen classes data and unseen classes data; and 2) modeling the semantic interactions between the image feature space and the label embedding space. Motivated by these observations, we propose a bidirectional mapping based semantic relationship modeling scheme that seeks for crossmodal knowledge transfer by simultaneously projecting the image features and label embeddings into a common latent space. Namely, we have a bidirectional connection relationship that takes place from the image feature space to the latent space {{as well as from the}} label embedding space to the latent space. To deal with the domain shift problem, we further present a transductive learning approach that formulates the class prediction problem in an iterative refining process, where the object classification capacity is progressively reinforced through <b>bootstrapping-based</b> model updating over highly reliable instances. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (AwA, CUB and SUN) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art approaches...|$|E
40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the characterization of}} homomorphic encryption schemes {{both in terms of}} security and design. In particular, we are interested in currently existing fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes and their common structures and security. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: • We define a certain type of homomorphic encryption that we call shift-type and identify it as the basic underlying structure of all existing homomorphic encryption schemes. It generalizes the already known notion of shift-type group homomorphic encryption. • We give an IND-CPA characterization of all shift-type homomorphic encryption schemes in terms of an abstract subset membership problem. • We show that this characterization carries over to all leveled FHE schemes that arise by applying Gentry’s bootstrapping technique to shift-type homomorphic encryption schemes. Since this is the common structure of all existing schemes, our result actually characterizes the IND-CPA security of all existing <b>bootstrapping-based</b> leveled FHE. • We prove that the IND-CPA security of FHE schemes that offer a certain type of circuit privacy (for FHE schemes with a binary plaintext space we require circuit privacy for a single AND-gate and, in fact, all existing binary-plaintext FHE schemes offer this) and are based on Gentry’s bootstrapping technique is equivalent to the circular security of the underlying bootstrappable scheme...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This study aims to {{investigate}} how organizations can utilize sport sponsorship {{to build their}} corporate social responsibility (CSR) image effectively, by examining the attributes of a sports property that are most conducive to a sponsor gaining CSR image benefits. Design/methodology/approach – A between-subjects experimental design was used, which simulated different sponsorship scenarios by varying community proximity (operationalized by property scope) and property engagement in community initiatives. Hypotheses were tested with a non-parametric <b>bootstrapping-based</b> procedure, using a panel sample of 400. Findings – The results show that a sporting property’s proactive community engagement is conducive to an enhanced CSR image for its sponsor, especially when the property operates on the national rather than grassroots level. Further analysis also demonstrates the critical contribution of altruistic motive attributions in the process. Originality/value – This study advances knowledge on how organizations may build their CSR image while leveraging on the strong audience involvement and the mass appeal of sport sponsorship. It {{is the first to}} offer insights into {{the extent to which a}} sports property’s proactive engagement in the community, rather than that of the sponsoring firm itself, enhances the CSR image of the sponsor, particularly if the property’s community proximity is low. Furthermore, our results provide an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms determining the benefits that sponsors can reap from a property’s activities.

40|$|Obesity is {{a rising}} problem among {{adolescents}} in modern societies; {{it results in}} long-term cardio-metabolic problems. Possible overlooked drivers of obesity and its consequent cardio-metabolic deficits include videogame addiction and the resulting curtailed sleep; both are growing problems among adolescents. The objective {{of this study is}} to examine possible associations among these concepts in adolescents, as a means to point to plausible interventions. Data were collected from 94 adolescents who play videogames and are enrolled in outpatient clinics, using surveys, wearable sleep monitors (FitBit), physical exams, and blood tests at three points in time. These data were subjected to structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses and <b>bootstrapping-based</b> mediation testing procedures. Videogame addiction among adolescents was negatively associated with sleep duration (β = - 0. 24). Sleep duration was negatively associated with obesity (β = - 0. 30), which in turn was associated with elevated blood pressure (β = 0. 26), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β = - 0. 18), high triglycerides (β = 0. 61), and high insulin resistance (β = 0. 39). The model explained 36. 2 % of the variation in sleep duration, 32. 7 % of the variation in obesity, and between 12. 8 % and 28. 1 % of the variation in cardio-metabolic indicators. Post-hoc analyses indicated that curtailed sleep is a possible full mediator of the association between videogame addiction, abdominal obesity and the associated cardio-metabolic deficits. The findings point to possible information systems use lifestyle-health links, which behooves researchers and practitioners to pay closer attention to possible adverse health outcomes of technology-related addictions. Interventions that target problematic video-gaming and sleep should be devised as a possible means for improving adolescents' long-term cardio-metabolic health...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Designing {{evidence-based}} {{interventions to}} address socioeconomic disparities {{in health and}} health behaviours requires {{a better understanding of}} the specific explanatory mechanisms. We aimed to investigate a comprehensive range of potential theoretical mediators of physical activity (PA) and screen time in different socioeconomic status (SES) groups: a high SES group of high school students, and a low SES group of vocational school students. The COM-B system, including the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), was used as a heuristic framework to synthesise different theoretical determinants in this exploratory study. Methods Finnish vocational and high school students (N[*]=[*] 659) aged 16 – 19, responded to a survey assessing psychological, social and environmental determinants of activity (PA and screen time). These determinants are mappable into the COM-B domains: capability, opportunity and motivation. The outcome measures were validated self-report measures for PA and screen time. The statistical analyses included a <b>bootstrapping-based</b> mediation procedure. Results Regarding PA, there were SES differences in all of the COM-B domains. For example, vocational school students reported using less self-monitoring of PA, weaker injunctive norms to engage in regular PA, and fewer intentions than high school students. Mediation analyses identified potential mediators of the SES-PA relationship in all of three domains: The most important candidates included self-monitoring (CI 95 for b: 0. 19 – 0. 47), identity (0. 04 – 0. 25) and material resources available (0. 01 – 0. 16). However, SES was not related to most determinants of screentime, where there were mainly gender differences. Most determinants were similarly related with both behaviours in both SES groups, indicating no major moderation effect of SES on these relationships. Conclusions This study revealed that already in the first years of educational differentiation, levels of key PA determinants differ, contributing to socioeconomic differences in PA. The analyses identified the strongest mediators of the SES-PA association, but additional investigation utilising longitudinal and experimental designs are needed. This study demonstrates the usefulness of combining constructs from various theoretical approaches to better understand the role of distinct mechanisms that underpin socioeconomic health behaviour disparities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{postprandial}} event {{known as}} the specific dynamic action is an evolutionarily conserved physiological set of metabolic responses to feeding. Its behavioral counterpart, a sequence of drinking, maintenance (e. g., grooming) and sleep-like behaviors {{known as the}} behavioral satiety sequence (BSS), has been thoroughly described in rodents and has enabled the refined evaluation of potential appetite modifiers. However, the presence and attributes of a BSS have not been systematically studied in non-mammalian species. Here, we describe the BSS induced in pigeons (Columba livia) by 1) the presentation of a palatable seed mixture (SM) food to free-feeding animals (SM+FF condition) and 2) re-feeding after a 24 -h fasting period (FD 24 h+SM), which was examined by continuous behavioral recording for 2 h. We then compare these patterns to those observed in free-feeding (FF) animals. A set of graphic representations and indexes, drawn from these behaviors (latency, time-to-peak, inter-peak intervals and the first intersection between feeding curves {{and those of other}} BSS-typical behaviors) were used to describe the temporal structure and sequential relationships between the pigeon's BSS components. Cramér–von Mises-based statistical procedures and <b>bootstrapping-based</b> methods to compare pairs of complex behavioral curves were described and used for comparisons among the behavioral profiles during the free-feeding recordings and after fasting- and SM-induced BSS. FD 24 h+SM- and SM+FF-induced feeding were consistently followed by a similar sequence of increased bouts of drinking, followed by preening and then sleep, which were significantly different from that of FF birds. The sequential and temporal patterns of the pigeon's BSS were not affected by differences in food intake or by dissimilarity in motivational content of feeding stimuli. The present data indicated that a BSS pattern can be reliably evoked in the pigeon, in a chronological succession and sequence that strongly resembled that observed in rodents and primates. This pattern can be quantitatively described and compared using different suitable and coordinated behavioral measures, enabling further studies on the comparative and evolutionary aspects of the mechanisms that shape the post-consummatory behavioral flux in amniotes...|$|E
