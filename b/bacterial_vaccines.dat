40|$|SummaryWe {{evaluated}} γ-irradiated Listeria monocytogenes as a killed <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine,</b> {{testing the}} hypothesis that irradiation preserves antigenic and adjuvant structures destroyed by traditional heat or chemical inactivation. Irradiated Listeria monocytogenes (LM), unlike heat-killed LM, efficiently activated dendritic cells via Toll-like receptors and induced protective T cell responses in mice. Like live LM, irradiated LM induced Toll-like-receptor-independent T cell priming. Cross-presentation of irradiated listerial antigens to CD 8 + T cells involved TAP- and proteasome-dependent cytosolic antigen processing. These results establish that killed LM can induce protective T cell responses, previously thought to require live infection. γ-irradiation may be potentially applied to numerous <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates, and irradiated bacteria {{could serve as a}} vaccine platform for recombinant antigens derived from other pathogens, allergens, or tumors...|$|R
40|$|A novel CC {{chemokine}} gene {{was isolated}} from {{large yellow croaker}} (Pseudosciaena crocea) by expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis (LycCC). The open reading frame (ORF) of 300 nucleotides (m) of LycCC encodes a polypeptide of 100 amino acids (aa), including a 22 -aa signal peptide and a 78 -aa mature polypeptide. The deduced LycCC possesses the typical arrangement of four cysteines as found in other known CC chemokines (C- 27 C- 28, C- 55 and C- 77). Genomic analysis revealed that LycCC gene, spanning 2259 nt, consisted of three exons and two introns. Recombinant LycCC (rLycCC) protein produced in Pichia pastoris exhibited marked chemotactic activity for peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs) from large yellow croaker. RT-PCR analysis showed that LycCC gene was constitutively expressed in all nine tissues examined, although at a different level. Upon stimulation with poly(I:C) or inactivated trivalent <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine,</b> LycCC gene expression was obviously up-regulated in kidney, gills, spleen, liver. intestine, blood and heart at 12 h post-induction, and poly(I:C) was more potent than <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine</b> in up-regulating LycCC expression. Time-course analysis using a real time PCR revealed that LycCC transcripts in spleen and kidney were quickly increased by either poly(I:C) or <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine</b> and reached their peak levels at 12 h, followed by a rapid decrease at 24 h. An in vivo administration of rLycCC could significantly up-regulate the expression of low molecular mass polypeptide 10 (LMP 10), MHC class I alpha chain and beta 2 -microglobulin (beta(2) m) in spleen, kidney and blood at 24 h after treatment. These results suggest that LycCC may not only have a pro-inflammatory function in immune response triggered by poly(I:C) or <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine,</b> but also be involved in adaptive immune response by modulating MHC class I antigen processing and presenting pathway in large yellow croaker.

40|$|Vaccination is an {{effective}} and safe strategy for combating bacterial diseases in fish, but the mechanisms underlying the early immune response after vaccination remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we used RNA-seq technology to perform transcriptome analysis of spleens from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) induced by inactivated trivalent <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine</b> (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus and Aeromonas hydrophila). A total of 2, 789 or 1, 511 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained at 24 or 72 h after vaccination, including 1, 132 or 842 remarkably up-regulated genes and 1, 657 or 669 remarkably down-regulated genes, respectively. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichments revealed that numerous DEGs belong to immune-relevant genes, involved in many immune-relevant pathways. Most of the strongly up-regulated DEGs are innate defense molecules, such as antimicrobial peptides, complement components, lectins, and transferrins. Trivalent <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine</b> affected the expressions of many components associated with bacterial ligand-depending Toll-like receptor signaling pathways and inflammasome formation, indicating that multiple innate immune processes were activated at the early period of vaccination in large yellow croaker. Moreover, the expression levels of genes involved in antigen processing were also up-regulated by <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine.</b> However, the expression levels of several T cell receptors and related CD molecules and signal transducers were down-regulated, suggesting that the T cell receptor signaling pathway was rapidly suppressed after vaccination. These results provide the comprehensive insights into the early immune response of large yellow croaker to vaccination and valuable information for developing a highly immunogenic <b>vaccine</b> against <b>bacterial</b> infection in teleosts...|$|R

In this study, a caspase- 3 homologue was cloned and characterized from large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea). The full-length cDNA of large yellow croaker caspase- 3 (Lyccasp 3) is 2222 bp with an open reading frame of 858 bp encoding a polypeptide of 285 amino acids (aa). Lyccasp 3 exhibited a conserved caspase- 3 architecture including a prodomain, a large subunit and a small subunit. Moreover, several residues known to be critical in the caspase- 3 catalytic centre and binding pocket, as well as the active-site pentapeptide motif Q(172) ACRG(176) were present in the deduced Lyccasp 3. Recombinant Lyccasp 3 (rLyccasp 3) produced in Escherichia coli exhibited obvious hydrolyzing activity against synthetic peptide substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA. The Lyccasp 3 was constitutively expressed in all the tissues examined, although the expression levels varied from tissue to tissue. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that Lyccasp 3 transcript in spleen and kidney was quickly increased after stimulation with either poly (I:C) or inactivated trivalent <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Enzyme activities of Lyccasp 3 were also up-regulated in these two tissues post-stimulation when analyzed by hydrolyzing activity assay. Since the activity of large yellow croaker caspase- 9 (Lyccasp 9) in the spleen and kidney also increased when the fish was stimulated with the poly(I:C) or <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine</b> [1], we therefore proposed that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is initiated by caspase- 9 and executed by caspase- 3, was activated during the immune response induced by poly(I:C) or <b>bacterial</b> <b>vaccine</b> in large yellow croaker.
