40|$|Data are a {{vital part}} of the {{scientific}} process, but all too often they languish at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>cupboards</b> or on servers, without any documentation, or any credit given to the researcher who created and/or manages them. Now, more than ever, data is of interest not only to researchers, but also to the funders and members of the general public, and there is greater pressure on institutions and researchers to make their data available for further reuse. Journals and data repositories are providing new platforms for researchers to make their data available, and also to ensure that the data authors and managers get the credit they deserve for creating, maintaining and sharing their data. This talk will discuss advances in data citation and publication and is suitable for anyone who works with data...|$|R

His wearing of the suit with the vest has been explained by the show's creator, Bruno Heller, as follows: [...] "The thinking is these were the suits he used to wear as a mentalist {{and he would have}} them dry cleaned and pressed. Now he gets them out <b>of</b> the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard.</b> It's also a magician thing. They wear vests because they {{need to be able to}} hide things.|$|R
60|$|Peg trotted to the door, {{and after}} fumbling at the bolt, crept {{to the other}} end of the room, and from beneath the coals which filled the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard,</b> drew forth a small deal box. Having placed this on the floor at Squeers's feet, she brought, from under the pillow of her bed, a small key, with which she signed to that gentleman to open it. Mr Squeers, who had eagerly {{followed}} her every motion, lost no time in obeying this hint: and, throwing back the lid, gazed with rapture on the documents which lay within.|$|R
30|$|If you {{are giving}} a direction, in English, {{to someone who}} is {{fetching}} some item for you from its place, you are likely to say (for example) that it is in the left-hand corner <b>of</b> the <b>bottom</b> drawer <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> next to the window in the bedroom {{at the back of the}} upstairs floor. In Mandarin you would start at the other end (and probably omit the locative expressions ‘in, at, on’).|$|R
5000|$|George Grove and Arthur Sullivan rediscovered the {{original}} manuscript {{parts of the}} music when they visited Vienna in 1867 specifically to research Schubert. Grove wrote: [...] "I found, at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard,</b> and in its farthest corner, a bundle of music-books two feet high, carefully tied round, and black with the undisturbed dust of nearly half-a-century. … These were the part-books of {{the whole of the}} music in Rosamunde, tied up after the second performance in December, 1823, and probably never disturbed since. Dr. Schneider curator must have been amused at our excitement; but let us hope that he recollected his own days of rapture; at any rate, he kindly overlooked it, and gave us permission to take away with us and copy what we wanted." ...|$|R

2500|$|Among the composers whom Grove {{sought to}} popularise was Schubert, whose music was largely {{neglected}} in England. Grove and Manns presented the first performance in England of the Great C major Symphony. Together {{with his friend}} Arthur Sullivan, Grove went to Vienna in 1867 in search of Schubert manuscripts. They found and copied several, and were particularly excited about their final discovery, which Grove described thus: [...] "I found, at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard,</b> and in its farthest corner, a bundle of music-books two feet high, carefully tied round, and black with the undisturbed dust of nearly half-a-century. … These were the part-books of {{the whole of the}} music in Rosamunde, tied up after the second performance in December, 1823, and probably never disturbed since.

60|$|The most {{extraordinary}} attic I ever came across was one {{a friend and}} I once shared many years ago. Of all eccentrically planned things, from Bradshaw to the maze at Hampton Court, that room was the most eccentric. The architect who designed {{it must have been}} a genius, though I cannot help thinking that his talents would have been better employed in contriving puzzles than in shaping human habitations. No figure in Euclid could give any idea of that apartment. It contained seven corners, two of the walls sloped to a point, and the window was just over the fireplace. The only possible position for the bedstead was between the door and the cupboard. To get anything out <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard</b> we had to scramble over the bed, and a large percentage of the various commodities thus obtained was absorbed by the bedclothes. Indeed, so many things were spilled and dropped upon the bed that toward night-time it had become a sort of small cooperative store. Coal was what it always had most in stock. We used to keep our coal in the <b>bottom</b> part <b>of</b> the <b>cupboard,</b> and when any was wanted we had to climb over the bed, fill a shovelful, and then crawl back. It was an exciting moment when we reached the middle of the bed. We would hold our breath, fix our eyes upon the shovel, and poise ourselves for the last move. The next instant we, and the coals, and the shovel, and the bed would be all mixed up together.|$|R
