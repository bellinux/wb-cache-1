40|$|An {{investigation}} is conducted into portable Braille devices {{which would allow}} visually impaired individuals to read electronic documents. Consumer research conducted on <b>the</b> existing Braille <b>devices</b> has identified <b>the</b> need for a portable and flexible E-books reader. This poster describes the design and development of an electronic device that will enable reading of any electronic text document through a single Braille cell. Braille books tend to be bulky in size due to the minimum size requirements for each Braille cell. Ebooks can be read in Braille using refreshable Braille displays connected to a computer. However, the refreshable Braille displays are expensive, bulky and are not portable. These factors restrict {{blind and visually impaired}} individuals from accessing much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature which isn’t available in Braille.

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{compared}} two distinct approaches to designing driving assistance devices. These devices aim to facilitate steering responses by delivering directional pulses {{on the steering}} wheel when lane departure is imminent.

The other approach consists of eliciting a compensatory reflex reaction by means of a jerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel in the opposite direction. Central to this investigation are <b>the</b> safety <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> and <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> drivers to remain in full control of their steering responses. <b>The</b> steering behaviour <b>of</b> 18 participants during near lane departure in bends and in straight lines was analysed. The strength and direction of haptic cueing was manip- ulated. The results show that drivers were always able to control <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steer- ing response when the haptic cue was delivered. No reflex counteraction was observed, whatever the strength or <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stimulus. The fastest responses were observed when the cue was directed toward lane departure, especially when cueing was strong. However, these did not necessarily lead to the fastest returns to a safe position in the lane when compared with motor priming toward the lane centre.

These results are discussed in relation to the sensorimotor and cognitive processes involved in steering behaviour.

40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) currently requires {{long-term treatment}} with disease-modifying drugs, administered parenterally up to once daily. The need for regular self-injection {{can be a}} barrier to treatment for many patients. Autoinjectors can help patients overcome problems or concerns with self-injection and could, therefore, improve treatment adherence. This study was performed to assess <b>the</b> suitability <b>of</b> a new electronic <b>device</b> for <b>the</b> subcutaneous (sc) administration of interferon (IFN) beta- 1 a, 44 mcg three times weekly, for relapsing MS. Methods In this Phase IIIb, multicentre, single-arm study, patients with relapsing MS who had been consistently self-injecting sc IFN beta- 1 a using an autoinjector for at least 6 weeks were taught to use <b>the</b> new <b>device</b> and self-administered treatment for 12 weeks thereafter. Patient-rated suitability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> was assessed at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Week 12 using the Patient User Trial Questionnaire. Patient satisfaction with, and evaluation <b>of,</b> <b>the</b> injection process was assessed using the MS Treatment Concern Questionnaire. Trainers evaluated <b>the</b> <b>device</b> using <b>the</b> Trainer User Trial Questionnaire. Results At Week 12, 71. 6 % (73 / 102) <b>of</b> patients considered <b>the</b> <b>device</b> 'very suitable' or 'suitable' for self-injection; 92. 2 % (94 / 102) reported some degree of suitability and only 7. 8 % (8 / 102) found <b>the</b> <b>device</b> 'not at all suitable'. At Weeks  4, 8 and 12, most patients reported that injection preparation and clean-up, performing injections and ease <b>of</b> <b>device</b> use in <b>the</b> previous 4 weeks compared favourably with, or was equivalent to, their previous experience of self-injection. Injection-related pain, injection reactions and 'flu-like' symptoms remained stable over the 12 weeks. Each device feature was rated 'very useful' or 'useful' by at least 80 % of patients. All trainers and 95. 2 % (99 / 104) of patients found device functions 'very easy' or 'easy' to use.

40|$|Carbon credits are an {{increasingly}} prevalent market-based mechanism used to subsidize household water treatment technologies (HWT). This involves generating credits through {{the reduction of}} carbon emissions from boiling water by providing a technology that reduces greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change. Proponents claim this process delivers health and environmental benefits by providing clean drinking water and reducing greenhouse gases. Selling carbon credits associated with HWT projects requires rigorous monitoring to ensure households are using the HWT and achieving the desired <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> Critics {{have suggested that the}} technologies provide neither the benefits of clean water nor reduced emissions. This study explores the perspectives of carbon credit and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) experts on HWT carbon credit projects. Thirteen semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants from the WASH and carbon credit development sectors. The interviews explored perceptions of the two groups with respect to the procedures applied in the Gold Standard methodology for trading Voluntary Emission Reduction (VER) credits. Agreement among the WASH and carbon credit experts existed for the concept of suppressed demand and parameters in the baseline water boiling test. Key differences, however, existed. WASH experts' responses highlighted a focus on objectively verifiable data for monitoring carbon projects while carbon credit experts called for contextualizing observed data with the need for flexibility and balancing financial viability with quality assurance. Carbon credit projects have the potential to become an important financing mechanism for clean energy in low- and middle-income countries. Based on this research we recommend that more effort be placed on building consensus on the underlying assumptions for obtaining carbon credits from HWT projects, as well as the approved methods for monitoring correct and consistent use of the HWT technologies in order to support public health impacts...|$|E
40|$|O implante coclear (IC) tem sido indicado para crianças deficientes auditivas de grau severo e/ou profundo que não tem benefício com o aparelho de amplificação sonora {{individual}} (AASI), e que apresentem família adequada e motivada para o uso do dispositivo, bem como condições adequadas de reabilitação na cidade de origem. Atualmente, a procura pelo IC também ocorre por pais surdos, fluentes na Língua Brasileira de Sinais (LIBRAS), que recorrem a este tratamento para oferecer outra realidade para seus filhos. O ambiente destas crianças é bilíngue, dado pela LIBRAS dos pais e pela linguagem oral dos familiares próximos, do fonoaudiólogo e da escola. Neste sentido, o presente estudo visou acompanhar quatro crianças deficientes auditivas implantadas, sendo duas crianças filhas de pais deficientes auditivos fluentes na LIBRAS (expostas a ambiente bilíngue) e duas crianças filhas de pais sem alterações auditivas (expostas a ambiente oral). Para tanto, as habilidades de audição e de aquisição da linguagem oral foram comparadas nas quatro crianças implantadas. Foi possível observar que as quatro crianças apresentaram habilidades auditivas e de linguagem semelhantes ao longo do primeiro ano de uso do IC. Contudo, a partir disto, as crianças inseridas em ambiente bilíngue apresentaram melhor desempenho auditivo e linguístico, comparado ao desenvolvimento das outras crianças. As crianças inseridas em ambiente bilíngue podem se beneficiar do IC, desenvolvendo habilidades auditivas e de linguagem similares às das crianças inseridas em ambiente oral. Ressalta-se que os benefícios do dispositivo são obtidos a partir de aspectos multifatoriais, e estudos mais aprofundados são necessários. The {{cochlear implant}} (CI) has been indicated {{for children with}} severe and/or profound bilateral hearing loss who do not benefit from hearing aids and have adequate and motivated family {{for the use of}} the device, as well as adequate rehabilitation conditions at their hometowns. Currently, the demand for CI also occurs by deaf parents, fluent in Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS), who resort to this treatment to offer their children another reality. The environment of these children is bilingual, with exposition to LIBRAS through their parents and to oral language through close relatives, audiologist/speech-language pathologist, and the school. In this sense, the present study aimed to follow-up four implanted deaf children - two with deaf parents fluent in LIBRAS (exposed to a bilingual environment), and two with hearing parents (exposed to oral environment). For this purpose, abilities of hearing and oral language development were compared in these children with CI. It was observed that all four children in this study presented similar language development and auditory skills throughout the first year of CI use. However, after this period, children inserted into a bilingual environment had better auditory and linguistic performance when compared to the other children. Children in bilingual environments can benefit from the CI, developing auditory skills and oral language similarly to children inserted into an oral environment. It is emphasized that the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is dependent on several factors, and further studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|Haptic {{technologies}} provide physical sensations in {{the interaction}} with a computing system, by exploiting <b>the</b> human sense <b>of</b> touch and by applying forces, vibrations, or motions {{to the user}} hands or body. Considering their features, {{they can be a}} useful tool in life-science teaching, especially when molecules are involved. For this purpose, a framework composed of an haptic device and a visual interface for molecular exploration has been developed to simulate molecular and intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, this work evaluates the visual and haptic tool for molecular exploration in a didactic context, performing tests and interviews with students. The final aim is to properly develop <b>the</b> features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tool, {{in order to make it}} suitable for the introduction in chemistry education. Preliminary results show positive and effective responses and learning gains from the tasks. It has also been noticed that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> such an innovative instrument raises <b>the</b> interest <b>of</b> students in <b>the</b> learning process, which is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> haptic <b>device...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>The</b> {{operative}} potential <b>of</b> hand-assisted {{laparoscopic surgery}} (HALS) could {{be enhanced by}} <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> {{a new generation of}} assisting instruments. These tools will have to meet specific requirements of shape, function, and safety of use. Methods: Problems related to <b>the</b> working environment <b>of</b> HALS and deriving projectual restrictions of HALS instruments were analyzed in order to develop and manufacture a working prototype with grasping and dissecting properties to assist during HALS procedures. The resulting instrument was mechanically and clinically tested in 22 HALS procedures. Results: <b>The</b> additional <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>device</b> was particularly appreciated during dissection and isolation of vascular pedicles (nephrectomies and splenectomies). It was shown to be safe and effective in providing the additional assistance it was designed for. Conclusion: The described grasping and dissecting instrument for HALS is of great value in assisting the surgeon during fine dissection, as required in selected procedures. New generation of HALS instruments should comply with the functional and safety issues analyzed in this report...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{morphing}} <b>devices</b> developed in <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> SARISTU, integration in an overall aircraft model is required. For this purpose, the relevant input data regarding the adaptive leading-edge, trailing-edge and winglet devices are gathered with specific focus on weight and aerodynamic performance. Different levels of detail are applied. For weight and actuation power, the methods range from geometry (e. g. span and chord) -dependent methods to absolute delta values which are for instance subtracted from components weights as wing structure weight. Methods for aerodynamic data reach from subtractions of absolute values from the lift to drag ratio, constant for the flight phases (i. e. climb, cruise, decent), towards changes to the induced drag polars specific for each mission increment and dependent on the explicit lift coefficient. For an objective assessment, several aircraft models are compared. The assessment and comparison of these aircraft AC models take place on standard overall aircraft-level parameters as block fuel or maximum take-off weight...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{implantology}} is <b>the</b> branch <b>of</b> dentistry {{focused on}} <b>the</b> reconstruction <b>of</b> missing teeth and their supporting structures with natural or synthetic substitutes. Conventional instruments used during oral implantation exhibit severe operational limitations, especially in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> limited surgical access, anatomically delicate bone structures, and proximity to soft tissues, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high risk <b>of</b> injury.
