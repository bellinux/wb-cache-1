50|$|The {{village is}} bordered by the Hudson River to the west, and is {{bound by the}} Hudson Highlands State Park to the north, where Mount Taurus and Breakneck Ridge rise steeply and {{dramatically}} out of {{the banks of the}} Hudson and form two <b>basically</b> <b>parallel</b> ridges that track each other inland. The valley between them has an abandoned dairy farm, two lakes, and a camp. The view from the river bank is the Constitution Marsh and the US Military Academy (West Point) slightly to the south, and Crow's Nest and Storm King Mountain to the west and northwest. All of this considered, the village is nestled in the most prominent vertical terrain on the Hudson River north of New York City prior to the Shawangunk and Catskill ranges. Being bound by these formidable terrain features has kept the size of the village small, and prevented the suburban sprawl that has come about in the less-constrained regions to the north and south and in the New York Metropolitan area generally. This unique sense of place, and the village's historic housing stock, have made it a very popular weekend destination for tourists from New York City. Its oldest current home is located on 191 Main Street and was built in 1814. Some say Abraham Lincoln visited that house when he visited Cold Spring.|$|E

40|$|Patterns of {{polarized}} light {{present in the}} clear dusk sky provide directional information relevant to the orientation behaviour of migratory birds. Experiments performed with white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) and American tree sparrows (Spizella arborea), North American night migrants, examined migratory orientation between the time of sunset and the first appearance of stars under several manipulations of skylight polarization patterns. Under clear skies, birds tested in Emlen funnel orientation cages oriented their hopping <b>basically</b> <b>parallel</b> to the E-vector of {{polarized light}}, with a bias towards the brightest {{part of the sky}} (sunset direction). Under solid, thick overcast conditions (no polarized light from the natural sky), birds showed axially bimodal hopping orientation parallel to an imposed E-vector. When birds were tested in cages covered with depolarizing material under a clear sky, their hopping orientation was seasonally appropriate and indistinguishable from controls viewing an unaltered clear sky. Skylight polarization patterns are not necessary for the occurrence of migratory orientation, but birds respond strongly to manipulations of the E-vector direction. The results reported here support the hypothesis that the relevant stimulus is the E-vector orientation rather than other parameters of skylight, e. g. intensity or colour patterns, degree of polarization. It appears that these night migrants are using skylight polarization at dusk as one of a set of multiple compass capabilities. Because of the necessarily artificial nature of the polarized light stimuli used in the experimental manipulations, it has not been possible to establish the relationship between this orientation cue and other known mechanisms (magnetic, sun and star compasses) ...|$|E

Currently, to create the model of EA-KM-induced cochlear lesion in rats, adult rats received a single injection of EA (75 mg/kg, intravenous injection), or followed immediately by KM (500 mg/kg, intramuscular injection). The hearing function was assessed by auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement in response to click and/or tone bursts at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 32 kHz. The static microcirculation status in the stria vascularis after a single EA injection was evaluated with eosin staining. The pathological changes in cochlear and vestibular hair cells were also quantified after co-administration of EA and KM. After a single EA injection, blood flow in vessels supplying the stria vascularis rapidly diminished. However, the blood supply to the cochlear lateral wall partially recovered 5 h after EA treatment. Threshold changes in ABR were <b>basically</b> <b>parallel</b> to the microcirculation changes in stria vascularis after single EA treatment. Importantly, disposable co-administration of EA and KM resulted in a permanent hearing loss and severe damage to the cochlear hair cells, but spared the vestibular hair cells. Since the cochlear lateral wall is the important part of the blood-cochlea barrier, EA-induced anoxic damage to the epithelium of stria vascularis may enhance the entry of KM to the cochlea. Thus, experimental animal model of selective cochlear damage with normal vestibular systems can be reliably created through co-administration of EA and KM...|$|E

The {{study was conducted}} within one large complex consisting of pine, mixed pine-hornbeam and typical old oak-linden-hornbeam forests in northern Poland. Epiphytic lichens were recorded in 50 study plots randomly selected within 5 forest stand classes of a different structure and age, ranging from 80 to over 220 years. Altogether 143 lichen species were recorded, of which only 41 were entirely nonspecific, and were occurring in all the studied forest stand classes. Significant differences in lichen species richness between stand classes were found {{and the number of}} species increases with the forest age. Lichen species composition also differs and its changes progress towards restoration of lichen biota typical for deciduous forest consistent with the habitat. The age of the forest has the most significant effect on the biodiversity of lichen biota. Microhabitat space provided by oaks is highly desirable since it greatly enriches lichen biota in forests. Phorophyte specificity of particular lichens were assessed. Hornbeam and oak have the greatest number of species mostly confined to them and constitute a main refuge for lichens with a high conservation value. The changes of lichen biota are <b>basically</b> <b>parallel</b> with the changes of the forest stand structure.

40|$|Bibliography: pages [104]- 110. The sulfur isotope age curve for the Phanerozoic ocean {{has been}} well {{established}} by studies of evaporite deposits, {{but only a few}} Precambrian evaporites persist. In this study, concentrations of sulfate in rocks, sulfur and oxygen isotope composition of sulfate, and oxygen isotope composition of chert and carbonates have been obtained world wide from samples ranging in age from 600 Ma to 3500 Ma. The original sulfur isotope composition of sulfate can be preserved in quartz and chert pseudomorphs after sulfate. Studies of remnant sulfate inclusions in chert and quartz nodules derived through dissolution of evaporites in Phanerozoic carbonate units reinforce this conclusion. In many cases, there are obvious differences in the oxygen isotope data between primary and secondary sulfates. Therefore, oxygen isotope composition of sulfate may be a good discriminator between primary and secondary sulfate sources. The sulfur data of this study show that the sulfur isotope age curve was close to 0 %₀ (CDT standard) before 3. 0 Ga, and somewhat before 2. 0 Ga the range of variation of sulfur isotopes in sulfate appears to have increased to close to 15 %₀. This change has been controlled mainly by marine hydrothermal reactions in mid-ocean ridges and bacterial sulfate reduction. The later shift (within the range 10 to 30 %₀) observed for Phanerozoic evaporites may result mainly from bacterial reduction of marine sulfate. Samples of presumably marine sulfate preserved in early Archean rocks are unusually depleted in ¹⁸O compared to Phanerozoic marine sulfate. The δ¹⁸O range of variation for the Precambrian is about 4 - 18 %₀. The similarity between δ¹⁸O variations of marine sulfate and chert may be explained by later metamorphism. However, the δ¹⁸O of Precambrian marine sulfate may have been dominated more by contemporaneous circulation of seawater through hot basalt along ocean ridges. Examination of δ¹⁸O for sixty-four of the Precambrian chert samples show that they formed under warm water conditions and most likely involved contributions of meteoric water, possibly in a sabkha environment. These data <b>basically</b> <b>parallel</b> the curves from previous studies of δ¹⁸O of chert formed in a pure marine environment. Thus differences in chert formation temperature and oxygen isotope composition of diagenetic solutions between deep marine and coastal facies may be essentially similar for Precambrian and Phanerozoic samples. Five samples of microfossiliferous chert have δ¹⁸O values consistent with δ¹⁸O values of pure marine original chert samples from previous studies. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|First-passage probabilities are {{investigated}} for {{the absolute value}} of the zero-start response of simple oscillators excited by stationary white noise with a normal probability distribution. Both small-time (non-stationary) and large-time (stationary) behavior are included, but more emphasis {{is given to the}} latter. The oscillator responses studied included the linear SDF system, linear 2 DF systems, and yielding SDF systems. The basic purposes of this study are, for each oscillator, to investigate the behavior of the first-passage probability by use of Monte Carlo simulation data and theoretical approaches, and to seek empirical formulas which approximate the results adequately for design purposes. Simple procedures are presented for the linear SDF system which allow approximate prediction of the probability of first-passage for both long-time and short-time situations. This includes both the zero-start situation and the stationary-start situation. For a linear 2 DF system with nearly equal modal frequencies, an equivalent SDF model is developed by consideration of response correlation coefficients. The model is shown to agree with the 2 DF first-passage behavior when modal frequencies differ by less than 20 percent. A diffusion model is developed to approximate the first-passage probability of linear 2 DF systems. The procedure is <b>basically</b> <b>parallel</b> to the ideas of Roberts for SDF response. The approximate formulation uses the amplitudes of two response modes as components of a Markov vector to establish a two-dimensional diffusion model. Within any short-time increment the two amplitudes are assumed to evolve independently of each other. The model is simplified to a one-dimensional diffusion when the second frequency is very large. Based on simulation and diffusion results, relatively simple empirical formulas are presented to approximate the long-time first-passage probabilities for 2 DF systems. The yielding SDF system studied is the bilinear hysteretic oscillator which has previously been approximated by third-order linear systems and two-mode linear systems in studies of power spectral density and mean-squared response. Here the first-passage statistics of the yielding system are compared with results for the "equivalent" two-mode and third-order linear models. Diffusion results for the two-mode linear system are feasible only when both modes are under-damped, and this excludes approximation of several yielding situations. Diffusion results for the third-order linear model seem to better fit the existing simulation data for the yielding system than do the results for two-mode models...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{structure}} of reflexive sheaves over projective spaces through hyperplane sections. We give a criterion for a reflexive sheaf to split into a direct sum of line bundles. An application to the theory of free hyperplane arrangements is also given. 0 Main Theorem Vector bundles over the projective space Pn K are one of the main subjects in both (algebraic) geometry and commutative algebra. The most fundamental result in this area is the theorem due to Grothendieck which asserts that any holomorphic vector bundle over P 1 K splits into a direct sum of line bundles. When n ≥ 2, vector bundles over Pn K do not necessarily split. Indeed, the tangent bundle is indecomposable. In these cases, some sufficient conditions for vector bundles to split have been established. The following is one of such criterions, which we call “Restriction criterion”. Theorem 0. 1 (Horrocks) Let K be an algebraically closed field, n be an integer greater than or equal to 3, and let E be a locally free sheaf on Pn K of rank r (≥ 1). Then E splits into a direct sum of line bundles if and only if there exists a hyperplane H ⊂ Pn K such that E|H splits into a direct sum of line bundles. In other words, the splitting of a vector bundle can be characterized by using a hyperplane section. However, vector bundles, or equivalently locally free sheaves, form a small class among all coherent sheaves. There are some important wider classes of coherent sheaves, e. g., reflexive sheaves or torsion free sheaves. The {{purpose of this}} article is to generalize the “Restriction criterion ” to one for reflexive sheaves, and we also show that it fails in the class of torsion free sheaves. Our main theorem is as follows. 1 Theorem 0. 2 Let K be an algebraically closed field, n be an integer greater than or equal to 3, and let E be a reflexive sheaf on Pn K of rank r (≥ 1). Then E splits into a direct sum of line bundles if and only if there exists a hyperplane H ⊂ Pn K such that E|H splits into a direct sum of line bundles. We give two proofs for Theorem 0. 2.

40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} gravity field allows {{an insight into}} the {{structure}} and dynamics of the earth. It provides the geoid {{as the most important}} physical reference surface in geodesy and oceanography. Since 2000, the CHAMP (CHAllenging Mini-satellite Payload) mission detects the structure of the global gravity field, followed by the launch of GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) in 2002. In 2008, finally, the GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) satellite is supposed to be set in orbit. These missions demonstrate satellite-based gravity field recovery to {{be at the center of}} geo-scientific interest. Interpretation and evaluation of satellite observations are difficult, especially the determination of the unknown gravity field parameters from a huge amount of measurements. Because of the immense demand for memory and computing time, the occurring systems of equations pose a real numerical challenge. Therefore, High-Performance Computing (HPC) is commonly adopted to overcome computational problems. <b>Basically,</b> <b>parallel</b> programming with MPI and OpenMP routines allows to speed up the solution process considerably. In this thesis, firstly global gravity field modelling by means of satellite observations is reviewed. Secondly, the LSQR method (Least-Squares using QR factorization) is introduced in detail in order to solve the resulting least-squares problems. Because the LSQR method is an iterative solver, it basically can not provide the variance-covariance information of the parameter estimate. To investigate the approximate computation of the variance-covariance matrix, two methods are introduced. The first one is based on the generalized inverse of the design matrix. The second approach applies Monte-Carlo integration techniques. Because parallel programming is very helpful to implement such iterative methods, it is necessary to introduce some basic principles and concepts about HPC.

Seit 2000 erfasst die CHAMP (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload) Mission die Struktur des globalen Schwerefeldes, gefolgt vom Start der GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) Mission im Jahr 2002. Im Jahr 2008 ist der Start des GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) Satelliten vorgesehen. Diese Missionen zeigen, dass die satellitengestützte Schwerefeldbestimmung im Zentrum des geowissenschaftlichen Interesses liegt. Die Interpretation und Auswertung von Satellitenbeobachtungen sind schwierig, vor allem die Bestimmung der unbekannten Parameter des Schwerefeldes aus einer großen Anzahl von Messungen. Aufgrund der immensen Nachfrage nach Speicher und Rechenzeit, stellen die auftretenden Gleichungssysteme eine große numerische Herausforderung dar. Zur Behebung der rechentechnischen Schwierigkeiten kommt deshalb üblicherweise High Performance Computing (HPC) zum Einsatz. Grundsätzlich kann die parallele Programmierung mit MPI und OpenMP den Lösungsprozess deutlich beschleunigen. In dieser Arbeit wird zunächst ein kurzer überblick über die satellitengestützte Schwerefeldbestimmung gegeben. Danach wird die LSQR Methode ausführlich eingeführt um die resultierenden least-squares Probleme zu lösen. Da die LSQR Methode ein iterativer Löser ist, kann das Verfahren die Varianz-Kovarianz Informationen der Parameterschätzung grundsätzlich nicht liefern. Um die approximierte Berechnung der Varianz-Kovarianz Matrix zu untersuchen, werden zwei Methoden eingeführt. Die erste basiert auf der generalisierten Inverse des Designmatrix. Der zweite Ansatz gründet auf Monte-Carlo Integration. Da parallele Programmierung zweckdienlich bei der Umsetzung solcher iterativen Methoden ist, ist es notwendig, einige grundlegende Prinzipien und Konzepte zum Thema HPC einzuführen...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a Quadrature Mirror Filter is {{implemented}} in VHDL, for wireless communication applications. The Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) <b>basically</b> is a <b>parallel</b> {{combination of a}} High Pass Filter (HPF) and Low Pass Filter (LPF), which performs the action of frequency subdivision by splitting the signal spectrum into two spectra. The QMF implementation is carried out on FPGA platform. The Xilinx IP Core generator {{will be used for}} instantiating the standard Xilinx parts. Xilinx ISE will be used to carry out the synthesis and bit file generation. The obtained Synthesis Report for implemented QMF will be used to analyze the occupied area and power dissipation. The study and implementation will be aimed to realize the equalizer for wireless communication system. Modelsim Xilinx Edition (MXE) will be used for simulation and functional verification. Xilinx ISE will be used for synthesis and bit file generation. The Xilinx Chip scope will be used to test the results on Spartan 3 E 500 K FPGA board...|$|R
40|$|A {{hydrogen}} recombiner has a recombination tank (1) whose main axis (2) is <b>basically</b> aligned in <b>parallel</b> with {{the effect of}} gravity; the recombination tank features inlet valves (12), outlet valves (17) and catalyst surfaces (9) of a non-restrictive catalyst aligned in parallel with the main axis (2). The inlet valves (12) and the outlet valves (17) can be closed by a hydrogen detector arranged in {{the proximity of the}} inlet aperture (11). An electronic window circuit generates control signals for at least one closing motor for the inlet valves (12) and the outlet valves (17). The closing motor performs infinitely variable adjustment of the aperture width of the inlet valve (12) and the outlet valve (17). The lower limit of the window circuit is in the order of a few tenths of hydrogen concentration in air, and the upper limit is in the range of three to four per cent of the hydrogen concentration. At a hydrogen concentration outside the predefined window of the window circuit, a closing signal is generated for the valves (12, 17) ...|$|R
