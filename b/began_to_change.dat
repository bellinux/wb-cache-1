5|$|The {{economic}} focus <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> as {{the country}} sank into the worst recession since the Great Depression four decades earlier. The focus of the Ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment, which reached nine percent in May 1975.|$|E

5|$|After his divorce, Vainio's life slowly <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Creatively he {{was more}} {{prolific}} than ever in the late 1970s and 1980s. He began composing in addition to writing lyrics. He worked a lot with Veikko Samuli and Jaakko Salo, and Salo started arranging songs Vainio had written.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Beth Elohim allowed {{women to}} become full members, {{granting}} them full voting privileges and {{allowing them to}} hold office. The congregation subsequently elected Jeanette Marks as a trustee. At this time {{the origins of the}} membership <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> as Jews of Eastern European descent started joining the congregation.|$|E
5|$|After these events, Ueshiba {{seemed to}} slowly grow away from Takeda, and he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> his art. These changes are {{reflected}} in the differing names with which he referred to his system, first as aiki-jūjutsu, then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and aiki budō. In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally {{came to be known as}} aikido.|$|E

5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> however, particularly after de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.|$|E
5|$|Nor, {{unlike their}} European counterparts, did American generals and admirals have {{influence}} on or involvement in foreign policy; but mainly {{because in the}} frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, there was no requirement to do so. This <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> after the Spanish-American War, when American military forces started to be deployed overseas in the Pacific, Asia and the Caribbean for extended periods of time.|$|E
5|$|Swimwear and {{underwear}} have similar design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.|$|E

Seattle had an August record of 16–13 (.552), while California had an August record of 13–17 (.433). Seattle took second place on September 2, with Texas in a losing streak it would never recover from.|$|E
5|$|When the bebop {{movement}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> jazz in the 1940s, Manne {{loved it}} and {{adapted to the}} style rapidly, performing with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker.

5|$|After {{years of}} decline with {{abandoned}} buildings and high elderly populations, {{the demographics of}} Old Louisville <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> noticeably in the 1990s. New residents were not just college students using the area as housing, but also young professionals who {{wanted to live in}} Old Louisville. The Courier-Journal's Velocity weekly has reported the area as a hip, emerging center of culture in Louisville. This change is reflected in numerous coffeehouses, restaurants and bars opening in Old Louisville in the 1990s and early 2000s targeting at the younger crowd.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious progress was made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E
5|$|As {{publishing}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> {{its form}} in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses pushed out small, independent booksellers. Johnson {{did not attempt to}} form or join one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, particularly as his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began to take over the daily operations; Miles was uninterested in the business, and Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, and in {{some cases}} as late as the 1940s, historians largely took ancient {{literary}} sources at face value as evidence for the lives of women in the ancient world. In the middle of the 20th century this <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France, as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups. Robert Flacelière was an influential early author on women in Greece. Around the same time, feminist philosophy, such as Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex also examined the lives of women in the classical world.|$|E

60|$|Derek {{smiled a}} ghastly smile. This was not wholly due to mental disturbance.

A sub-motive of sharp pain had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> run through it, flashing in and out like lightning through a thunder-cloud. He felt sullen and vicious.|$|R

Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> in the mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E
5|$|Hiller {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} heating and burning on bone mineral using X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The bone samples were heated in temperature of 500, 700, and 900 C° for 15 and 45 min. The results show bone crystals <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> during the first 15 min of heating at 500 C0 and above. At higher temperatures, thickness and shape of crystals of bones appear stabilized, but when the samples were heated at lower temperature or for shorter period, XRD traces showed extreme changes in crystal parameters.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> this balance. New Krupp steel armour {{meant that}} it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies {{in the event of}} war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E
