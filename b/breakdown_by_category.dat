40|$|The Homelessness Research Institute, the {{research}} and communications arm of the Alliance, released {{the first in a}} series of briefs analyzing the geography of homelessness. This first brief looks at the extent to which homelessness exists in urban or rural areas. The administrative geography units that collect data on homelessness, Continua of Care (CoCs), were analyzed and classified into one of five categories on a spectrum ranging from completely rural to completely urban. The brief includes a <b>breakdown</b> of CoCs <b>by</b> <b>category,</b> as well as information on the extent to which homelessness exists in each category nationally. The brief also includes a link to an interactive map with information on homelessness by geographic type across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Next month, the Alliance will release Part II of the series, which will examine the differences in rates of homelessness by geography type...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} an econometric {{model of the}} world cobalt industry, relatively disaggregated to incorporate different demand equations for the United States, and rest of the non-communist world, {{as well as a}} breakdown into types of cobalt used. Largely due to reasons of data availability, the model is an annual one and the <b>breakdown</b> <b>by</b> end use <b>categories</b> has been restricted to the United States. Particular attention in the model construction has been given to price setting in the cobalt market. Existing evidence by Burrows (1971) and Charles River Associates (1976) suggests that Zaire sets the price so as to maximise its own profits. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate aggregate and disaggregate short run and long run elasticities with respect to price and activity variables, and to test whether the own profit maximization hypotheses is representative of current producer price setting behaviour when Zaire's share in total world mine production has fallen from nearly two thirds to less than half between 1972 and 1978. Finally, the model constructed is used to simulate the effect of marginal cost pricing by major producers and the movements in price resulting from an exogeneous increase in supply. The latter exercise was motivated by the possibility of a substantial long run source of supply of cobalt from seabed mining. ...|$|R

40|$|In the mid-nineties the OECD’s Centre for Educational Research and Innovation {{published}} {{a collection of}} data making comparisons {{in the field of}} special needs education in a few OECD countries. This work strengthened the view that a different comparative framework would need to be developed if reliable and valid comparisons were to be made. Subsequent discussions with participating member countries identified a resource based definition as the best means of facilitating international comparison. In fact this helps to overcome different national interpretations of concepts such as special educational needs which cover very different populations of students who are experiencing difficulties in accessing the curriculum. Concurrent work at UNESCO and OECD in revising standards for classifying education systems (ISCED) updated the definition of special needs education and reformulated it to reflect policy developments. In doing so, a much wider range of students, in all types of schools were brought into the frame. In addition, the idea that extra resourcing may be needed to assist schools to help students access the curriculum more effectively was included in the new description. In order for policy relevant comparisons to emerge, a resource based approach would require that the students included under this definition would need to be sub-divided into some form of straightforward classification scheme. Participating countries agreed on a tri-partite system in which students are divided into three cross-national categories, A, B and C. Broadly, they cover : students whose disabilities have clear biological origin (category A); students whose learning and behaviour difficulties are likely to have more of an acquired nature (category B); and students who have difficulties arising from disadvantages (category C). The book presents a complete account of the development of the work and an application of this model in practice, and provides qualitative data to contextualise the quantitative information. It provides <b>breakdowns</b> <b>by</b> national <b>category</b> systems as well as comparisons using the cross-national framework described...|$|R
