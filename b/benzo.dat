2500|$|These {{involved}} the fundamental ring systems and derivatives of 1,2-benzanthracene, the dibenzopyrenes, steranthrenes, anthanthrene, 1,2,3,4-dibenzanthracene, {{a variety of}} <b>benzo</b> and dibenzofluoranthenes. This was extended to large-molecular-size and [...] "hypercondensed" [...] hydrocarbons, ring opening and partial hydrogenation. During his study of dibenzopyrenes, he discovered a molecular arrangement involving the framework of aromatic hydrocarbons. His studies of the carcinogenic azulenophenalenes led him to question the role of aromaticity. Aside from his studies with aza-replaced hydrocarbons, benz- and dibenzacridines and –carbazoles, he also synthesised and tested {{a number of new}} structural types of heteroaromatics with reference to the nature, nuimber and position of the heteroatoms. These included the naphtho and <b>benzo</b> derivatives of pyridocarbazole and beta-carboline, heteroaromatics with sulfur, arsenic or selenium replacements. These were either alone or in association with nitrogen, as well as sulfur and nitrogen containing pseudoazulenes. A series of hydrocarbon-like polynuclear lactones were explored with the intent of establishing a connection between polynuclear aromatics and aflatoxins. Such studies of heteroatomic polynuclears led him to propose a [...] "newer picture" [...] of a carcinogenic hydrocarbon, helping the generalise the classical K-region hypothesis.|$|E

2500|$|Benzodiazepine {{withdrawal}} syndrome—often {{abbreviated to}} <b>benzo</b> withdrawal—is {{the cluster of}} symptoms that emerge when {{a person who has}} taken benzodiazepines, either medically or recreationally, and has developed a physical dependence undergoes dosage reduction or discontinuation. Development of physical dependence and/or addiction and the resulting withdrawal symptoms, some of which may last for years, may result from either drug-seeking behaviors or from taking the medication as prescribed. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and anxiety, panic attacks, hand tremor, sweating, difficulty with concentration, confusion and cognitive difficulty, memory problems, dry retching and nausea, weight loss, palpitations, headache, muscular pain and stiffness, a host of perceptual changes, hallucinations, seizures, psychosis, and suicide (see [...] "Signs and Symptoms" [...] section below for full list). [...] Further, these symptoms are notable for {{the manner in which they}} wax and wane and vary in severity from day to day or week by week instead of steadily decreasing in a straightforward monotonic manner.|$|E

40|$|Benzodiazepines (<b>Benzos)</b> and {{ketamine}} (K) are {{compounds that}} have been encountered in Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault (DFSA) cases. Due to the intimate nature of these crimes, evidence collection is often postponed due to delays and/or reluctance in reporting these crimes. Further delays in analysis may be encountered in laboratories with large caseloads and/or backlogs. Drug identification in biological samples is important to determine whether victims knowingly or unknowingly took an impairing substance, however, the results could be negative due to chemical degradation over a long storage period. The purpose of this project was to study if degradation could be prevented with a new preservation method {{at the time of}} collection. Urine samples were prepared by the addition of K and metabolites and selected <b>benzos</b> and metabolites that were subjected to different sample pre-treatment techniques, and were analyzed after storage at room temperature (25 °C), refrigerator (4 °C) and freezer (- 20 °). The samples were either pre-treated with preservative (0. 5 % toluene) or filtration sterilization (sterile filter kit) within two hours after sample collection, and a control group with no pre-treatment was incorporated into the study for comparison. The changes in concentrations over 50 days (<b>Benzos</b> group) and 210 days (K group) were evaluated between different pre-treated methods and different temperature conditions. Sample that were treated with 0. 5 % toluene showed the most degradation: 44 % of oxazepam and 96 % of diazepam degraded over 10 days, and 80 % of dehydronorketamine degraded after storage of 150 days regardless the temperature conditions. Clonazepam and flunitrazepam concentrations were reduced by 80 % of the original concentration when stored at room temperature for 10 days. The major benzodiazepines evaluated in this study were stable when stored in the freezer. In K group, ketamine and norketamine that were stored at room temperature and refrigerated over 210 days were stable, however, degradation was observed after 150 days when the samples were stored in the freezer. There was no statistically different change observed among the samples pre-treated with or without filtration sterilization. Each sample pH was measured and it was determined that those stored at room temperature had an average pH of 8. 5, while samples stored in the refrigerator and freezer had an average pH of 6. 7 and 6. 5, respectively. This finding revealed that pH could be the major factor affecting compound degradation rather than the bacterial contamination with high pH contributing to degradation, and low pH potentially preventing sample lost...|$|R
500|$|Slang {{terms for}} {{alprazolam}} vary {{from place to}} place. Some of the more common terms are shortened versions of the trade name [...] "Xanax", such as Xannies (or Xanies) and the phonetic equivalent of Zannies; references to their drug classes, such as <b>benzos</b> or downers; or remark upon their shape or color (most commonly a straight, perforated tablet or an oval-shaped pill): bars, ladders, Xanbars, Z-bars, footballs, planks, poles, blues, or blue footballs. While prices for a black market substance vary wildly in time and geography, this author's personal research of {{the past fifteen years}} throughout California bears out $2.00 prices for 1mg pills (often referred to as footballs or even more anecdotally, //ones//) and $4.00 for 2mg pills (often referred to as bars, spinners, and ladders). More recently (Summer, 2017) prices for 1mg and 2mg have risen to $3-$4 and $5-$8 respectively. This is an economic result of a prescription shortage created by an FDA crackdown on opioids that alprazolam was caught up in as well.|$|R
40|$|Stopping the use {{of certain}} tranquillisers in prisons and {{hospitals}} reduces the levels of violence and self-harm and helps raise health standards, according to the country’s leading forensic psychiatrist. Harry Kennedy, head of the Central Mental Hospital, said that since they stopped prescribing the medication in their prison clinics, the suicide rates there had fallen. He said in the CMH, the most violent patients in the State are now managed without BZDs, a group name for tranquillisers commonly known as <b>benzos.</b> Prof Kennedy’s statement comes as the Department of Health continues to draft laws to impose additional controls on BZDs and hypnotics known as Z-drugs. The measures are being brought in to deal with both legal over-prescribing of the drugs by GPs and psychiatrists, and the massive illicit sale of the drugs, fuelled by a booming online trade.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of benzodiazepines has been {{a cause for concern}} for many years by organisations within the drugs sector culminating in the establishment of the Benzodiazepine Committee and subsequent publication of the Good Practice Guidelines for Clinicians in 2002. Benzodiazepine refers {{to a wide range of}} drugs used as hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquillisers, anticonvulsants and sedation. Synonyms include sleeping tablets and tranquillizers while they are also known by their street names such as nerve tablets, <b>benzos,</b> valies, sleepers and downers. It is nearly a decade since these good practice guidelines were published with no visible impact on prescribing practices or usage. The lack of regulation has many adverse effects on the community – dependency, drug driving, workplace accidents and the creation of a black market to name a few. This report came about following numerous accounts of socio economic problems stemming from benzodiazepine dependency amongst the Traveller community. It examines the use of this particular group of drugs by the Traveller community based on anecdotal evidence collected by local Traveller organisations around Ireland. It also sets out some recommended actions that could be implemented to effectively tackle the problem...|$|R
25|$|Sedative-hypnotics such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and the {{barbiturates}} {{are known}} for the severe physical dependence that {{they are capable of}} inducing which can result in severe withdrawal effects. This severe neuroadaptation is even more profound in high dose drug users and misusers. A high degree of tolerance often occurs in chronic benzodiazepine abusers due to the typically high doses they consume which can lead to a severe benzodiazepine dependence. The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome seen in chronic high dose benzodiazepine abusers is similar to that seen in therapeutic low dose users but of a more severe nature. Extreme antisocial behaviors in obtaining continued supplies and severe drug-seeking behavior when withdrawals occur. The severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been described by one benzodiazepine drug misuser who stated that I'd rather withdraw off heroin any day. If I was withdrawing from <b>benzos</b> you could offer me a gram of heroin or just 20mg of diazepam and I'd take the diazepam every time– I've never been so frightened in my life. Those who use benzodiazepines intermittently are less likely to develop a dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon dose reduction or cessation of benzodiazepines than those who use benzodiazepines on a daily basis.|$|R
