25|$|To make it, I prayed by the hour. It was automatic, almost subconscious. I {{did not ask}} God to take me out of it. I prayed {{he would}} give me {{strength}} to endure it. When it would get so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not think I could stand it, I would ask God to ease it and somehow I would make it. He kept me.|$|E
500|$|The {{cultural}} references {{featured in}} the episode have attracted both criticism and praise. The parody of Next Media Animation has been commended by several reviewers. [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club commented that the episode [...] "features a couple of quite funny sight gags, like the fresco on Moe's ceiling and the delightful Taiwanese dramatization of certain events", but further wrote that the [...] "rest of the jokes and references clang away without being too funny or too insulting, and that {{is probably the best}} that any viewers can ask of The Simpsons in its advanced age." [...] Television Blend's Steve West commented that the episode was the worst of the Animation Domination lineup that week and further elaborated that the cultural references [...] "are always a year behind, and the smart writers who used classic American culture to bring wit to the series have been replaced by those who want to mimic South Park and Family Guy. They fail miserably, and it's gotten so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> now no longer care about the relationship between Marge and Homer." ...|$|E
500|$|Leandersson {{lives in}} Falun with her mother, stepfather, and two younger sisters. She is of Swedish and Iranian descent. Leandersson has always liked {{to dance and}} play theatre. Though there are several athletes in her family, she is not {{particularly}} fond of sports. [...] "I was on a football team when I was in third grade. But I was so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't allowed {{to play in a}} match", she recalled. She has stated on several occasions that she wants to continue acting, and has indicated that she would like to try different types of roles to challenge herself. Leandersson was a student at Gruvrisskolan. In an interview, she identified history as her favorite subject, because she finds it [...] "interesting to know how people lived and died in the past". She does not see school as a hindrance to continue acting, saying that she [...] "will just have to work harder than everyone else. But school isn't that difficult, it's quite easy." [...] She is a fan of the Twilight film series. In 2011-2014 years she is studying theatre at [...] ,a school for performing arts in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

2500|$|How {{much more}} of the story Lewis then wrote is uncertain. Roger Lancelyn Green thinks that he might even have {{completed}} it. In September 1947 Lewis {{wrote in a letter}} about stories for children: [...] "I have tried one myself but it was, by the unanimous verdict of my friends, so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> destroyed it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keats {{wrote his}} last letter on 30 November 1820 to Charles Armitage Brown; [...] "Tis the most {{difficult}} thing in the world to me to write a letter. My stomach continues so <b>bad,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel it worse on opening any book â€“ yet I am much better than I was in Quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the proing and conning of any thing interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past, and that I am leading a posthumous existence".|$|E
2500|$|Critic John Simon {{wrote in}} a review of the play, [...] "Selective patrons cannot even imagine what horrors reviewers are exposed to, night after nightmarish night." [...] Associated Press drama critic Jay Sharbutt {{described}} the play as comprising [...] "a lot of labored skulduggery, frantic slapstick, dashes upstairs, downstairs and sideways, assorted gunshots and half the population of this caper dispatched to a better world, if not better play" [...] and declined to identify the cast [...] "pending notification of [...] kin". Douglas Watt of the New York Daily News called it an [...] "incredibly sappy murder mystery farce" [...] that shouldn't happen to a moose and said that he had forgotten how it ended, while the New York Posts Clive Barnes said that it was [...] "so indescribably <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not intend to waste anyone's time by describing it." [...] He commended Eve Arden for leaving it before it opened and commented: [...] "Some people have all the luck." [...] Arthur Bicknell has also said that one member of the public, on spotting him in the street, shouted 'Officer, arrest that show!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{satisfied}} if I make wages {{out of the}} thing; but it's too <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> money <b>I</b> found wasn't good, for I {{allowed to}} put {{the most of it}} away so's to pay my board till I got another job." ...|$|R
2500|$|Paramount Pictures was {{concerned}} with the film's budget, which reportedly was almost $50 million. By 1997, multiple script drafts from three writers brought costs to approximately $2 million. After delays in production, Paramount Pictures told the group behind the film they had two months to set the project up at another studio. In a review of Carr's sequel The Angel of Darkness, Malcolm L. Johnson of The Hartford Courant cited concerns over how to depict the mutilation of the murdered prostitutes in the film, writing: [...] "Questions about how to treat this gruesome element has perhaps delayed the film of The Alienist." [...] When in a 1999 online chat with fans, set up by Time and Yahoo!, Carr was asked if there were film plans for The Alienist or The Angel of Darkness, he responded: [...] "Only 'The Alienist,' and the attempts have been so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not yet sold 'Angel' to the movies. What happened was that a producer bought the rights and then decided he had to completely change {{the characters in the}} book. We got into a huge conflict, one that is actually ongoing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'It is to his advice,' {{she said}} to herself, 'that I owe this very <b>bad</b> bargain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have made. If that young fellow had been left to himself he would have agreed to {{everything}} I demanded.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My nurse was," [...] {{returned}} the young man, reddening, and laughing rather uneasily. [...] "She taught me some <b>bad</b> habits <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not got over yet." [...] With those words {{he nodded and}} hastily went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you believe}} it. Just watch me, and {{sometime}} you'll see me break out that <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> won't know what I'm doin' myself. Oh, I'm a holy terror when I get started!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't {{look you}} in the face while I tell it. Listen calmly till I am done, and then pitch me {{overboard}} if you like, for I deserve it," [...] was his cheerful beginning.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must beg you {{to excuse}} the darkened room. I am {{suffering}} from a severe cold. My eyes are inflamed, and my throat is so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can only speak in a whisper. Sit down, sir. I have got news for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, not so <b>bad</b> as <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> hope," [...] {{said the}} host; and Lapham looked {{from one to}} the other, trying to make out what they were at. He had never been so up a tree before.|$|R

60|$|Well, I thought I could. After last night, I thought I could. But to {{wait and}} wait, and expect and expect, and think and think, was such <b>bad</b> {{preparation}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> resolved to go along the road again and meet her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You oblige me {{to speak}} out. You are such a one, that I do not dare to let you have my child. Your life is so <b>bad,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should not be {{justified}} in doing so for any family purpose. You would break her heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very bad," [...] he answered, [...] "so <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{wondering}} if it wouldn't be best to remove the limb below the knee {{and make it a}} job. You can see for yourself that it is septic and the inflammation is spreading up rapidly." ...|$|E
