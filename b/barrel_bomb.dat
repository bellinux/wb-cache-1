2500|$|Amnesty International {{issued a}} {{detailed}} report about Aleppo in 2015. It warned about the Syrian government use of imprecise explosive weapons on densely populated civilian areas, illustrating {{it with the}} example that eight <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> attacks between January 2014 to March 2015 killed at least 188 civilians—while only one rebel was recorded among the fatalities. It concluded that the government forces in Aleppo deliberately targeted civilians and civilian objects, implemented [...] "forced disappearances", used torture and other ill-treatment among the prisoners—and that this constitutes a crime against humanity.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, in the {{oil port}} of Haifa, where the first <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> {{had been used in}} September against the British, Irgun turned the weapon against Arab civilians. On December 30, 1947, Jewish assailants rolled a <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> from the back of a fast moving taxi into a group of Arabs waiting in line to enter an oil {{refinery}} where they were employed. The refinery employed Jewish and Arab workers and after the bombing distraught Arabs [...] "went berserk". They killed fellow workers by beating, stabbing and kicking them to death. In total 41 Jews and 6 Arabs were killed. Arabs quickly [...] "learned from the enemy" [...] about the <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> technique and used it to successfully retaliate against Jewish targets. On January 14, 1948, a Jewish [...] "terminal" [...] in Haifa was bombed using the so-called [...] "Jewish <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> technique". An Arab <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> was also reported on February 29, 1948, in Beit Dajan near Jaffa, when a delayed action <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> blew up a Jewish house injuring one person. It had been rolled off an Arab lorry.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next phase}} of barrel bombings {{targeted}} institutional buildings of symbolic importance, with a tit for tat back and forth bombing and retaliation. On February 2, 1948, the United Press reported that Arabs [...] "used the Jewish <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> technique" [...] to destroy the 5-story building of The Palestine Post, the only English-language newspaper in the holy land. Twenty people were injured but none were killed. In retaliation, on February 3, a <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> was exploded near the Arab National Society building in Haifa, killing four Arabs and wounding three others. On March 3, 1948, members of the Stern Gang used a stolen army truck to deliver a 400-pound <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb,</b> pushed out of the moving vehicle outside the former municipal building in the Arab quarter of Haifa.

On December 12, 1947, a <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> was pushed in front of Damascus Gate. Curious bystanders gathered around the barrel, unaware that it might contain a bomb. The explosion killed twenty people and five wounded. This was followed on December 29 by another <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> at Damascus Gate, thrown from a moving taxi into a line of Arabs waiting for the bus. Prior to the explosion, Jewish gunmen sprayed the crowd with machine-gun fire. Thirteen Arabs were killed. The taxi was chased down by an angry mob and its occupants were killed and the car set on fire image right. Irgun claimed responsibility. A third <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> targeting Arab civilians in Jerusalem occurred on January 7, 1948, when members of Irgun stole a police van from which they rolled a <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> into a large group of civilians who were waiting for a bus by the Jaffa Gate, killing around sixteen. The bomb was described as [...] "two fifty-gallon oil drums packed tight with old nails, bits of scrap iron, hinges, rusty metal filings. At their center was a core of TNT...". In the pursuit that followed the raiders crashed into a Muslim cemetery in Mamillah Road, Jerusalem, and their vehicle was wrecked by police gunfire.

Militants in Fallujah have boasted that they have discovered about 20 <b>barrel</b> <b>bombs</b> that did not explode on impact and are using them to make their own weapons. It was claimed in July 2014 by doctors in Fallujah that the city was being barrel-bombed three times a week and more than 600 civilians had been killed in such strikes since January.

5000|$|The Syrian {{government}} has reportedly used [...] "barrel bombs" [...] to attack civilian populations in rebel held territories {{in defiance of}} United Nations Security Council Resolution 2139 passed on February 22, 2014. The bombs are [...] "cheaply made, locally produced, and typically constructed from large oil drums, gas cylinders, and water tanks, filled with high explosives and scrap metal to enhance fragmentation, and then dropped from helicopters". [...] Between February 2014 and January 2015, Human Rights Watch reports that [...] "at least 450 major damage sites" [...] in Syria [...] "showed damage consistent with <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> detonations". A local Syrian group estimates {{that in the first}} year after UN resolution 2139 was passed, aerial <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> attacks killed 6,163 civilians in Syria, including 1,892 children. According to a UN investigation, in September 2016 the Syrian air force dropped barrel bombs from helicopters on a United Nations humanitarian aid convoy at Urum al-Kubra headed to Aleppo. The bombs were followed by rocket fire from jets, and strafing of survivors with machine guns, killing 14 aid workers. In a report issued 1 March 2017, the United Nations found the attack was “meticulously planned” and “ruthlessly carried out”—and because it was deliberate, a war crime.|$|E

50|$|A <b>barrel</b> <b>bomb</b> is {{an improvised}} unguided bomb, {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} flying IED (improvised explosive device). They are typically made from a large barrel-shaped metal container that has been filled with high explosives, possibly shrapnel, oil or chemicals as well, and then dropped from a helicopter or airplane. Due to {{the large amount of}} explosives (up to 1000 kg), their poor accuracy and indiscriminate use in populated civilian areas (including refugee camps), the resulting detonations have been devastating. Critics have characterised them as weapons of terror and illegal under international conventions.|$|E
