40|$|International audienceThe {{kinetics}} {{and efficiency}} of sterol production and bioconversion of phytosterols in two heterotrophic protists Oxyrrhis marina and Gyrodinium dominans were examined by feeding them two different algal species (Rhodomonas salina and Dunaliella tertiolecta) differing in sterol profiles. R. salina contains predominantly <b>brassicasterol</b> (≅ 99 %) and < 2 % cholesterol. The major sterols in D. tertiolecta are ergosterol (45 - 49 %), 7 -dehydroporiferasterol (29 - 31 %) and fungisterol (21 - 26 %). O. marina fed R. salina metabolized dietary <b>brassicasterol</b> to produce 22 -dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol. O. marina fed D. tertiolecta metabolized dietary sterols to produce cholesterol, 22 -dehydrocholesterol, <b>brassicasterol</b> and stigmasterol. G. dominans fed either R. salina or D. tertiolecta metabolized dietary sterols to make cholesterol, <b>brassicasterol</b> {{and a series of}} unknown sterols. When protists were fed R. salina, which contains cholesterol, the levels of cholesterol were increased to a magnitude of nearly 5 - to 30 -fold at the phytoplankton-heterotrophic protist interface, equivalent to a production of 172. 5 ± 16. 2 and 987. 7 ± 377. 7 ng cholesterol per mg R. salina carbon consumed by O. marina and G. dominans, respectively. When protists were fed D. tertiolecta, which contains no cholesterol, a net production of cholesterol by the protists ranged from 123. 2 ± 30. 6 to 871. 8 ± 130. 8 ng per mg algal C consumed. Cholesterol is not only the dominant sterol, but a critical precursor for many physiologically functional biochemicals in higher animal. As intermediates, these heterotrophic protists increase the amount of cholesterol at the phytoplankton-zooplankton interface available to higher trophic levels relative to zooplankton feeding on algae directly...|$|E

40|$|Sea ice is a {{fundamental}} component of Earth’s climate system, contributing to heat reduction (albedo) and deepwater formation. In order to understand processes controlling the recent dramatic reduction in Arctic sea ice cover, {{it is essential to}} determine spatial and temporal changes in sea ice occurrence and its natural variability in the present and past. Here, we present new biomarker data from surface sediments and related to the modern spatial sea ice variability in the Kara and Laptev seas. That means, we determined concentrations of the sea ice diatom-derived biomarker „IP 25 “ (isoprenoid with 25 carbon atom; Belt et al., 2007), phytoplankton-derived biomarkers (<b>brassicasterol</b> and dinosterol) and terrigenous biomarkers (campesterol and ß-sitosterol) to estimate recent sea ice conditions as well as terrigenous input in the study area. Assessment of sea ice conditions based on these biomarkers shows that a marginal ice zone exists along the continental shelf/slope of Kara and Laptev seas during summer/early fall. Elevated IP 25 as well as <b>brassicasterol</b> and dinosterol values occurring in the central Kara and Laptev seas are related to extended sea-ice-cover and higher primary production (close to ice edge situation). Further to the north, lower IP 25 and phytoplankton biomarker concentrations point to a more close sea ice cover situation. There are no IP 25 and very low <b>brassicasterol</b> and dinosterol concentrations in the river mouths but high terrigenous biomarker (campesterol and ß-sitosterol) concentrations due to the fresh water inflow transporting terrigenous matter to estuaries.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1967. Bibliography: 179 - 185. xiii, 185 l graphs, tablesA chemotaxonomic {{investigation}} of the family Zoanthidae, phylum Coelenterata, with sterols as the chemical parameter showed {{that most of the}} species contained a mixture of from four to six individual sterols. Each sterol mixture was characteristic of a given zoanthid, as shown by reproducible gas chromatographic patterns. Fingerprint gas chromatograms are therefore a valid tool to aid in the classification of zoanthids. Previous work had established the presence of 24 -methylenecholesterol in Zoanthus proteus and palysterol in Palythoa mammilosa. Re{{investigation of}} "palysterol" from Palythoa sp. proved it to be a mixture of at least five compounds which could be separated by preparative gas chromatography. The major component (ca. 60 % of the palysterol mixture) was shown to be identical with 22, 23 -dihydrobra. ssicasterol, a sterol which had not been previously isolated from marine or other natural sources. A second sterol (ca. 20 % of palysterol) was shown to be identical with gorgosterol. Structural investigation of gorgosterol has not led to complete structural elucidation. The remaining three sterols of the palysterol mixture were shown to be identical with cholesterol (10 - 15 %), <b>brassicasterol</b> (1 - 2 %), and 24 ξ-ethylcholesterol (1 - 2 %). "Zoansterol", a sterol mixture isolated from Zoanthus confertus, was shown to be composed of four sterols. Three sterols were shown to be identical with cholesterol, <b>brassicasterol,</b> and 24 ξ-methylcholesterol. The fourth component, 24 -methylenecholesterol, was indicated by gas chromatographic behavior. A sterol isolated from a toxic Palythoa sp. consisted of essentially a single compound which proved to be 24 -methylenecholesterol. The sterols of members of five classes of the phylum Echinodermata were studied. The results indicate a close relationship of sea stars and sea cucumbers on the one hand, and of brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea lilies on the other. Five sterols isolated from the sterol mixture of the sea star Acanthaster planci were shown to be Δ^ 7 -cholestenol, 24 ξ-methyl-Δ^ 7 -cholestenol, 24 ξ-ethyl-Δ^ 7 -cholestenol, 24 ξ-methyl-Δ^ 7, 22 - cholestadienol, and the Δ^ 7 - analogue of gorgosterol. Mass spectra and gas chromatograms of the sterols were used to distinguish Δ^ 7 - from Δ^ 5 -sterols. The sterols of the sea cucumber Holothuria atra proved to be closely analogous to those found in the sea star. Cholesterol was shown to be the major sterol in the sterol mixture of the sea urchin, Echinothrix diadema. It was associated with minor quantities of 24 ξ-ethyl- and 24 ξ-methylcholesterol. From the sterol mixture of the brittle star Ophiocoma insularia five sterols were isolated. The major sterol was identical with cholesterol. The second most abundant component was identified as 24 -ethylidinecholesterol (fucosterol?) with small inseparable impurities of 24 ξ-ethylcholesterol. <b>Brassicasterol,</b> 24 ξ-methylcholesterol, and stigmasterol were identified as the minor components. Gas chromatographic and mass spectrographic evidence indicated the presence of 22 -dehydrocholesterol, chole sterol, <b>brassicasterol,</b> 24 ξ-methylcholesterol, stigmasterol, and 24 ξ-ethylcholesterol in the sterol mixture of a crinoid Antedon sp.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The tropics are {{centrally}} {{important in}} determining global climate patters {{as the primary}} heat and moisture source for atmosphere and ocean circulation. Understanding {{of the range of}} natural variability and the sensitivity to external change is limited by the short period of direct observation and the relative scarcity of paleoclimate records. In this thesis I develop and apply new methods to determine rainfall changes in the tropics based on the hydrogen isotopic composition of lipids from phytoplankton. Specifically, I enhance the capacity to measure the hydrogen isotopic composition of organic compounds preserved in sediments, calibrate the sensitivity of these values to modern lake water and salinity, and apply these tools to reconstruct hydrologic changes in the Galápagos. Several streamlined methods for purifying dinosterol, taraxerol, <b>brassicasterol,</b> and individual alkenones are presented using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These techniques permit quantification of the hydrogen isotope fractionation in dinosterol, <b>brassicasterol,</b> individual alkenones, and n-alkanoic acids, from a series of globally distributed lake surface sediments spanning a salinity range of 0 to 248 ppt. Dinosterol and <b>brassicasterol</b> hydrogen isotope fractionations decreased by approximately 1 //unit change in salinity, which agrees with previous localized environmental transect studies, but individual alkenones and n-alkanoic acids are found to be relatively insensitive to changing salinity. These fractionation factors are then applied to reconstruct hydroclimate variations in the Galápagos islands during the past 2, 000 years. Using a combination of nC 29 -alkane, nC 24 -alkanol, taraxerol and dinosterol hydrogen isotope data, as well as concentration profiles of n-alkanes, n-alkanols, and taraxerol, along with calibration data sets for mangrove- and algal-lipids, from three different saline lakes {{in the southern part of}} Isabela Island I quantitatively reconstruct lake water hydrogen isotope and salinity changes. The data imply that the region experienced significant hydrologic changes, with those occurring between approximately 0 and 1200 AD driven by shifts in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation system, and those between 1200 AD and the present driven predominantly by changes in position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone...|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} {{isotopic composition}} (δ 2 H) of lipid biomarkers has diverse {{applications in the}} fields of paleoclimatology, biogeochemistry, and microbial community dynamics. Large changes in hydrogen isotope fractionation have been observed among microbes with differing core metabolisms, while environmental factors including temperature and nutrient availability can affect isotope fractionation by photoautotrophs. Much effort has gone into studying these effects under laboratory conditions with single species cultures. Moving beyond controlled environments and quantifying the natural extent of these changes in freshwater lacustrine settings and identifying their causes is essential for robust application of δ 2 H values of common short-chain fatty acids as a proxy of net community metabolism and of phytoplankton-specific biomarkers as a paleohydrologic proxy. This work targets the effect of community dynamics, temperature, and productivity on 2 H∕ 1 H fractionation in lipid biomarkers through a comparative time series in two central Swiss lakes: eutrophic Lake Greifen and oligotrophic Lake Lucerne. Particulate organic matter was collected from surface waters at six time points throughout {{the spring and summer of}} 2015, and δ 2 H values of short-chain fatty acids, as well as chlorophyll-derived phytol and the diatom biomarker <b>brassicasterol,</b> were measured. We paired these measurements with in situ incubations conducted with NaH 13 CO 3, which were used to calculate the production rates of individual lipids in lake surface water.  As algal productivity increased from April to June, net discrimination against 2 H in Lake Greifen increased by as much as 148  ‰ for individual fatty acids. During the same time period in Lake Lucerne, net discrimination against 2 H increased by as much as 58  ‰ for individual fatty acids. A large portion of this signal is likely due to a greater proportion of heterotrophically derived fatty acids in the winter and early spring, which are displaced by more 2 H-depleted fatty acids as phytoplankton productivity increases. Smaller increases in 2 H discrimination for phytol and <b>brassicasterol</b> suggest that a portion of the signal is due to changes in net photoautotrophic 2 H fractionation, which may be caused by increasing temperatures, a shift from maintenance to high growth, or changes in the community assemblage. The fractionation factors for <b>brassicasterol</b> were significantly different between the two lakes, suggesting that its hydrogen isotope composition may be more sensitive to nutrient regime than is the case for fatty acids or phytol...|$|E
