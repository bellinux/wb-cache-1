5|$|Many {{fragments}} {{that are}} securely {{attributed to the}} Catalogue, {{some of which are}} relatively substantial, cannot be placed within the poem because their content is either too obscure or could <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to different individuals or genealogies which are themselves difficult to locate within the five books.|$|E
5|$|Other {{features}} include Bloodhound technology, which looks for virus-like behavior to better find zero day viruses. The Security Inspector looks for common vulnerabilities, including insecure user account passwords and browser insecurities. Advertisement blocking rewrites a website's HTML to prevent advertisements from being displayed. Parental controls, an optional component, can block certain programs from accessing the Internet, such as IM clients, and restrict newsgroup access. Restrictions can <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to different Windows users accounts. Sites are classified in 31 categories, {{and the four}} profiles which can <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> each block different categories of sites. Supervisors define exceptions, add global blocked sites, or block all access to sites not on a user-created whitelist. Both PC Magazine and PC Pro noted the exclusion of time-based restrictions. Information filtering can be controlled on a per-user basis.|$|E
5|$|PHP stores {{integers}} in a platform-dependent range, {{either a}} 64-bit or 32-bit signed integer {{equivalent to the}} C-language long type. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations; this behavior {{is different from that}} of other programming languages. Integer variables can <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> using decimal (positive and negative), octal, hexadecimal, and binary notations.|$|E
50|$|Councils {{outside the}} US were given numbers {{that began with}} 800, which <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> to the Direct Service Council.

The second was the theory of plate tectonics, which helped {{make sense of the}} geographical distribution of ancient life.|$|E
5|$|Type {{safety is}} {{variable}} in COBOL. Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric {{data can be}} placed in any data item that can be stored as a string, including numeric and group data. In contrast, object references and pointers may only <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, in the PostgreSQL {{implementation of}} SQL, Null {{is used to}} represent all UNKNOWN results, including the UNKNOWN BOOLEAN. PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors {{do not support the}} Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN.|$|E

3000|$|The {{first step}} in the test {{assembly}} is to determine the number of blocks and the assignment of items to those blocks. The function block_design facilitates this process with two required arguments and one optional argument. The n_blocks argument specifies the number of blocks while the item_parameters argument takes a data frame of item parameters. The default allocation of items to blocks is a spiraling design. For 1, 2, [...]..., H item blocks, the first item <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block 1, item 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to the block 2, and item H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block H. The process is continued such that item H+ 1 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block 1, item H+ 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block 2 and item H+H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> to block H until all items <b>are</b> <b>assigned</b> to a block.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} it was thought that Alpha was the twenty-second storm of the season, and so was the storm which broke the 1933 season's record for most storms in a single season. However post-season {{analysis}} revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October4, which made Alpha the twenty-third storm of the season. Alpha was the first tropical storm to <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> a Greek-alphabet name after the list of hurricane names was exhausted.|$|E
5|$|Basic to {{the second}} group is a clade {{consisting}} of both species sofar included in Ploceus that live on Madagascar, P. nelicourvi and P. sakalava, and these are morphologically very distinct from the remaining species. These two species could in future <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to the genus Nelicurvius that was erected by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850, but which was merged with Ploceus later on. This second group further contains the genera Malimbus and Anaplectes, and all remaining Ploceus species.|$|E
5|$|Between battles, {{characters}} can {{be managed}} at a Base. In this location, skills can <b>be</b> <b>assigned,</b> weapons can be traded, purchased, and forged, and bonus experience points earned in battle can be given to characters. There is also a Support system accessible through the Base where player characters can talk {{with each other and}} improve their relationships. These conversations improve affinity between characters and grant stat boots in battle. Supports are ranked from C to A, with A being the highest rank and granting the best bonuses.|$|E

The highest scoring Green-Light cadet <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> {{to his or}} her highest desired NCSA, followed by the second highest scoring Green-Light, and so on, until all green light cadets have <b>been</b> <b>assigned.</b> After Green-Light cadets have <b>been</b> <b>assigned,</b> the highest Approved cadet <b>is</b> <b>assigned,</b> followed by the second highest approved cadet, and so on.|$|R
5|$|Both {{versions}} use {{a common}} airframe, with three Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option, is , or six hours. However, range {{can be extended}} further when the five underfloor fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks fitted in the cabin. Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. At least 14 Merlin HM2s will <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to the carrier.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{have several}} {{different}} stats and gauges: their health (HP), a magic meter stocked by Technical Points (TP), and Learning Points (LP) for learning skills. a character's respective agility or luck, {{and how a}} character reacts to attacks. Attack types are physical and magical, while defense is limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points (EXP). EXP and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, can <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to each character. The number of skills that can <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> is calculated {{by the number of}} skill points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their LP meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, can also be used by individual characters to restore their HP and TP and grant temporary enhancements. Recipes are learned from a character called the Wonder Chef.|$|E
5|$|Each Poor Law Union {{employed}} {{one or more}} relieving officers, {{whose job}} it was to visit those applying for assistance and assess what relief, if any, they should be given. Any applicants considered to be in need of immediate assistance could be issued with a note admitting them directly to the workhouse. Alternatively they might be offered any necessary money or goods to tide them over until the next meeting of the guardians, who would decide on the appropriate level of support {{and whether or not}} the applicants should <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to the workhouse.|$|E
50|$|For 1951, letter codes were used. One-letter codes <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> to {{the first}} {{counties}} whose names began with those letters, while all other counties <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> two-letter codes consisting of the initial letter and the next available letter in their names (the letters I, O and Q were not used). There were three exceptions: Douglas County, the most populous in the state, <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> single-letter X to increase capacity; Otoe County <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> Z as O was not allowed; and Dodge County <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> DG instead of DD as double-letter codes were also not allowed.|$|R

5|$|Finucane was {{now one of}} the 45 {{pilots in}} his class to have {{completed}} 100 hours of piloting time on aircraft since he joined the RAF. After completing basic flight training on 28 October 1938, Finucane was classed as an average pilot, but deemed to be competent enough to <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to advanced flying school. With effect from the following day, he was granted a short-service commission as an acting pilot officer (on probation) and sent to 8 Flying Training School, RAF Montrose in Scotland. On 12 November, he left King's Cross railway station travelling on the Flying Scotsman to Glasgow, arriving at Montrose after a 10-hour journey.|$|E
5|$|Fossilized {{remains of}} Deinonychus have been {{recovered}} from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming and in the roughly contemporary Antlers Formation of Oklahoma, in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 108 Ma.
