5|$|Although many in NASA's Voyager {{program were}} {{supportive}} of the idea, there were concerns that taking a picture of Earth {{so close to the}} Sun risked damaging the spacecraft's imaging system irreparably. It was not until 1989 that Sagan's idea was put into practice, but then instrument calibrations delayed the operation further, and the personnel who devised and transmitted the radio commands to Voyager 1 were also <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> or transferred to other projects. Finally, NASA Administrator Richard Truly interceded to ensure that the photograph was taken.|$|E

40|$|Despite recent {{interest}} in how psychiatric disorders affect work outcomes, {{little is known}} about the role of personality disorders (PDs), which are poorly understood yet prevalent (15 %) and impairing. We used nationally representative data for 12, 457 men and 16, 061 women to examine associations of PDs with any employment, full-time employment, chronic unemployment, <b>being</b> fired or <b>laid</b> <b>off,</b> and having trouble with a boss or co-worker. Antisocial, paranoid, and obsessive-compulsive PDs demonstrated the broadest patterns of associations with adverse outcomes. Findings suggest that PDs may have implications for the productivity of co-workers as well as that of the disordered employees themselves...|$|R
50|$|Matters {{came to a}} head after November 1989 when protesters {{breached}} {{the wall}} and it became apparent that the fraternal Soviet forces had no instructions to suppress the street protests by force, as they had in 1953 (and, more recently, in Prague in 1968). A successiion of seemingly unstoppable events were set in train, leading to East Germany's first (and as matters turned out last) free and fair election in March 1990 and then, formally in October 1990, German reunification. At the hitherto important Berlin Economics Academy Carola Bluhm's career prospects disappeared. In 1990 she was informed succinctly in writing that she was <b>being</b> temporarily <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> ("in Warteschleife geschickt") and six months later, her job disappeared permanently (although according to her own website she remained, at least formally, an employee of the Berlin Economics Academy till early in 1991).

5|$|From {{early in}} his career, Wałęsa was {{interested}} in workers' concerns; in 1968 he encouraged shipyard colleagues to boycott official rallies that condemned recent student strikes. He was a charismatic leader, who helped organize the illegal 1970 protests at the Gdańsk Shipyard when workers protested the government's decree raising food prices and he was considered for the position of chairman of the strike committee. The strikes' outcome, which involved the deaths of over 30 workers, galvanized Wałęsa's views {{on the need for}} change. In June 1976, Wałęsa lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of his continued involvement in illegal unions, strikes, and a campaign to commemorate the victims of the 1970 protests. Afterwards he worked as an electrician for several other companies but his activism led to him continually <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> and he was jobless for long periods. Wałęsa and his family were under constant surveillance by the Polish secret police; his home and workplace were always bugged. Over the next few years, he was arrested several times for participating in dissident activities.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Garry McGuire {{announced}} that 24 of 80 employees were <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> {{and the days}} of operation would be reduced from 7 to 3 per week. Attendance figures had never reached either original or updated projections, causing the facility to operate annually in the red since its opening. In November, he {{announced that}} the property would be sold due to unsustainable debt. The museum closed on Friday, November 21, 2008. The closure was without warning; visitors who had arrived for scheduled events found a paper notice at the entrance that the center was temporarily closed. The next days' events involving chef Andrew Carmellini and singer Joni Morris were also abruptly cancelled; the museum later stated that it would reopen on December 1. On that day, the organization (with $80 million ($ today) in debt) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The federal bankruptcy court blocked a $2 million ($ today) emergency loan with priority in security, leaving Copia with no funds to resume operations.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's overall {{net sales}} {{declined}} from its peak of ¥1.8trillion (US$18.7billion) in 2009 to ¥549billion (US$4.6billion) in 2015. Net income losses were incurred in 2012 and 2014. In 2010, Nintendo revealed that Iwata earned a modest salary of ¥68 million (US$770,000), which increased to ¥187 million (US$2.11million) with performance based bonuses. In comparison, Miyamoto earned {{a salary of}} ¥100 million (US$1.13million). Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014 as apologies for the poor sales while {{other members of the}} Nintendo board of directors had pay cuts of 20–30percent. This also served to ensure the job security of Nintendo's employees, preventing workers from <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> in order to improve short-term finances. In 2012, the company experienced its first operating loss since entering the video game market more than 30years earlier. Losses continued {{for the next two years}} before the company finally returned to profitability at the end of the 2015fiscal year. The slight turnaround was largely attributed to blockbuster games such as Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E
40|$|Using a rich, {{recent and}} nationally {{representative}} longitudinal survey {{specifically designed to}} examine alcohol use and associated problems, we investigate the effects of alcohol misuse {{on a series of}} understudied and perhaps less common employment problems. Such problems include <b>being</b> fired or <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> from a job, sustained unemployment and conflicts with a supervisor and/or co-worker. After controlling for time-invariant omitted variables via fixed effects estimation, we find evidence that three measures of alcohol misuse are significantly related to employment problems. The results offer new information on the potential adverse labour market effects of alcohol misuse and shed light on potential mechanisms through which alcohol misuse may impact intensive labour supply and/or wages. ...|$|R

40|$|Are there {{negative}} {{health effects}} from losing the job? We analyze the causal effect of job displacement on diabetes incidence and prevalence. Type 2 diabetes is an illness that is {{directly affected by}} lifestyle factors and psychosocial stress, and with severe side-effects deteriorating the quality of life. We use rich Swedish register data {{that allows us to}} identify workers displaced through plant downsizing between 2002 and 2004, matched to detailed information on diabetes status from the Swedish National Diabetes Register. As those displaced at large layoffs may still be a selective group with respect to health we match them to comparable workers not being displaced. On average we do not find signs for {{a significant increase in the}} diabetes onset in case an individual is mass-laid off. However, we find substantial effect heterogeneity when distinguishing between different socio-economic characteristics which additionally differ between men and women. For example, the probability of the onset of diabetes increases due to <b>being</b> mass <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> in case men do not have a partner. In addition there are signs that women in case of having a partner and a child below 18 also suffer in terms of diabetes incidence in case they are mass-laid of...|$|R

50|$|Turnover is when {{employees}} {{leave the}} organization, either voluntarily (quitting) or involuntarily (<b>being</b> fired or <b>laid</b> <b>off).</b> Research on voluntary employee job turnover {{has attempted to}} understand the causes of individual decisions to leave an organization. It {{has been found that}} lower performance, lack of reward contingencies for performance, and better external job opportunities are the main causes. Other variables related to turnover are conditions in the external job market and the availability of other job opportunities, and length of employee tenure. Turnover can be optimal as when a poorly performing employee decides to leave an organization, or dysfunctional when the high turnover rates increase the costs associated with recruitment and training of new employees, or if good employees consistently decide to leave. Avoidable turnover is when the organization could have prevented it and unavoidable turnover is when the employee's decision to leave could not be prevented.|$|R

25|$|The final {{construction}} {{project for the}} yard {{came in the form}} of construction of five 2nd Lieutenant John P. Bobo Class of Maritime Prepositioning ships. These ships could house equipment and supplies to house 4,000 Marines for thirty days, as well as everything they would need for combat. The ships were also designed to not need port facilities, as everything could be offloaded offshore. The ships were built by General Dynamics and initially were operated by General Dynamics' American Overseas Marine under a 25-year charter. The end of the construction of these ships in May 1986 meant that there was no longer any need for the yard, as attempts to secure container ships for United States Lines and survey ships for the Navy fell through. In 1986, the yard closed, with remaining employees either retiring or <b>being</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off.</b> In 1987, General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division ceased operation.
