5|$|Antony Gibbs & Sons {{may have}} {{intended}} to employ Great Britain only to exploit a temporary demand for passenger {{service to the}} Australian gold fields following the discovery of gold in Victoria in 1851, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> long-term employment on this route. For her new role she was given a third refit. Her passenger accommodation was increased from 360 to 730, and her sail-plan altered to a traditional three-masted, square-rigged pattern. She was fitted with a removable propeller, which could be hauled up on deck by chains to reduce drag when under sail power alone.|$|E

Kate now works the Dordogne site {{from the perspective of}} architecture, examining the ruins to see how they were built and to make recommendations of restoration.|$|E
25|$|That {{same year}} she moved, against her family's wishes, to Denver, Colorado to join {{one of her}} {{brothers}} who lived there. She {{then moved on to}} Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was unusual during that period in American history for a woman to move independently and alone, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> work as a seamstress and a cook.|$|E

25|$|Soon after 21:00 on December 14, 1989, Sakharov went to {{his study}} {{to take a nap}} before {{preparing}} an important speech he was to deliver the next day in the Congress. His wife went to wake him at 23:00 as he had requested <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> Sakharov dead on the floor. According to the notes of Yakov Rapoport, a senior pathologist present at the autopsy, it is most likely that Sakharov died of an arrhythmia consequent to dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 68. He was interred in the Vostryakovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Atwell often {{returned}} to her native Trinidad, and on one occasion she {{bought a house in}} Saint Augustine, a home she adored and later renamed Winvilla and which was later turned into the Pan Pipers Music School by one of her students, Louise McIntosh. In 1968 she had recorded Ivory and Steel, an album of standards and classics, with the Pan Am Jet North Stars Steel Orchestra (director/arranger Anthony Williams), and supported musical scholarships in the West Indies. In the early 1980s, Atwell's sense of loss following her husband's death made her consider returning to Trinidad to live, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> the weather too hot.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> immense {{success in}} 1938 with The Yearling, {{a story about}} a Florida boy and his pet deer and his {{relationship}} with his father, which she originally intended as a story for young readers. It was selected for the Book-of-the-Month Club, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1939. MGM purchased the rights to the film version, which was released in 1946, and it made her famous. In 1942, Rawlings published Cross Creek, an autobiographical account of her relationships with her neighbors and her beloved Florida hammocks. Again it was chosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club, and it was even released in a special armed forces edition, sent to servicemen during World War II.|$|E

25|$|She {{decided to}} open a child care center in Montgomery County, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> the state {{licensing}} process to be burdensome. She reasoned {{that it must be}} even more burdensome for individuals who have limited or no English-speaking abilities, leaving them at risk of fines and closures if they decide to provide unlicensed child care services. In 1998, Navarro co-founded Centro Familia, a small local nonprofit organization that trained people so they can be licensed in child care. She volunteered for the organization at no pay until the organization received enough state and county grant money that it could pay her a salary and hire four instructors two years later. She was with the organization until 2006.|$|E
25|$|She did {{not want}} to switch to the {{futurist}} style popular in the art of the early Soviet period, nor paint portraits of commissars, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> some work at the Kharkov Archaeological Museum, where she made pencil drawings of the exhibits. In December 1920 she moved to her grandfather’s apartment in Petrograd. After the October Revolution, inhabitants of private apartments were forced to share them with additional inhabitants, but Serebriakova was lucky - she was quartered with artists from the Moscow Art Theatre. Thus, Serebriakova's work during this period focuses on theatre life. Also around this time, Serebriakova's daughter, Tatiana, entered the academy of ballet, and Serebriakova created a series of pastels on the Mariinsky Theater.|$|E
25|$|After recuperating until 1802, {{she decided}} to re-enlist, rejoining the 9th Dragoons, now garrisoned in Paris, as a gentleman volunteer. The memoirs claim that she was accorded many of the {{privileges}} of an officer, and she found herself an object of curiosity in fashionable society, culminating in a dinner invitation with Napoleon, now First Consul of the Republic. For ten days, she became an attendant to Josephine, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> it hard {{to adapt to the}} informal idleness of the Château de Saint-Cloud, so she returned to her regiment in the Paris garrison until 1805, when Marshal Augereau recruited her as a uniformed aide-de-camp for his wife, who, like her, enjoyed both riding and shooting – a more conducive household than Saint-Cloud. The basic outline is confirmed by the appearance of her stipend at St-Cloud in Napoleon's accounts in 1804, and by the eyewitness memoirs of Marbot, which vouch for her role with Augereau, and summarize her previous biography up to her departure from Saint-Cloud. In 1805, she was also proposed (albeit unsuccessfully) for the Napoleonic army's gallantry medal, the Légion d'honneur.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Adermann {{was forced}} {{to give up her}} dream of playing basketball. However, a {{physical}} education teacher suggested that she try wheelchair basketball, a sport she had never heard of. Although she is a wheelchair basketball player, Adermann does not require a wheelchair for everyday activities, and is classified as a 4.5 point player, the lowest level of disability. Being able to move her body fully gives the [...] tall center a height advantage, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> that shooting from the free throw line in a chair requires as much force as shooting standing from the three-point line.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Gwynne married Tony David in Cairo on 30 August 1944. [...] Within a year, {{her husband}} was posted to India. She {{followed}} him there in January 1946, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> life as the wife of {{an officer of the}} British Raj tedious, the social life dull, and the food generally [...] "frustrating". Later in life she came to appreciate the cuisine more, and wrote about a few Indian dishes and recipes in her articles and books. In June 1946, she suffered severe sinusitis and was told by her doctors that the condition would persist if she remained in the summer heat of Delhi. Instead, she was advised to go back to England. She did so; Cooper observes, [...] "She had been away from England for six years, and in that time she, and England, had changed beyond recognition." ...|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green praised the episode, {{saying it was}} an {{improvement}} on [...] "Borderland" [...] and that Spiner was even better. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> {{the murder of the}} doctor shocking and felt that it had gone too far. She said that themes raised in [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] mirrored those which could have appeared on The Original Series but that this episode didn't take the time to discuss them. She hoped that the final episode of the trilogy would cover that ground. The mini-arc featuring the episodes [...] "Borderland", [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] and [...] "The Augments" [...] were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt. Viewing of [...] "Cold Station 12" [...] was included alongside the Doctor Who episode [...] "The Beast Below" [...] in the course [...] "Captain Picard Meets Dr. Who" [...] at the University of Dubuque to demonstrate the idea of sacrificing one person to save many.|$|E

500|$|Steven Spielberg {{took notice}} of Zeta-Jones in Titanic and {{recommended}} her to Martin Campbell, who was directing The Mask of Zorro (1998) for Spielberg's production company. Campbell cast {{her as the}} leading lady in favour of Izabella Scorupco, who was his original choice for the part. Co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas, the film {{tells the story of}} Zorro (Hopkins), a Latin warrior who sets out to avenge the death of his wife and find his lost daughter Elena (Zeta-Jones). She found similarities between her [...] "volatile" [...] Celtic personality and her Latin character's temperament, and in preparation she studied dancing, riding and sword-fighting, and took diction lessons in Spanish. Filming the action and dance sequences while wearing heavy corsets in the humid Mexican desert proved to be a challenge for Zeta-Jones, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> the experience [...] "worth suffering for". The Mask of Zorro was positively received by the critics and earned over US$250 million worldwide. The role proved to be a breakthrough for her and she was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance.|$|E
500|$|When Jam and Lewis {{agreed to}} produce Jackson's third studio album, {{they wanted to}} appeal {{primarily}} to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts. Jam commented {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "We wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America... we were going for the black album of all time." [...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head. We saw what she was capable of, what she wanted to say, where she wanted to be, what she wanted to be. We put together some songs to fit her as we saw her, as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that." ...|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{stated that}} she had Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince [...] "planned for years", but she spent two months going over her plan before she began writing seriously. This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for Goblet of Fire and had to rewrite {{a third of the}} book. She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him. The first chapter, [...] "The Other Minister", which {{features}} the meeting between the Muggle Prime Minister, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in Philosopher's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> [...] "it finally works" [...] in Half-Blood Prince. She stated that she was [...] "seriously upset" [...] writing the end of the book, although Goblet of Fire was the hardest to write. When asked if she liked the book, she responded, [...] "I like it better than I liked 'Goblet', 'Phoenix' or 'Chamber' when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I know it will remain one of my favourites of the series. Ultimately you have to please yourself before you please anyone else!" ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{emotions}} stirred by this task, Mary Shelley arguably proved herself {{in many respects}} a professional and scholarly editor. Working from Percy's messy, sometimes indecipherable, notebooks, she attempted to form a chronology for his writings, and she included poems, such as Epipsychidion, addressed to Emilia Viviani, which she would rather have left out. She was forced, however, into several compromises, and, as Blumberg notes, [...] "modern critics have found fault with the edition and claim variously that she miscopied, misinterpreted, purposely obscured, and attempted to turn the poet into something he was not". According to Wolfson, Donald Reiman, a modern editor of Percy Bysshe Shelley's works, still refers to Mary Shelley's editions, while acknowledging that her editing style belongs [...] "to an age of editing when the aim was not to establish accurate texts and scholarly apparatus but to present a full record of a writer's career for the general reader". In principle, Mary Shelley believed in publishing every last word of her husband's work; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> herself obliged to omit certain passages, either by pressure from her publisher, Edward Moxon, or in deference to public propriety. For example, she removed the atheistic passages from Queen Mab for the first edition. After she restored them in the second edition, Moxon was prosecuted and convicted of blasphemous libel, though he escaped punishment. Mary Shelley's omissions provoked criticism, often stinging, from members of Percy Shelley's former circle, and reviewers accused her of, among other things, indiscriminate inclusions. Her notes have nevertheless remained an essential source {{for the study of}} Percy Shelley's work. As Bennett explains, [...] "biographers and critics agree that Mary Shelley's commitment to bring Shelley the notice she believed his works merited was the single, major force that established Shelley's reputation during a period when he almost certainly would have faded from public view".|$|E
2500|$|After {{working with}} Cameron on Titanic, Kate Winslet decided {{she would not}} work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". She said that Cameron was a nice man, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> his temper {{difficult}} to deal with. In an editorial, the British newspaper The Independent said that Cameron [...] "is a nightmare to work with. Studios have come to fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, {{as well as his}} flaming temper." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{the initial}} {{conception}} of the character, Gordon and Gansa targeted Claire Danes to play the lead role of Carrie. The pair were very impressed with her acting prowess, especially in My So-Called Life and Temple Grandin, but were skeptical as to whether she would accept a television role. Indeed, Danes was not necessarily looking to return to television, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>found</b> the script and the character to be very compelling. In addition, {{the opportunity to be}} a part of the [...] "renaissance" [...] of high-quality dramas on cable television appealed to her.|$|E
