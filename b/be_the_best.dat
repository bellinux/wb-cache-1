5|$|Contemporary reviewers {{considered}} Fifty Years to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> available {{biography of}} Neill.

5|$|A {{few years}} after {{studying}} experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of the Nickelodeon series Rocko's Modern Life, at an animation festival, and was offered {{a job as a}} director of the show. Martin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko's Modern Life, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, this would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> approach. Production on Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996. Shortly afterwards, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.|$|E

5|$|A year {{prior to}} Kameo release, GamesRadar wrote {{that while they}} highly {{anticipated}} the title and {{expected it to be}} of high quality, they thought the game's continual delays would likely hurt the final product. Closer to release, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) added that he had expected the game to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> among the Xbox 360 launch titles. Kameo core gameplay concept brought his anticipation to par with that customary for The Legend of Zelda titles, and he thought the game would reap the benefits of its long development through refined audiovisuals. Xbox executive Peter Moore announced Kameo as his favorite launch title in anticipation of the Xbox 360's launch.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{researched}} its use {{for treatment}} of female sexual arousal disorder and chronic anorgasmiaa sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasm. The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> method to achieve orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing.|$|E
5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem.

Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, who at the time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are {{coated with}} a layer of iridium 60nm thick. Iridium proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E
5|$|Britain and France {{declared}} war on Russia on 28 March 1854 {{in support of the}} Ottoman Empire.

5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods {{as well as a}} federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E

5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing in verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This {{is not to say}} that he disliked Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E

5|$|During the 12 {{years in}} which Belgium failed to qualify for major tournaments, another golden {{generation}} matured, most of whom later featured in foreign top football leagues; as of July 2013, 12 Belgian national team players would play the next season in the English Premier League. Five players of this generation gained both prime individual and team awards in foreign top competitions or European club competitions: defenders Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen, wingers Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne, and forward Kevin Mirallas. However, as of November 2016 {{none of them were}} regarded by FIFA or UEFA to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> at their position in any major international tournament yet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Optimum {{band and}} band {{combination}} for retrieving total nitrogen, water and fiber content in tealeaves with remote sensing data is investigated based on regressive analysis. Based on actual measured data of total nitrogen, fiber and water content in tealeaves {{as well as}} remotely sensed visible to near infrared reflectance data with 5 nm of wavelength steps and ASTER/VNIR onboard Terra satellite, regressive analysis <b>is</b> conducted. As <b>the</b> results, it <b>is</b> found that 1045 nm <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wavelength for retrieving total nitrogen content while 945 nm <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wavelength for fiber content retrieval. Also {{it is found that}} 545 nm <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wavelength for water content. On the other hand, it is found that 350 and 750 nm wavelength combination <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> for estimation of total nitrogen content while 535 and 720 wavelength combination <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> for fiber content estimation. It also found that 545 and 760 nm wavelength combination <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> for water content retrieval.

50|$|Another {{advantage}} is that a barque can outperform a schooner or barkentine, and is both easier to handle and better at going to windward than a full-rigged ship. While a full-rigged ship <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> runner available, and while fore-and-aft rigged vessels <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> at going to windward, <b>the</b> barque <b>is</b> often <b>the</b> <b>best</b> compromise, and combines <b>the</b> <b>best</b> elements of these two.|$|R
5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E

He {{let it be known that}} if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.|$|E
