5|$|For {{the role}} of Brandon's girlfriend, Lana Tisdel, Peirce had envisioned a young Jodie Foster. The role was also offered to Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Polley. Peirce {{ultimately}} decided to cast Chloë Sevigny based on her performance in The Last Days of Disco (1998). Sevigny had auditioned for {{the role of}} Brandon, but Peirce decided Sevigny would be more suited to playing Lana <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not picture Sevigny as a man.|$|E
5|$|She later {{switched}} to songwriting while in high school, writing lyrics on napkins and schoolbooks and recording her humming on a Walkman <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not play any instruments. During high school, {{she worked as}} a backing vocalist for Elfa Secioria. Her family eventually moved to Jakarta to further her singing career, and she was requested to be a backing vocalist for three different pop singers. At one point, she was recording at three different studios every day. The money that she earned convinced her to continue singing.|$|E

5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not pump the water out of her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, she {{returned}} to India {{in the wake of}} the economic recession and moved to Mumbai to stay with Priyanka. During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti to the head of the public relations team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> use what she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Boyd {{was cast}} as the antagonist, Messala, on April 13, 1958. William Wyler {{originally}} wanted Heston for the role, but sought another actor after he moved Heston {{into the role of}} Judah Ben-Hur. Because both Boyd and Heston had blue eyes, Wyler had Boyd outfitted with brown contact lenses as a way of contrasting the two men. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired after two days of work <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not cry on cue. Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott as Miriam, and she was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline, Wyler cast her as Tirzah.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1890, Bronisława — who {{a few months earlier}} had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist — invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not afford the university tuition; it would take her {{a year and a half}} longer to gather the necessary funds. She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again. All that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself. In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw. She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891. She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum of Industry and Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw's Old Town. The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E
5|$|Sue Hendrickson, amateur paleontologist, {{discovered}} {{the most complete}} (approximately 85%) and the largest Tyrannosaurus fossil skeleton known in the Hell Creek Formation near Faith, South Dakota, on August 12, 1990. This Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Sue in her honor, was {{the object of a}} legal battle over its ownership. In 1997 this was settled in favor of Maurice Williams, the original land owner. The fossil collection was purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History at auction for $7.6 million, making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton to date. From 1998 to 1999 Field Museum of Natural History preparators spent over 25,000 man-hours taking the rock off each of the bones. The bones were then shipped off to New Jersey where the mount was made. The finished mount was then taken apart, and along with the bones, shipped back to Chicago for the final assembly. The mounted skeleton opened to the public on May 17, 2000 in the great hall (Stanley Field Hall) at the Field Museum of Natural History. A study of this specimen's fossilized bones showed that Sue reached full size at age 19 and died at age 28, the longest any tyrannosaur is known to have lived. Early speculation that Sue may have died from a bite {{to the back of the}} head was not confirmed. Though subsequent study showed many pathologies in the skeleton, no bite marks were found. Damage to the back of the skull may have been caused by post-mortem trampling. Recent speculation indicates that Sue may have died of starvation after contracting a parasitic infection from eating diseased meat; the resulting infection would have caused inflammation in the throat, ultimately leading Sue to starve <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer swallow food. This hypothesis is substantiated by smooth-edged holes in her skull which are similar to those caused in modern-day birds that contract the same parasite.|$|E

Unfortunately, Trump felt it was a very foolish thing to say and Ivanka deemed it flippant.|$|R

25|$|In 1972, the 54-year-old Hayworth {{wanted to}} retire from acting, but she needed money. At the {{suggestion}} of Robert Mitchum, she agreed to film The Wrath of God.

25|$|A major {{development}} in the international Ursuline organization in 1900 gave the St. Peter's nuns the independence of action they sought. For some years, a movement had existed to unify the hundreds of independent Ursuline chapterhouses into a single organization. A union would also give the Ursulines most of the independence they sought. Pope Leo XIII asked for Ursuline delegates to meet in Rome to consider creating an Ursuline Union. Mother Amadeus traveled to Rome to attend the meeting, in part <b>because</b> <b>she</b> advocated a union and in part <b>because</b> <b>she</b> believed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> win approval from the new organization for an expansion into Alaska. Mother Amadeus cast her eight convents' votes for the union, which was formed. She won approval to go to Alaska from the Union's new Superior General, Mother St. Julien Aubrey.
