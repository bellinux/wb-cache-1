For their work they used a method of study unknown to the Romans themselves, insisting that contradictions in the legal material were only apparent. They tried to harmonize the sources in the conviction that for every legal question only one <b>binding</b> <b>rule</b> exists. Thus they approached these legal sources in a dialectical way, which is a characteristic of medieval scholasticism. They sometimes needed to invent new concepts not found in Roman law, such as half-proof (evidence short of full proof but of some force, such as a single witness). In other medieval disciplines, for example theology and philosophy, glosses were also made on the main authoritative texts.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{activity}} {{takes place}} in a scenario characterized by an increasing number of environmental regulations aimed at bringing under control the emission of contaminating wastes. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of transforming a code of good practice in nitrogen fertilization on Spanish citrus fruit farms into an environmental regulation of compulsory fulfilment. Using data envelopment techniques, we calculate unrestricted and environmentally regulated short-run maximum profits. Both profit values are then used to compute an index of the cost of regulation. Our results suggest that the cost of shifting from a merely recommended practice to a <b>binding</b> <b>rule</b> is low. On average, the loss of profit computed is only about 4 %. Furthermore, we find that farms' overall efficiency is low and that the current gap between observed and regulated fertilization practices could be overcome by improving overall management efficiency. ...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{seeks to}} reflect on how the {{conscious}} political effort to overcome the divisiveness caused by Member States' idiosyncracies has matured into the constitutional recognition of Member State identities as essential to the European project. Central findings concern the particular twist from 'national identity' to 'constitutional identity' in the Lisbon Treaty. This {{can be considered a}} codification of the case law of some of the Member State constitutional courts. This implies that, whereas the Lisbon Treaty failed to incorporate a 'supremacy clause' on the priority of EU law over conflicting Member State law, it has indeed formulated a legally <b>binding</b> <b>rule</b> on the priority of certain Member State constitutional law over EU law. The more precise contours of this priority have already become the object of controversial ECJ case law.

40|$|Abstract – A {{number of}} European fishing fleets have been {{regulated}} {{through a combination}} of quota and effort (sea days) controls since 2004. These two regulation schemes are, however, interrelated, i. e. a given quota limit will neces-sarily determine the effort used and vice versa. A bioeconomic feedback model is presented which takes this causality between effort and harvest control into account, and switches back and forth between these two regulation schemes depending on which is the <b>binding</b> <b>rule.</b> The model is based on biological stock projection, and quotas are set using the Pope approximation while an economic production function is used to estimate the harvest when the effort is binding. The economic response of the fleet is modelled through a dynamic investment/disinvestment module which evaluates the change in the fleet capacity given the economic outcome of the fishery. A simple example is presented for the Danish seiners catching cod in the North Sea. The model has been constructed as part of the 6 th framework project “Operational Evaluation Tools for Fisheries Management Options (EFIMAS) ”...|$|E
40|$|N-Methylpyrrole (Py) –N-methylimidazole (Im) {{polyamides}} are {{organic molecules}} that can recognize predetermined DNA sequences in a sequence-specific manner. Human telomeres contain regions of (TTAGGG) n repetitive nucleotide sequences {{at each end}} of chromosomes, and these regions protect the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes. The telomeres are disposable buffers at the ends of chromosomes that are truncated during cell division. Tandem hairpin Py–Im polyamide TH 59, which recognizes human telomere sequences, was reported by Laemmli’s group in 2001. Here, we synthesized three types of Py–Im polyamides 1 – 3 based on TH 59 for specific recognition of human telomere repeat sequences. Thermal melting temperature (Tm) measurements and surface plasmon resonance analysis were used to evaluate the abilities of the three types of Py–Im polyamides to discriminate between three kinds of DNA sequences. Significantly, the results showed that polyamides 1 and 2 have better affinities to TTAAGG than to TTAGGG. In contrast, polyamide 3 displayed good specificity to human telomere sequence, TTAGGG, as expected on the basis of Py–Im <b>binding</b> <b>rule...</b>|$|E
