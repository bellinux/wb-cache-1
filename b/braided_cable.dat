40|$|Migrating {{orthopedic}} hardware has widely {{been reported}} in the literature. Most reported cases of migrating hardware involve smooth Kirschner wires or loosening/fracture of hardware involved with joint stabilization/fixation. It is unusual for hardware to migrate within the soft tissues. In some cases, smooth Kirschner wires have migrated within the thoracic cage—a proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is the negative intrathoracic pressure. While wires have also been reported to gain access to circulation, transporting them over larger distances, the majority of broken or retained wires remain local.

This cracking does not occur if the insulating material is not under tension, or if the cable is surrounded by some medium other than air. But it does occur even if the insulation is not subjected to electric stress, provided that the atmosphere near the cable contains ozone. The extent of this cracking varies greatly with the insulating material used. The cracking can be materially reduced by using <b>braided</b> <b>cable</b> and by avoiding sharp bends...|$|E
40|$|A binary {{magnesium}} diboride (MgB 2) cable has been assembled by braiding six Nb/Monel sheathed monofilament strands around a central copper stabilizer {{for improving the}} operational environment. The total critical current (Ic) of the <b>braided</b> <b>cable</b> is obtained by multiplying the I c of six single wires, without any dissipation. In this work, various mechanical deformations, i. e., swaging, two-axial rolling, groove rolling, and cold high-pressure densification (CHPD) at 1. 8 GPa have been applied to the 6 -stranded cable to obtain additional densification. The highest critical current density at both 4. 2 and 20 K has been achieved in this work through the CHPD treated cable due to higher filament mass density.

50|$|The {{critical}} angle {{depends on the}} relative difference in index of refraction, larger differences will increase the {{critical angle}} and trap more light. However, changing the index of refraction in most materials generally changes its mechanical properties too, which means that different types of cables are used for different purposes.

Even cables designed to be flexible, like TOSLINK, are less flexible than a similar sized <b>braided</b> copper <b>cable.</b>|$|R

This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of two types of in situ powder-in-tube processed mono (pure) and multifilament (carbon doped) MgB 2 cables with different twist pitch lengths; thereby making them possible candidates for industrial AC applications. Critical current is not influenced by the cabling that results in various twist lengths. The total critical current of the <b>braided</b> <b>cables</b> is obtained by multiplying the critical current of six single wires without any dissipation. The critical current density (Jc) of pure (mono) and carbon doped (18 -filament) six stranded cable reached 10000 A/cm 2 at 5. 5 and 10 T, respectively; without any observable deleterious effect caused by varying the twist pitch. The engineering current density (Je) of both cables reached the same value of 10000 A/cm 2 at 3. 5 and 6. 5 T, respectively. Compared to the literature, this work reports {{some of the highest}} Jc and Je values for carbon doped multifilament cables that remain unaffected upon varying the twist pitch.

40|$|The sublaminar wiring {{procedure}} {{has been}} commonly used for stabilizing the atlantoaxial complex. Multistrand <b>braided</b> <b>cables</b> {{were introduced in}} the early 1990 s. In previous biomechanical studies these cables were demonstrated to be superior to monofilament wires {{in terms of their}} flexibility, mechanical strength, and fatigue-related characteristics. To the authors' knowledge, they are the first to describe clinically the occurrence of delayed spinal cord compression resulting from multistrand cables after the completion of rigid spinal arthrodesis in the upper cervical spine. Three patients underwent posterior atlantoaxial fusion in which two sublaminar multistrand cables were placed. Between 15 and 48 months postoperatively, they suffered from upper- and lower-extremity numbness as well as gait disturbance. Plain radiography and computerized tomography myelography revealed spinal cord compression caused by the sublaminar cables, although fusion was complete and physiological alignment was maintained at the fused segment. The radiographs obtained immediately after surgery demonstrated that the initial cable placement had been properly performed. The shape of the cable at the initial surgery was oval and then gradually became circular. The anterior arc of the circular shape of the cable in fact led to the spinal cord compression. Considering the mechanism of this late complication, a cable tends to spring open because of its high flexibility and becomes circular shaped even after the complete arthrodesis. When applying multistrand cables for intersegmental fixation at the atlantoaxial complex, delayed complications related to bowing of the cables is possible...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial <b>cables</b> use <b>braided</b> {{copper wire}} forming the shield.

The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a wire <b>braid.</b> Some <b>cables</b> may invest in more than two shield layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid.

40|$|In recent years, {{electromagnetic}} compatibility (EMC) {{problems associated with}} high frequency and high speed interconnects are becoming of increasing concern. Coaxial cables are a popular form of interconnect. In this thesis, the crosstalk coupling between two parallel coaxial cables in free space and above a ground plane is investigated. The degree of coupling is usually formulated analytically in the frequency domain. In this thesis, a method for time domain simulation is proposed using the TLM technique. Results are compared with frequency domain solutions and experimental results. Also; the standard model has been improved by including the skin depth effect in the coaxial <b>cable</b> <b>braid.</b> The crosstalk between the two coaxial cables is observed through the induced voltages on the loads of the adjacent cable, which is deemed to be the usual measureable form of cable coupling. The equivalent circuit developed for the coupling path of two coaxial cables in free space takes account of the differential mode (DM) current travelling in the <b>braids</b> of the <b>cables.</b> As for the coupling path of the cables via a ground plane, the equivalent circuit is developed based on the flow of differential mode (DM) and common mode (CM) currents in the braid, where the coaxial braid’s transfer impedance is modelled using Kley’s model. The radiated electric (E) field from the coaxial cable above a ground plane is also deduced from the predicted cable sheath current distribution and by the Hertzian dipoles’ approach.
