Based on the <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> load-time courses {{calculation}} model under bucket digging condition, the stresses on the hydraulic cylinder piston rods of boom and bucket and the real-time length of bucket hydraulic cylinder were set as measured variables, and a measuring method of the <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> load-time courses was developed {{which had the}} advantages of less measuring points, simplified measurement process and low cost. The <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> load-time courses were calculated by inputting the measuring data into the self-developed Constructing Hydraulic Excavators Load Spectrum software, and its characteristics of each digging step in one excavation cycle at digging macadam were analyzed. Then, using rain-flow counting module in FE-SAFE software, the statistical graphs of <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> load-time courses were acquired which could {{provide the basis for}} hydraulic excavator reliability design and fatigue life prediction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{excavator}} is {{a typical}} hydraulic heavy-duty human-operated earth engaging machine tool used in general as a continuous digging machine in large-scale open pit mining operations. However, under dynamic loading, excavator <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> are subjected to severe abrasive wear. The objective of this work was to improve the service life of the excavator <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> in order to decrease the idle time required to reinstate the teeth periodically during excavation. This objective {{was carried out by}} overlaying the excavator <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> (of high tensile steel) with four different wear resistant hardfacing alloys by manual metal arc welding. Comparative wear tests on a regular tooth and overlayed excavator <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> were conducted in the field and laboratory (ASTM G- 99, pin-on-disc apparatus), where the effect of hardfacing alloys on the extent of wear and the wear characteristics of the excavator teeth were examined...|$|R
40|$|The life of <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> in {{shovel and}} {{dragline}} deployed in handling of overburden rock {{is an important}} contributor to the stores cost and is also responsible {{for the loss of}} valuable availability and utilisation time of these critical equipment. To ascertain the effect of rock type on longevity of <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> a study has been conducted in two large opencast mines of Singrauli Coalfields. The results of this study is presented in this paper. There was a significant variation as compared to the actual figures of the mine it establish useful relationship between the type of mineral present in the overburden and the life of <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> of shovel and dragline...|$|R
5000|$|A {{specialist}} use for {{filler metal}} {{is where a}} deliberately different metal is to be deposited. This is often done for hard-facing excavating tools or digger <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth.</b> A hard, but more expensive and sometimes brittle, facing alloy is deposited onto the wear surfaces of mild steel tools.|$|R

40|$|In this report, {{parametric}} and non-parametric {{regression models}} and their suitability to determining the {{mass in the}} bucket of large mining excavators are compared. Although the problem of determining the force on the <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> could be modelled in a similar fashion, {{it is not clear}} that there is a single force acting on the teeth and not a more complex contact between the bucket and the ground, so the report focuses on the problem of determining the payload mass. The parametric model is found to be the better approach, because although a detailed model of each type of machine must be developed, an exact measurement of the model parameters is not required, and the model requires far less data for training that the non-parametric one...|$|R

40|$|A better {{tool design}} in the {{excavation}} process has been always a challenging task for the engineers. A poorly designed tool always results in poor excavation of the ground, higher wear of the tool, wastage of the time, and power, and thus reducing the overall productivity of the excavation operation. But proper understanding of the soil mechanics in context of the soil cutting process may help in a better tool design. Moreover; in designing the control system for an excavator requires the dynamic model of an excavator, and it requires in turn the resistive forces offered by the ground on the bucket. The excavation forces necessary to cut the soil by the excavator bucket have been analyzed in this paper to improve {{the design of the}} <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth,</b> the leap plate of the bucket,and the side cutting plates. The method used for calculating the excavation force is based on 2 D analytical soiltool interaction models...|$|R
40|$|For many years, buckets {{have been}} {{equipped}} with teeth to help penetrate, gouge and breakout materials. The teeth also works as wear parts {{and can be}} replaced when they are worn down, and thus increase the service life of the <b>bucket.</b> The first <b>teeth</b> were made like a one-piece design and to replace such tooth required both cutting and welding which was very time consuming. Today’s modern teeth consist of an adapter that is welded on the <b>bucket</b> and a <b>tooth</b> with a locking system that {{makes it easy to}} replace the tooth when needed. The teeth on the market today are cast, which means that the hardness cannot be guaranteed through the whole cast and the hardest tooth is measured to be around 500 HB.   SSABs brand Hardox is the toughest steel on the market. It is extremely wear resistant and has a three time longer service life than ordinary steel. To increase the use of Hardox the possibility to manufacture <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> of three or more plates are examined.   This thesis has applied a product development process to mainly develop concepts of the locking system that holds the adapter and tooth together. The locking systems main requirement is to be hammerless, meaning that it is not hammered in, due to the high risk of injury and longer assembly time. Apart from, the geometry of the tooth will be developed to give a better wear resistance.   The result is a tooth with at least twice as long service life than the cast competitors and two concepts of locking system. Both locking systems meet the requirement of being hammerless and the sustainability is ensured with calculations of shear force. The geometry of the tooth is design to be self-sharpening, which allows it to stay sharper throughout its service life. Wear test using DEM analysis assure a positive outcome. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{concerns}} part 2 of {{a project}} with the aim to propose protective measures for cables and pipelines for bio and natural gas. Part 1 was previously reported in SGC Rapport 2011 : 239. The wish {{is to be able}} to increase the pressure in the distribution networks from 4 to 10 bar without having to retain the safety distances valid for 80 bar pipelines. Polymer, concrete and steel protective plates, and deep digging are the physical measures considered. In part 1 a survey was made, in part by an enquiry, of the frequency, causes and consequences of incidents where pipelines were hit by excavators. Further, the rules and standards were investigated in countries where 7 – 10 bar pipelines are already in service. Here, in part 2 the perspective was widened to include, apart from gas pipelines, also all kinds of buried pipelines and cables. Now a visit to a supplier in France is reported, as well as an vestigation of costs and environmental impacts of the different protective measures, and an analysis of the strength of protective plates and of how they can best be positioned in the ground in relationship to the pipeline. The main result from the study visit to France was that new regulations mean that both new and existing pipelines have to be satisfactorily protected. For the physical point of view these plastic protective plates play an important part, and there are commercially available building systems of plates for which the strength and durability have been verified by tests. In the full scale experiments done in, e. g., France, it can be concluded that the plastic (HDPE) plates can wit stand high loads which are applied by use of a <b>bucket</b> with <b>teeth</b> mounted on an excavator. In some cases penetration of teeth occurs, but the plates will in that case either come up and alert the operator or stay in the ground and still protect the buried cable or pipeline. Concrete plate can also break, but the pieces are held together by the steel reinforcement. The analysis of costs and environmental impacts shows that plastic plates are preferred with regard to both aspects. In addition they have a very good signalling effect being produced in a bright yellow colour. Also deep digging can be effective taking into account costs and environmental aspects, but the risk reduction will according to literature be less than for the plates. Plastic plates are shown, in the literature surveyed, by full scale experiments to have at least as good, and sufficient, resistance to impact as concrete ones. This is verified by in-house numerical analyses. The finite element analyses show that the plastic plates deforms but do not break. The arching action of the backfill protects the buried pipe, and the stresses become only somewhat higher when using plastic plates instead of using stiff plates of steel or concrete. There may be unfavourable cases when the plastic plates cannot by themself stop forces and stresses passing down through soil layers acting on the buried pipe...|$|R
40|$|Shaft sinking is an {{important}} part of the mining process, of which “mucking” (clearing the broken rock from the bottom of the shaft) plays a critical role. The aim of the research was to develop a scaled experimental replica of the so-called Clamshell Mucker and compare its performance, over a range of operating parameters, with those yielded by numerical simulations, for the long-term purpose of validating the simulation as a tool for optimizing the design of full-scale machines. Towards this end a scaled experimental rig of the clamshell mucker was developed and tested over an appropriate range of geometrical and operating parameters, for two different materials: hard plastic balls and thereafter 13 mm decomposed granite stone. Hydraulic actuator forces were established by measuring line pressures, while angular rotation of the jaws of the mucker was monitored using an angular potentiometer. Simple analysis provided a relationship between actuator force and torque on the buckets. The stone in the muck reservoir was agitated after each test run, to ensure random particle arrangements with no structuring, and a constant digging depth. Testing of the hard plastic balls was used to establish a qualitative comparison between Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) and physical testing, using both video and still photography comparisons, corresponding to the teeth initially touching the surface with a bucket closing velocity of 20 deg/s. Heuristic correlations obtained by this means were generally favourable. Quantitative testing using 13 mm granite stone yielded the bucket closing torque variation with bucket angle for various combinations of:- (a) bucket closing velocity, (b) initial distance of the bucket from the muck pile, (c) proximity of the bucket to the side and front walls of the container, and (d) the angle at which bucket assembly enters the muck pile. The main set of tests took place with the bucket entering vertically and positioned in the middle of the bed. Three different initial distances from the surface to the starting position of the <b>bucket</b> <b>teeth</b> were investigated (20 mm, 10 mm and 0 mm), with bucket angular velocities of 10 deg/s, 15 deg/s and 20 deg/s. Thereafter, testing was conducted at the forward (polycarbonate) boundary of the container and one of the lateral boundaries (steel) respectively, each for a single bucket velocity of 20 deg/s and covering the three above-mentioned initial distances from the surface. This testing was performed in an attempt to simulate the proximity effects that would be encountered in practice - for example, digging close to a side wall. Finally, torque variations with bucket angle were established at four different angles of attack (0 ±, 5 ±, 15 ± and 30 ±), at a constant bucket closing velocity of 20 deg/s, with the closest portion of the bucket initially touching the surface. Data was generally interpreted in the context of the fact the torque required to rotate the buckets appears to depend on an interplay between:- (a) the level of fluidization between particles in the bed, increasing with bucket closing velocity, results in a reduced torque; (b) particulate congestion, increasing as the initial distance from the surface of the granular material decreases, results in an increased torque; and (c) the momentum required to move the particles and change their direction, increasing with bucket velocity, results in an increased torque. Accordingly, for the larger initial distances from the surface momentum effects are dominant, generally leading to an increase of torque with angular velocity. However, as the initial distance reduces, congestion becomes increasingly important, until for the zero initial separation case, the lowest angular velocity yields the highest torques, probably because fluidization has been inhibited. Because particle to boundary interactions have lower friction than particle to particle interactions, torques in the presence of boundaries were lower than for the middle position in the initial stages. Beyond a certain point, proximity to the forward boundary led to congestion with a commensurate increase in torque above that of the middle case, whereas proximity to the lateral boundary led to no congestion, so the torques remained generally lower than for the middle case. When considering the effects of angle of penetration, it was found that the largest angle of penetration (30 ±) gave the highest torque in the initial stages, probably because the highest volumes of material are captured relative to other angles of attack. Beyond a bucket angle of about 14 ± congestion becomes increasingly dominant, with the rise in torque due to this effect generally delayed with increasing angles of attack. This phenomenon was ascribed to the fact that in all cases other than zero angle of penetration, only one jaw initially enters the material, with the second following at a later stage: therefore particles escape to a free surface for the mid-range bucket angles, with the onset of congestion commensurately delayed to the larger ones. Comparisons between DEM data and measurements for various testing parameters showed that the simulated and physical results display similar values of torque towards the beginning and end of the digging motion, but DEM predictions are low in the middle of the range. This is thought to arise primarily from the fact that simplified particle geometries (smooth, with no sharp edges) were incorporated into the DEM model because of computational resource limitations, whereas the real granular particles have sharp edges and are blocky, thus increasing particle interlocking effects and the high level of congestion frequently exhibited in the physical experimentation. This effect was generally reflected by poor comparisons between DEM data and experimentation in the context of torque variations with velocity in the middle range of angular positions. Because the coefficients of rolling friction and restitution were obtained from published data, additional simplified simulations were run to determine the sensitivity of these parameters (in addition to static friction coefficient, for comparative purposes) on the force characteristics of the model. It was established that specifically chosen percentage changes in all of the parameter values relative to the base system led to percentages of force deviation that were at least 3 to 5 times smaller, reinforcing the inference that particle interlocking effects were the dominant reason for poor mid-range correlations between experimentation and the DEM modelling. The maximum energy to fill the buckets was required at a zero angle of penetration, diminishing significantly to an angle of about 15 ± and then increasing once again. This trend is attributed to the fact that the 0 ± case is most affected by congestion, whereas the larger angles of attack (beyond about 20 ±) cause the weight of the material to significantly affect the energy required to close the buckets. While it was considered possible that similar trends would be observed in practice, that could potentially reflect in improved operational guidelines for the mucking process, further analysis suggested that an energy saving of less than 814. 3 kJ might be attainable for clearing a 6 m diameter shaft during a single cycle. While this appears to be inconsequential in the broader context, it should be subjected to a more comprehensive investigation in the context of full-scale cleaning strategies. It is recommended that:- (a) the test facility be modified to extend the range of bucket angular velocities; (b) testing be conducted with a broader range of particle sizes; (c) research into the interlocking and frictional effects of rock be pursued, to create representative particulate shapes as input to the DEM model; (d) higher friction coefficients be attempted as a means of artificially compensating for interlocking effects that are impractical to achieve because of computer resource limitations; and (e) testing be conducted with a range of different bucket shapes and sizes for the purpose of optimizing the design by way of minimizing structural stresses and the specific energies required to collect individual loads...|$|R
