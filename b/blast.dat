5|$|The {{technology}} {{required for}} <b>blast</b> furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or {{may have been}} an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record <b>blast</b> furnaces about three metres high. As the Varangian Rus' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route, {{it is possible that the}} technology reached Sweden by this means. High quality ores, water power for bellows for <b>blast</b> and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since <b>blast</b> furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the Haya people, it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently. The step from bloomery to true <b>blast</b> furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of the <b>blast</b> and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron and, cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the <b>blast.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tuyeres {{are used}} to {{implement}} a hot <b>blast,</b> {{which is used to}} increase the efficiency of the <b>blast</b> furnace. The hot <b>blast</b> is directed into the furnace through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The hot <b>blast</b> temperature can be from 900°C to 1300°C (1600°F to 2300°F) depending on the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000°C to 2300°C (3600°F to 4200°F). Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.|$|E

5|$|A <b>blast</b> furnace {{converts}} {{raw iron}} ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered <b>blast</b> furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in <b>blast</b> furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold <b>blast</b> traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced.
