60|$|Next morning, the {{recently}} appropriated room adjoining {{on the other}} side of the dining-room, presented a different aspect from that which met the eye of Delly upon first unlocking it with Pierre on the previous evening. Two squares of faded carpeting of different patterns, covered the middle of the floor, leaving, toward the surbase, a wide, <b>blank</b> <b>margin</b> around them. A small glass hung in the pier; beneath that, a little stand, with a foot or two of carpet before it. In one corner was a cot, neatly equipped with bedding. At the outer side of the cot, another strip of carpeting was placed. Lucy's delicate feet should not shiver on the naked floor.|$|E
50|$|The Spanish Forger's {{works were}} painted on vellum or {{parchment}} leaves of genuine medieval books, using either <b>blank</b> <b>margins</b> or scraping off the original writing. He also “completed” unfinished miniatures or added missing miniatures in medieval choir books. His works fooled many experts and collectors {{at the time}} and appear today in the collections of many museums and libraries. Over 200 forgeries have been identified.|$|R
5000|$|Like other Persian manuscripts, it uses paper. Excluding <b>blank</b> <b>margins,</b> {{the pages}} are 41 by 29 cm, {{with the text}} in six columns of 31 lines where not {{interrupted}} by the miniatures. These mostly take the full width of the page, and are placed at various heights within it. None are full page. Some miniatures use irregular [...] "stepped" [...] shapes to suit the subject. [...] Given {{the history of the}} manuscript (see below), the usual system of numbering by folios cannot be applied.|$|R
50|$|German artist Karl Schwesig, while a {{political}} prisoner during World War II, drew {{a series of}} pseudo-stamps on the <b>blank,</b> perforated <b>margins</b> of postage stamp sheets, using coloured inks. Jas Felter asserts that this 1941 series, which illustrated life in a concentration camp, is typically accepted as the first true set of artist's stamps.|$|R
40|$|Judging {{from the}} title {{this would be}} a book for a {{distinctly}} limited audience. After all, only very few of the more than 430 South African orchid species are in general cultivation. For two reasons that judgement would be wrong. First, many South African orchids deserve to be much more widely cultivated. This book may be considered an excellent promotion for these beautiful but neglected species. Second, this book could well be described as an up-to-date guide to orchid growing, where the examples happen to be South African species. Especially valuable is the detailed information on cultivating terrestrial species. These are generally much more difficult to grow than the epiphytic ones, and most of the advice given here applies just as well to Australian and Mediterranean orchids. Propagating orchids by sowing is given extensive coverage, down to a blueprint for building your own laminar flow cabinet. All the information is very clearly represented, with many instructive photographs. The colour photographs are excellent, and the book is well-produced, although I personally dislike <b>blank</b> <b>margins</b> as wide as 5 cm, as they are here. This book is warmly recommended, not only to those who are attracted by the subject of the title, but to all who are seriously interested in cultivating and propagating terrestrial orchids...|$|R
5000|$|The text is extant in {{a single}} ninth-century {{manuscript}}, Clm 14098 of the Bavarian State Library, Munich.The bulk of the manuscript contains a Latin theological text presented between 821 and 827 by Adalram, bishop of Salzburg, to the young Louis the German (ca. 810-876). Into this orderly written manuscript, {{the text of the}} Muspilli was untidily entered, with numerous scribal errors, using <b>blank</b> pages, lower <b>margins</b> and even the dedication page.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} extant manuscripts of the Lives, {{although}} {{none of them are}} especially old, and they all descend from a common ancestor, because they all lack the end of Book VII. The three most useful manuscripts are known as B, P, and F. Manuscript B (Codex Borbonicus) dates from the 12th century, and is in the National Library of Naples. Manuscript P (Paris) is dated to the 11th/12th century, and is in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Manuscript F (Florence) is dated to the 13th century, and is in the Laurentian Library. The titles for the individual biographies used in modern editions are absent from these earliest manuscripts, however they can be found inserted into the <b>blank</b> spaces and <b>margins</b> of manuscript P by a later hand.|$|R
40|$|In 1932 Beatrice Warde {{delivered}} to the British Society of Typographic Designers what has since {{become one of the}} most recognizable statements about the design of books: “The Crystal Goblet, or Printing Should Be Invisible. ” In it, Warde defines good typography as a crystal goblet, “because everything about it is calculated to reveal rather than hide the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain. ” Her address argues that the true art of designers is the creation of transparent interfaces which allow readers to imbibe deeply of the intellect captured within the pages of the book without external distractions. Warde’s ‘Crystal Goblet’ is fundamentally contradictory. Typographers must strive to make themselves and their work invisible so that only the voice of the absent author speaks through the text; but there is no voice, only words on page produced through a great deal of human labour at a specific moment in history. But, Warde did not create her metaphor; she adopted existing imagery from the Western tradition. Nor was she the first typographer to do so. The writings and work of those involved with the creation of books has, since before the invention of the printing press, revolved around attempts to create ‘perfect’ communicative interfaces – books which allow the reader an unobscured view into the mind of the author. The resultant page is that with which we are most familiar: a block of black Roman-style text on a white or off-white page with <b>blank</b> <b>margins.</b> This study tracks the rise and influence of the ‘crystal goblet’ motif, the dream of perfect readability, in the discourse of those directly involved with the creation of books: scribes, printers, type-cutters and typographers. It postulates transparency, or perfect readability, to be the primary motive underlying the actions of those making books, but does not assume all printers in all times have been motivated by the same forces or to the same extent. Rather, it traces the thread of transparency through many incarnations and examines the social and political factors underlying each permutation and how new elements are introduced into the discourse without completely erasing all traces of the old. Chapter One studies the Italian Renaissance and how the writing style of a small group of humanist scholars comes to dominate the printed book of the sixteenth century. Chapter Two begins with an examination of the perceived decline in typographic practice in the seventeenth century and the subsequent emergence of both writings about typography and of a new style of Roman typeface: the Modern. Chapter Three deals with similar events in the nineteenth-century – first there is a perceived decline in and then a revival of printing standards. Chapter Four discusses the reconciliation of machine- production and traditional practices in the early to mid-twentieth century and the unsuccessful challenge to traditional typography posed by the Bauhaus and other Modernist schools of design...|$|R
