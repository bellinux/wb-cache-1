Futurama, conversely, stems from Jewish-American humor, {{and not just in}} the obvious archetype of Dr. Zoidberg.

5000|$|Land of the <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{second album}} by {{contemporary}} folk singer-songwriter John Gorka. The album was also Gorka's major label debut for High Street Records/Windham Hill Records.

The album's fifteen tracks and near hour-long length also provided an unusually large amount of music for a recording of that era.

60|$|Composite pictures, are, however, {{much more}} than averages; they <b>are</b> rather <b>the</b> {{equivalents}} of those large statistical tables whose totals, divided {{by the number of}} cases, and entered in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line,</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> averages.

Financial considerations are also driving a social conscience. The quadruple bottom line – ethical responsibility is the focus on employees, on stewardship and on leadership fostering and nurturing employees.
