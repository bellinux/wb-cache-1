50|$|Each Bill {{consists}} of five main parts: the long title, the short title, the interpretation clause, {{the main body}} of the Bill and the objects and reasons. The long title is a description of the nature of the Bill and covers the intent of the Bill. The Short title follows the long title and labels the <b>Bill</b> for <b>identification</b> purposes. The short title sometimes also, contains the commencement clause, which states when the Bill will have legal force. The short title in turn is followed by the interpretation clause, which defines certain words and phrases used in the Bill. The body of the Bill {{consists of}} all of the other clauses, which contain the provisions of the Bill, that is, they contain all of the measures that the Bill is enacting. The objects and reasons is the final part of a Bill and it seeks to explain in layman’s terms the purpose of the Bill and the reason why it is necessary.|$|R
40|$|Information {{technology}} can improve healthcare efficiency. We developed and implemented {{a simple and}} inexpensive tool, the “Automated Case Finding and Alerting System” (ACAS), using data from an existing clinical information system to facilitate identification of potentially eligible patients for clinical trials and patient encounters for billing purposes. We validated the ACAS by calculating the level of agreement in patient identification with data generated from manual identification methods. There was substantial agreement between the two methods both for clinical trial (kappa: 0. 84) and billing (kappa: 0. 97). Automated identification occurred instantaneously vs. about 2 hours/day for clinical trial and 1 hour 10 minutes/day for billing, and was inexpensive ($ 98. 95, one time fee) compared to manual identification ($ 1, 200 /month for clinical trial and $ 670 /month for <b>billing).</b> Automated <b>identification</b> was more efficient and cost-effective than manual identification methods.

40|$|Abstract—In many organizations, {{especially}} in most utility companies including Company X, revenue collection {{is a major}} issue when customers face difficulties in paying their utility bills before the deadline. There are many reasons for this problem but it becomes a serious financial issue for the organizations when the cumulative amount of bad debts reached a staggering figure. This paper reports a study of this issue for Company X involving its customers based in Bangi and Kajang, totaling upto 1, 525 customers. The study is conducted to identify the factors of customers who would default payment of their <b>bills.</b> The <b>identification</b> of such factors is important to enable Company X to identify these customers and implement the necessary measures to mitigate the problem. The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for data mining) model was employed in conducting the study.

5000|$|With 7,074 votes (60.1 percent), Cain won the Republican {{nomination}} for the District 3 House seat on March 2, 2010, by defeating Holland Harper of Paris, {{the county seat}} of Lamar County in northeast Texas, who trailed with 4,689 (39.9 percent). In the ensuing general election on November 2, 2010, Cain unseated the six-term Democratic Representative Mark S. Homer, also of Paris. Homer had narrowly won reelection in 2008 over the Republican Kirby Hollingsworth of Mount Vernon. Cain received 19,974 votes (56.6 percent) to 14,645 (41.5 percent). The remaining 665 ballots (1.9 percent) went to the Libertarian nominee, J. Douglas Froneberger. Prior to his election, Cain had listed his legislative priorities as the reduction of state spending and taxation, protection of property and Second Amendment rights, halting illegal immigration, {{the passage of a}} voter <b>identification</b> <b>bill,</b> and the creation of new jobs economic development. Cain serves on the House Corrections and Government Efficiency & Reform committees. [...] Late in 2010, even before Cain took office, Representative Bryan Hughes of Mineola in Wood County, claimed that Larry Phillips, a lawmaker from Sherman, told Hughes that the conservative Cain and neighboring Representative Dan Flynn of Van, Texas, would be redistricted for the 2012 elections because they had declined to commit to the second-term reelection of Speaker Joe Straus, a moderate Republican from San Antonio. In a hearing before the House Ethics Committee, chaired by another East Texas representative, Chuck Hopson of Jacksonville, an ally of Speaker Straus, Phillips denied having made such a claim to Hughes. Neither Hughes nor Phillips taped the conversation. No judgment was made by the committee {{because of the lack of}} corroborating witnesses.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 This {{research}} {{was designed to}} evaluate the Fatty Acid Signature (FAS) technique as a non-lethal alternative to more traditional, and sometimes destructive, methods of studying the diet composition of piscivorous birds. Specifically we tested the technique with Caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia) which currently nest in large numbers in the Columbia River estuary and are known to consume juvenile salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.) listed under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. From captive feeding trials conducted with Caspian tern chicks, we determined that FASs of the birds reflected differences in their diets. After 20 days of being fed consistently mixed or monotypic diets of two fish types, chicks displayed different adipose tissue FASs between all 4 diet treatments. When diets were changed, adipose tissue FASs reflected the shift in diet treatments within two weeks. Fatty acid (FA) - specific calibration coefficients (FA level in the consumer divided by FA level in the food) were calculated for Caspian terns fed monotypic diets for 34 days; some calibration coefficients varied in association with diet and age of the terns, and also differed between terns and common murres (Uria aalge), whose calibration coefficients were measured in a separate study. Variation in FA-specific calibration coefficients may be problematic for obtaining accurate estimates of diet composition in piscivorous birds using the Quantitative Fatty Acid Signature (QFASA) technique. We advocate sensitivity analysis to test whether the QFASA models are robust to the magnitude of variation in calibration coefficients detected in this study. FASs differed among the 3 major fish prey types observed in diets of Caspian terns nesting in the Columbia River estuary during the 2003 breeding season: juvenile salmonids, surf smelt (Hypomesus pretiosus), and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). We detected differences in FASs of nesting Caspian terns between early and late in the nesting season of 2003; these differences were associated with a shift in diet compostion from a diet dominated by juvenile salmonids to a diet dominated by northern anchovy. The FASs of several species of juvenile salmonids, however, exhibited little inter-specific variation, especially between species raised in hatcheries, which comprise the majority of smolts consumed by Caspian terns in the estuary. We found levels of highly-unsaturated FAs (HUFAs) to be higher in wild steelhead smolts than in hatchery-reared steelhead smolts, but HUFA levels in terns did not reflect the changing prevalence of wild steelhead in their diets. This is likely due to contribution of HUFAs to the diets of terns from marine forage fishes. Thus, HUFAs {{do not appear to}} be useful indicators of wild steelhead in the diets of these birds. If the QFASA technique can be validated, it has the potential to provide general information on diet composition for piscivorous birds foraging on broadly different prey types over extended periods. However, due to similarities in FASs of key prey types consumed by Caspian terns in the Columbia River estuary, namely salmonids, obtaining the precise estimates of diet composition and consumption of different species of salmonids that are requested by resource managers does not seem feasible using the QFASA technique alone. Consequently, more traditional methods of diet composition analysis for Caspian terns (<b>bill</b> load <b>identification,</b> stomach contents analysis) can not be replaced by the FAS analysis technique...|$|R
