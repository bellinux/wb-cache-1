40|$|In mineral {{processing}} the mill power {{plays a major}} role in the economics of the process and is a critical design criterion. The mill power is influenced by a range of parameters such as: charge and slurry filling, number <b>and</b> geometry of <b>lifters,</b> <b>and</b> mill speed. Deriving the optimum conditions of these parameters should lead to efficient mill operation. Additionally, the optimum utilization of the impact loads that are affected by charge and slurry filling, number of lifters, geometry of <b>lifter</b> <b>and</b> mill speed should result in increased milling efficiency. In this work the influence of these operating parameters were investigated using a laboratory experimental mill. It is found that the power, are affected by number of lifters, lifter height, mill charge and mill speed. Overall the results showed that increasing the mill velocity, number of <b>lifters,</b> <b>and</b> height of <b>lifter</b> <b>and</b> significantly decreasing the mill charge filling results in a higher impact value and impact frequency that may also increase overall efficiency. A simple linear regression relationship has been demonstrated for mill power as a function of <b>lifter</b> spacing (S/H) <b>and</b> mill speed. These parameters give an indication of the possible optimum mill operating conditions in an idealised condition...|$|R

50|$|The LA 318 was a 318 cu in (5.2 L) {{relative}} of the A 318. Like the A 318, it has a larger cylinder bore at 3.91 in (99.31 mm) {{as well as a}} stroke of 3.31 in (84 mm). It appeared shortly after the 273, in 1967, and proved tremendously successful. A crop duster version of this engine was available until 1991 when it was superseded by the Magnum version (See below). It used hydraulic <b>lifters</b> <b>and</b> a two barrel carburetor for most of its production, though four-barrel Carter Thermo-Quad and Rochester Quadrajet carburetors were used in police applications starting in 1978. The 318 received roller <b>lifters</b> <b>and</b> a fast-burn cylinder head in 1985. Throttle-body electronic fuel injection was factory equipment on the 1981-1983 Imperial.
