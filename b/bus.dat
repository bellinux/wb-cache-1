5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is {{a computer}} system with multiple identical processors that share memory and connect via a <b>bus.</b> <b>Bus</b> contention prevents <b>bus</b> architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs generally do not comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for <b>bus</b> bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E

30|$|In the following, a {{total of}} 66 <b>BuSs</b> from Germany will be {{included}} in the analysis. Additionally, a reference group has to be defined to calculate the J-factor. For this reference group, we included all those <b>BuSs</b> which were analysed as part of the CHE research performance evaluation published in 2011. CHE’s original data basis goes beyond the <b>BuSs</b> mentioned in the CHE publications (see Berghoff et al. 2011) because this data basis includes all <b>BuSs</b> in German-speaking countries, i.e. also those in Austria and Switzerland. To obtain a larger reference group, we also included these <b>BuSs</b> in the reference group.|$|R
30|$|We finally {{consider}} whether <b>BuSs</b> classified as strong in research or reputable {{can be identified}} in the partial ratings of the individual indicators. Therefore, we make use of three studies: the investigation of <b>BuSs</b> strong in research by CHE and Handelsblatt {{as well as the}} survey of reputable <b>BuSs</b> by CHE. According to CHE, a <b>BuSs</b> is designated strong in research if it belongs to the top group in four out of eight partial ratings of different research performance indicators. For partial ratings on the basis of absolute figures, the top group is determined by those <b>BuSs</b> with the highest values which generate a cumulative 50 % of the total sum of the respective indicator values. In the four relative performance ratings, the 25 % best <b>BuSs</b> are included in the top group. To counteract any distortions due to the data collection methods, we considered all <b>BuSs</b> as being strong in research which had been among the top groups at least twice in the last three surveys.|$|R
5|$|Between 1989 and 1994, Lam Tin MTR Station, Laguna City and Pik Wan Road were built. To serve these newly {{populated}} areas, {{three new}} <b>bus</b> termini were constructed: Lam Tin MTR <b>Bus</b> Terminus, now commonly named Lam Tin <b>Bus</b> Terminus as {{shown on the}} wall painting of the terminus; Laguna City <b>Bus</b> Terminus, which took up routes originally terminating at Kwun Tong Ferry; and Kwong Tin <b>Bus</b> Terminus, with new routes initiated to serve exclusively Lam Tin and the area nearby.|$|E

30|$|It becomes {{apparent}} {{that more than}} 50 % of the CHE strong in research <b>BuSs</b> are represented in the partial ratings of the h-, g-, and e-indexes {{as well as in}} the partial ratings of the two supportive indicators. With respect to the Handelsblatt classification, more than 50 % of these <b>BuSs</b> can be found in the three above-mentioned citation index indicators. The reputable <b>BuSs</b> are also represented in all three citation index indicators with over 67 %. In addition, slightly more than 50 % of the reputable <b>BuSs</b> are listed in the partial ratings of the international research publications per researcher and the citations per paper. With respect to the citation metrics, strong relations emerge between the top 25 % rankings for the h-, g-, and e-index and all three <b>BuSs</b> classifications taken into consideration. It is not particularly surprising to discover that this is the case for all three partial ratings of these citation index indicators. Nevertheless, the large number of <b>BuSs</b> either strong in research or reputable is astonishing. For the citations per paper, and especially for the J-factor, however, a different picture emerges, as there are only a few of the classified <b>BuSs</b> in these two partial ratings.|$|R
