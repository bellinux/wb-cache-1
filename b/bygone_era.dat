5|$|The economy {{continued}} in muted form. The three main establishment families on the island, the Moodys, the Sealys, and Kempners, had essentially unrivalled {{control of the}} island. The Splash Day celebrations restarted, drawing tourists to the coast. Many hotels, banks, and some insurance companies remained as did the medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals. Efforts at historical preservation (notably including those of George P. Mitchell) gradually helped to re-establish the island's tourism industry, though in a very different form from the past. Nonbinding referenda were put forward in the 1980s regarding legalization of casinos in the city but were defeated by the voters each time, demonstrating the changes in the city since the <b>bygone</b> <b>era.</b> However informal polls in 2008 and 2010 indicate this sentiment may be changing. Indeed gambling aboard cruise ships leaving from Galveston is now commonplace.|$|E

25|$|This {{feature of}} {{football}} is uncouth, unfair and {{a relic of}} a long <b>bygone</b> <b>era...</b> The proper disposition of this fluke play {{is to change the}} rules so that the ball shall be put down for scrimmage at the point where a fumble is recovered by the side recovering the fumble and no run allowed. If the fumble is recovered behind an opponent's goal line the ball shall be put in play at the point where it was fumbled.|$|E
25|$|Later in the Victorian period, the Regency {{seemed to}} retreat to an unthreateningly remote {{historical}} distance, and Kate Greenaway and the Artistic Dress movement selectively revived elements of early 19th century fashions. During the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, many genre paintings, sentimental valentines, etc. contained loose depictions of 1795–1820 styles (then considered to be quaint relics of a <b>bygone</b> <b>era).</b> In the late 1960s / early 1970s, there was a limited fashion revival of the Empire silhouette.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-to-late 2000s {{the dot-com}} losses were recouped and eclipsed by a {{combination}} of events, including the 2000s commodities boom and the United States housing bubble. However, the recession of 2007 onward wiped out these gains. The second market slump brought the phrase back into the public eye, where it was much used in hindsight, to characterize the excesses of the <b>bygone</b> <b>era.</b> In 2006, upon Greenspan's retirement from the Federal Reserve Board, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart held a full-length farewell show in his honor, named An Irrationally Exuberant Tribute to Alan Greenspan.|$|E
25|$|Ricketts' lab on Cannery Row had {{attracted}} visitors {{who ran the}} gamut from writers, artists and musicians to prostitutes and bums. Gatherings often included discussions of philosophy, science and art, and sometimes developed into parties that continued for days. Participants in meetings had included Steinbeck, Bruce Ariss, Joseph Campbell (who had worked at the lab as Ricketts' assistant), Adelle Davis, Henry Miller, Lincoln Steffens and Francis Whitaker. Amidst the tumult of commercial activity and tourist attractions that Cannery Row has become in recent decades, the modest and mostly unnoticed and unmarked lab stands as a silent witness to the <b>bygone</b> <b>era</b> celebrated in Steinbeck's work.|$|E
25|$|During this {{transition}} period and beyond, various groups of former Kuroda bushi held sporadic meetings and training sessions {{in memory of}} the now <b>bygone</b> <b>era.</b> The old bushi present at these sessions included Uchida Ryogoro, Shiraishi Hanjiro and many of the former Dangyo (instructors) of the Kuroda clan. Due to newfound cooperation between the surviving SMR-lineages there were several joint-licenses of the Haruyoshi and Jigyo-branches of SMR issued in the late 19th century. Shiraishi Hanjiro was one of those men who received a full Menkyo Kaiden license. By the end of the Meiji era, (1912), only Shiraishi was still active as a fully qualified exponent and dedicated teacher of the last two remaining Kuroda Jō lineages.|$|E

25|$|Kothi Khas Bagh is {{a palace}} located at Rampur, about 30km east of Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. It was the {{erstwhile}} {{residence of the}} Nawabs of Rampur. Set in a 300-acre compound, this huge 200-room European style palace is a unique blend of Islamic architecture and British architecture. It also features personal apartments and offices, music rooms and personal cinema hall of Nawabs. The huge halls, adorned with Burma teak and Belgium glass chandeliers, present a fine specimen of the architecture of a <b>bygone</b> <b>era.</b> There is an Italian marble staircase towards the main bedrooms. The statue of Kalb Ali Khan, the second Nawab of Rampur, is an eye-catching one. Kothi Khas Bagh {{is now in a}} dilapidated state due to the age and neglect.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} Magyarization {{did not succeed}} in {{imposing}} the Hungarian language as the most used language in all territories in the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact the profoundly multinational character of historic Transylvania was reflected in the fact that during the fifty years of the dual monarchy, the spread of Hungarian as the second language remained limited. In 1880, 5.7% of the non-Hungarian population, or 109,190 people, claimed to have a knowledge of the Hungarian language; the proportion rose to 11% (183,508) in 1900, and to 15.2% (266,863) in 1910. These figures reveal the reality of a <b>bygone</b> <b>era,</b> one in which millions of people could conduct their lives without speaking the state's official language. The policies of Magyarization aimed to have a Hungarian language surname as a requirement for access to basic government services such as local administration, education, and justice.|$|E
25|$|Following completion, {{the park}} quickly slipped into decline. One {{of the main}} reasons for this was the lack of {{interest}} from the Tammany Hall political machine, which was the largest political force in New York at the time. Around the turn of the 20th century, the park faced several new challenges. Cars were becoming commonplace, bringing with them their burden of pollution, and people's attitudes were beginning to change. No longer were parks to be used only for walks and picnics in an idyllic environment but also for sports and similar recreation. Following the dissolution of the Central Park Commission in 1870 and Andrew Green's departure from the project, and Vaux's death in 1895, the maintenance effort gradually declined. All of this changed in 1934, when Republican Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor of New York City and unified the five park-related departments then in existence. Robert Moses was given the task of cleaning up the park. Moses, about {{to become one of the}} most powerful men in New York City, took over what was essentially a relic, a leftover from a <b>bygone</b> <b>era.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Franklin Smith {{travelled}} Europe extensively {{during his}} lifetime, studying the great architectural achievements and art from <b>bygone</b> <b>eras.</b> For one hundred years, the United States had directed its efforts toward industrial and commercial development while neglecting cultural development.

5000|$|Dennis Harvey of Variety {{wrote that}} the film [...] "takes true trash cinema devotion to satirize the clunky visuals, banal dialogue, logic gaps and pseudoscientific silliness of a <b>bygone</b> <b>era’s</b> schlockiest obscurities quite so accurately, {{complete}} with one-beat-tardy editorial rhythms". Ed Gonzales and Jeremiah Kipp, writing for Slant Magazine, said that the [...] "perilously low budget plays to Lost Skeletons advantage, and the scant 90-minute running time assures that it doesn’t wear out its welcome".|$|R

500|$|Other critics' enthusiasm was {{somewhat}} tempered. For instance, Stephen Holden of The New York Times lauded its visuals and its evocation of a <b>bygone</b> <b>era</b> but felt that [...] "the monochromatic variations on sepia keep {{the actors and}} their adventures at a refined aesthetic distance ... At times the film is hard to see. And as the action accelerates, the wonder of its visual concept starts giving way to sci-fi clichés".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, a {{line from}} the song [...] "America""All gone to look for America"began {{appearing}} spray-painted on vacant buildings and abandoned factories in the town of Saginaw, Michigan, which is mentioned in the song.

500|$|On 15 September 1935, {{one year}} after the death of Reich President Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler's {{elevation}} to the position of Führer, the dual flag arrangement was ended, with the exclusive use of the Nazi flag as the national flag of Germany. One reason may have been the [...] "Bremen incident" [...] of 26 July 1935, in which a group of demonstrators in New York City boarded the ocean liner SS Bremen, tore the Nazi Party flag from the jackstaff, and tossed it into the Hudson River. When the German ambassador protested, US officials responded that the German national flag had not been harmed, only a political party symbol. The new flag law was announced at the annual party rally in Nuremberg, where Hermann Göring claimed the old black-white-red flag, while honoured, was the symbol of a <b>bygone</b> <b>era</b> and under threat of being used by [...] "reactionaries".|$|E

5000|$|Artist Buckley Mac-Gurrin, an {{art critic}} for the {{literary}} film magazine Script published by writer and artist Rob Wagner, wrote in a cover story of Politi in 1940 that “Leo became proficient {{in the use of}} many media - oil, watercolor, wood-carving, wood engraving, lithography, book illustration; he had a very fine artistic education. His training was modern as opposed to academic; it tended to develop originality rather than subservient to the art forms of <b>bygone</b> <b>eras.</b> His own artistic philosophy drew him toward the genuine and the earthy; toward people whose contact with the soil was still fresh, intimate, satisfying.” ...|$|R
500|$|Getzein's {{record for}} {{complete}} games {{is based in}} part on the customs of the 1880s. [...] In 1915, Baseball Magazine reported that managers were not allowed to freely pull the starting pitcher from a game in the <b>bygone</b> <b>era.</b> [...] It cited an incident involving Getzein to illustrate the old practice:"The Nationals got onto Getzein in the fourth inning and batted him all over the field. In the fifth inning they kept up the slugging until Getzein said he was ill, and Manager Hanlon wanted the Nationals to allow Getzein to retire, claiming that he was too sick to play. Baker, captaining the home club, said he would call a doctor and have him examine Getzein, and if the latter was really sick he would probably allow the change to be made. Dr. Bond, who happened to be present, was called on, and he examined the pitcher, while the crowd guyed Getzein terribly. The doctor announced that he did not consider Getzein sick, only discouraged at the pounding he had received, and that {{he would be able to}} finish the game." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{photos on}} the album were taken by Michael Maggid, a friend of Morrison's then wife Janet Planet, {{in the town of}} Fairfax. The {{original}} LP was released in a gatefold sleeve. The cover photograph showed Planet, riding bareback on a horse, with Morrison walking alongside. The gatefold and back cover photographs showed Morrison perched upon the fence of the horse's paddock, with his wife standing to his right and a black-and-white kitten on the fence to his left. [...] This rural setting depicting a <b>bygone</b> <b>era</b> was in vogue on album covers at the time as rock artists moved from cities to rural communities. [...] The Band, CSNY and Grateful Dead had similar themes on album covers in 1969 and 1970. [...] Morrison later complained of the cover, explaining that, [...] "The picture was taken at a stable and I didn't live there. We just went there and took the picture and split. A lot of people seem to think that album covers are your life or something." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Your Sinclair rated the game within the top fifth of their top 100 ZX Spectrum games. The {{magazine}} said that Underwurlde {{was the most}} simultaneously loved and hated game of its era—though Sabreman's invulnerability to direct damage was novel, the Your Sinclair also recalled the game's [...] "stratospheric level of frustration". Their readers, however, ranked the game {{near the bottom of}} their top 100 games for the platform. Underwurlde was later included in the 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation Rare Replay, wherein critics rated it among the worst of the 30 titles by Ultimate Play the Game and its successor, Rare. Kyle Hilliard (Game Informer) wrote that Ultimate's early games, such as Underwurlde, fared the worst in the package, though he was glad they were included. [...] "By today's standards," [...] began New Zealand newspaper The Nelson Mail, [...] "the likes of ...

2500|$|Rob Lineberger of DVD Verdict said, [...] "The {{direction}} is sometimes uncertain, but Highlander: The Series gives viewers something unique and inspiring.

[...] Lineberger added, [...] "These actors, writers, producers, directors, and crew delivered one of television's great successes, particularly in the fantasy genre. Highlander: The Series took us to places we otherwise could not have gone, and did so with intelligence, style, and wit."
