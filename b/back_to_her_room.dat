25|$|One weekend, Shaista is {{kidnapped by}} a chauffeur posing {{as the one}} sent by her uncle to take her home. That night there is another murder in the Sports Pavilion, where Miss Vansittart is found dead, having been coshed. Many of the girls go home, but the {{resourceful}} Julia, who has been pondering the exchange of the racquets, takes her racquet <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> and discovers gems in the hollowed-out handle. She hears someone at the door who quietly turns the knob and attempts to enter. Julia places furniture against the door to prevent entry and is ready to scream out loud but the person who turned the knob leaves, identity unknown. The following day Julia flees the school {{to tell her story}} to Hercule Poirot, of whose career she learned from a friend of her mother. The police focus on the newcomer, Miss Blanche, who knows the identity of the murderer. She is killed for attempting blackmail. With three unsolved murders and the school hemorrhaging fearful students, Poirot arrives.|$|E
2500|$|Sadie, frightened {{because she}} heard noises, is waiting in Davidson's room. [...] Davidson is shocked and sends her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b> [...] The last reel is missing, but {{fishermen}} find Davidson's body. He has committed suicide. Sadie and O'Hara reconcile {{and head for}} Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{aspects of}} Kiki's {{behavior}} and appearance {{have been the}} focus of commentary. One major theme is Kiki's transition into adulthood. While being raised by loving parents who support her independence, [...] Kiki is faced with problems common in adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself. The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling noted a scene during Kiki's first night away from home, staying with the bakers: [...] Early in the morning, she quickly steps out of her room into the outhouses and peers out to see the husband, Fukuo, stretching his muscles. After he leaves the scene, Kiki rushes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> and slams the door behind her while gasping for air. [...] "The scene does absolutely nothing to advance the plot and the humor in it is low...but...it wordlessly — and eloquently — expresses Kiki's youth, vulnerability, and isolation." ...|$|E
60|$|The conspirators had a jolly supper, and one Beugnot, {{a friend}} of Jeanne, not {{conscious}} of the plot, escorted the Baronne d'Oliva <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>rooms</b> in Paris.|$|R
60|$|He {{carried her}} letter {{with him to}} Cicely's wedding, and they all noticed with {{pleasure}} a new buoyancy in his walk and bearing, a keener light in his eyes, and the old true ring in his voice. There was never a shadow of envy in his heart as he watched Drexley's happiness. Joan and he saw them off at Charing Cross for the Continent, and they walked <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>rooms</b> together.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{she heard}} the door shut <b>to</b> behind <b>her,</b> she ran up the stairs <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room</b> with all speed, like a frightened hare.|$|R
60|$|She crept <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room,</b> a small timorous {{figure in}} white.|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{he must be}} an artist. Miss Martha {{took the}} picture <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{got up and}} went. Defeat was {{apparent}} enough, although it was unexpected. Lois stole back to the house--stole <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> and locked the door.|$|E
60|$|As fast she ran <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room,</b> ordered off Pauline to help Master Martindale's nurse, {{and flung}} herself into her chair, {{in a wild}} fit of passion.|$|R
60|$|At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, {{and nodded}} {{before he turned}} the corner. The old lady smilingly {{returned}} his salutation, and, closing the door, went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room.</b>|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} the {{servants}} and gillies had gathered, hastily clad; they were met by Logan, who briefly bade some bring hammers, and the caber, or pine-tree trunk that is tossed in Highland sports. It would make a good battering-ram. Donald Macdonald he sent at once to Mr. Macrae. He met Bude and Lady Bude, and rapidly explained that there was no danger of fire. The Countess went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>rooms,</b> Bude returned with Logan into the observatory. Here they found Donald telegraphing to the conspirators, by the wireless engine, a message dictated by Merton: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, then," [...] said Anne, quickly, [...] "I {{must give}} it up!" [...] And {{she turned away}} with a rapid step, to carry her texts <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} prevail on Lady Glyde to go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room,</b> {{but it was}} useless. She stopped in the passage, with {{the look of a}} woman whose mind was panic-stricken.|$|E
60|$|She {{would not}} go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> just yet. She knew {{that she could not}} rest. Though the room was empty there seemed {{something}} of him still in it, even in its cold and deserted aspect.|$|E
60|$|She {{walked to}} the door and stood uneasily {{listening}} in the passage until she heard the clatter of hoofs in the paved patio, and knew that he had ordered his horse. Then she turned <b>back</b> relieved <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|A vague foreboding of evil overcame her. She stole {{down the}} stairs in the blank dark and took the letter without a word from the half-dressed and {{wondering}} butler. Then she glided <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room,</b> sat down eagerly by the dressing-table, {{and began to read}} it.|$|R
50|$|Predators - Danny drives Ally to {{work and}} runs into a female snake demon. The snake demon invites him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> hotel <b>room</b> and once there she robs Danny. Since Brad is at the movies, Ally is at work, and Pat is sleeping, Danny is forced to ask Seth for help.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, with a weary contempt. [...] "It's dull {{enough of}} {{me not to}} {{understand}} you by this time. Send word upstairs when I am wanted." [...] She left him, and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{hope for}} me anywhere," [...] she sobbed to herself. [...] "Every man's hand is against me. I have only one true friend, and he is far away." [...] She went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> utterly disheartened and dispirited.|$|E
6000|$|Anne went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room,</b> {{and waited}} near the open door--ready to close and fasten it {{instantly}} if any thing occurred to alarm her. [...] "How changed I am!" [...] {{she thought to}} herself. [...] "Every thing frightens me, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, in her lowest voice, [...] "as a dear friend. But {{remember}} that I expect a friend's generosity and a friend's forbearance." [...] And so she made <b>her</b> way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room,</b> and appeared at breakfast in her usual sober guise, but with eyes that told no tales.|$|R
60|$|She went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room,</b> {{and tried}} to prepare herself for bed. But who could sleep--sleep! who could lie passively down, distracted by such terrors? They came upon her more and more {{strongly}} yet. Half undressed, and with her hair in wild disorder, she flew to the old man's bedside, clasped him by the wrist, and roused him from his sleep.|$|R
60|$|Her father {{seized a}} candle that was flaming on the ground--someone {{had put it}} down there, and {{forgotten}} it--and came running upstairs with such fury, that Florence, in her fear, had hardly time to fly before him. She heard him striking in the door, as she ran on, with her hands widely spread, and her hair streaming, and her face like a distracted person's, <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{was still}} gazing upward {{when a man}} {{approached}} her and said the stage for Oak Creek Canyon would soon be ready to start, {{and he wanted to}} know if her baggage was ready. Carley hurried <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> to pack.|$|E
60|$|She {{passed on}} to her room with a {{malicious}} smile. Estella shrank back against the wall, humiliated and baffled. When she found herself alone, she crawled <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> and threw herself face downward on the bed, praying that she might die.|$|E
60|$|When {{presently}} {{she brought}} me <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room,</b> the dead Queen {{was dressed in}} the robe of fine linen with the embroidery of gold; and all her beautiful jewels were in place. Candles were lit around her, and white flowers lay upon her breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me stay here," [...] he begged, [...] "if it's only an attic. There may be {{work to be}} done. Let me stay, sir. My {{little bit}} of life is of no more account to me than a snap of the fingers. Don't send me away. Julia's a woman--they won't hurt her. She can go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> old <b>rooms.</b> The streets are quite orderly. Let me stay, sir!" ...|$|R
60|$|Thus they waited, and {{she went}} <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b> The baby's frock, shoes, and socks, which had been lying on {{a chair at the}} time of his death, she would not now have removed, though Jude would fain have got them out of her sight. But {{whenever}} he touched them she implored him to let them lie, and burst out almost savagely at the woman of the house when she also attempted to put them away.|$|R
5000|$|Later in {{the night}} Jane arrives <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> hotel <b>room</b> <b>to</b> find Dorothy sitting on her bed in a red wig and punk style clothes smoking a cigarette. Dorothy {{introduces}} herself as [...] "Mary"; she is very loud, obnoxious and loves to drink. There is then {{a snapshot of the}} three teenagers who were in the car that ran Jane off the road discussing going to a party where everyone bar the three teenagers are wearing masks.|$|R
60|$|I {{did then}} what {{might seem to}} be a callous thing. I left them all {{crowding}} around the body of the dead man. I let even Felicia be led <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> by her companion. I took the lift downstairs, and I made my way into the cafe.|$|E
60|$|Sadly I {{took her}} away, <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room,</b> realizing {{that we had}} been too eager. We had oppressed her with the exotic, the magnificent. She was too old and too feeble to enjoy as we had hoped she would enjoy, the color and music and thronging streets of The Magic City.|$|E
60|$|She {{came down}} to breakfast, dark under the eyes and no whit {{advanced}} toward decision. Neither of them mentioned their last night's talk, and Gyp went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> to busy herself with dress, after those weeks away. It was past noon when, at a muffled knock, she found Markey outside her door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Her own, to be sure. Between {{twelve and}} three, on the Thursday morning, {{she must have}} slipped down to your young lady's room, to settle the hiding of the Moonstone while {{all the rest of}} you were in bed. In going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room,</b> <b>her</b> nightgown must have brushed the wet paint on the door. She couldn't wash out the stain; and she couldn't safely destroy the night-gown without first {{providing}} another like it, to make the inventory of her linen complete." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{turned and}} left the house. Going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room</b> {{was out of the}} question. The servant (as Magdalen knew by not hearing the door close) was looking after her; and, moreover, she would expose herself, if she went indoors, to the risk of going out again exactly at the time when the landlady's {{children}} were sure to be about the house. She turned mechanically to the right, walked on until she recalled Vauxhall Bridge, and waited there, looking out over the river.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} struggle in Emily for self-command. She {{was obliged to}} find support in a chair. The returning richness of color, excited by her walk, vanished; but recovering herself, she pressed the hand of her anxious guardian, and, gently waving <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> proceeded <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own <b>room.</b>|$|R
