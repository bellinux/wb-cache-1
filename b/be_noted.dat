5|$|It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} figure above for Chongqing's Administrative Area {{includes}} the entire Municipality of Chongqing whereas the City Population only counts the urbanized districts making up Chongqing city. Thus {{the population of the}} administrative area shown will be significantly larger. Chengdu is similar.|$|E

40|$|Effect of {{different}} growth media and basal injuries on {{the propagation of}} olive through hardwood cuttings was investigated at Agricultural Research Institute, Tarnab Peshawar Pakistan during Spring- 2002. The results revealed that maximum number of days to sprouting was taken in control while minimum number of days to sprouting <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> in 3 times injuries. Maximum sprouting percentage, number of shoots and leaves were recorded in 2 injuries. Minimum sprouting percentage, number of shoots and leaves <b>were</b> <b>noted</b> in control treatment. Maximum survival percentage <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> in 1 cut treatment while minimum survival percentage was recorded in 3 injuries and maximum shoot length was recorded in 3 cut while minimum shoot length <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> in control. Similarly maximum days to sprouting <b>were</b> <b>noted</b> in farmyard manure while minimum were observed in sand media. Maximum sprouting percentage, number of shoots <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> in clay media while minimum sprouting percentage and number of shoots <b>were</b> <b>noted</b> in farmyard manure. Maximum survival percentage, shoot length and number of leaves <b>were</b> <b>noted</b> in sand media while minimum survival percentage, shoot length and number of leaves were found in farmyard manure...|$|R
5|$|Symptoms in PID {{range from}} none to severe. If there are symptoms, then fever, {{cervical}} motion tenderness, lower abdominal pain, new or different discharge, painful intercourse, uterine tenderness, adnexal tenderness, or irregular menstruation may <b>be</b> <b>noted.</b>|$|E
5|$|The HSV W427 will <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> in TWR / HSV {{history as}} the only car to which Tom Walkinshaw 'personally' {{attached}} his name.

5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday, 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts to protect the rights to the throne of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants to the throne. It should, however, <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} is the most {{populated}} of Extremadura, it has a relatively low population density (102.30 hab/km²), due to the extension of its municipality, {{one of the largest}} in Spain, with an area of 1,470km². It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that in addition to the metropolitan centre the population includes districts, neighborhoods and towns with small populations, the most populous of which is Guadiana del Caudillo, which had 2,524 people as of 2012, but gained independence on 17 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|As for tournaments {{where only}} one of the Big Four has competed, this is the only {{category}} where {{the rest of the field}} has a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, it must <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just one of them has competed.|$|E

5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur. It should also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|As with FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the {{developers}} of DragonFly BSD are slowly replacing K style C code with more modern, ANSI equivalents. Similar to other operating systems, DragonFly's {{version of the}} GNU Compiler Collection has an enhancement called the Stack-Smashing Protector (ProPolice) enabled by default, providing some additional protection against buffer overflow based attacks. It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that , the kernel is no longer built with this protection by default.|$|E
5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E
50|$|Nematode parasites in {{the genus}} Acuaria have <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b> Adult birds have few predators {{although}} bats (Megaderma lyra) and wintering Asio flammeus have <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to prey on them.|$|R
5|$|Helpers, {{offspring}} {{from the}} previous brood, have sometimes <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to assist in feeding the fledglings at the nest of their parents. Cases of brood parasitism by the Asian koel have <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b> An average breeding success of 44% has <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> with {{the main cause of}} fledgling mortality being shortage of insect food which in turn was dependent on rainfall.|$|R
30|$|Two {{distinct}} {{patterns of}} {{distribution of the}} hypo-autofluorescent lesions <b>were</b> <b>noted</b> on FAF imaging. The majority of eyes (5 out of 8; 62.5  %) demonstrated macular and extra-macular areas of hypo-autofluorescence. Placoid hypo-autofluorescence involving the macula <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> in one eye. The remaining eyes showed peripapillary areas of hypo-autofluorescence. Unlike the FAF, no consistent pattern of visual field defects <b>was</b> <b>noted</b> on GVF.|$|R
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It should also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that {{they appear to be}} sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|In addition, other {{characters}} have supporting roles {{in this game}} as well. Lakitu reprises {{his role as the}} referee, helping racers in various situations such as announcing laps, giving the signal to drive with its traffic lights hanging on a fishing pole, and taking characters back on track in case they fall off course. Other supporting characters appearing in this game include Shy Guys, Goombas, Nokis, Toadsworth, Piantas, Chain Chomps, Piranha Plants and more. It should also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that this is the very first time that Toadette has appeared in the Mario franchise.|$|E
5|$|Indian women {{negotiate}} survival {{through an}} array of oppressive patriarchal family structures: age, ordinal status, relationship to men through family of origin, marriage and procreation as well as patriarchal attributes. Examples of patriarchal attributes include: dowry, siring sons etc., kinship, caste, community, village, market and the state. It should however <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that several communities in India, such as the Nairs of Kerala, Shettys of Mangalore, certain Maratha clans, and Bengali families exhibit matriarchal tendencies. In these communities, {{the head of the}} family is the oldest woman rather than the oldest man. Sikh culture is also regarded as relatively gender-neutral.|$|E
