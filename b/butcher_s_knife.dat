Tendrils are contact-sensitive, filamentous organs that permit climbing plants to tether to their taller neighbors. Tendrilled legume species are grown as field crops, where the tendrils {{contribute to the}} physical support of the crop prior to harvest. The homeotic tendril-less (tl) mutation in garden pea (Pisum sativum), identified almost a century ago, transforms tendrils into leaflets. In this study, we used a systematic marker screen of fast neutron?generated tl deletion mutants to identify Tl as a Class I homeodomain leucine zipper (HDZIP) transcription factor. We confirmed the tendril-less phenotype as loss of function by targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING) in garden pea and by analysis of the tendril-less phenotype of the t mutant in sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus). The conversion of tendrils into leaflets in both mutants demonstrates that the pea tendril is a modified leaflet, inhibited from completing laminar development by Tl. We provide {{evidence to show that}} lamina inhibition requires Unifoliata/LEAFY-mediated Tl expression in organs emerging in the distal region of the leaf primordium. Phylogenetic analyses show that Tl is an unusual Class I HDZIP protein and that tendrils evolved either once or twice in Papilionoid legumes. We suggest that tendrils arose in the Fabeae clade of Papilionoid legumes through acquisition of the Tl gene. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2001 Academic Press. All rights reserved. A mutant form of {{the common}} beta-subunit of the GM-CSF, interleukin- 3 (IL 3) and IL 5 receptors is {{activated}} by a 37 residue duplicated segment which includes the WSXWS motif and an adjacent, highly conserved, aliphatic/basic element. Haemopoietic expression of this mutant, hbeta(c) FIDelta, in mice leads to myeloproliferative disease. To examine the mechanism of activation of this mutant we targetted the two conserved motifs in each repeat for mutagenesis. Here we show that this mutant exhibits constitutive activity in BaF-B 03 cells {{in the presence of}} mouse or human GM-CSF receptor alpha-subunit (GMRalpha) and this activity is disrupted by mutations of the conserved motifs in the first repeat. In the presence of these mutations the receptor reverts to an alternative conformation which retains responsiveness to human IL 3 in a CTLL cell line co-expressing the human IL 3 receptor alpha-subunit (hIL 3 Ralpha). Remarkably, the activated conformation is maintained in the presence of substitutions, deletions or replacement of the second repeat. This suggests that activation occurs due to insertion of extra sequence after the WSXWS motif and is not dependent on the length or specific sequence of the insertion. Thus hbeta(c) displays an ability to fold into functional receptor conformations given insertion of up to 37 residues in the membrane-proximal region. Constitutive activation most likely results from a specific conformational change which alters a dormant, inactive receptor complex, permitting functional association with GMRalpha and ligand-independent mitogenic signalling.

50|$|The {{company began}} in 1867 as the William Butcher Steel Works. The {{products}} that founders William Butcher, Jr. (a {{son of the}} founder of W. & <b>S.</b> <b>Butcher</b> Steel Works, a scion of the Sheffield, England steel industry) and Philip Syng Justice (an American manufacturer) planned to produce were cast-steel locomotive tires (that is, in British spelling, tyres) and cast-steel forgings, {{with a plan to}} make eventually a promising new product: steel rails, which would be far superior to older iron ones. At about this time in nearby Bethlehem, the predecessor company of Bethlehem Steel was also getting into the steel rail business. The Nicetown site was chosen because plenty of the anthracite coal that moved by river, canal, and rail from northeast Pennsylvania passed by Nicetown on its way to Port Richmond. Anthracite was superior to bituminous coal for steelmaking. Nicetown's proximity to one of the principal locomotive-building plants of the western hemisphere, the Baldwin Locomotive Works (which at the time was just a few rail-served miles away in the Spring Garden neighborhood), was another benefit of the site.|$|R
50|$|Sati, was {{the first}} wife of Shiva as the first {{incarnation}} of Parvati. She {{was the daughter of}} King Daksha and Queen (the daughter of Brahma). She committed self-immolation at the sacrificial fire of a yagna performed by her father Daksha as she felt seriously distraught by her father’s insult of her husband and also to her by not inviting both of them for the yagna. Shiva was so grieved after hearing of the death of his wife that he danced around the world in a Tandav Nritya (“devastating penance” or dance of destruction) carrying Sati's dead body over his shoulders. Perturbed by this situation and in order to bring Shiv to a state of normalcy, it was then Vishnu who decided to use his Sudarshan Chakra (the rotating <b>knife</b> <b>s</b> carried on his finger tip). He dismembered Sati’s body with the chakra into several pieces and wherever her body fell on the earth, the place was consecrated as a divine shrine oo Shakthi Peeth with deities of Sati (Parvati) and Shiva. These locations have become famous pilgrimage places as Pithas or Shakthi Pithas, and are found scattered all over the subcontinent including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, apart from India. Sati is also known as Devi or Shakthi, and with blessinggs of Vishnu she was reborn as the daughter of Himavat or Himalayas and hence named as Parvati (daughter of mountains). She was born on the 14th day of the bright half of the month of Mrigashīrsha, which marks the Shivarathri (Shiva's night) festival.|$|R
40|$|The Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolysis Evaluation Trial (EPITHET) {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) -diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch predicts the response to thrombolysis. There is no accepted standardized definition of PWI-DWI mismatch. We compared common mismatch definitions in the initial 40 EPITHET patients. Raw perfusion images were used to generate maps of time to peak (TTP), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak of the impulse response (Tmax) and first moment transit time (FMT). DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and PWI volumes were measured with planimetric and thresholding techniques. Correlations between mismatch volume (PWIvol-DWIvol) and DWI expansion (T 2 (Day 90 -vol) -DWI(Acute-vol)) were also assessed. Mean age was 68 +/- 11, time to MRI 4. 5 +/- 0. 7 hours, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 11 (range 4 to 23). Tmax and MTT hypoperfusion volumes were significantly lower than those calculated with TTP and FMT maps (P or = 20 % was observed in 89 % (Tmax) to 92 % (TTP/FMT/MTT) of patients. Application of a + 4 s (relative to the contralateral hemisphere) PWI threshold reduced the frequency of positive mismatch volumes (TTP 73 %/FMT 68 %/Tmax 54 %/MTT 43 %). Mismatch was not significantly different when assessed with ADC maps. Mismatch volume, calculated with all parameters and thresholds, was not significantly correlated with DWI expansion. In contrast, reperfusion was correlated inversely with infarct growth (R=- 0. 51; P= 0. 009). Deconvolution and application of PWI thresholds provide more conservative estimates of tissue at risk and decrease the frequency of mismatch accordingly. The precise definition may not be critical; however, because reperfusion alters tissue fate irrespective of mismatch. K. <b>S.</b> <b>Butcher,</b> M. Parsons, L. MacGregor, P. A. Barber, J. Chalk, C.

40|$|Visual clutter {{concerns}} {{designers of}} user interfaces and information visualizations. This should not surprise visual perception researchers because excess and/or disorganized display items can cause crowding, masking, decreased recognition performance due to occlusion, greater difficulty at both segmenting a scene and performing visual search, and so on. Given a reliable {{measure of the}} visual clutter in a display, designers could optimize display clutter. Furthermore, a measure of visual clutter could help generalize models like Guided Search (J. M. Wolfe, 1994) by providing a substitute for “set size ” more easily computable on more complex and natural imagery. In this article, we present and test several measures of visual clutter, which operate on arbitrary images as input. The first is {{a new version of}} the Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter presented in R. Rosenholtz, Y. Li, S. Mansfield, and Z. Jin (2005). This Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter is based on the analogy that the more cluttered a display or scene is, the more difficult it would be to add a new item that would reliably draw attention. A second measure of visual clutter, Subband Entropy, is based on the notion that clutter is related to the visual information in the display. Finally, we test a third measure, Edge Density, used by M. L. Mack and A. Oliva (2004) as a measure of subjective visual complexity. We explore the use of these measures as stand-ins for set size in visual search models and demonstrate that they correlate well with search performance in complex imagery. This includes the search-in-clutter displays of J. M. Wolfe, A. Oliva, T. <b>S.</b> Horowitz, <b>S.</b> <b>Butcher,</b> and A. Bompas (2002) and Bravo and Farid (2004), as well as new search experiments. An additional experiment suggests that color variability, accounted for by Featur...|$|R
40|$|Background Whether {{intravenous}} {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (alteplase) is eff ective beyond 3 h after onset of acute ischaemic stroke is unclear. We aimed to test whether alteplase given 3 – 6 h after stroke onset promotes reperfusion and attenuates infarct growth in patients who have a mismatch in perfusion-weighted MRI (PWI) and diff usionweighted MRI (DWI). Methods We prospectively and randomly assigned 101 patients to receive alteplase or placebo 3 – 6 h after onset of ischaemic stroke. PWI and DWI were done before and 3 – 5 days after therapy, with T 2 -weighted MRI at around day 90. The primary endpoint was infarct growth between baseline DWI and the day 90 T 2 lesion in mismatch patients. Major secondary endpoints were reperfusion, good neurological outcome, and good functional outcome. Patients, caregivers, and investigators were unaware of treatment allocations. Primary analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00238537. Findings We randomly assigned 52 patients to alteplase and 49 patients to placebo. Mean age was 71 · 6 years, and median score on the National Institutes of Health stroke scale was 13. 85 of 99 (86 %) patients had mismatch of PWI and DWI. The geometric mean infarct growth (exponential of the mean log of relative growth) was 1 · 24 with alteplase and 1 · 78 with placebo (ratio 0 · 69, 95 % CI 0 · 38 – 1 · 28; Student’s t test p= 0 · 239); the median relative infarct growth was 1 · 18 with alteplase and 1 · 79 with placebo (ratio 0 · 66, 0 · 36 – 0 · 92; Wilcoxon’s test p= 0 · 054). Reperfusion was more common with alteplase than with placebo and was associated with less infarct growth (p= 0 · 001), better neurological outcome (p< 0 · 0001), and better functional outcome (p= 0 · 010) than was no reperfusion. Interpretation Alteplase was non-signifi cantly associated with lower infarct growth and signifi cantly associated with increased reperfusion in patients who had mismatch. Because reperfusion was associated with improved clinical outcomes, phase III trials beyond 3 h after treatment are warranted.

40|$|In 1995 Alan Boye, an English {{professor}} at Lyndon State College in Vermont, began a thousand-mile journey on foot retracing {{the steps of}} Little Wolf 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> and Dull <b>Knife</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Northern Cheyennes in 1878 - 1879 that took them from Indian Territory to Montana. The Cheyennes were escaping from deplorable conditions on the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Indian Reservation at Darlington Agency near Fort Reno, Indian Territory. Troops from four federal military departments were eventually placed {{in the field to}} stop them. Fighting their way through Indian Territory and Kansas, the Indians eventually split into two groups in Nebraska. Dull Knife 2 ̆ 7 s followers were captured and taken to Fort Robinson where on 9 January 1879 they made a dramatic escape for freedom rather than return to Indian Territory. By 22 January, almost half of them had perished. Little Wolf made it to Fort Keogh, Montana, where his people remained. By 1900 the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation was created as a result of one of the great odysseys in American history, one that rivaled the Nez Perce and Navajo journeys. Occasionally joined by tribal members, Boye trekked through four states on a modern spiritual journey where time stood still. For the Northern Cheyennes accompanying him, here was a chance to touch the past and experience some of the same world views their ancestors had dwelled in over a century ago. Boye 2 ̆ 7 s spiritual awakening and inspiration are revealed in illuminating prose. The evocative emotion generated by the journey 2 ̆ 7 s magnitude, its sights, {{and the ways in which}} a sense of place can put an individual in touch with touching history is profound. This book is not, however, a scholarly work of history and should not be promoted as such. Although Boye uses government documents to blend historical commentary with his personal experience, his treatment is not comprehensive. He completely misses a number of important manuscript collections from the Walter Camp Papers, the Ellison Collection in the Denver Public Library, and collections in the Kansas State Historical Society. The most visible omission is Thomas Marquis 2 ̆ 7 s 1926 interview with Iron Teeth, which gave history the only firsthand account of the odyssey by a Cheyenne woman. There are also historical errors. There is meager evidence that Little Wolf traveled to Washington with Stone Calf in 1873. Crazy Horse was stabbed, not shot. The endnotes are non-specific in regard to page citations. Much of the historical narrative is offered through the eyes and words of local ranchers and regional history buffs. There is no index or formal bibliography. Alan Boye 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to this important topic is chiefly literary and spiritual. In this he succeeds. As the works of John Neihardt, Bruce Cutler, and Scott Momaday show, there is an important niche for literary efforts that link the saga of the Indian Wars to the present.
