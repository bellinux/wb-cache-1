5|$|Montana Moon (1930), {{an uneasy}} mix of Western clichés and music, teamed her with John Mack Brown and Ricardo Cortez. Although the film had {{problems}} with censors, {{it was a major}} success {{at the time of its}} release. Our <b>Blushing</b> Brides (1930), co-starring Robert Montgomery and Anita Page, was the final installment in the so-called Our Dancing Daughters franchise. It was a greater successboth critically and financiallythan her previous talkies, and became one of her personal favorites.|$|E
5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea, {{commonly}} known as the <b>blushing</b> morel, is a species of ascomycete fungus in the family Morchellaceae. A choice edible species, the fungus was originally described as new to science in 1998 by mycologists Gastón Guzmán and Fidel Tapia from collections made in Veracruz, Mexico. Its distribution was later revealed to be far more widespread after several DNA studies suggested that it is common in the West Coast of the United States, Israel, Australia, and Cyprus.|$|E

25|$|Clinical {{reports of}} the effects of {{consumption}} of plants described as Mandragora autumnalis (Mandragora offinarum s.l.) include severe symptoms similar to those of atropine poisoning, including blurred vision, dilation of the pupils (mydriasis), dryness of the mouth, difficulty in urinating, dizziness, headache, vomiting, <b>blushing</b> and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia). Hyperactivity and hallucinations also occurred in the majority of patients.|$|E

25|$|Anime and manga artists often {{draw from}} a common canon of iconic facial {{expression}} illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts. These techniques are often different in form {{than their counterparts in}} Western animation, and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods. For example, a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused. A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweat drops to depict nervousness, visible <b>blushing</b> for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} rosacea is unknown. Triggers that cause episodes of {{flushing}} and <b>blushing</b> {{play a part}} in its development. Exposure to temperature extremes, strenuous exercise, heat from sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, anxiety, cold wind, and moving to a warm or hot environment from a cold one, such as heated shops and offices during the winter, can each cause the face to become flushed. Certain foods and drinks can also trigger flushing, such as alcohol, foods and beverages containing caffeine (especially hot tea and coffee), foods high in histamines, and spicy foods.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{illustration of}} Lophospermum erubescens appeared in 1830 in The British Flower Garden. The plant {{was at first}} identified as the already known Lophospermum scandens and labelled as such. David Don later {{realized that it was}} a new species, and corrected the error in a subsequent note in The British Flower Garden, describing the illustrated plant as a new species, L.erubescens. Don did not explain the origin of the specific epithet, but erubescens means reddening or <b>blushing</b> in Latin. Don's correction was not always noticed, with the result that the name L.scandens became associated with the illustration of L.erubescens, creating confusion between the two species.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who suffer}} from social anxiety {{disorder}} fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous {{in the presence of}} people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations. People {{who suffer from}} this disorder may behave a certain way or say something and then feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when they are with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or <b>blushing</b> when someone is talking to them.|$|E
25|$|Physiological effects, {{similar to}} those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobics. In adults, it may be tears as well as {{excessive}} sweating, nausea, difficulty breathing, shaking, and palpitations {{as a result of the}} fight-or-flight response. The walk disturbance (where a person is so worried about how they walk that they may lose balance) may appear, especially when passing a group of people. <b>Blushing</b> is commonly exhibited by individuals suffering from social phobia. These visible symptoms further reinforce the anxiety in the presence of others. A 2006 study found that the area of the brain called the amygdala, part of the limbic system, is hyperactive when patients are shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening situations.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} epithet rufobrunnea {{derives from}} the Latin roots ruf- (rufuous, reddish) and brunne- (brown). Vernacular names used for the fungus include [...] "western white morel", [...] "blushing morel", and—accounting {{for the existence of}} subtropical species in the [...] "blushing clade"—"red-brown <b>blushing</b> morel".|$|E
500|$|The Love of the Plants, however, while {{opening up}} the world of botany to the non-specialist and to women in particular, {{reinforced}} conventional gender stereotypes. Darwin's images “remained deeply polarized between the chaste, <b>blushing</b> virgin and the seductive predatory woman, the modest shepherdess and the powerful queen.” ...|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots {{to color}} Mickey's face. According to some art critics, {{this gives the}} {{character}} the appearance of <b>blushing.</b> Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or {{that it is the}} hue associated with a [...] "healthy glow," [...] since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur. Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the <b>blushing</b> interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others {{are quick to point out}} that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.|$|E
500|$|During this {{intercourse}} I {{perceived the}} superiority of Miss Honora Sneyd's capacity ... her sentiments were on all subjects so just and were delivered with such <b>blushing</b> modesty though not without an air of conscious worth as to command attention from every one capable of appreciating female excellence. Her person was graceful her features beautiful and their expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing she said. I was six and twenty and {{now for the first}} time in my life I saw a woman that equalled the picture of perfection which existed in my imagination.|$|E
500|$|Alston {{commented on}} his approach, saying, [...] "I never criticized a player for a mistake on the spot. Whenever I got steamed up about something, I {{always wanted to}} sleep on it and face the {{situation}} with a clear head." [...] Sportswriter Jim Murray said that Alston was [...] "the only guy in the game who could look Billy Graham right in the face without <b>blushing</b> and who would order {{corn on the cob}} in a Paris restaurant." [...] The 1954 Dodgers finished second in the NL as both Gil Hodges and Duke Snider hit at least 40 home runs and registered 130 runs batted in.|$|E
500|$|Another {{suggested}} {{explanation for}} Stegosaurus plates' heavily vascular design is that, when under threat, blood could rush into the plates, {{causing them to}} [...] "blush" [...] which would add a colorful, red warning, [...] "embellishing" [...] the visual threat display. This [...] "blushing capacity", instead of thermoregulatory functions, may be the plates' purpose, though the two functions certainly could have coexisted. That Stegosaurus plates could [...] "blush" [...] has become the predominant interpretation of plate function since the late 20th century, and is even depicted in the popular BBC documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, with the sudden reddening of the plates {{used in conjunction with}} threatening swings of the spiked tail to intimidate and confuse an attacking Allosaurus. Also, this <b>blushing</b> could have been used to attract mates.|$|E
500|$|Daedaleopsis confragosa, {{commonly}} known as the thin walled maze polypore or the <b>blushing</b> bracket, is a species of polypore fungus in the family Polyporaceae. A plant pathogen, it causes a white rot of injured hardwoods, especially willows. The fruit bodies are semicircular and tough, have a concentrically zoned brownish upper surface, and measure up to [...] in diameter. The whitish underside turns gray-brown as the fruit body ages, but bruises pink or red. It is found all year and is common in northern temperate woodlands of eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. The species was first described from Europe in 1791 as a form of Boletus, and has undergone several changes of genus in its taxonomic history. It acquired its current name when Joseph Schröter transferred it to Daedaleopsis in 1888.|$|E
500|$|At their hotel, McNeill's Rangers private Sprigg Lynn was {{directed}} to Melvin's room first, and then to Kelley's. The men were forced to dress at gunpoint and were taken captive along with Crook, who had been staying at the Revere House hotel. Melvin, Kelley, and Crook were sent to Libby Prison in Richmond, and were exchanged for Confederate general Isaac R. Trimble and a guarantee from General Ulysses S. Grant that the treatment of captured McNeill's Rangers imprisoned at Fort McHenry would be improved. An article published in Richmond's Enquirer newspaper claimed that Melvin had been caught in bed with [...] "a <b>blushing</b> bride" [...] by McNeill's men during his capture; however, Wheeling's Daily Intelligencer newspaper reminded its readers that the story was baseless, as Melvin was unmarried.|$|E

500|$|A young four-armed Shiva and a {{beautiful}} two-armed Parvati should be the central figures, performing the panigrahana ("accepting the hand") ritual of a Hindu wedding, where the groom accepts the bride by taking her right hand in his. Shiva stands in tribhanga posture, {{with one of his}} legs straight and firmly on the ground and the other one slightly [...] bent. Shiva wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, adorned with a crescent moon. He wears serpents as earrings, as a waist band and as a necklace. Various gold ornaments adorn his body. His back hands carry a parashu (axe) and a mriga (deer). His front left hand makes the varada mudra ("blessing-giving gesture") and his front right hand is stretched ahead to receive the hand of the bride. A dark-complexioned Parvati, adorned in silk and gold finery, stands to the left of Shiva, <b>blushing</b> with her head bent slightly as she extends her right arm to hold Shiva's right hand.

500|$|Watch the Throne {{was one of}} {{the top-ranked}} albums in year-end lists by music critics and publications. Q ranked the album number six in its list of the Top 50 Albums of 2011.

From the {{cinematic}} 'No Church in the Wild' to the Stax-soul update 'Otis,' Throne testifies to Kanye West's talent for beats both iconoclastic and pop-savvy." [...] Claire Suddath of Time ranked it number three on her top-10 albums list and called it [...] "a beautifully decadent album". Chris Richards of The Washington Post ranked it number two on his list and stated, [...] "Instead of <b>blushing</b> over their embarrassment of riches, pop's most intriguing partnership delivered a self-congratulatory opus that was adventurous enough to remind us that they're rap visionaries first, 1 percent bazillionaires second. The A.V. Club ranked the it number nine on its year-end list, commenting that [...] "Watch The Throne thrives on the bristling tension between Kanye's live-wire energy and rule-breaking abandon, and Jay-Z's innate cautiousness. It's an album of the moment—a point underlined by the presence of Frank Ocean on two tracks—yet it has the substance to endure." [...] Stereogum placed Watch the Throne at number 10 on its list of the [...] "Top 50 albums of 2011" [...] while Pitchfork Media placed the album at number 21 on its list.

2500|$|In psychology, {{the body}} {{receives}} a stimulus {{from the environment}} or internally that causes the release of hormones. Release of hormones then may cause more of those hormones to be released, causing a positive feedback loop. This cycle {{is also found in}} certain behaviour.

When they realize that they are <b>blushing,</b> they become even more embarrassed, which leads to further <b>blushing,</b> and so on.|$|E

2500|$|The {{roots of}} the word shame are thought to derive from an older word meaning [...] "to cover"; as such, {{covering}} oneself, literally or figuratively, is a natural expression of shame.

[...] He also noted the sense of warmth or heat (associated with the vasodilation of the face and skin) occurring in intense shame. Shame can also result in crying.|$|E
