40|$|Thesis (M. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 This {{thesis is}} a {{combination}} of tape transcriptions and research to document the life history of Athabascan leader Effie Folger Kokrine. Effie Kokrine was well known in the Interior of Alaska, but her impact reached much farther, and in many directions, as she loved to travel and share her stories with people in many different states and in several other countries. Sharing stories was only one of her many talents. She was an Alaska Native culture educator, a champion dog musher, an expert seamstress, skin sewer and <b>beader,</b> hunter, fisher, cook and bottle washer. Effie stayed active and busy right until her sudden death from heart failure. She believed that every person should contribute to the well-being of the community, and she did her part by volunteering with the Junior Dog Musher's Association, the American Legion Post # 11 Women's Auxiliary, the Badger Lion's Club, and speaking to almost every group that invited her, which was many. The only reason that she would turn someone down who invited her to speak was if she had a prior commitment. She was a favorite speaker of various groups, especially those involving children, because of her history, and because of her humor. The intent of this thesis is to attempt to capture some of that history and share some of the stories...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine Iser's <b>'reader</b> response' theory with special focus on Iser's concept of 'dynamic reading' and 'blanks' as major {{narrative}} devices. The researcher will discuss how blanks or gaps function, through applying Iser's theory on William Faulkner's "A Rose for Emily". She will discuss how gaps in characters and events engage the reader in a dynamic process of reading which leads to revealing the text's meaning. This paper is an application of text-reader interaction which, as Iser states, generates meaning. It is worth mentioning here that Iser views meaning as an effect to be experienced rather than an object to be defined. It is here where Iser's contribution to the world of criticism becomes clear. He redirects focus from the text as an object to the subjectivity of the reader...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{oscillation}} between immersion and repulsion amongst readers of A clockwork orange by Anthony Burgess. I argue that nadsat, as an invented language, introduces {{the state of}} <b>‘reader</b> immersion’ resulting in ‘flow’ {{by means of a}} ‘ludic reading’ motivational structure. Reader curiosity acts as a ‘positive reinforcer’ through the sense of accomplishment felt by mastering nadsat. Reader repulsion occurs once nadsat is understood. Repulsion is induced {{as a result of the}} brutality the nadsat narrative communicates. However, repulsion does not necessarily cause the reader to stop reading, but rather acts as a sensationally derived motivation to continue reading. This type of motivation is identified as a ‘negative reinforcer’. Both motivational structures (positive and negative reinforcers) develop the oscillation between reader immersion and repulsion as part of the reading experience A clockwork orange offers. The aim of this article is to discuss the oscillation between immersion and repulsion experienced by readers of A clockwork orange according to the theoretical frameworks indicated above.

40|$|Providing {{instruction}} in music listening {{is one of}} the more challenging responsibili-ties for general music teachers at the middle and junior high school levels. These educa-tors frequently feel better prepared to teach for performance outcomes-singing, play-ing instruments, moving to music-than for listening skills; after all, they have observed many models of teaching for performance outcomes while participating in ensembles, or in methods classes or inservice work-shops focusing on the performanceaspectof musicianship. The purpose of this article, then, is to address the teaching of music listening by providing a review of recent literature regarding the listening aspect of musicianship in the general music class. Four recent studies supply evidence that young adolescents attend to musical ele-ments as they listen to either classical or popular music. Four guidelines for instructional prac-tice are identified below, but the <b>'reader</b> needs to be cautioned that the body of recent research concerning music listening in grades 6 - 9 is not particularly large. In some cases, there is only one research study that serves as the basis for formulating a guideline...|$|R
40|$|The Jumonji C (JmjC) {{family of}} 2 -oxoglutarate (2 OG) {{dependent}} oxygenases have established {{roles in the}} regulation of transcription via the catalysis of demethylation of Nε-methylated lysine residues in histone tails, especially the N-terminal tail of histone H 3. Most human JmjC KDMs are complex enzymes, with <b>‘reader</b> domains’ {{in addition to their}} catalytic domains. Recent biochemical evidence has shown that some, but not all, JmjC KDMs also have Nω-methyl arginyl demethylase (RDM) activity. JmjC KDM activity has been linked to multiple cancers and some JmjC proteins are therapeutic targets. It is therefore important to test not only whether compounds in development inhibit the KDM activity of targeted JmjC demethylases, but also whether they inhibit other activities of these proteins. Here we report biochemical studies on the potential dual inhibition of JmjC KDM and RDM activities using a model JmjC demethylase, KDM 4 E (JMJD 2 E). The results reveal that all of tested compounds inhibit both the KDM and RDM activities, raising questions about the in vivo effects of the inhibitors...|$|R
5000|$|In the Great Lakes, Ursuline nuns {{introduced}} floral {{patterns to}} tribes who quickly applied them to beadwork. Great Lakes tribes {{are known for}} their bandolier bags that might take an entire year to complete. During the 20th century the Plateau tribes, such as the Nez Perce, perfected contour-style beadwork in which the lines of beads are stitched to emphasize the pictorial imagery. Plains tribes are master <b>beaders,</b> and today dance regalia for men and women feature a variety of beadwork styles. While Plains and Plateau tribes are renowned for their beaded horse trappings, Subarctic tribes such as the Dene create lavish beaded floral dog blankets. Eastern tribes have a completely different beadwork aesthetic: Innu, Mi'kmaq, Penobscot, and Haudenosaunee tribes are known for symmetrical scroll motifs in white beads, called the [...] "double curve." [...] Iroquois are also known for [...] "embossed" [...] beading in which strings pulled taut force beads to pop up from the surface, creating a bas-relief. Tammy Rahr (Cayuga) is a contemporary practitioner of this style. Zuni artists have developed a tradition of three-dimensional beaded sculptures.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the discourse of}} workfare, which has swept a number of Western countries {{over the past two}} decades, perpetuates social divisions and facilitates the intensification of Western capitalism. The social politics of workfare in Western countries is underpinned by dubious notions about the flawed behaviour and morality of welfare recipients {{on the one hand and}} the virtue of paid work on the other, often expressed as a ‘work-first’ approach. This policy narrative is guided by the belief that the sources of economic disadvantage are largely attributable to the behavioural problems and moral shortcomings of an established ‘underclass’, rather than the result of structural inequalities in the national and global economy. While some critical attention has been paid to the words of welfare, far less attention has been paid to the effects of discourse, particularly in terms of analysing how ‘target’ populations respond to the policy frames that are used to legitimate welfare state restructuring. This paper draws on a 3 year semi-longitudinal study with long-term unemployed in Australia to examine how low-income people respond to problematised constructions of citizenship, such as ‘welfare-dependent’ and ‘work shy’. Through this form of <b>‘reader</b> research’ I aim to show that ‘welfare reform’ is much more than a set of policies aimed at managing the poor and the long-term unemployed in advanced capitalist economies; it also reinforces a system of values and beliefs about how all citizens should behave...|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} {{the differences between}} fiction and history, {{it seems reasonable to}} conclude that ‘imaginative literature, conceived of as fiction’ is a somewhat ‘privileged form of communication’ that ‘understands itself as separate from the sphere of the real’ (Ellison 6). Fiction, after all, is the realm of the speculative. It is a space where authors are free to invent, describe, and ruminate — even in the complete absence of evidence that these ruminations and descriptions are plausible. Kim Scott’s most accomplished novel, That Deadman Dance, is a work deeply preoccupied with its position as a fiction and with its relation to history, {{to the point that it}} becomes a central focus of the narrative. De Man once insisted that <b>‘readers</b> degrade the fiction by confusing it with a reality from which it has forever taken leave’, yet in the case of That Deadman Dance, which uses the history of the Albany region in Western Australia as a scaffold for narrative, character, and thematic elements, it seems the reader is being specifically invited to confuse the events of the past with the events of the novel (2002 : 17). The presence in the text of these historiographic elements, while fundamental to the novel’s ethical project, also leads to what Ellison has called ‘referential anxiety’, or the turn away from the referent towards self-referentiality (6). So do we degrade Scott’s fiction by searching for a historical referent? Or is it his intention to use the ‘referential effects’ of fiction to reveal the tenuous nature of its relationship with the past (Ellison 8) [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Long before today’s {{debates about}} English {{literary}} heritage, compulsory school readings, {{and whether or}} not England’s national poet, William Shakespeare, should remain safe from the national curriculum’s axe, members of the European public passionately debated the value of Shakespeare’s plays and their place in an increasingly modern world. Indeed, more than one hundred and fifty years before Harold Bloom declared that Shakespeare invented the human, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge similarly promised in him a ‘wisdom deeper even than our consciousness’ and characterised his talents as god-like. In his public lectures, Coleridge assured his audiences that Shakespeare’s art was of such majesty that every line was instantly recognisable – ‘not a sentence could be read without its being discovered if it were Shakespeare’ – and, furthermore, that it was so noble as to be morally impeccable, ‘keeping at all times the high road of life’ and making its <b>‘readers</b> better as well as wiser’. Notes from Coleridge’s lectures, writings, and conversations reveal his unequivocal devotion to Shakespeare, expressed to its full extent in his discussion of the playwright’s rhythm: ‘He goes on kindling like a meteor through the dark atmosphere; yet, when the creation in its outline is once perfect, then he seems to rest from his labour, and to smile upon his work, and tell himself that it is very good’. 1 In his version of Genesis, Coleridge envisioned Shakespeare as a divine Creator, shaping form out of chaos as he dashed off a few hundred lines of his sublime iambic pentameter. The effort was minimal, the result ‘very good’, and the appropriate response {{on the part of the}} reader humble veneration. </p...|$|R
40|$|Textiles of War: Women 2 ̆ 7 s Commentaries on Conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan Shortly {{after the}} events of September 11, 2001, {{patriotic}} imagery {{in the form of}} American flags began appearing in traditionally patterned rugs woven by Navajo women and beadwork sold on the reservation. This {{was not the first time}} women 2 ̆ 7 s textiles provided a political commentary on the destruction resulting from warfare. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989, rugs featuring Soviet weaponry and vehicles appeared in the markets of Peshawar. Created by nomadic Beluch women who experienced the impact of war first-hand, the war rugs helped the women cope with the violence surrounding their everyday lives and served as a source of income for families devastated by warfare. War rugs, whose production had ceased with the Soviet withdrawal, again appeared in Peshawar and the United States after September 11 - this time made by individual women and in factories by men, women and children. The iconography and color palette also differ from the originals, as these rugs serve as a means of showing solidarity with Americans as well as providing sources of income for families once again surrounded by violence. In the U. S., war imagery became a subject for American textile artists as well. Imagery on quilts displayed at shows across the country reflected the artists 2 ̆ 7 support for or protest against American military involvement in the region. These same sentiments appear in the works of embroiderers, knitters and <b>beaders</b> as they reflect on the impact of the war on American society, those fighting overseas, and their own lives...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} educational trends {{as reported}} in five major New Zealand daily newspapers from 1988 - 1999 when the New Zealand education system underwent radical policy reforms. Newspaper reporting of the educational reforms was set alongside and compared {{with a range of}} academic and professional critiques. The role of newspaper reporting differed from the academic literature in two inter-related ways. First, newspapers had to appeal to a <b>‘reader</b> audience’ so as to achieve their second function, commercial viability. Commercial viability was achieved by a process of ‘gatekeeping’ whereby articles were selected for their publishing suitability. Gatekeeping took into account the reader audience, time constraints and the employer’s political orientation. The key argument of this thesis was, that because of those restraints, reporting on complex educational issues, which required time to investigate, analyse, reflect and theorise, were too difficult and therefore, were largely ignored. A mixed research methodology was used to identify the similarities and differences between academic and professional concerns with those educational articles found in newspapers. Five newspapers were surveyed over 12 years (1988 - 1999) on the basis of every 11 days, but omitting Sunday. This resulted in 1680 newspapers being identified. Educational articles were coded according to their story content and substory content and scored according to their prominence using the ‘Budd Score’ method. The key findings were that articles about education, in the new global media market with its focus on the commodification of information, were superficial, narrow, unquestioning and given low priority. Such ‘dumbing down’ was seen to have effectively muzzled the ‘watchdog’ role that the media claimed to have upheld. As a result a ‘cultural bricolage’ had led to an unequal power distribution that, based on the evidence of the literature review and the Budd score analysis in this thesis, was arguably anti-social, anti-Maori, anti-feminist, anti-competitive and therefore, anti-democratic...|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} smart card has {{dramatically}} expands over the centuries. This {{is due to}} the needs in various areas such as healthcare, communication, self identification, banking, and many more that smart card contributes. Malaysia is one of the countries that are implementing smart card as self identification for the citizens. Malaysia has started with MyKad and recently, the government introduces MyKid as identification card for kids below 12 years old. MyKid Initialization System is a system that links two ‘firmware’, which is ‘mechanical firmware’ and <b>‘reader</b> firmware’ with the mechanical parts of machine that operates the smart card operating machine. The system ran on physical machine named MRR 300 E. Due to several upgrading to the mechanical part of the machine, the mechanical firmware has to change. Changing the mechanical firmware caused the Machine Automation Department, hereinafter called as MAD, at IRIS need to review back the previous version of the software to enable the new firmware and hardware functioning and delivered the same task as before. Also, the upgrading involved several enhancements to the software. With this new software, security features are added that enable only the maintainer can access the maintainer page. Also, the system will be auto lock from being run after certain times. This is to enable the maintainer team to trace the condition of the machine, and how the machine operated at certain period of time. The methodology used to deliver the project is V shape methodology as this is the simpler methodology compared to others. As MAD have not implement software engineering practices before, choosing V shape is a wise move to introduce software engineering documents and practices. As a result, after competing this project, the author have produced Interface Requirement (IRS), Software Requirement Specification (SRS), Software Design Description (SDD) for the upgraded software.
