25|$|The {{weight of}} the {{locomotive}} is roughly proportional to the power output; {{the number of axles}} required is determined by this weight divided by the axleload limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels is derived from the adhesive weight in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase {{in the size of the}} grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> in which the swivelling movement of a single axle truck controls the lateral displacement of the front driving axle (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.|$|E
50|$|To {{allow the}} {{locomotive}} to negotiate curves of 320 ft radius despite its long coupled wheelbase, {{the third and}} fourth pairs of driving wheels were flangeless. In addition, the locomotive made use of a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie system, where the leading pair of driving wheels has a limited amount of sideplay with an articulated link to the leading <b>bissel</b> <b>bogie.</b> The <b>bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> was connected to a sleeve around the first driving axle so that any displacement of the <b>bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> in one direction would cause a similar displacement of the leading driving axle in the opposite direction, thereby steering the driving wheels through curves.|$|E
50|$|The spring {{compensation}} {{of the engine}} was arranged in two groups. The leading <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> and the first two pairs of coupled wheels were compensated in one group, while the remaining three pairs of coupled wheels were compensated with the trailing bogie. Cross compensation was provided between the leading <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> and leading coupled wheels. Instead of pins, case-hardened cotters were provided for fulcrums of the bearing spring compensating beams. The proportion of balanced reciprocating parts was only 6% which reduced the hammer blow on the rails to 5 lcwt kg per wheel at 50 mph. The locomotive was noted for its smooth running.|$|E
50|$|On a steam locomotive, {{the leading}} and {{trailing}} wheels may be mounted on bogies like pony trucks or <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogies.</b> Articulated locomotives (e.g. Fairlie, Garratt or Mallet locomotives) have power bogies {{similar to those}} on diesel and electric locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The {{modifications}} {{were done}} between 1926 and 1929 {{and consisted of}} the removal of their trailing <b>bissel</b> <b>bogies</b> and coal bunkers, the shortening of their main frames {{and the addition of}} tenders to increase their coal and water capacity, thereby converting them to 4-8-0 Mastodon type tank-and-tender locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Locomotive numbers 1 to 3 on the L端beck-B端chen railway (L端beck-B端chener Eisenbahn or LBE) in Germany were {{streamlined}} tank locomotives. The locomotives had a 2-4-2T wheel arrangement, a two-cylinder, superheated {{engine and}} {{were capable of}} push-pull operations. In order to ensure a symmetrical running gear, both carrying axles were built as <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogies,</b> which were fitted with return devices for improved running.|$|R
50|$|The tender {{locomotives}} {{of classes}} 41 and 45 {{only had a}} Krauss-Helmholtz bogie at the front; the trailing axle was housed in a <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie.</b> The tank locomotives of Class 85, {{like some of the}} Class 64 and 86 engines, had two Krauss-Helmholtz bogies.|$|E
50|$|Its {{invention}} {{is generally}} credited to Levi Bissell, who devised one in 1857 and patented it the following year. Hence the term <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> (spelt with one 'l') or axle {{is used in}} continental Europe. In the UK, the term is Bissell truck with two 'l's.|$|E
50|$|The {{pony truck}} can move {{radially}} around a real or virtual pivot. When the pivot is situated {{at a point}} inside the truck, the truck is called a bogie. What makes it a <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> is the pivot being placed outside to the rear or fore.|$|E
5000|$|The boiler and {{elements}} of the driving gear {{were the same as}} those on the DRG Class 24. They had <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogies,</b> apart from ten engines which had a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie [...] From no. 64 368 onwards the engines were 10 cm longer than their predecessors. The Class 64 engine was given the nickname [...] "Bubikopf" [...] ('bob') after a fashionable ladies hairstyle of the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{and other}} rolling stock {{also had a}} scaled-down appearance when {{compared with those of}} the larger networks. The steam locomotives were often tank engines, generally having three axles, with or without <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogies</b> front or rear. They were comparatively light, weighing from 8 to 25 t unladen. Later, petrol and diesel multiple units appeared as railbuses. Overall, these machines formed short trains of at most about a dozen small carriages or wagons, often far fewer.|$|R
500|$|On the Southern Railway's Central and Eastern sections, crews {{complained that}} the {{locomotives}} rolled heavily and unpredictably on the cheaply laid track of the former SECR and LBSCR networks, leading to their nickname, [...] "Rolling Rivers". The rolling was in part caused {{by the type of}} coil suspension and steadying springs used on the <b>Bissel</b> truck and <b>bogie</b> axles, which caused adverse springing on poor track. These were modified in later batches, with limited success. The rough-riding was also attributed to the frames, which were of insubstantial construction to save weight. The bracing proved incapable of counteracting the stresses applied to the frames when travelling at speed and caused excessive vibration on the footplate at higher outputs.|$|R
5000|$|A Bissel truck (also: Bissell {{truck or}} <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie)</b> is a single-axled bogie which pivots towards {{the centre of}} a steam {{locomotive}} to enable it to negotiate curves more easily. Invented in 1857 by [...] and usually known as a pony truck, {{it is a very}} simple and common means of designing a carrying axle.|$|E
50|$|These ten-coupled {{locomotives}} had carrying axles {{housed in}} a <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie.</b> The fixed third axle acted as the driving axle and had thinner wheel flanges to begin with. After 1945 its flanges were removed entirely to improve curve running still further. The wheelbase was 3,000 mm initially; this was later increased to 4,000 mm.|$|E
50|$|When a {{shortage}} of suitable shunting locomotives developed in 1926, the SAR modified 21 Class A and Class A Belpaire 4-8-2T locomotives by removing the trailing <b>bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> and coal bunker, shortening the main frame and adding a tender to increase their coal and water capacity. Tenders from various scrapped locomotive types were used.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the accident, two Kand K1class engines were trialled on the London and North Eastern Railway's (LNER) Great Northern mainline {{under the supervision of}} that company's CME, Nigel Gresley, to gain an unbiased review of their riding qualities. Locomotives No.A803 (K) and No.A890 (K1), and KingArthurclass No.E782, were tested on the well-maintained LNER line between [...] and [...] in October 1927, where few problems were found with locomotive stability. On runs between Kings Cross and [...] with the LNER's dynamometer car, No.A890 was recorded at a top speed of [...] and A803 at , with no problems in riding. When these engines returned from the LNER, the Southern Railway's General Manager, Sir Herbert Walker ordered further trials to be led by Sir John Aspinall on the Western section main line near [...] These were terminated by the Southern Railway's Operating Department, as the riding of the locomotives at speeds near [...] rendered the locomotives unsafe. The instability of No.A890 at speed was attributed to the helical springs on the <b>Bissel</b> truck and <b>bogie.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to their predecessors the machines {{were given a}} plate frame. Like them, however, the third axle is driven and the carrying axles are housed in a <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie.</b> Two vacuum injectors form the feed water system. In order to enable brown coal firing, the grate area was increased {{compared with that of}} the Einheitslok.|$|E
50|$|The bogie {{is a type}} of {{pony truck}} and was named after the {{locomotive}} firm of Krauss and the engineer, Richard von Helmholtz. By contrast a <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> is independently installed in the frame, and sideways guidance of the locomotive is achieved by elastic forces. The distribution of these forces is not tightly defined and, in addition, they are dependent on the curve radius.|$|E
50|$|Locomotive No. 44 of the Brunswick State Railway (BLE) was a tank {{locomotive}} for mixed passenger {{and goods}} traffic. The locomotive, built in 1934 by Krupp, had a 2-8-2T wheel arrangement and a two-cylinder superheated engine. Leading and trailing wheels were {{housed in a}} <b>Bissel</b> <b>bogie.</b> Rather unusual for such a locomotive were the smoke deflectors which were attached directly to the side tanks and extended {{as far as the}} front buffer beam.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Second Boer War, the CSAR {{inherited}} 35 4-10-2T Reid Tenwheeler tank locomotives {{from the}} IMR and designated them Class E. The CSAR found them to have an inadequate coal and water supply for trips of any length and, beginning in 1905, 29 of them were converted to 4-8-0 tank-and-tender locomotives by removing the trailing <b>bissel</b> <b>bogie,</b> the fifth pair of driving wheels and the coal bunker, shortening the main frame and adding tenders reclaimed from various scrapped locomotives. In 1912, these locomotives were reclassified as Class 13 on the SAR.|$|E
50|$|Between 1926 and 1929, when a {{shortage}} of suitable shunting locomotives developed {{as a result of}} increasing traffic throughout the country and particularly on the Witwatersrand, the SAR rebuilt 21 of its Class A 4-8-2T locomotives to Class 17 4-8-0 tank-and-tender locomotives. They were modified by removing the trailing <b>bissel</b> <b>bogie</b> and the coal bunker, shortening the main frame and adding a tender to increase the coal and water capacity. Tenders from various scrapped locomotive types were used and they were employed as shunting engines around Durban and Port Elizabeth. In 1953, two of them were sold to the Zambezi Saw Mills Company for use on their Livingstone-Mulobezi logging railway in Northern Rhodesia. The rest were withdrawn from service by 1961, more than seventy years after the first one was built for the NGR.|$|E
50|$|After the war, the Reid Tenwheeler {{locomotives}} {{were designated}} Class E on the CSAR. P.A. Hyde, Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CSAR, {{found them to}} have an inadequate coal and water supply for trips of any length and decided to convert 29 of them to 4-8-0 Mastodon type tank-and-tender engines, beginning in 1904. The trailing <b>bissel</b> <b>bogie,</b> the fifth pair of coupled wheels and the coal bunker were removed, the main frame was shortened and three- or four-axle tenders from various withdrawn or obsolete locomotives were attached. This increased the coal and water capacities {{which resulted in a}} considerable increase in the operating range of the locomotive. Since it was now able to be used without a water tank attached, it could still haul the same load as before, used less oil and was no longer prone to derailment while reversing. Crews found the locomotive more comfortable to work than the tank version.|$|E
