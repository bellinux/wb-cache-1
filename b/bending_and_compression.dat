In this study, 30 years old oil palm trunk (OPT) that is normally regarded as waste after falling for re-planting {{is used as}} raw material in combination with rubberwood veneers for the manufacture of laminated veneer lumber (LVL). Their properties, in terms of <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> strength, were evaluated {{in accordance with the}} Japanese Agricultural Standard for L VL.

Significant reduction in strength properties variations between boards was also found when OPT was utilized in the form of LVL. Being a monocotyledonous species, oil palm trunk properties is stipulated of having great variations between the outer parts of the stems and towards the center of the stem.

The material consisted of 5 trees, each of which was represented by 4 bolt taken respectively from near tree base, at middle half and {{upper end of the}} merchantable bole. The test pieces were then drawn from each bolt following the cruciform pattern of the ASTM D 14362 procedure. Using this pattern, 221 and 197 test specimens were respectively obtained for the <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> test. The result shows that the tree averages of the bending strength ranges from 90 - 110 % of the species maan value, the cardinal point averages from 100 - 101 % and the position within tree (bolt) averages from 97 - 102 %, As has been anticipated the tree averages are significantly different in both the <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> strengths. Computation of the precision of estimates of the species mean in term of the probable limit of error (PLE) as percentage of the species mean within 95 % confidence band as suggested by Pearson (1952) indicates an error of 9, 51 % and 12, 44 % for respectively the <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> strength. Values of the probable limit of error PLE were then calculated using various combination of number of test pieces per tree and number of trees, and the result compared with those obtained from previous test using Agathis lorantifolia and Schima wallichii tree species. It shows that for structural and non-structural purposes at leat 10 trees per species, and 5 - 10 specimens per tree should be employed in future strength test in order to obtain an error of between 5 - 10 %.

50|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, ultimate failure {{describes the}} breaking of a material. In general {{there are two types}} of failure: fracture and buckling. Fracture of a material occurs when either an internal or external crack elongates the width or length of the material. In ultimate failure this will result in one or more breaks in the material. Buckling occurs when compressive loads are applied to the material and instead of cracking the material bows. This is undesirable because most tools that are designed to be straight will be inadequate if curved. If the buckling continues, it will create tension on the outer side of the <b>bend</b> <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> on the inner side, potentially fracturing the material.|$|R

System effects in timber structural systems {{can be expected to}} be rather important due to load redistribution and random strength and stiffness along the structural elements not always explicitly accounted for in codes of practice. The system effect is investigated in illustrative models. The results indicate that the coeffi-cient of variation of the load bearing capacity of typical timber structural systems is lower than for the individual members. Finally some statistical results for <b>bending,</b> tension <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> strength data are presented. The results indicate that <b>bending,</b> tension <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> strengths ap-proximately have a coefficient of variation, COV equal to 20 %, 25 % and 15 % if 2 -parameter Weibull tail fits are used. If a LogNormal distribution is fitted then the COV’s are approximately 25 %, 30 % and 15 %. Therefore it seems thus reasonable to introduce different partial safety factors for <b>bending,</b> tension <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> strength.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} relaxation dynamics of a nearly-flat binary {{lipid bilayer membrane}} by {{taking into account the}} membrane tension, hydrodynamics of the surrounding fluid, inter-monolayer friction and mutual diffusion in each monolayer. We find that two relaxation modes associated with the mutual diffusion appear in addition to the three previously discussed relaxation modes reflecting the <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> of the membrane. Because of the symmetry, only one of the two diffusive mode is coupled to the bending mode. The two diffusive modes are much slower than the <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> <b>compression</b> modes in the entire realistic wave number range. This means that the long time relaxation behavior is dominated by the mutual diffusion in binary membranes. The two diffusive modes become even slower {{in the vicinity of the}} unstable region towards phase separation, while the other modes are almost unchanged. In short time scales, on the other hand, the lipid composition heterogeneity induces in-plane compression and bending of the bilayer. Comment: 21 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
