5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E

30|$|The {{appreciation}} of the Swiss franc {{since the start of}} the financial crisis has been a traumatic experience for Swiss-based investors, repeatedly turning their currency exposures into severe losses. The impact of this experience is hard to overestimate. Ten years later, broad anecdotal evidence and current account statistics suggest that the propensity of Swiss-based investors (and corporates) to assume currency risk has been durably reduced when not annihilated. With extremely low—in fact currently negative—risk-free interest rates in francs, this implies that prudent investors—notably pension funds—face a very high hurdle in order to deliver the investment returns that are counted on. Macroeconomically, the reluctance to take on currency risks has meant the end of the previously prevailing external <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>equilibrium</b> whereby the current account surplus is compensated by equi-proportionate external net capital flows. As a consequence, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been forced into substituting public capital flows to the missing private ones and in so doing has accumulated a balance sheet exceeding 100 % of GDP as of this writing.|$|R

In the present note, the author demonstrates that: A) one of the their conclusions, according to which the reduction of social contributions, financed by raising indirect taxes have no effect, can not be shared, B) the difficulties that result from an excessive level of real wages can also justifiably be attributed to an excessive volume of public spending, and unions’ position of a relatively high level of real wages can be considered a necessary condition for "waste" to be eliminated; C) the economic policy framework is radically different depending on whether the elasticity of trade with foreign countries is or is not high enough to allow, through changes in the terms of trade, the attainment of full employment in conditions <b>of</b> a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>equilibrium.</b>   JEL: E 24, E 31, F 13 </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{implements}} a panel {{approach to}} investigate the empirical relevance of ‘Thirlwall’s Law’, which states that long-run growth must be consistent with <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> (BOP) <b>equilibrium</b> and is, thus, determined on the demand side. Building on ARDL modelling, mean-group and pooled mean-group estimation methods, we use annual data over the 1960 - 2010 years for a panel of 22 OECD countries and find significant support for the ‘Law’. Next, we also explore empirically {{the hypothesis that the}} BOP-constrained growth rate (yb) must equal the natural (or potential) rate of growth (yn) and find that the data do not reject this hypothesis. Finally, we adopt a new approach, based on panel Granger-causality methods, to explore the direction of causality between yb and yn. The results indicate the existence of unidirectional long-run causality from yb to yn, thus reinforcing the view, embodied in the ‘Law’, that long-run growth is demand-determined and constrained by the BOP. ...|$|R

However, in 1986, he returned to government service and was appointed as the Secretary to the Government. By then, he believed Nigeria needed economic re-structuring. In 1985, prior to his appointment, the military sought public opinion of an IMF economic structuring proposal as a condition for external credit from the fund, the popular opinion was to reject the proposal. The administration then came up with Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). SAP was a proposal to diversify export from a crude oil dependent regime, ensure fiscal and <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and non-inflationary growth. The mechanisms to be implemented in order to achieve these objectives were the devaluation of the naira, reduction of petroleum products subsidies and trade liberalization. During his time in office, Falae became a vocal defender of SAP even when it was becoming unpopular earning him the moniker, Mr. SAP.|$|E

40|$|Monetary {{policy is}} one of the {{economic}} policy "tools" through which it acts on the currency demand and supply in the economy. The importance of monetary policy results from its primary objective - price stability, plus limiting inflation and maintaining internal and external value of the currency. Responsibility for achieving these objectives rests with the Central Bank, which has a monopoly in the formulation and the implementation of monetary policy targets. Price stability is the primary objective of monetary policy and also the central objective of economic policy, alongside with: sustainable economic growth, full employment <b>of</b> labor force, <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> external <b>payments</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> To achieve these overall objectives of economic policy, monetary policy acts through currency as an instrument of action and it represents the overall action exercised by the monetary authority to influence economic development and to ensure price stability.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a general {{equilibrium}} intertemporal model with optimizing consumers and producers is developed to analyze how different policies geared at liberalizing {{the current and}} capital accounts <b>of</b> the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> affect the <b>equilibrium</b> real exchange rate (RER). In particular, {{the effects of a}} reduction in the level of import tariffs and of a change in the tax on foreign borrowing on the equilibrium RER are investigated. In the case of import tariffs, both a temporary and an anticipated liberalization are considered. It is shown {{that in the case of}} tariffs reduction it is not possible to know a priori whether the equilibrium RER will appreciate or depreciate. However, a liberalization of the capital account will always result in an equilibrium real appreciation in the current period. It is then argued that analyses of this type are essential to evaluate whether observed movements in the RER represent a misalignment situation or if they are an equilibrium phenomenon. The case of the recent liberalization attempts in the Southern Cone are also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{written as}} a chapter for a Handbook of International Economics, reviews {{developments}} {{in the theory of}} international monetary economics from the late 1960 's through the early 1980 's. Following a review of the operation of the monetary mechanism <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> adjustment {{in the context of the}} Mundell-Fleming model, the paper reviews the more modern analysis of the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> adjustment under fixed exchange rates and of exchange rate determination under flexible exchange rates. Beginning with a simple exposition of the monetary mechanism, the model is then extended to incorporate sluggish wage and output adjustments, endogenous monetary policy and sterilization operations, multiplicity of tradable and nontradable goods, large countries, capital mobility and portfolio balance. The review then turns to an exposition of exchange rate theory, starting with the monetary approach to exchange rate determination. Issues discussed in this context include purchasing power parities, nontraded goods, the real exchange rate, currency substitution and the interaction between real and monetary factors in effecting exchange rates. The paper proceeds with a presentation of a more general framework that views the question of exchange rate determination as part of the general theory of the determination of asset prices, and which highlights the unique role of expectations. The general framework is then applied to characterize the interaction between the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> and the <b>equilibrium</b> real exchange rate. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some empirical issues of exchange rate analysis. ...|$|R
