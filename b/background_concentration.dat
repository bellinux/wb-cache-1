They {{can be used}} for instance to detect a local pollution or to calculate the cleaning targets if a site has to be remediate. However, soils from urban and industrial areas generally present high concentration {{of pollutants}}, since they usually are disturbed by urbanization, mixed with technogenic material and affected by smoke and dust fallout. In these zones, <b>background</b> <b>concentrations</b> can be very high and fluctuating across short distances. It is therefore difficult to calculate them precisely, and use them properly for the roles they must fulfill. Dealing with this notion in soil protection policy can therefore be complicated. We present seven western European approaches for the consideration of <b>background</b> <b>concentrations</b> in soil protection policies: Flanders, Wallonia, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Germany, France, England and the Netherlands. The definition of the concept of <b>background</b> <b>concentrations</b> of pollutants in soils, the way to calculate them and their roles are presented between these different systems that have various pedogeological and industrial contexts.

The current work proposes an approach for the estimation of <b>background</b> <b>concentrations</b> using air quality measured data decomposed on baseline and short-term components. For this purpose, the spectral density was obtained for air quality monitoring data based on the Fourier series analysis. After, short-term fluctuations associated with the influence of local emissions and dispersion conditions were extracted from the original measurements using an iterative moving-average filter and taking into account the contribution of higher frequencies determined from the spectral analysis. The deterministic component obtained by the filtering is characterised by wider spatial and temporal representativeness than original monitoring data and is assumed to be appropriate for establishing the background values.

The observations show that at Moerdijk C 2 -C 4 concentrations measured in Rijnmond sector have decreased considerably since the early 1980 s, corresponding with changes in emissions in that area. Averaged over all wind directions the trend of all species is downward, but for acetylene the trend is significant at a 95 % confidence interval. The acetylene concentrations show an annual downward trend of 3 % during the 1980 s, supporting other estimates of decreasing hydrocarbon emissions from traffic over this period at the same rate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{guidance}} is to describe procedures acceptable to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for the comparison of site contaminant levels to <b>background</b> <b>concentrations</b> in groundwater. An evaluation of local <b>background</b> <b>concentrations</b> is appropriate at a cleanup site whenever it is suspected that certain contaminants detected above applicable cleanup criteria may be equal to, or less than, natural <b>background</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Some chemicals, such as inorganics and radionuclides, are present naturally in groundwater or may be introduced as contaminants. If they are present from a chemical release and exceed risk-based criteria, cleanup or other risk management measures are typically required. If the chemical is present due to natural conditions, cleanup is not needed under current rules, even if the concentrations exceed risk-based criteria. Consequently, it {{is important in the}} management of a number of sites {{to determine whether or not}} the presence of a chemical represents natural background conditions. Some chemicals, both man-made and natural, can be enriched in area groundwater due to human activities not associated with a specific release of contaminants. An example of this would be pesticides and nitrate associated with agricultural activity. Low levels that exist in th...|$|R
