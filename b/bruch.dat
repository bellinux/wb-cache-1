40|$|PURPOSE. The {{mutation}} R 345 W in EFEMP 1 (fibulin- 3) causes macular degeneration. This study {{sought to}} determine whether proteoglycan content and diffusion across <b>Bruch's</b> membrane are altered in Efemp 1 (ki/ki) mice carrying this mutation or in Efemp 1 (-/-) mice. METHODS. Proteoglycans in mouse <b>Bruch's</b> membranes were stained with Cupromeronic Blue (CB). Heparan sulfated proteoglycan (HSPG) and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (C/DSPG) distributions were visualized following treatments with chondroitinase ABC (C-ABC) or nitrous acid. Total sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) in <b>Bruch's</b> membrane/choroid (BrM/Ch) were measured with dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB). Matrix metalloprotease (MMP) - 2, MMP- 9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 3 were examined by immunofluorescence and quantified using Image J. Molecules with different Stokes radius (R-s) were allowed simultaneously to diffuse through mouse BrM/Ch mounted in a modified Ussing chamber. Samples were quantified using gel exclusion chromatography. RESULTS. HSPGs and C/DSPGs were markedly increased in Efemp 1 (ki/ki) <b>Bruch's</b> membrane, and MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 were decreased, but TIMP- 3 was increased. Diffusion across Efemp 1 (ki/ki) <b>Bruch's</b> membrane was impaired. In contrast, the proteoglycan amount in Efemp 1 (-/-) <b>Bruch's</b> membrane was not significantly different, but the size of proteoglycans was much larger. MMP- 2, MMP- 3, and TIMP- 3 levels were {{similar to that of}} Efemp 1 (+/+) mice, but they were localized diffusely in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells instead of <b>Bruch's</b> membrane. Diffusion across Efemp 1 (-/-) <b>Bruch's</b> membrane was enhanced. CONCLUSIONS. Mutant fibulin- 3 causes proteoglycan accumulation, reduction of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, but increase of TIMP- 3, and impairs diffusion across <b>Bruch's</b> membrane. Fibulin- 3 ablation results in altered sizes of proteoglycans, altered distributions of MMP- 2, MMP- 9, and TIMP- 3, and enhances diffusion across <b>Bruch's</b> membrane...|$|R
30|$|Histopathologic {{studies have}} {{provided}} {{insight into the}} potential mechanisms {{in the development of}} peripapillary CNV [3]. Sarks provided clinicopathologic correlation of 21 eyes with peripapillary CNV from AMD [3]. Based on histopathologic evidence, Sarks hypothesized that peripapillary CNV originates either from the choroidal vessels passing around the termination of <b>Bruch's</b> membrane or from the choroidal vessels passing through defects in <b>Bruch's</b> membrane. In the above reported cases of peripapillary CNV in intermediate uveitis, {{it is interesting to note}} that chronic disc edema was present prior to the onset of all cases. Arkfeld and Brockhurst hypothesized that chronic disc swelling may increase the potential space between <b>Bruch's</b> membrane and swollen disc tissue facilitating ingrowth of choroidal vessels around the termination of <b>Bruch's</b> membrane [2]. Alternatively, chronic disc swelling may result in the deformation of the peripapillary <b>Bruch's</b> membrane leading to breaks in <b>Bruch's</b> membrane facilitating ingrowth of the choroidal neovascular tissue under the RPE [4]. Peripapillary CNV has also been observed in conditions causing chronic disc swelling such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus [5 – 8].|$|R

40|$|Retinal pigment {{epithelial}} cell malfunction is a causative feature of age-related macular degeneration, and transplantation of new retinal pigment {{epithelial cell}}s {{is an attractive}} strategy to prevent further progression and visual loss. However, transplants have shown limited efficacy, mainly because transplanted cells fail to adhere and migrate onto pathological <b>Bruch's</b> membrane. Adhesion to <b>Bruch's</b> membrane is integrin-mediated. Ageing of <b>Bruch's</b> membrane leads {{to a decline in}} integrin ligands and, added to this, wet age-related macular degeneration leads to upregulation of anti-adhesive molecules such as tenascin-C. We have therefore investigated whether manipulation of integrin function in retinal pigment epithelial cells can restore their adhesion and migration on wet age-related macular degeneration-damaged <b>Bruch's</b> membrane. Using spontaneously immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells (adult retinal pigment epithelium- 19), we show that adhesion and migration on the <b>Bruch's</b> membrane components is integrin-dependent and enhanced by integrin-activating agents manganese and TS 2 / 16. These allowed cells to adhere and migrate on low concentrations of ligand, as would be found in aged <b>Bruch's</b> membrane. We next developed a method for stripping cells from <b>Bruch's</b> membrane so that adhesion and migration assays can be performed on its surface. Integrin activation had a moderate effect on enhancing retinal pigmented epithelial cell adhesion and migration on normal human and rat <b>Bruch's</b> membrane. However, on <b>Bruch's</b> membrane prepared from human wet age-related macular degeneration-affected eyes, adhesion was lower and integrin activation had a much greater effect. A candidate molecule for preventing retinal pigmented epithelial interaction with age-related macular degeneration-affected <b>Bruch's</b> membrane is tenascin-C which we confirm is present at high levels in wet age-related macular degeneration membrane. We show that tenascin-C is anti-adhesive for retinal pigmented epithelial cells, but after integrin activation, they can adhere and migrate on it using alphaVbeta 3 integrin. Alternatively, we find that transduction of retinal pigmented epithelial cells with alpha 9 integrin, a tenascin-C-binding integrin, led to a large increase in alpha 9 beta 1 -mediated adhesion and migration on tenascin-C. Both expression of alpha 9 integrin and integrin activation greatly enhanced the ability of retinal pigment epithelial cells to adhere to tenascin-rich wet age-related macular degeneration-affected <b>Bruch's</b> membranes. Our results suggest that manipulation of retinal pigment epithelial cell integrins through integrin activating strategies, or expression of new integrins such as alpha 9, could be effective in improving the efficacy of retinal pigment epithelial cell transplantation in wet age-related macular degeneration-affected eyes. </p...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—The authors studied how artificially damaged <b>Bruch's</b> {{membrane}} influenced {{growth and}} differentiation of transplanted embryonic retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and of host RPE cells in rabbits.  METHODS—Embryonic RPE cells obtained from pigmented rabbits were transplanted into the subretinal space of adult albino rabbits. The host RPE was removed with a silicone cannula, and <b>Bruch's</b> membrane was damaged by scratching with a microhooked 27  gauge needle under the detached retina in closed vitrectomy. The transplantation sites were examined 3,  7, and 14  days after surgery by light and electron microscopy.  RESULTS—Varying degrees of damage in <b>Bruch's</b> membrane were observed. Pigmented and hypopigmented RPE cells showed a normal polarity and tight junctions were {{seen at the}} sites of mild to moderate damage 3 - 7 days after the surgery. In contrast, fibroblast-like cells with no such features of RPE cells formed multiple layers at the sites of severe damage involving the full thickness of <b>Bruch's</b> membrane and the choriocapillaris even 14  days after the surgery. Without transplantation, host RPE cells repopulated the damaged areas {{in the same way}} as transplanted RPE cells.  CONCLUSIONS—Transplanted embryonic RPE cells as well as host RPE cells grew and differentiated on the moderately damaged <b>Bruch's</b> membrane, while the severely damaged <b>Bruch's</b> membrane did not allow differentiation of RPE cells although these cells could grow and cover the damaged areas.    Keywords: transplantation; repopulation; retinal pigment epithelial cells; <b>Bruch's</b> membrane; rabbi...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in tissue {{inhibitor}} of metalloproteinases (TIMP) - 3 {{are found}} in some patients with Sorsby's fundus dystrophy, a retinal degeneration characterized by abnormal deposits in <b>Bruch's</b> membrane and choroidal neovascularization. The {{purpose of this study}} was to localize TIMP- 3 in the retina/choroid of normal human and animal eyes. Immunolabeling was performed on unfixed and fixed sections of human eyes aged 24 to 85 years and unfixed sections of baboon, chicken, cow, pig, and rat eyes using a monoclonal antibody against a human TIMP- 3 synthetic peptide. The antibody produced strong immunolabeling of <b>Bruch's</b> membrane and drusen and weak labeling of retina blood vessels in unfixed human and baboon eyes. Unfixed chicken, cow, pig, and rat tissues showed no reactivity. After antigen retrieval, all fixed human eyes showed specific labeling of <b>Bruch's</b> membrane and drusen, which was strongest in eyes from elderly donors. The results indicate that TIMP- 3 is an extracellular matrix component of <b>Bruch's</b> membrane. Thus, abnormal local function of TIMP- 3 may lead to the characteristic <b>Bruch's</b> membrane deposits and choroidal neovascularization found in Sorsby's fundus dystrophy. Specific labeling of drusen raises the possibility that altered TIMP- 3 -mediated matrix remodeling may contribute to age-related degenerative changes in <b>Bruch's</b> membrane...|$|R

RESULTS. Human <b>Bruch's</b> membranes (n = 20) showed a linear age-dependent increase in pentosidine that reached approximately 0. 17 millimoles pentosidine per mole hydroxyproline in late life (r = 0. 896; P < 0. 001). Immunohistochemical evaluation showed evidence of pentosidine in <b>Bruch's</b> membrane, choroidal extracellular matrix, and vessel walls in the 82 -year-old nondiabetic and diabetic globes. A similar staining pattern was found with the anti-CML antibody. Basal laminar deposits and drusen stained with both antibodies in the elderly nondiabetic eye.

40|$|The recent {{revolution}} in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) genetics {{has demonstrated that}} genetic alterations affecting the alternative pathway of the complement cascade have {{a major influence on}} AMD risk. One of the two most important genetic loci is on chromosome 1 and contains genes encoding complement factor H (FH) and the factor H related proteins (FHR proteins). In macular tissue, especially <b>Bruch’s</b> membrane, relatively high levels of a truncated splice variant of FH called factor H-like protein 1 (FHL- 1) are present. Here we discuss how genetic variations may alter the amounts, or by altering their protein sequences, the functions of these proteins. In particular, the common Y 402 H polymorphism affects the ability of FHL- 1 and FH to localize to <b>Bruch’s</b> membrane and the inner choroid because it alters the ability of these complement regulators to bind heparan sulphate (HS) in these structures. In addition, there is an age-related loss of HS from <b>Bruch’s</b> membrane. We hypothesize that a combination of poor binding of the 402 H variants of FHL- 1 and FH to <b>Bruch’s</b> membrane, combined with a decrease in binding due to age-related HS loss, eventually results in insufficient FHL- 1 and FH binding to <b>Bruch’s</b> membrane.

25|$|It {{has been}} shown that there is a two to {{threefold}} greater risk of having social phobia if a first-degree relative also has the disorder. This could be due to genetics and/or due to children acquiring social fears and avoidance through processes of observational learning or parental psychosocial education. Studies of identical twins brought up (via adoption) in different families have indicated that, if one twin developed social anxiety disorder, then the other was between 30 percent and 50 percent more likely than average to also develop the disorder. To some extent this 'heritability' may not be specific – for example, studies have found that if a parent has any kind of anxiety disorder or clinical depression, then a child is somewhat more likely to develop an anxiety disorder or social phobia. Studies suggest that parents of those with social anxiety disorder tend to be more socially isolated themselves (<b>Bruch</b> and Heimberg, 1994; Caster et al., 1999), and shyness in adoptive parents is significantly correlated with shyness in adopted children (Daniels and Plomin, 1985).|$|E
