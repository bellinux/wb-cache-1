5|$|While in Washington, Lead <b>Belly</b> {{encountered}} {{several other}} incidents of segregation that {{are believed to}} have contributed to the impetus of the song. For instance, when Lead <b>Belly,</b> Lomax, and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together, they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead <b>Belly</b> was told that if he returned later without Lomax, he would be served.|$|E
5|$|The second {{match was}} Scott Steiner versus Test {{in which the}} winner would earn the {{managing}} services of Stacy Keibler. In the early stages, both competitors wrestled inconclusively until Steiner performed a <b>Belly</b> to <b>belly</b> suplex on Test. Test attempted to hit Steiner with a chair but the chair hit Test. Steiner performed the Steiner Flatliner to win the match and Keibler's managing services.|$|E
5|$|Weapon turrets were {{mounted at}} {{the nose and}} the middle of {{aircraft}} underbelly. The nose turret could rotate +/- 100° from the aircraft's centerline and could mount either a 40mm (1.57in) grenade launcher, or a 7.62mm (0.308in) minigun. The <b>belly</b> turret included a 30mm (1.18in) automatic cannon with 360° of rotation. Mechanical stops prevented the <b>belly</b> turret from aiming at {{any part of the}} helicopter.|$|E
40|$|Commercial bacon {{processors}} often raise {{concerns regarding}} the management practice of frozen storage of the <b>bellies</b> prior to curing and processing for sliced bacon. Deterioration of quality measures {{is a concern}} and is usually attributed to freezer storage. A secondary issue, {{in the production of}} bacon including those processed from frozen <b>bellies,</b> is the effect of breed and sex of pigs. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to determine the effect of a 15 -day frozen storage time, the genetics, and sex of the pig on the quality and fatty acid profile of pork <b>bellies.</b> Frozen storage of fresh pork <b>bellies</b> did not pose any significant quality problems. However, significant differences in the fatty acid profile of fat from the <b>bellies</b> were observed between breeds of pigs. Fat accounts for about 60 % of the composition of a slice of bacon. Thus, fatty acid differences of fresh <b>bellies</b> due to breed effects may {{have a significant impact on}} bacon fatty acid composition...|$|R

5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} muscle tone is {{the main cause of}} a beer <b>belly,</b> rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer <b>belly.</b> But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E
5|$|M. c. leggei, {{described}} by Gregory Mathews in 1912, {{is found in}} eastern South Australia. Males in breeding plumage {{differ from those of}} subspecies cyanochlamys by having blue tinges on their <b>belly</b> below the chest band and on their wing remiges.|$|E
50|$|The yellow <b>bellied</b> weasel is an {{interesting}} animal that travels {{through most of the}} Thailand north countries. Most of the records came from hill evergreen Forrest and/or distributed habitats at elevations above 1,400 m. There are several characteristics of the yellow <b>bellied</b> weasel that are useful in distinguishing it from other weasel species. The basic color pattern of a yellow <b>bellied</b> weasel is rich mid-to dark brown above and yellowish to rich yellow below. It has a broad yellow patch from its throat extending past the front legs and along the venter (what is venter? is the underside or abdomen of an animal.) The yellow <b>bellied</b> weasel has a minimum head and body (165-280 mm). The tail is longer relatively to the head-body length.|$|R
50|$|Behavior of {{the yellow}} <b>bellied</b> weasel. The yellow <b>bellied</b> weasel roams by itself and doesn’t tend to travel with a pack (http://www.siamese-hertiag.org/nhbsspdf). It hunts and looks for food, it usually eats…..eat mostly rodents such as mice, rats, and voles. They will also eat birds and small mammals (Nowak and Paradiso 1983; Jha 1999) A yellow <b>bellied</b> weasel was once spotted with a frog in its mouth as it was seen it dropped the frog and then came back but didn’t eat it while being spotted (http://www.siamese-hertiag.org/nhbsspdf).|$|R
50|$|If any market, such as pork <b>bellies,</b> had no speculators, only {{producers}} (hog farmers) {{and consumers}} (butchers, etc.) would participate. With fewer {{players in the}} market, {{there would be a}} larger spread between the current bid and ask price of pork <b>bellies.</b> Any new entrant in the market who wanted to trade pork <b>bellies</b> would be forced to accept this illiquid market and might trade at market prices with large bid-ask spreads or even face difficulty finding a co-party to buy or sell to.|$|R

5|$|The Smoking Gunns defended their WWF Tag Team Championship in {{the next}} match against Owen Hart and his mystery partner, who was {{revealed}} to be Yokozuna. The Gunns worked together to control the match at the beginning, but Yokozuna gained control by performing a leg drop on Billy Gunn. Hart attempted to perform a dropkick from the top rope but accidentally hit Yokozuna. The Gunns briefly took control until Yokozuna performed a <b>belly</b> to <b>belly</b> suplex and landed on Billy. He then performed a Banzai Drop, jumping from the second rope and sitting on Billy's chest. Hart tagged in and considered performing the Sharpshooter submission hold; instead, he pinned Billy Gunn to win the title belts for his team.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the snake}} is subcylindrical, and is taller than it is wide. It has an upper surface that is {{typically}} a shade of blueish gray, while the <b>belly</b> is yellowish, with wide ventral scales that stretch from a third to {{more than half of}} the width of the body. Black rings of about uniform width are present throughout the length of the snake, but the rings narrow or are interrupted at the <b>belly.</b> The midbody is covered with 21 to 25 longitudinal rows of imbricate (overlapping) dorsal scales. The tail of the snake is paddle-shaped and adapted to swimming.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} match, {{which was}} not broadcast in the United Kingdom, pitted Crush against the Repo Man. Crush used his size advantage to perform a Gorilla press slam on Repo Man. Repo Man performed a back suplex, but Crush showed no sign that the move affected him. Crush continued to dominate the match with such moves as a <b>belly</b> to <b>belly</b> suplex. Repo Man eventually tried to attack Crush by jumping off the top rope, but Crush caught him and performed the Cranium Crunch to win the match by submission.|$|E
5|$|The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and {{scapular}} {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a brown {{spot on the}} nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and <b>belly</b> are grey-white. Its lower <b>belly</b> and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and {{the bottom of their}} breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|E
5|$|This bird is glossy {{black with}} a wide fork to the tail. Adults usually have a small white spot {{at the base of}} the gape. The iris is dark brown (not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo). The sexes cannot be told apart in the field. Juveniles are {{brownish}} and may have some white barring or speckling towards the <b>belly</b> and vent, and can be mistaken for the white-bellied drongo. First-year birds have white tips to the feathers of the <b>belly,</b> while second-years have these white-tipped feathers restricted to the vent.|$|E

5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal in the <b>belly</b> of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E
5|$|According to Human Rights Watch, the abdomens {{of three}} {{pregnant}} women were cut {{open and the}} foetus removed and thrown into a fire.
