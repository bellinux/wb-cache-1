5|$|Copenhagen {{itself has}} also been {{undergoing}} significant transformations in recent years with the encouragement of various projects along the waterfront. Based on initial planning work in the 1980s, the area has already seen the appearance of several prestige buildings including the <b>Black</b> <b>Diamond</b> national library extension (1999), the Opera House (2000) and the Royal Danish Playhouse (2004).|$|E

In West Virginia, Virginia Tech eked out a 2220 victory with a last-second field goal from placekicker Shayne Graham. It was Tech's closest victory {{of the season and}} moved the Hokies to the No.2 ranking in the country.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{traffic in}} the city grew {{significantly}} and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect Jan Gehl, pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre. Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with {{the closure of the}} Holmen naval base. Copenhagen Airport underwent considerable expansion, becoming a hub for the Nordic countries. In the 1990s, large-scale housing developments were realized in the harbour area and in the west of Amager. The national library's <b>Black</b> <b>Diamond</b> building on the waterfront was completed in 1999.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>Black</b> <b>Diamonds</b> {{is used in}} a {{derogatory}} {{way because}} people who {{are referred to as}} <b>Black</b> <b>Diamonds</b> are viewed by others as gauche nouveau riche/new money and showing poor taste by dressing in a gaudy way, wearing clothes and accessories with conspicuous name-brands (like Gucci or Prada), driving specific cars (like Mercedes Benz or BMWs), going to specific nightclubs (like ZAR, Cubana and News Café) and indulging generally in conspicuous consumption activities without restraint. They are viewed as being an avaricious caste with little regard for philanthropy or benevolent, typically African, social precepts like ubuntu. Many people who are considered <b>Black</b> <b>Diamonds</b> are hard working <b>black</b> people. <b>Black</b> <b>Diamonds</b> is similar to the concept of the WaBenzi.|$|R
5|$|The Hokies {{started the}} season well, winning their {{first four games}} in {{succession}} and culminating with a victory against West Virginia in the annual battle for the <b>Black</b> <b>Diamond</b> Trophy. The Hokies, who had begun the season ranked No. 21 in the country, rose to No. 14 by their fifth game of the season, a trip to Syracuse, New York, to play the Syracuse Orange. There, Virginia Tech suffered its first loss of the season, permitting 100-yard rushing games from Syracuse's Malcolm Thomas and Kirby Dar Dar, {{the last time the}} Hokies allowed two hundred-yard rushers in the same game. Tech responded to the loss by reeling off another three wins in succession. That winning streak ended at No. 6 Miami, when Tech lost its second game of the season, a loss that was followed by a season-ending defeat to perennial rival Virginia. The Hokies concluded the regular season with an 84 record overall and a 52 record in the Big East. Ironically, despite their season-ending loss to Virginia, the Hokies were awarded an invitation to the Gator Bowl over the Cavaliers, who lost to North Carolina State in their season-ending game. In addition to that loss, Gator Bowl officials later stated they were reluctant to invite an Atlantic Coast Conference team for a fourth straight year, thus opening the door for the Hokies from the Big East.|$|E

The hotel was designed by Adelaide architect William Wier. It opened as the White Horse Cellars Inn in 1851, with an integral 600seat theatre. Parts of the building were used for an early freemason hall, library and the Port Adelaide Institute.
