5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque <b>between</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians</b> created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|Laws {{governing}} the material support of terrorism proved contentious. It was {{criticized by the}} EFF for infringement of freedom of association. The EFF argues that had this law been enacted during Apartheid, U.S. citizens {{would not have been}} able to support the African National Congress (ANC) as the EFF believes the ANC would have been classed as a terrorist organization. They also used the example of a humanitarian social worker being unable to train Hamas members how to care for civilian children orphaned in the conflict <b>between</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> a lawyer being unable to teach IRA members about international law, and peace workers being unable to offer training in effective peace negotiations or how to petition the United Nations regarding human rights abuses.|$|E

25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat and they {{do not believe that the}} new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship <b>between</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think that should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E

2500|$|Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle {{added that}} [...] "the decisive steps" [...] towards {{practical}} statehood needed negotiations <b>between</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> [...] "In our view there are doubts {{over whether the}} desired move by the Palestinians today is supportive for the peace process. We fear it could lead rather to a hardening of views." [...] Indian Ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri said [...] "if there is a poor turnout, a poor vote, the radicals gain," [...] in expecting a high turnout to bolster Abbas' standing.|$|E
2500|$|... – [...] "Israel has {{committed}} an indefensible act," [...] the Swedish TT news agency quoted Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson as saying. [...] "It is disproportionate {{in terms of}} what the Palestinians have done," [...] Persson said. [...] "To go like that and remove part of a government and members of parliament is incompatible with international law." [...] Persson cast doubt on the possibility of an exchange of prisoners. The situation [...] "keeps getting worse and the dialogue <b>between</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians</b> has now become virtually impossible. It is ominous," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Marleau {{introduced}} several {{aid programs}} during her tenure as International Cooperation Minister.

2500|$|The {{new museum}} was {{dedicated}} on 15 March 2005 {{in the presence}} of leaders from 40 states and former Secretary General of the UN Kofi Annan. President of Israel Moshe Katzav said that Yad Vashem serves as [...] "an important signpost to all of humankind, a signpost that warns how short the distance is between hatred and murder, between racism and genocide". According to Jonathan Kis-Lev, in recent years the Museum was visited by a growing number of Palestinians, as part of efforts of various organizations to bridge the gap <b>between</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians.</b> [...] "Learning about the Holocaust," [...] Kis-Lev wrote, [...] "helped the Palestinian members of our binational group better understand the Jewish perspective, and was a turning point in improving our relationship." ...|$|E

[...] Pro-boycott demonstrators called for the AUT to maintain its course against what they described as [...] "unbelievable pressure", while anti-boycott demonstrators suggested that the decision had been influenced by antisemitism, and argued that the AUT's integrity was being threatened by a group of [...] "leftwing extremists". At the meeting the AUT membership decided to cancel the boycott of both Israeli universities. Reasons cited for the decision were: the damage to academic freedom, the hampering of dialogue and peace effort <b>between</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> and that boycotting Israel alone could not be justified.|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post {{review of}} the book noted, [...] "Prisoners is Jeffrey Goldberg’s sensitive, forthright and {{perceptive}} account of {{his years as a}} soldier and journalist in Israel—and of his long-running conversation with a Palestinian whom he once kept under lock and key. It is a forceful reminder of how rewarding, and how difficult, discourse <b>between</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Palestinians</b> can be.” CBS News critic wrote, [...] "There is no shortage of histories, polemics and policy manuals about the Middle East. An honest but complex story, from what happens to be a personal perspective that many Americans can at least conjure, is a rarer opportunity for insight. And that is what Jeffrey Goldberg, a reporter for The New Yorker, delivers in Prisoners. To {{those of us who have}} followed Jeffrey Goldberg’s reporting on the Muslim world, the publication of his first book is cause for real pleasure...because his writing on the subject has always been exceptional: wise, unpretentious, and at times, unexpectedly funny.” ...|$|E
