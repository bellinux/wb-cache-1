40|$|The future {{wireless}} communication systems {{are required to}} meet the growing demands of reliability, bandwidth capacity, and mobility. However, as corruptions such as fading effects, thermal noise, {{are present in the}} channel, the occurrence of errors is unavoidable. Motivated by this, the work in this dissertation attempts to improve the system performance by way of exploiting schemes which statistically reduce the error rate, and in turn boost the system throughput. The network can be studied using a simplified model, the two-way relay channel, where two parties exchange messages via the assistance of a relay in between. In such scenarios, this dissertation performs theoretical analysis of the system, and derives closed-form and upper bound expressions of the error probability. These theoretical measurements are potentially helpful references for the practical system design.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{analysis}} suggests that three stages {{can be identified}} in the post-rift Cretaceous development of the northern North Sea, namely the incipient (Ryazanian–latest Albian), the middle (Cenomanian–late Turonian) and the mature (early Coniacian–early Palaeocene). The transition from syn- to post-rift configur-ation was strongly diachronous, suggesting that the thermal state of the system was not homogeneous {{at the onset of}} the post-rift stage. This is supported by observed differences between the early post-rift subsidence histories of the southern Viking Graben, the Stord Basin and the Sogn Graben. The incipient post-rift stage was characterized by diverse subsidence. The major structural features inherited from the syn-rift basin (e. g. crests of rotated fault <b>blocks,</b> <b>relay</b> ramps and sub-platforms) had a strong influence on the basin configuration and, therefore, the sediment distribution. In the middle stage the internal basin relief became gradually drowned by sediments. This is typical for basins where sediment supply outpaces or balances subsidence, as was the case in the northern North Sea. Thus, the influence of the syn-rift basin topography become subordinate to th...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} coding {{paradigm}} {{that provides a}} new achievable rate for the primitive relay channel by combining compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward with a chaining construction. In the primitive relay channel model, the source broadcasts {{a message to the}} relay and to the destination; and the relay facilitates this communication by sending an additional message to the destination through a separate channel. Two well-known coding approaches for this setting are decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward: in the former, the relay decodes the message and sends some of the information to the destination; in the latter, the relay does not attempt to decode, but it sends a compressed description of the received sequence to the destination via Wyner-Ziv coding. In our scheme, we transmit over pairs of blocks and we use compress-and-forward for the first block and decode-and-forward for the second. In particular, in the first <b>block,</b> the <b>relay</b> does not attempt to decode and it sends only a part of the compressed description of the received sequence; in the second <b>block,</b> the <b>relay</b> decodes the message and sends this information plus the remaining part of the compressed sequence relative to the first block. As a result, we strictly outperform both compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward. Furthermore, this paradigm can be implemented with a low-complexity polar coding scheme that has the typical attractive features of polar codes, i. e., quasi-linear encoding/decoding complexity and super-polynomial decay of the error probability. Throughout the paper we consider as a running example the special case of the erasure relay channel and we compare the rates achievable by our proposed scheme with the existing upper and lower bounds.
