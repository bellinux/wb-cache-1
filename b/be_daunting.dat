25|$|Henry James (1843–1916) {{confronted the}} Old World-New World dilemma by writing {{directly}} about it. Although {{he was born}} in New York City, James spent most of his adult life in England. Many of his novels center on Americans who live in or travel to Europe. With its intricate, highly qualified sentences and dissection of emotional and psychological nuance, James's fiction can <b>be</b> <b>daunting.</b> Among his more accessible works are the novellas Daisy Miller, about an American girl in Europe, and The Turn of the Screw, a ghost story.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, the Tri-State Transportation Commission {{along with}} the Regional Plan Association {{proposed}} an extension further northward to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. The two agencies saw the proposed freeway {{as an integral part}} of starting Hudson River development of the communities in its path. The agencies also noted it was also be an important part of preserving the New Jersey Palisades, a mountain range in northern New Jersey. However, constructing this freeway was halted when problems relating to engineering such a highway, the economic cost, and environmental concerns arose. The political community also had an issue in constructing the highway, as creating a six-lane freeway through the established communities would <b>be</b> <b>daunting.</b> $3 billion (1966 USD) was allocated for the construction of the Route 85 Freeway from the Holland Tunnel to the George Washington Bridge. Local residents demanded an agency be included in the plan to preserve the Palisades and that it be done quick. The proposed price to construct the Route 85 Freeway in 1969 had ballooned from the original $18 million to $110 million (1969 USD).|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Carol Case and Hawley {{worked closely}} together to develop Fargo costumes. Case saw {{the show as}} a big undertaking because of her desire to capture the [...] "specific feeling" [...] of 1970s fashion. Starting [...] "from scratch", the design team sought to create a [...] "really small-town America" [...] style {{for most of the}} show's wardrobe. They also felt {{that it was important to}} distinguish the style of the rural characters, who at that time were largely unaware of fashion trends, from that of the urban characters. For the urban characters, Case used clothes she bought from New York to create a more polished, sleek look. Though Fargo producers bought a few pieces months in advance of production, sourcing vintage wear proved to <b>be</b> <b>daunting,</b> especially for cold weather, since much of the available supply was inadequately insulated. As a consequence, many costumes, such as Dunst's, were either modified by adding insulation, or created anew by the design team. Some modern pieces were used for footwear and accessories.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly afterwards, in October 2011, [...] RIM {{unveiled}} BBX, a new {{platform for}} future BlackBerry smartphones {{that would be}} based on the same QNX-based platform as the PlayBook. However, due to an accusation of trademark infringement regarding the name BBX, the platform was renamed BlackBerry 10. The task proved to <b>be</b> <b>daunting,</b> with the company delaying the launch in December 2011 to some time in 2012. On January 22, 2012, Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie resigned as the CEOs of the company, handing the reins over to executive Thorsten Heins. On March 29, 2012, the company reported its first net loss in years. Heins set about the task of restructuring the company, including announcing plans to lay off 5,000 employees, replacing numerous executives, and delaying the new QNX-based operating system for phones ("BlackBerry 10") a second time into January 2013.|$|E
2500|$|The engine {{selected}} for the new interceptor was Nakajima's Ha-41 (a development of the Nakajima Ha-5) 14-cylinder double-row radial, originally intended for bomber aircraft. Although the Ha-41 was not the ideal choice due to its large-diameter cross section, the design team was able to marry this engine to a much smaller fuselage with a narrow cross section. At 1,260mm in diameter, the Ha-41 was 126mm larger in diameter than the 1,144mm Nakajima Sakae (used in the Mitsubishi A6M [...] "Zero" [...] and Nakajima Ki-43 [...] "Hayabusa"). However, the Sakae was only 27.8L in displacement and 1,000hp, while the Ha-41 was 37.5L and made 1,260hp (1,440 in the later Ha-109 version). In any case, since the Sakae wasn't powerful enough, the only alternative available was the Mitsubishi Kinsei, which was slightly smaller than the Ha-41 in diameter, five liters smaller in displacement, and was less powerful. Unfortunately, this was already in demand for many other aircraft, so the Ha-41 {{was chosen as the}} best powerplant. In order to achieve its design goals, the wing area was relatively small leading to a high wing loading and a comparatively high landing speed that could <b>be</b> <b>daunting</b> to the average Japanese pilot, who was more used to aircraft with a low wing loading like the Ki-44s predecessors, the Ki-43 and Ki-27.|$|E
