60|$|I {{took up the}} 'Christian Scientist' {{book and}} read half of it, then took a dipperful of drench and read the other half. The {{resulting}} experiences were full of interest and adventure. All through the rumblings and grindings and quakings and effervescings accompanying {{the evolution of the}} ache into the botts and the cold into the <b>blind</b> <b>staggers</b> I could note the generous struggle for mastery going on between the mash and the drench and the literature; and often I could tell which was ahead, and could easily distinguish the literature from the others when the others were separate, though not when they were mixed; for when a bran-mash and an eclectic drench are mixed together they look just like the Apodictical Principle out on a lark, and no one can tell it from that. The finish was reached at last, the evolutions were complete and a fine success; but I think that this result could have been achieved with fewer materials. I believe the mash was necessary to the conversion of the stomach-ache into the boots, but I think one could develop the <b>blind</b> <b>staggers</b> out of the literature by itself; also, that <b>blind</b> <b>staggers</b> produced in this way would be of a better quality and more lasting than any produced by the artificial processes of a horse-doctor.|$|E

60|$|We {{build our}} churches almost {{without regard to}} cost; we rear an edifice which is an {{adornment}} to the town, and we gild it, and fresco it, and mortgage it, and {{do everything we can}} think of to perfect it, and then spoil it all by putting a bell on it which afflicts everybody who hears it, giving some the headache, others St. Vitus's dance, and the rest the <b>blind</b> <b>staggers.</b>|$|E
60|$|Before the man's companions {{realized}} {{what had happened}} Billy had possessed himself of the fallen club and struck {{one of them a}} <b>blinding,</b> <b>staggering</b> blow across the eyes. Then number three pulled his gun and fired point-blank at Billy. The bullet tore through the mucker's left shoulder. It would have sent a more highly organized and nervously inclined man to the pavement; but Billy was neither highly organized nor nervously inclined, so that about the only immediate effect it had upon him was to make him mad--before he had been but peeved--peeved at the rank crust that had permitted these cheap-skates from south of Twelfth Street to work his territory.|$|R

40|$|Selenium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{interesting}} of all nutrients. It was first known for its toxicity and was then discovered to be an essential nutrient. The power of its antioxidant activity has been widely acclaimed. The importance of selenium in immune response and as an anticarcinogen has recently received a great amount of attention. In fact, selenium has been claimed to have a protective role in at least 50 diseases of humans (Reilly, 1996). However, Reilly pointed out the evidence is not yet convincing for many of the claims. Casey (1988) rightfully stressed that the claims of many selenophiles might be exaggerated. Selenium is not a panacea. However, there is evidence that selenium can have enormous health benefits for animals and humans. Selenium as a Toxin Selenium was first identified as a toxin in the 1930 s. Alkali disease of horses and cattle was shown to be caused by selenium. Signs in the horse included hair loss from mane and tail, sloughing of hooves, joint erosion and lameness. <b>Blind</b> <b>staggers</b> characterized by ataxia, blindness, head pressing and respiratory failure...|$|E
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{selenium}} {{in the environment}} will be a prominent water quality issue in the western United States for many years. Selenium accumulation is linked to increased rates of death and deformity in migratory birds, <b>blind</b> <b>staggers</b> in livestock, and selenosis in humans. In California, agricultural drain waters and oil refinery effluent contribute to high selenium content in the San Joaquin Valley and the San Francisco Bay. The importance of these industries to California`s economy precludes simple abatement, while the complexity of selenium cycling precludes simple remediation. The purpose of this project is to measure variations in the isotopic composition of selenium in water and soil samples caused by natural processes and to show, for the first time, the value of isotopic measurements in characterizing selenium pollution. The research seeks to identify sources of selenium pollution, determine processes in the selenium cycle, and support selenium remediation studies. The project required the successful integration of three components: (1) appropriate sampling a field setting showing Se enrichment and possibly isotopic fractionation, (2) analytical chemical methods for isolating and purifying the various species of Se in waters and sediment, and (3) mass spectroscopic instrumentation for high precision isotope abundance measurements...|$|E
40|$|Selenium {{belongs to}} the Ⅵb group of the {{periodic}} table,and possesses both metallic and nonmetallic characteristics. Physicochemical properties of selenium resemble more or less those of sulfur,and selenium may be indiscriminately incorporated in place of sulfur in cellular constituents and disturb metabolism. Alkali disease and <b>blind</b> <b>stagger</b> disease of livestock are caused by selenium-polluted grass. Carcinogenic effect {{is also one of}} the marked biological properties of selenium. In spite of the toxic and carcinogenic effects,selenium is actually an essential trace element for bacteria,fish,and mammals. Life has exploied the high reactivity and unique characteristics of organoselenium compounds,especially in the form of selenoenzymes. Mammalian glutathione peroxidase(EC 1. 11. 1. 9) has selenocysteine residue at the active site, and the enzyme plays a central role in the biological defense system against oxidative challenge by activated oxygens and radicals. The author has studied the low redox potential and high reactivity of selenium-containing compounds, and developed glutathione peroxidase mimics. Glutaselenone, a selenium analog of glutaheione, catalyzes a glutathione peroxidase like reaction in vitro. Studies on the mechanisum of glutaselenone-catalyzed reaction revealed that glutaselenone is converted to a selenosulfide conjugate with glutathione in its catalysis. Thioredoxins contain a conserved sequence,Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys, which is known to form intramolecular disulfide bond with consecutive β-turn conformations. THe peptide is expected to serve as an template for intramolecular selenosulfide bond formation when either the cysteine is replaced by selenocystein. A tetrapeptide,Secys-Gly-Pro-Cys, was synthesized chemically. It showed glutathione peroxidase-like activity three times as high as glutaselenone. The high catalytic activity is ascribed to an intramolecular selenosulfide bond formation in the catalytic reaction. セレンは 2 -、 0 、 2 +、 4 +、 6 +と多彩な酸化還元状態をとるという点で金属的な性質を持つ。また有機セレン化合物として求核的・求電子的な反応性に関与できるという点で酸素や硫黄などの典型元素のような振る舞いをする。生命は進化の過程で、セレンのユニークな化学的特性をうまく利用し、グルタチオンペルオキシダーゼなどのセレン酵素を獲得してきたと考えられる。セレン酵素の研究に触発されて、セレン酵素化合物を医薬品として利用する研究が進められており注目を集めている。このような背景のもと、グルタセレノンとテトラペプチドを合成した。とくにテトラペプチドはグルタセレノンの反応機構研究から生まれたペプチドである。今後さらに高い活性を持つ人工酵素がデザインされ、合成されるだろう。その時、鋳型として蛋白質や核酸、オリゴ糖などある特定のコンフォメーションをとる生体物質が利用されると思われる...|$|R
60|$|In {{another moment}} the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had rushed upon me. I screamed aloud, and scalded, half <b>blinded,</b> agonised, I <b>staggered</b> through the leaping, hissing water towards the shore. Had my foot stumbled, {{it would have}} been the end.

6000|$|Two {{nights ago}} the club had its first meeting; only twelve were present, {{but it went}} very well.

40|$|An {{imaginative and}} {{elaborate}} parody on the upcoming 1844 presidential campaign. The artist favors Whig nominee-apparent Henry Clay and is {{highly critical of}} incumbent John Tyler. The "chase" for the presidency leads to the White House (upper left) where Robert Tyler arouses his sleeping father saying, "Come wake up old Sampson, the Philistines are upon you!" President Tyler replies with a yawn: "Why Bobby my Pippin! I do believe I've been asleep! no matter I'm the People's favorite and belong to no Party. They will reelect me! If they don't I'll veto the whole concern d [...] n me!" His statement {{and the presence of}} a "Veto" paper on his desk allude to his liberal use of the presidential refusal to stymie Whig congressional efforts to establish a National Bank. In Robert Tyler's pocket is a scroll "Irish Repeal," referring to his support of that international movement. Approaching the steps of the White House, riding a beast which is half-horse and half-alligator (a mythical animal associated in popular lore with Clay's Kentucky), is Henry Clay. He exclaims triumphantly, "Hurrah! Old Kentuck will distance them all yet, and then the views of the lamented Harrisson will be carried out in full, and treachery will meet its reward. " The sun rises behind him and an eagle with a streamer reading "E pluribus unum" flies ahead. Clay is followed by South Carolina Democrat John Calhoun, who remarks, "My old nullification Coota Turtle is rather a slow Coach! I am afraid he won't get out of this Clay Bank!" Taking the lower road (in keeping with his reputation for intrigue) is Martin Van Buren, riding a fox and exclaiming, "Confound Calhoun! He is right in my way! I'll take a short cut and though the path is crooked and rather dirty, I don't care so that I get in. " Van Buren was derisively nicknamed "the Kinderhook fox. " On the same path are two more presidential aspirants, James K. Polk(?) and Richard M. Johnson. The first, sitting on a donkey and waving a club, yells, "I'am an Old Soldier, but I shall never get in unless I can turn this Donkeys head the right way. " Johnson, who has fallen off his horse, exclaims, "My old amalgamation Nag has got the <b>blind</b> <b>staggers!</b> and I can stump it no longer!" "Amalgamation" was common parlance for the melding of races, more specifically referring here to Johnson's common-law marriage and offspring with a mulatto woman, Julia Chinn. Off to the right, Massachusetts senator Daniel Webster sits by an open fire, cooking a cauldron of "Chowder" (a staple of his native New England), vowing, "I shant leave my Chowder! unless my country calls me. " Behind him on horseback is Gen. Winfield Scott who calls over to War of 1812 Commodore Charles Stewart, seated in a boat on a lake, "Odds bullets and bayonets! I don't care about being President but if my friends insist upon it I'll serve! I say Commodore, cant you or I get in by a Coup-de-main!" Stewart replies, "I think not General! so I'll haul my wind! I am better fitted to govern the helm of old Ironsides than the helm of State. " In the lower right corner, a man (possibly Supreme Court Justice John McLean) falls head first down an incline, saying, "If I thought I had a drop of Democratic blood in my veins I would let it out.

50|$|Mikos {{makes his}} way to the Bennetts' home, and begins to murder {{everyone}} there. Peggy, a family friend, is stabbed {{in the head with a}} pickaxe, and the babysitter has her head forced into a lit oven and is stabbed in the throat with a pair of scissors, but not before sending the brother off to get help. Katia struggles from her bed to take on the killer herself. Mikos breaks into Katia's bedroom and attacks her, but she manages to stab him in the eyes with a set of drawing compasses. She then stumbles down the hallway as the <b>blinded</b> killer <b>staggers</b> after her. He stalks her through the house, but Katia manages to elude him. The priest arrives and struggles with Mikos, and Katia grabs an axe from a decorative suit of armor and decapitates Mikos with it. The police and the rest of the family arrive to discover Katia standing in the doorway, covered in blood holding Mikos's severed head.|$|R
50|$|Having a 38-0 {{record with}} 32 KOs he fought the future {{champion}} Ken Norton in a prime time network television bout in May 1977. Both fighters appeared tight and cautious {{from the opening}} bell. Norton suddenly connected with an unexpected overhand right flush onto Bobick's chin. He staggered wildly unable to clinch and avoid Norton's furious assault. Norton trapped Bobick in a corner landing several roundhouse rights. One of the punches that connected was a right uppercut that caught Bobick in the throat. <b>Staggered,</b> <b>blind</b> from his tearing eyes {{as a result of}} the throat punch and walloped by another huge right hand, Bobick went to the canvas face first. He rose as the count reached ten. Duane swayed on unsteady legs and the bout was stopped. The fight officially lasted just 58 seconds, but the actual length of the contest was about 70 seconds. Trainer Joe Frazier had apparently advised Bobick not to take the fight.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he flashed}} forth his bright sword and leaped upon Will Stutely, {{thinking}} {{he would take}} him unaware; but Stutely had his own sword tightly held in his hand, beneath his robe, so he drew it forth before the constable came upon him. Then the stout constable struck a mighty blow; but he struck no more in all that fight, for Stutely, parrying the blow right deftly, smote the constable back again with all his might. Then he would have escaped, but could not, for the other, all dizzy with the wound and with the flowing blood, seized him by the knees with his arms even as he reeled and fell. Then the others rushed upon him, and Stutely struck again at another of the Sheriff's men, but the steel cap glanced the blow, and though the blade bit deep, it did not kill. Meanwhile, the constable, fainting as he was, drew Stutely downward, and the others, seeing the yeoman hampered so, rushed upon him again, and one smote him a blow upon the crown so that the blood ran down his face and <b>blinded</b> him. Then, <b>staggering,</b> he fell, and all sprang upon him, though he struggled so manfully that they could hardly hold him fast. Then they bound him with stout hempen cords {{so that he could}} not move either hand or foot, and thus they overcame him.|$|R
6000|$|Another {{book which}} shows the romance and the heroism which still linger upon earth is that large copy of the [...] "Voyage of the Discovery in the Antarctic" [...] by Captain Scott. Written in plain sailor fashion with no attempt at over-statement or colour, it none the less (or perhaps all the more) leaves a deep {{impression}} upon the mind. As one reads it, and reflects on what one reads, one seems to get {{a clear view of}} just those qualities which make the best kind of Briton. Every nation produces brave men. Every nation has men of energy. But there is a certain type which mixes its bravery and its energy with a gentle modesty and a boyish good-humour, and it is just this type which is the highest. Here the whole expedition seem to have been imbued with the spirit of their commander. No flinching, no grumbling, every discomfort taken as a jest, no thought of self, each working only for the success of the enterprise. When you have read of such privations so endured and so chronicled, it makes one ashamed to show emotion over the small annoyances of daily life. Read of Scott's <b>blinded,</b> scurvy-struck party <b>staggering</b> on to their goal, and then complain, if you can, of the heat of a northern sun, or the dust of a country road.|$|R
