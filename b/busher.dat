25|$|Sydney Edmund <b>Busher</b> (19 December 1882 – 28 May 1953) was an English cricketer {{who played}} five {{first-class}} games, one for Surrey and four for Worcestershire. Of his 26 first-class wickets, 22 were bowled and four caught.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{had played}} (with little {{personal}} success) in a minor match for Gentlemen of Surrey v Gentlemen of Netherlands at The Oval in August 1906, Busher's first-class debut did not come until April 1908, when he represented Surrey against Gentlemen of England cricket team at the same venue. Busher's maiden first-class victim was a highly illustrious one: he bowled the opposition captain W. G. Grace, who was making his final first-class appearance {{at the age of}} 59. <b>Busher</b> repeated this feat in the second innings, and finished with match figures of 7-92 as well as making 52 (his only fifty) as Surrey won by an innings.|$|E

500|$|Joining the Maple Leafs for the 1929–30 season, 18-year-old Jackson was the {{youngest}} player in the National Hockey League (NHL).

One year later, he was instrumental in the Leafs' comeback in the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals. [...] He scored the tying and winning goals in Toronto's 3–1 victory in the seventh game against the Detroit Red Wings to win the Stanley Cup, a moment described as being one of his greatest thrills in hockey.
