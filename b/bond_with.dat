30|$|The {{results are}} shown in Table  1. As with dry-bending strength, the wet-MOR of CA boards was {{lower than that of}} boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF and pMDI. However, the wet-MOE of boards was higher than those of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF and pMDI. The wet-MOR value of the board under {{effective}} conditions satisfied the type 13 requirement of JIS A 5908 (> 6.5  MPa) [19]. SH of the board was lower than that of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF and pMDI, probably because the CA made particles brittle [31]. Gambhir and Jamwal [32] reported that brittle particles absorbed very little energy. This means that boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA seemed to result in weak holding power for screws. The SH value of the board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA satisfied type 8 standard of JIS A 5908 (> 300  N) [19]. As to the formaldehyde emission test, the board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA did not emit formaldehyde, such as the boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> pMDI and PF. The formaldehyde emission value of the board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA was lower than the F**** criteria of the lowest formaldehyde emission of JIS A 5908 standard [19]. Thus, boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA are environmentally friendly.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the mean shear bond strength of molar tubes <b>with</b> micro-etched bases <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> either a compomer (Ultra Band-Lok), a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (3 M Multi-Cure or Fuji Ortho LC), or a light-cured resin adhesive (Transbond). The amount of adhesive remaining on the tooth surface following tube removal was assessed also. Finally, survival time of molar tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> each <b>bonding</b> agent was assessed following simulated mechanical fatigue in a ball mill. A total of 120 extracted human third molars were collected and randomly divided into 4 test groups. Thirty teeth (20 to assess debonding force and 10 to assess survival time) were <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> each adhesive according to the manufacturers' instructions. Debonding was carried out using a Nene M 3000 testing machine with a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The mean shear bond strength of tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Transbond was significantly {{less than that of}} those <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> 3 M Multi-Cure (P =. 0036) or Fuji Ortho LC (P <. 0001). Tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Ultra Band-Lok also had significantly lower mean shear bond strength than those <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Fuji Ortho LC (P =. 020). Distribution of adhesive remnant index scores only differed significantly between tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> 3 M Multi-Cure or Transbond. Only 1 molar tube, <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Transbond, debonded in the ball mill at 5 hours, but at 50 hours {{there was no significant difference}} in the survival time of tubes <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> any of the bonding agents. Compomer or resin-modified glass ionomer cements appear to be viable alternatives to light-cured resin adhesive for bonding molar tubes...|$|R

30|$|The mass {{losses of}} {{specimens}} during the 12 -week fungal decay tests are also presented in Table  2. The mass losses of the boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA {{exposed to the}} brown-rot fungus were quite {{similar to those of}} boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF and pMDI. However, the mass losses of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA and exposed to the white-rot fungus were higher than those of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PF. On the other hand, they were lower than those of the board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> pMDI. In addition, the degree of mass losses of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> CA was much lower than that of solid wood specimens (Cryptomeria japonica). In a previous study, Despot et al. [35] demonstrated that wood modified by CA had the greatest protection against decay. They also mentioned that the enhancement of decay resistance in wood modified by CA was exclusively the result of the cross-linking of CA and hydroxyl groups of the wood components. Therefore, the boards had good resistance against decay.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study aims to {{evaluate}} the resistance of three types of particleboard panels to biodeterioration, two of which <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> synthetic resins and one <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PVC plastic. Composite panels were made using sugar cane straw particles as raw material which were <b>bonded</b> together <b>with</b> urea-formaldehyde (UF), tannin-formaldehyde (TANI) and PVC plastic (PVC) resins. Decay tests were performed following procedures outlined in the ASTM D 2017 - 81 / 1994 standard, whereby sample specimens were subjected to attack by white rot fungus Trametes versicolor and brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum using pine (Pinus sp.) and embaúba (Cecropia sp.) as reference timber. Panels <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> PVC resin were rated resistant to attack by both fungi while those <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> UF and TANI resins were rated slightly resistant to their attack...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{appraise}} the opportunities {{provided by a}} new class of composites based on using basalt fibers <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> a cement-based matrix as an innovative strengthening material for confinement of reinforced concrete members. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is assessed by comparing different confinement schemes on concrete cylinders: (1) uniaxial glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates; (2) alkali-resistant fiberglass grids <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> a cement-based mortar; (3) bidirectional basalt laminates preimpregnated with epoxy resin or latex and then <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> a cement-based mortar; and (4) a cement-based mortar jacket. The study showed that confinement based on basalt fibers <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> a cement-based mortar could be a promising solution to overcome some limitations of epoxy-based FRP laminates...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of different prophylaxis pastes on shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Self-Etch Primer (SEP). Methods: Two hundred human premolars were divided into 4 equal groups. In Group 1 (control), no prophylaxis was done prior to <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> SEP. In Groups 2 - 4 different prophylaxis pastes, that is, pumice, nonfluoridated and fluoridated pastes were used respectively. After bonding, the samples were debonded using a universal testing machine at a cross head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Results: The shear bond strength (MPa) for Group 1 - 4 was 5. 99, 7. 51, 7. 57, and 7. 71, respectively. Conclusions: The result shows that the shear bond strength of brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> SEP without prior prophylaxis produces statistically significant lower bond strength as compared to brackets which were <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> prior prophylaxis treatments. The shear bond strengths of orthodontic brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> SEP with prior prophylaxis with various prophylaxis pastes were not statistically different from each other. The use of fluoridated prophylaxis pastes did not adversely affect bond strength of orthodontic brackets <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> SEP...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{adhesive}} resistance of metallic brackets bonded to temporary crowns made of acrylic resin after different surface treatments. METHODS: 180 specimens {{were made of}} Duralay and randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 30) according to surface treatment and bonding material: G 1 - surface roughening <b>with</b> Soflex and <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> Duralay; G 2 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting and <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> Duralay; G 3 - application of monomer and <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> Duralay; G 4 - roughening <b>with</b> Soflex and <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> Transbond XT; G 5 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting and <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> Transbond XT and G 6 : application of monomer and <b>bonding</b> <b>with</b> Transbond. The results were statistically assessed by ANOVA/Games-Howell. RESULTS: The means (MPa) were: G 1 = 18. 04, G 2 = 22. 64, G 3 = 22. 4, G 4 = 9. 71, G 5 = 11. 23, G 6 = 9. 67. The Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) ranged between 2 and 3 on G 1, G 2 and G 3 whereas in G 4, G 5 and G 6 it ranged from 0 to 1, showing that only the material affects the pattern of adhesive flaw. CONCLUSION: The surface treatment and the material influenced adhesive resistance of brackets bonded to temporary crowns. Roughening by aluminum blasting increased bond strength when compared to Soflex, in the group <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> Duralay. The <b>bond</b> strength of Duralay acrylic resin was superior to that of Transbond XT composite resin...|$|R

30|$|The {{search for}} new {{value-added}} uses for oilseed and animal proteins led us to develop protein-based wood adhesives. Low-fat soy and peanut flours and blood meal were hydrolyzed in an alkaline state, and PF-cross-linked protein resins were formulated by reacting the protein hydrolyzates with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) in solid-tosolid ratios ranging from 70 % to 50 % hydrolyzates and 30 % to 50 % PF. Physical properties of medium density fiberboard (MDF) <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> protein-based phenolic resins were compared to those of boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> ureaformaldehyde (UF) and PF resins, and flakeboard <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> soy protein-based phenolic resin was compared to PF-bonded board. As MDF binders, adhesive properties of protein-based phenolic resins depended upon protein content of proteinacious materials. MDF board <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> blood-based phenolic resin was comparable to PF-bonded board and met the requirements for exterior MDF. Boards <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> soy-protein-based phenolic resin met requirements for interior MDF, while peanut-based phenolic failed to {{meet some of the}} requirements. Flakeboard <b>bonded</b> <b>with</b> soy-protein-based phenolic resins was inferior to PF-bonded board but outperformed PF-bonded board in accelerated aging tests. Although they exhibit a slow curing rate, the cost effectiveness and superior dimensional stability of protein-based phenolic resins may make them attractive for some uses.|$|R
