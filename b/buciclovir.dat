40|$|Five {{herpes simplex}} virus mutants known or presumed to contain {{mutations}} in their DNA polymerase genes conferring resistance to acyclovir and arabinosyladenine also proved to exhibit some degree of resistance to (R) - 9 -(3, 4 -dihydroxybutyl) guanine (<b>buciclovir).</b> For one mutant, a <b>buciclovir</b> resistance mutation was mapped to a region of the viral DNA polymerase gene proposed to encode the deoxynucleoside 5 '-triphosphate binding domain. These data implicate the viral polymerase as a target of <b>buciclovir</b> action that contributes to its antiviral selectivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the anti-herpesvirus drug <b>buciclovir</b> [(R) - 9 -(3, 4 -dihydroxybutyl) guanine] was investigated in guinea pigs and mice infected intravaginally with herpes simplex virus type 2. Topical treatment initiated early after infection was efficacious, in contrast to topical treatment delayed 24 h or more. Systemic treatment of infected mice could not {{prevent the spread of}} virus to the brain and mortality. Systemically administered <b>buciclovir</b> had an effect in guinea pigs, even after delayed onset of treatment, but this effect required high doses of the drug. Our results suggest that <b>buciclovir</b> has only a limited effect against herpesvirus infections once the virus is present in the nervous systems of infected animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{herpesvirus}} DNA polymerase inhibitor foscarnet, applied topically, and the anti-herpesvirus guanosine analogue <b>buciclovir,</b> given orally, decreased {{virus replication}} and disease development in primary skin infections of mice caused by herpes implex virus type 1 (HSV- 1). If the same tissues were infected via sensory nerves, following zosteriform {{spread of the}} virus the same treatments showed strongly decreased efficacy, or were inefficacious, when started before d velopment of clinical signs in the infected tissues. These results were obtained in murine models of zosteriform spread of HSV- 1 to the ear (following inoculation of the ventral side of the neck) or to the lower flank (following inoculation of the upper flank). In these models the immune system played a dominant role in virus clearance. The topically applied foscarnet could not prevent disease development in these models of recrudescent disease ven when applied before the virus was detected in the skin, but a decrease in virus titre was obtained. Orally administered <b>buciclovir</b> lost efficacy when adminis-tered {{at the time of}} virus entry into the skin, i. e. 1 or 2 days before development of clinical signs. In the flank model, measuring lesion development, orally administere...|$|E
40|$|The {{triphosphates}} of the antiherpesvirus acyclic guanosine analogs 9 -[4 -hydroxy- 2 (hydroxymethyl) butyl] guanine (2 HM-HBG), 9 -(2 -hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine (acyclovir [ACV]), and 9 -(3, 4 -dihydroxybutyl) guanine (<b>buciclovir)</b> {{were examined}} for {{their effects on}} partially purified varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA polymerase as well as cellular DNA polymerase alpha. The triphosphate of 2 HM-HBG competitively inhibited the incorporation of dGMP into DNA catalyzed by the VZV DNA polymerase. 2 HM-HBG-triphosphate (2 HM-HBG-TP) had a higher affinity for the dGTP-binding site on the VZV DNA polymerase than did dGTP; apparent Km and Ki values of dGTP and 2 HM-HBG-TP were 0. 64 and 0. 034 microM, respectively. ACV-triphosphate (ACV-TP) {{was found to be}} the most potent inhibitor of VZV DNA polymerase. ACV-TP had a 14 and 464 times better direct inhibitory effect than 2 HM-HBG-TP and buciclovir-triphosphate, respectively. The cellular (human embryonic lung fibroblast) DNA polymerase alpha inhibition was related to viral polymerase inhibition as efficacy ratios: 2 HM-HBG-TP had a ratio of more than 1, 000, which appeared to be similar to that of ACV-TP...|$|E
40|$|Human {{herpesvirus}} 6 (HHV- 6) {{was examined}} in vitro for its sensitivity {{to a broad}} range of nucleoside analogues, including acyclovir (ACV), ganciclovir (GCV), penciclovir (PCV), <b>buciclovir</b> (BCV), brivudin (BVDU), the N 7 -isomer of 6 -deoxyganciclovir (S 2242), foscarnet (phosphonoformic acid, PFA), and several acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (ANP) analogues such as (S) -HPMPA, (S) -HPMPC, PMEA and PMEDAP. Antiviral efficacy was monitored microscopically by the inhibitory effect of the compounds on HHV- 6 -induced cytopathic effect in human T-lymphoblastoid HSB- 2 cells. In addition, a newly developed immunofluorescence/flow cytometric assay (FACS) was used to determine HHV- 6 -specific antigen expression. A close correlation was observed between the antiviral data obtained by the microscopic assay and the flow cytometric assay. Marked antiviral efficacy was noted for S 2242, PFA and the ANP analogues (S) -HPMPA, (S) -HPMPC, (S) -cHPMPC, (S) - 3 -deaza-HPMPA, (S) - 3 -deaza-cHPMPA, (S) -HPMPG and (R) -HPMPG. Also, PMEA and PMEDAP proved highly active against HHV- 6 infection, whereas (S) -FPMPA and (R) -PMPDAP were inactive. ACV was only slightly protective against HHV- 6, and no activity was found for GCV, PCV, BCV and BVDU. Overall, the efficacy of the nucleoside analogues against HHV- 6 appeared to correlate with their efficacy against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{selective}} antiherpetic compounds {{were found to}} exert pronounced cytostatic activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) and type 2 (HSV- 2) thymidine kinase (TK) gene-transfected mammary carcinoma FM 3 A cells. Based on their potency and mechanism of cytostatic action, the antiherpetic compounds could {{be divided into two}} different classes. The first class encompasses (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine and structurally related analogues thereof [i. e., the cytosine derivative (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxycytidine and the 4 '-thio derivative (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxy- 4 '-thiouridine]. These compounds are exquisitely cytostatic against FM 3 A/TK-/HSV- 1 TK+ and FM 3 A/TK-/HSV- 2 TK+ cells (50 % inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0. 047 to 0. 001 microM) and inhibit tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting cellular thymidylate synthase. The second class consists of the acyclic guanosine derivatives penciclovir, <b>buciclovir,</b> and ganciclovir. These compounds are also more inhibitory to the HSV- 1 TK or HSV- 2 TK gene-transfected FM 3 A cells than to FM 3 A/ 0 or FM 3 A/TK- cells, but at concentrations that are higher than the concentrations at which the (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine derivatives proved to be inhibitory. These acyclic guanosine analogues appear to be targeted at the cellular DNA polymerase. From this study, (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxy- 4 '-thiouridine emerged as a promising candidate compound for the treatment of HSV- 1 TK gene-transfected tumors in vivo, due to its metabolic stability (i. e., resistance to hydrolysis by thymidine phosphorylase). status: publishe...|$|E
