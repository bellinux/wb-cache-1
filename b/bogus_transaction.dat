40|$|Similar to {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis in 2008 which is essentially the credit crisis, there are also general problems of distorting, alienating credit or credit evaluation mechanism through widespread speculation of credit, <b>bogus</b> <b>transaction</b> in e-commerce, which {{has resulted in the}} deterioration of trading environment. This paper introduces the concept “credit alienation” by the analysis of the financial crisis, mainly takes the credit evaluation of the auction websites in China for example, and analyzes the credit crisis in e-commerce and the root causes in detail. The emphasis is to explore the way to overcome the credit alienation, and build the necessary hardware and software environment for the development of e-commerce...|$|E
30|$|Countermeasure 1 avoids <b>bogus</b> <b>transactions</b> since if a byzantine client stops, it {{can leave}} at most K transactions, {{which will be}} {{eventually}} processed. Another way to address <b>bogus</b> <b>transactions</b> is to blacklist clients that were identified as byzantine. A violation {{to one of the}} countermeasures proposed here is a way to identify malicious behavior. For instance, a violation of CM 1 happens when f+ 1 servers detect that a client c submitted a transaction with an invalid sequence number. A proof of this violation is obtained by receiving f+ 1 signed messages asserting that c misbehaved.|$|R

40|$|Association rules mining {{is one of}} {{data mining}} {{techniques}} to extract useful patterns {{in the framework of}} the law. The major problem of this technique on a database of sensitive information is disclosed to the security and privacy risks. One of the most effective solutions for maintaining privacy in data mining techniques to hide a lot of elements sensitive (sensitive frequent patterns) reserved. In this study, an algorithm to hide the sensitive rules based on the rules and techniques to support the reduction of turbulence is presented. The proposed algorithm is to select the most appropriate transaction for changes, consider the degree of overlap between their response elements. Critical element in choosing transactions to correct the Frequency sensitive elements in the sensitive patterns and frequency patterns insensitive response elements in the balance. The proposed algorithm with algorithms ADSRRC, SIF-IDF and SL-HS dense and non-dense on four databases are implemented. Since the implementation of the proposed method compared with other algorithms reduced. Also, the number of missing rules changes the rules of the <b>bogus</b> <b>transactions</b> and the proposed algorithm is more efficient than other algorithms. Key Words — privacy, hiding the sensitive rules, Data Mining, secure database. 1...|$|R
