50|$|It {{could be}} argued that the {{constitutional}} right to <b>bargain</b> collectively (s 23(5)) includes both a legally enforceable right to <b>bargain</b> collectively, as well as a corresponding duty to <b>bargain</b> collectively on the other party to the relationship. Since the LRA does not create a duty to <b>bargain,</b> this may give rise to the argument that the Act does not go far enough in protecting and giving content to the constitutional right. This debate may have to be solved by the courts in the future. For now, however, there is no general duty to <b>bargain</b> on employers and trade unions in terms of the LRA. An employer may refuse to engage with a trade union; in turn, the trade union may take strike action.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Market {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} exploited as important means for spectrum acquisition and access in cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we propose a two-tier market for decentralized dynamic spectrum access. In the proposed Tier- 1 market, spectrum is traded from a primary user (PU) to secondary users (SUs) {{in a relatively}} large time scale to reduce signaling overhead. Then driven by dynamic traffic demands, SUs set up the Tier- 2 market to redistribute channels among themselves in a small time scale. More specifically, we use a Nash <b>bargain</b> game to model the spectrum acquisition of SUs in the Tier- 1 market and derive the equilibrium prices. We then employ a strategic <b>bargain</b> game to study the spectrum redistribution in the Tier- 2 market, where SUs can exchange channels with low overhead through random matching, bilateral <b>bargain,</b> and the predetermined market equilibrium price. We investigate how various factors, such as the availability of channels and <b>bargain</b> partners, matching strategies, and traffic dynamics, affect the market relationships. This work provides new understanding on the spectrum market and valuable guidelines to primary and secondary network operators.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the NFL, {{contractual}} negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective <b>bargaining.</b> A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official <b>bargaining</b> agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.|$|E
