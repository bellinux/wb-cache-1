5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage in growing the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly <b>bad</b> <b>when</b> all of the sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E
5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but <b>bad</b> <b>when</b> the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E

In other words, social inhibition is holding back for social reasons. There are different levels of social inhibition, from mild to severe.

25|$|Little-used {{floppy disk}} drives sitting unused {{for years in}} {{computers}} can actually damage disks, due to computer case air cooling that sucks air through the drive openings. This pulls dust into the mechanism, which coats all surfaces including the exposed read/write head. Upon loading a disk on the rare occasion the drive is needed, the dust is stirred up when the disk is inserted into the mechanism, and the dust on the head is ground into the medium while the stirred-up dust is deposited onto the disk through the open shutters, leading to nearly instant fouling of the media. The dust also gets into the drive mechanism lubricant, {{turning it into a}} sticky slime, which may jam the mechanism and prevent head movement. This causes the computer user to see read errors on every disk they try to use, and it may also lead to data corruption through writing in incorrect locations. Some users incorrectly assume that this means all their disks have gone <b>bad,</b> <b>when</b> it is in fact the drive that is the problem. The solution is for a technician to clean the drive before it is used after a long idle period.|$|E

500|$|When {{evaluated}} for release outside of Japan, Nintendo of America considered The Lost Levels {{too difficult for}} the North America market and declined its release.

500|$|After {{he signed}} a {{professional}} contract with the Cubs, Capel no longer threw sidearmed. Capel began professional baseball with the Class A Quad Cities Cubs, but was promoted to the Double-A Midland Cubs shortly into the season. Over 11 games, he finished with a 4–3 record and a 3.51 ERA. In 1984, Capel split playing time between the Class A-Advanced Lodi Crushers and Midland; he led Midland in losses (10) and wild pitches (11) and had the second-worst ERA (6.31) on the team. With Midland, Capel started 11 games out of the 16 in which he appeared. On his 0–7 record for the Crushers, Tom Alexander of the Lodi News-Sentinel wrote that Capel's luck [...] "has been all <b>bad</b> <b>when</b> it comes to wins".

500|$|Lionel Luthor {{is portrayed}} in the program by John Glover; Glover said he appreciates the [...] "clear canvas" [...] {{he had to work}} with when {{developing}} his portrayal of Lionel. In season one, Glover traveled from New York to Vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in New York at the time. When portraying the character's struggle with terminal liver disease, Glover was inspired by a friend's battle with cancer; he said his friend was a [...] "cheerleader to people", who supported and boosted others when they were feeling <b>bad.</b> <b>When</b> Glover's friend learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it, but when he learned that it was terminal he went to bed and stopped eating until he died about ten days later. This helped Glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide—which Lionel prepares to do when he learns his illness is terminal.|$|E
500|$|Good Girl Gone Bad {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 16 reviews. Uncut {{called it a}} [...] "shiny, trans-atlantic blend of Europop vim, R grit and Caribbean bounce." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic deemed it quintessential pop music and said each of its tracks was a potential hit. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters praised the album, describing it as [...] "more raw, perhaps edgier and more risqué" [...] than Rihanna's previous material. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that the album [...] "sounds {{as if it were}} scientifically engineered to deliver hits". Peter Robinson of The Observer commended her collaborators for [...] "masking her own shortcomings" [...] and commented that, [...] "While Rihanna lacks her peers' charisma, she's a great vessel for exhilarating mainstream pop." [...] Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan found the album varied and satisfying. Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly felt that, although it [...] "goes <b>bad</b> <b>when</b> Rihanna tries her hand at treacly ballads and glum sentiment", at times Good Girl Gone Bad is a [...] "thrilling throwback to more than a decade ago, when upstart producers haphazardly mashed R with hip-hop to create chunky jeep anthems such as Mary J.

500|$|On the June 15 {{episode of}} Raw, Fox {{was a part}} of the Divas that Paige tried to rally in an attempt to take a stand against The Bella Twins and join her, but no one {{accepted}} the offer. Three days later on SmackDown, Fox assisted Brie Bella in her match against Paige, and thus aligning herself with The Bella Twins and formed [...] "Team Bella". After weeks of Team Bella outnumbering Paige, Naomi, and Tamina, Stephanie McMahon called for a [...] "revolution" [...] in the WWE Divas Division by introducing the debuting Charlotte and Becky Lynch as Paige's allies, and NXT Women's Champion Sasha Banks aligning with Naomi and Tamina, leading to a brawl between the three teams. The three teams would ultimately face off, on August 23, at SummerSlam in a three team elimination match. Team Bella would first eliminate Team <b>B.A.D.</b> <b>when</b> Brie Bella pinned Tamina, however Team PCB would win the match after Brie was pinned by Becky Lynch. On the August 25 episode of Tough Enough, Fox make a special appearance on the finale of the sixth season, wrestling finalists Amanda and eventual winner Sara Lee. While Nikki Bella was off television with an injury, Fox spent the remainder of 2015 competing occasionally in singles matches and tag team matches with Brie Bella.|$|E

500|$|Scott Matthewman, {{writing for}} The Stage, gave a mixed {{review of the}} episode. He thought that [...] "pretty much the only {{surprise}} {{in the way the}} humans who made up the Ood Corporation were presented came as PR girl Solana (Ayesha Dharker) escaped with the Doctor and Donna, only to betray their position by calling for the guards," [...] and [...] "the revelation that Ryder (Adrian Rawlins) has been working to infiltrate the Corporation is thrown away... as quickly as it is revealed." [...] However, he thought Donna was becoming [...] "fast... one of the strongest and most well-rounded companions in the series’ history", and [...] "there were some nice interpretations of the Ood’s natural development". Caitlin Moran of The Times thought the episode was [...] "really really good... – one that will have you staring at your screen and asking, once again, 'How can something so good be happening so early on a Saturday night, in my own front room?'". She enjoyed the scene where the Doctor and Donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture, saying that Tate [...] "really, really isn’t that <b>bad</b> <b>when</b> she says [...] ". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five. Rawson-Jones opened his review by saying [...] "Doctor Who can occasionally transcend the properties of a mere family television show to reach out and give viewers a poignant, beautiful epiphany and greater sense of the world they inhabit," [...] citing Donna's reaction on seeing the uncultivated Ood as the moving part of the episode.|$|E
