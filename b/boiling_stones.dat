40|$|We {{performed}} {{food residue}} analysis of cook-stones from experimental and prehistoric earth ovens using a handheld Raman spectrometry. Progress in modern optical technology provides a facile means of rapid non-destructive identification of residue artifacts from archaeological sites. For this study spectral signatures were obtained on sotol (Dasylirion spp.) experimentally baked in an earth oven {{as well as}} sotol residue on an experimentally used processing tool. Inulin was the major residue component. The portable handheld Raman spectrometer also detected traces of inulin on <b>boiling</b> <b>stones</b> used to boil commercially obtained inulin. The Raman spectra of inulin and sotol may be useful as signatures of wild plant residues in archaeology. Spectroscopic analysis of millennia-old cook-stones from prehistoric archaeological sites in Fort Hood, TX revealed the presence of residues whose further identification requires improvement of current optical methods.

40|$|The {{techniques}} {{described in}} the following sections should have been covered in the prerequisite organic chemistry labs (Chem 261 or equivalent). You are therefore expected to be fully familiar with these techniques before you enter the lab. The only potentially new techniques discussed are in sections • E (Heating Methods) – all heated liquids/solutions are stirred magnetically in Chem 241 (by adding a Teflon®–coated bar to the flask and using a magnetic stir motor to spin it); <b>boiling</b> <b>stones</b> are not used. • H (Using Ground-Glass Jointware) – silicone grease should be used when making most joint connections and must be used for inert atmosphere and vacuum operations. A. Useful Calculations and Significant Figures It is assumed that you will be familiar with the basic calculations used to determine the theoretical yield of a product and to express final calculated values to the correct number of significant figures. As a brief review, if you want to calculate the amount of a substance, use mass of a liquid, use concentration of a solution, use MW mn = × mo...|$|E
40|$|A {{catalyst}} {{is defined}} as a substance that accelerates a process without undergoing a net change due to that process. Most chemistry students learn about catalysts in the context of chemical reactions, such as the enzymes in biochemistry or the heterogeneous metal catalysts in inorganic chemistry (1, 2). However, it is both important and instructive to show students that the concept of catalysis is broader than molecular chemistry as it also includes physical processes such as crystallization, freezing, boiling, and liquid condensation. Students are familiar with measures to accelerate these processes but probably without realizing that they apply a catalyst, according to the definition given above. In basic laboratorywork, for example, students learn about the precautions to prevent “bumping” when heating solutions or distilling liquids. This bumping is the sudden boiling that results in hot liquid and vapor shooting uncontrollably out of the heating vessel. Addition of <b>boiling</b> <b>stones</b> to the liquid before heating will prevent this uncontrolled boiling; alternative antibumping measures are stirring of the liquid with amechanical stirrer ormagnetic flea or the use of an inert gas (nitrogen) capillary bleed in the case of vacuum distillation (3). The effect of these precautions is that they facilitate the nucleation, that is, the formation of vapor bubbles in the heated liquid, such that the liquid boils at its normal boiling point (for either ambient or reduced pressure). Without antibumping measures the liquid temperature may rise above the liquid's boiling point. Any bubble nucleation in this so-called superheated liquid will lead to the uncontrollable boiling mentioned above. Ern e (4) describes an instructive classroom experiment, using amicrowave oven, that demonstrates this superheating of clean liquids and the effect of antibumping agents...|$|E
50|$|A <b>boiling</b> chip, <b>boiling</b> <b>stone,</b> or anti-bumping granule is a tiny, {{unevenly}} shaped {{piece of}} substance added to liquids {{to make them}} boil more calmly. Boiling chips are frequently employed in distillation and heating. When a liquid becomes superheated, a particle of dust or a stirring rod can cause flash boiling. This very rapid boiling can be extremely violent and cause reagents to splatter, possibly causing severe burns, ruining experiments, and damaging equipment. Boiling chips work by providing nucleation sites so the liquid boils smoothly without becoming superheated or bumping.|$|R

A 10 -ml portion of sample water was put into a 50 -ml Kjeldahl flask with 0. 3 g of mercury(II) sulfate and several pieces of <b>boiling</b> <b>stone,</b> and 25 ml of the reagent-mixture was added. The solution was boiled at 160 ℃ for 30 min, setting a cooling finger inside the neck of the flask. The contents of the flask was transferred into a 50 -ml measuring flask and was diluted with water to the mark. The absorbance of the solution was measured at the wavelength of 630 nm with a 50 -mm glass cell. Beer's law was obeyed over the range of 0 〜 1000 ppm COD. The calibration curves using glycine, glucose, ethanol and starch, as the reference, gave their slope of 7. 05 × 10 ^ as the mean. Therefore, the COD value can be calculated from the following equation : GOD=absorbance/ 7. 05 × 10 ^. An appropriate volume ratio of sulfuric add to phosphoric acid for the decomposition of glycine was found to be 3 : 2. The reaction time could be reduced to about one fourth of JIS(COD_) method. The analytical results obtained for several kinds of industrial waste water are in good agreement with those obtained by JIS(COD_) method...|$|R

40|$|Burned rock middens large accumulations of {{thermally}} fractured rock {{are among}} the most common features in Archaic archaeolgical sites in Central Texas. With a sample of 1654 archaeological sites, the distribution of burned rock midden sites is compared with the occurrence of live oak savanna in an area of approximately 55, 800 square kilometers in west central Texas. The objective of this distributional analysis is a preliminary assessment of the hypothesis that burned rock middens relate to prehistoric exploitation of acorns. The similarity of the distribution of burned rock middens to both the modern and postulated Archaic distribution of live oak savanna supports this hypothesis. On this basis, it is Inferred that acorns from Quercus fusiformis and perhaps Q. texana and Q. sinuata, var. breviloba were major foods during {{at least part of the}} Archaic period. Burned rock middens are suggested to be accumulations mainly of discarded <b>boiling</b> <b>stone</b> fragments broken from use in stone-boiling of acorn foods. Data on modern areas of live oak savanna are used to show that the acorn production Is quite substantial in some portions of Central Texas and is sufficient in most years to support a population density of 1 - 3 persons per square kilometer for at least half a year. The implications of this potential are evaluated, especially in regard to the kinds of archaeological remains found at burned rock midden sites. The similarity of the distributions of burned rock middens and live oak savanna suggest that the modern general occurrence of live oak savanna is little changed from that 5000 years ago. The possible loss of oaks in one portion of the study area may reflect either short or long periods of drying conditions at some time since 5000 BP...|$|R

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in AnthropologyThe presence of limestone has been noted by archaeologists among midden scatters associated with Grand Gulch phase (A.

Recent experimental evidence obtained from both natural as well as archaeological CedarMesa limestone supports this supposition chemically as well as nutritionally. Data collected from heating and boiling with natural limestone suggests local Cedar Mesa geological sources possess quality stone able to produce chemical lime through the application of high levels of heat. Assessments of protein quality also indicate that boiling maize with this heated limestonecauses significant shifts in essential amino acid content. Key physical indicators, such as density shifts during lab heating compared to similar measurements of stones recovered from a Basketmaker II site located on Cedar Mesa, attest to the likelihood that these groups were subjecting their local limestone sources to the high levels of heat necessary to create the slaked lime that would have enhanced the protein availability of maize.

40|$|The {{possibility}} thus {{exists that}} cobbles of agate and jasper {{were collected by}} Indians from the beaches and placed in fires, perhaps solely {{for the purpose of}} lithic reduction or perhaps in connection with <b>stone</b> <b>boiling</b> of water and acorn gruel (attested to by large amounts of associated fire-cracked rock of coarser variety). No careful effort was made by the Indians to control {{the rate at which the}} agate and jasper cobbles were heated and cooled, so many cobbles shattered into useless fragments. But in cases where a pot lid flake came off, the piece was plucked from the hearth, allowed to cool, and used as a core. The negative bulb scar of the pot lid flake would have provided the angular facet needed for a striking platform, thus rendering the cobble usable as a source of flakes. The pot lid flake itself was abandoned unused wherever it fell. Both the cobble and the pot lid flake would have been heat-altered during this process, as would any flakes and artifacts derived from the cobble-core. This hypothetical lithic reduction sequence could economically explain the technological anomalies referred to earlier. It should be tested by means of by-product experiments using heat and the appropriate raw materials, and I present it here in the hope that such experiments will be tried. Such a trial-and error approach to heat treatment would have been feasible along the beaches of northwestern California, where cobbles of agate and jasper abound. If validated, this method of lithic reduction may also be found in other coastal and riverine regions in places where tough isotropic stones were being subjected to natural rounding by water movement...|$|R
