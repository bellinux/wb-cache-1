40|$|The 2 ′-OH {{group of}} the branch point {{adenosine}} is a key moiety to initiate pre-mRNA splicing. We use RNA-guided RNA modification to target the pre-mRNA branch point adenosine for 2 ′-O-methylation, {{with the aim of}} blocking pre-mRNA splicing in vertebrate cells. We show that, under certain conditions, injection of a <b>branch</b> point-specific artificial <b>box</b> C/D RNA into Xenopus oocytes effectively 2 ′-O-methylates adenovirus pre-mRNA at the target nucleotide. However, 2 ′-O-methylation at the authentic branch point activates a host of cryptic branch points, thus allowing splicing to continue. These cryptic sites are mapped, and mutated. Upon injection, pre-mRNA free of cryptic branch points fails to splice when the <b>branch</b> point-specific <b>box</b> C/D RNA is present. However, 2 ′-O-methylation at the branch point does not prevent pre-mRNA from being assembled into pre-catalytic spliceosome-like complexes prior to the first chemical step of splicing. Our results demonstrate that RNA-guided pre-mRNA modification can occur in the nucleoplasm of vertebrate cells, thus offering a powerful tool for molecular biology research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work {{deals with the}} {{simulation}} of fractal growth patterns in electrodeposition (Diffusion limited aggregation) using concept of off lattice random walk. The simulation of electrodeposition under different electric field conditions is implemented to simulate the growth of dendritic patterns in circular cell geometry. The DLA growth in circular cell geometry is {{under the influence of}} two main driving forces, namely, the random Brownian motion of the ions and the radial ionic motion due to the applied electric field. In the simulation, the effect of radial movement of ions is superimposed over the zigzag random motion of the ions in the electrolyte. The relative influence of the random motion and radial motion is controlled by introducing a biasing parameter. It is observed that the growth patterns with lower values of bias (corresponding to lower electric field) are less crowded with limited branching and more closely resemble true DLA. As the electric field is increased (higher value of B), the growth tends to be dense and with more crowding of <b>branches.</b> The <b>box</b> counting technique was implemented to calculate the fractal dimensions of the patterns developed.

40|$|We propose two primal {{heuristics}} for nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs.

Each rounding step is accomplished through the solution of a mixed-integer linear program.

We propose a feasibility heuristic, that aims at finding an initial feasible solution, and an improvement heuristic, whose purpose is to search for an improved solution within the neighborhood of a given point.

Grey box modelling has been developed in several directions and can be grouped into branches depending on the way a priori knowledge is handled. In this paper we divide grey box modelling into the following branches; constrained black box identification, semi-physical modelling, mechanistic modelling, hybrid modelling and distributed parameter modelling. Experiences from case studies demonstrate the different <b>branches</b> of grey <b>box</b> modelling procedures. In the applications, the grey box models {{have been used for}} model based control, soft sensors, process supervision and failure detection. Further, distributed parameter modelling presents a specific challenge in {{that it is difficult to}} distinguish model reduction errors from model-data discrepancies.

Our examination of material {{from some of}} the drainages (see Figs E and F) instead shows a combination of 13 + 13 vertebrae, which is not unique among Australoheros. Our phylogenetic analyses have thus been performed with both combinations (14 + 12 in Figs A and B; 13 + 13 in Figs C – F). The three upper Figs (A, C, E) show maximum parsimony (MP) topologies, the lower three show neighbour joining (NJ) topologies (with branch lengths showing amount of morphological divergence; B, D, F). Numbers at nodes show bootstrap support. Bold black nodes and branches show agreement between all analyses (MP and NJ separately), bold grey nodes and branches agreement between two of three analyses. The interrupted-line boxes show the relationships and branch lengths among the northern Brazilian coastal species. Notable is the collaps of their relationships under the 13 + 13 scenario (Figs C – F) and the markedly short branches separating these species (Figs B, D, F). The short branches separating these species are much more similar to intraspecific variability among other species of Australoheros (grey boxes in Fig. F) than to interspecific <b>branch</b> lengths (grey-line <b>boxes</b> in Fig. F). This low differenciation of the northern Brazilian coastal species is also evident from Fig. E, where the morphological matrix (Appendices 1 and 2) is mapped onto the phylogeny (geographical distribution of the species is also shown). Most species, {{with the exception of the}} northern Brazilian coastal species, are diagnosed by unique characters or unique combinations of characters. The average number of changes among interspecific pairs described by Říčan and Kullander (2003, 2008, this study) is 98. 5, while among intraspecific comparisions it is 20. 7. The average for comparisons among the species described by Ottoni and Costa (2008), Ottoni et al.
