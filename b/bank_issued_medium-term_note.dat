50|$|Since ETNs are unsecured, unsubordinated debts, {{their risk}} is that of bonds of similar {{priority}} in the company's capital structure. Often <b>issued</b> off <b>medium-term</b> <b>note</b> shelves, ETNs would be pari passu with other debt issued off the same shelf. Therefore, ETNs are backed by the credit of the underwriting issuer. Like other debt securities, ETNs do not have voting rights. Unlike other debt securities, interest is not paid during the term of most ETNs.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the liquidity of large issues, this study tests for yield differences between corporate bonds and <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes.</b> In the sample, <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes</b> {{have an average}} issue size of $ 4 million, compared with $ 265 million for bonds. Among <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes</b> that have the same issuance date, the same maturity date, and the same corporate issuer, the authors find no relation between size and yields. Moreover, bonds and <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes</b> have statistically equivalent yields. Thus, rather than suggesting that large issues have greater liquidity, these findings indicate that large and small securities issued by the same borrower are close substitutes.

50|$|In finance, a day count {{convention}} {{determines how}} interest accrues over {{time for a}} variety of investments, including bonds, <b>notes,</b> loans, mortgages, <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes,</b> swaps, and forward rate agreements (FRAs). This determines the number of days between two coupon payments; thus, calculating the amount transferred on payment dates and also the accrued interest for dates between payments. The day count is also used to quantify periods of time when discounting a cash-flow to its present value. When a security such as a bond is sold between interest payment dates, the seller is eligible to some fraction of the coupon amount.|$|R
50|$|The {{short-term}} securities that a SIV issues often contain two tiers of liabilities, junior and senior, with a leverage ratio ranging from 10 to 15. The senior debt is invariably rated AAA/Aaa/AAA and A-1+/P-1/F1 (usually by two rating agencies). The junior debt {{may or may}} not be rated, but when rated it is usually in the BBB area. There may be a mezzanine tranche rated A. The senior debt is a pari passu combination of <b>medium-term</b> <b>notes</b> (MTN) and commercial paper (CP). The junior debt traditionally comprises puttable, rolling 10-year bonds, but shorter maturities and bullet notes became more common.|$|R
