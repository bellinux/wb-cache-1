In Sri Lanka, P. fimbriata is not a prolific hunter of web spiders or insects, but quite efficiently catches those it pursues. Like other Portia species, the Sri Lanka P. fimbriata typically take 3 to 5minutes for a pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen, liberated of {{the work}} on the daily comic, started on a comic series based on one of the novels he had read as a youth: Robert en Bertrand, the story of two Flemish tramps at the fin de siècle. The series debuted in De Standaard in 1972. The series was the first in a long time to renew the enthusiasm of Vandersteen, and the {{graphical}} quality and the stories were a lot <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> of the Studio production of the time.|$|E

5|$|Industry analysts {{feared that}} the storm could seriously impact the box office {{prospects}} of two films opening that weekend, Identity Thief and Side Effects, {{both of which were}} seen as having potential to do <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> winter movies. While it afterwards appeared that the two films were not seriously affected, and did better than expected, with Identity Thief even winning the weekend, despite generally poor reviews and word of mouth, with $36 million in receipts, overall box office was down 45% from the same weekend the previous year. Side Effects finished a distant third with a quarter of Identity Thiefs take. The clearest sign of the storm's effect, according to Box Office Mojo, was the 35% drop in earnings for Silver Linings Playbook, then in wide release after several Oscar nominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{boom of the}} 1970s and early 1980s {{that took place in}} Texas (because of the escalation in oil prices) benefited the Bay Area communities significantly. Industrial operations were expanded including the opening of the U.S. Steel plant in Baytown in 1970, and the Barbours Cut shipping terminal at Morgan's Point in 1977. The Port of Texas City became the third leading port in Texas by tonnage and ninth in the nation. The Barbours Cut terminal, operated by the Port of Houston, became the seventh leading port in the nation. Not all of this development was without controversy, however. In building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its power of eminent domain to evict residents from nearly one third of the homes in Morgan's Point. Still, when the Texas economy declined in the later 1980s, the economic diversity of the area and substantial annual federal investments related to JSC helped the region fare <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> of Greater Houston.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hobbs played cricket {{whenever}} he could. His first games were {{played in the}} streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter, and practised cricket on Parker's Piece, an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.|$|E

25|$|After Shaw's first retirement, {{he became}} a renowned umpire, but perhaps his {{greatest}} playing achievements were still ahead of him. Along with his cricketing engagements under cricket-mad Arthur Stanley, 5th Baron Sheffield, he was employed to coach young Sussex cricketers, working part-time as a cricket coach at Ardingly College. It did not go unnoticed that Shaw was still far <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> of the county's regular bowlers, thus, {{at the age of}} 52, Shaw returned to county cricket.|$|E

25|$|However, many of Károlyi's most {{prominent}} gymnasts have vehemently defended him against these allegations.

25|$|The main {{difference}} between the Brazilian and Guyanese Wapishana is their rights to land.

Entirely, Amerindians are the least privileged group of Guyanese society. Among their problems are health and education, unfortunately the Rupununi region is one of those Amerindian populations that are particularly suffering from these problems, according to a study demonstrated by the ARU.|$|E
25|$|Lystrosaurus {{was by far}} {{the most}} common {{terrestrial}} vertebrate of the Early Triassic, accounting for as many as 95% of the total individuals in some fossil beds. It has often been suggested that it had anatomical features that enabled it to adapt <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> animals to the atmospheric conditions that were created by the Permian–Triassic extinction event and which persisted through the Early Triassic—low concentrations of oxygen and high concentrations of carbon dioxide. However, recent research suggests that these features were no more pronounced in Lystrosaurus than in genera that perished in the extinction or in genera that survived but were much less abundant than Lystrosaurus.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the drum}} {{magazine}} provided significant firepower, in military service {{it was found}} to be overly heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching. The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing unwanted noise. For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility {{was not included in the}} design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.|$|E
