2500|$|Channel 7 had {{a limited}} <b>{{broadcast}}ing</b> <b>schedule</b> {{during its first}} year on the air. It was not until September 1950 that the station announced, in the San Francisco Chronicle, that it would broadcast seven days a week. [...] For much of the 1950s, the station signed on late {{in the morning or}} early afternoon, especially on the weekends, because the ABC network didn't offer many daytime programs. For many years, Saturday programming began with King Norman's Kingdom of Toys, a popular children's program hosted by the owner of a San Francisco toy store, Norman Rosenberg, from 1954 until 1961.|$|E
2500|$|On June 6, 1983, Al Michaels officially succeeded Keith Jackson as {{the lead}} play-by-play {{announcer}} for Monday Night Baseball. Michaels, who spent seven seasons working backup games, was apparently very miffed over ABC Sports' delay in announcing him as their top baseball announcer. Unlike Jackson, whose forte was college football, Michaels had gigs with the Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants before joining ABC in 1976. TV Guide huffed about Jackson by saying [...] "A football guy, on baseball!" [...] Jackson was unavailable for several World Series games in [...] and [...] because of conflicts with his otherwise normal college football <b>broadcasting</b> <b>schedule.</b> Thus, Michaels did play-by-play for games on weekends.|$|E
2500|$|While the CBS color <b>broadcasting</b> <b>schedule</b> {{gradually}} {{expanded to}} twelve {{hours per week}} (but never into prime time), and the color network expanded to eleven affiliates as far west as Chicago, its commercial success was doomed {{by the lack of}} color receivers necessary to watch the programs, the refusal of television manufacturers to create adapter mechanisms for their existing black-and-white sets, and the unwillingness of advertisers to sponsor broadcasts seen by almost no one. CBS had bought a television manufacturer in April, and in September 1951, production began on the only CBS-Columbia color television model, with the first color sets reaching retail stores on September 28. But it was too little, too late. Only 200 sets had been shipped, and only 100 sold, when CBS discontinued its color television system on October 20, 1951, ostensibly by request of the National Production Authority {{for the duration of the}} Korean War, and bought back all the CBS color sets it could to prevent lawsuits by disappointed customers. RCA chairman David Sarnoff later charged that the NPA's order had come [...] "out of a situation artificially created by one company to solve its own perplexing problems" [...] because CBS had been unsuccessful in its color venture.|$|E

40|$|With {{the number}} {{increment}} of mobile computing equipment, the invalidation {{of equipment and}} broadcasting information because of wireless bandwidth, communication quality and too long scheduling queue that badly influence the system computing performance. Mobile cache is a good technology to solute this difficult problem.

An invalidation control strategy of data <b>broadcasting</b> <b>scheduling</b> based on mobile Agent and IBM Application Response Measurement (ARM) is presented to guarantee data executing on the terminal in the right time. The results of experiments show that the invalidation rate and average work response time of the presented model and strategy in this paper are less (20 %) than the single buffer queue mode and random invalidation controlling strategy. </span...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:Wireless {{monitoring}} networks can be {{used for}} security applications such as the monitoring of narrow passages and operational elds. These networks can be designed based on sensor networks. In sensor networks, each node can hear a message and broadcast the message to its neighbor nodes. Nevertheless, nodes may fail, so that faulty nodes cannot hear or cannot transmit any message, where the locations of the faulty nodes are unknown and their failures are permanent. In this paper, the nodes are situated on a line or a square grid-based topology in a plane for security/monitoring applications. For each topology, 2 nonadaptive and adaptive <b>broadcasting</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms are proposed and analyzed. In addition, the scheduling algorithms take the energy consumption of the sensor nodes into account in order to prolong the network's lifetime. The analysis results show that adaptive algorithms need less time than nonadaptive algorithms to inform the whole network domain...|$|R
40|$|Broadcasting {{can reduce}} the cost of video on demand {{services}} by distributing in a more efficient fashion videos that are simultaneously watched by many viewers. Rather than waiting for individual requests, <b>broadcasting</b> <b>schedules</b> repeated broadcasts of the various segments of a video ahead of time. Hence it performs best when it is used to distribute videos that are watched concurrently by hundreds or thousands of viewers. We propose a reactive broadcasting protocol that addresses the problem of distributing moderately popular videos in a more efficient fashion. Like all efficient broadcasting protocols, reactive broadcasting assumes that the customer set-top box has enough local storage to store at least one half of each video being watched. Unlike other broadcasting protocols, reactive broadcasting only broadcasts the later portions of each video. The initial segment of each video is distributed on demand using a stream tapping protocol. Our simulations show that reactive broadcasti [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In July 2005 Mze {{announced}} it would take its daily political talk show Archevanis Zgvarze (On the Edge of Choice) off air. It was reported that Irakli Imnaishvili, the show’s anchor, announced on air on July 6 that his show would go out {{for the last time}} on July 8. Apparently this move came days after a key government member, Giga Bokeria, criticised Mze’s coverage of civil unrest in Tbilisi, criticism which led opposition parliamentarians to accuse the government of putting pressure on independent media, which was in turn denied by the government. Mze put the withdrawal of the political talk show down to planned changes in <b>broadcasting</b> <b>schedules.</b> But the same report also said that On the Edge of Choice had been temporarily cancelled earlier that year after experts invited on to the programme failed to corroborate the official explanation for the death of Prime Minister Zurab Zhvania.|$|R
