40|$|The European Union is {{becoming}} one undivided continent, where territories {{are faced with}} borderless economic, social and environmental challenges while still being governed through traditional institutional boundaries. Integration {{raises the question of}} cohesion among different territories, and territorial cohesion is a new objective for the Union according to the Lisbon Treaty. Cooperation between territories, beyond frontiers and across different institutional layers, {{is becoming}} crucial to provide multi-level governance to new functional regions. The European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC), a new legal and governance tool established by Regulation 1082 / 2006, was conceived as a substantial upgrade for this multi-level governance and "beyond-the-border" cooperation. Three years after its adoption, a number of EGTCs have been set up, and new ones are in the pipeline. Despite their early stage, these new ventures are generating interesting dynamics, revamping inter-institutional cross-border partnerships and establishing a new cooperation geography. However, promoting best practice partnerships would require a broader European policy. This article considers possible institutional incentives such as the "contractualisation" of the cooperation between the European Commission and the EGTCs. These Groupings truly are new governance "contracts" of multilevel cross-border cooperation, which can become creative engines for local development and deeper European integration. This provides food for thought for the EU policy and <b>budgetary</b> <b>package</b> after 2013...|$|E
40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the European Union (EU) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} fields of {{cooperation}} within the European Union. During the past decades the different Commissioners have made several proposals about changes in the CAP and many of them have not been passed but renegotiated. The present Commission has however published a report in 2011, which emphasizes that the CAP has three alternative ways to go in the future. This study aims to predict which one of these three alternative ways it is most likely that the CAP will take according to the historical institutionalist theory. When to be able to predict this text analysis is used. The analysis tools of the study are collected from the theory, which focuses on the conceptions: critical juncture, feedback effects, path dependency and sequencing. These tools as well as the theory are applied on the empirical material, which mainly consists of books about the earlier reforms and proposals from the Commission, academical journals and some reports. The analysis shows that the Luxembourg compromise can be seen as a critical juncture in the history of the CAP and this led to a path dependency, which is characterized by a decision-making procedure by consensus between the political institutions in the EU. The analysis also shows that most of the reforms regarding the CAP, are made with some sort of compromise or consensus (the Delors I <b>budgetary</b> <b>package,</b> the Mac Sharry reforms and so on). Therefore the conclusion of the study is that, from an historical institutionalist perspective, it is more or less possible for the CAP to go with any of the alternative ways that the Commission points out in the report. It is however most likely that the second way is the most prominent one. This is because that option emphasizes that major overhauls of the policy should be made, that the measures should be more targeted, and that the spending of the CAP should be more efficient. All of these changes have been made more or less during the history of the CAP and the institutional framework therefore allows this way...|$|E
40|$|The European Union is {{currently}} negotiating its next <b>budgetary</b> <b>package</b> for 2014 - 2020, amid calls for reform, and criticisms that the EU budget {{is out of}} touch with the realities of today's EU. This thesis aims to contribute towards that debate, by proposing an innovative methodological framework to assess which policy areas and funding programmes should be allocated to the EU level. The methodology proposed is multidisciplinary, combining the branch of economics generally used to analyse the EU and its budget (known as fiscal federalism) with another branch of economics (public sector economics), political science and EU law. From these four disciplines, eleven steps are derived, and this eleven-step analysis is applied to the three main areas of EU spending to assess whether or not they should be funded by the EU budget: agriculture, regional policy and research policy. The need for a multidisciplinary methodology arises from the fact that the EU budget is not equivalent to a national budget, because the EU is essentially a legislative union, where spending powers have remained small and are mainly there to support the regulatory initiatives. Therefore a different type of analysis is needed to address not only the economic issues involved, but the political and legal aspects as well. The research question addressed by this thesis is therefore both normative and methodological. It seeks to answer to answer a normative question – how should the EU budget be spent – but also addresses a methodological puzzle – how to create a multidisciplinary methodological framework that can be used to define how the EU finances should be organised, by completing fiscal federalism with insights from other theories, thereby making it more suited to the analysis of the EU? The results of applying this methodology to the three main areas of EU spending are as follows. The analysis supports EU cohesion funding for poorer EU Member States, as this funding can potentially be very efficient in helping those regions and is backed by EU law and political legitimacy. However, concerning funding for the wealthier Member States, the analysis has exposed a trade-off that should be openly addressed. The economic analysis would suggest to renationalise it because it is not efficient at EU level; however, the political analysis shows that there can be advantages in providing cohesion funding to all Member States. Concerning agriculture, all sections of the analysis have shown that this spending policy should not be at EU level, except EU law, which gives an ambiguous result. It is shown that this policy is inefficient and even in some respects harmful for the economy and at the same time also decreases political legitimacy. For research policy, the analysis has shown that, while economic criteria would advise a significant or even total transfer of funding programmes from the national to the EU level, this could lead to political and legal problems. Therefore, the conclusion is that there should be an increase in research funding from the current (very low) levels, but that this should not go beyond a certain level...|$|E

30|$|The {{aim of the}} EU Structural Funds is to {{increase}} long-term sustainable growth of the lagging areas. However, soon after {{the outbreak of the}} crisis, the European Commission put forward a recovery plan in which it encouraged the use of EU Structural Funds for counter-cyclical aims (European Commission 2008 a, b). In particular, the Commission suggested increasing the spending through the combination of both EU funding and national <b>budgetary</b> stimulus <b>packages,</b> which should be coordinated in order to avoid negative spillovers across countries (European Commission 2008 a). With regard to money available for the cohesion policy, the recovery plan envisaged to accelerate program implementation rather than {{to increase}} funding per se. It translated into an ease of administrative procedures, an increase of projects pre-financing and a decrease of national co-funding share, allowing countries to increase up-front spending as the pressure on national budget constraints is reduced. The Commission encouraged member States to “re-prioritize” cohesion investments in view of the ongoing turbulent economic situation: it invited national governments “to explore possible changes in priorities and objectives with a view to accelerate the spending in the areas with more growth potential. This could include more focus on energy efficiency measures, including in housing, and strengthening the focus of support for small and medium enterprises, which are the main motor for growth in the European economy.” (European Commission 2008 b, pg. 4).|$|R
