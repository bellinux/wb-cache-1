Student t test showed that the laser <b>bleaching</b> group significantly outperformed the power <b>bleaching</b> group in changing ?E (p= 0. 977). Similarly, while comparing the groups in changing ?L, the laser <b>bleaching</b> group indicated significantly superior results (p= 0. 953). Statistical data from student t test while comparing the groups in changing the parameter of yellowness indicated that samples in laser <b>bleaching</b> group underwent a more significant reduction than power-bleached samples (p= 0. 85). Correspondingly, changes in whiteness were statistically tested through student t test, showing that laser <b>bleaching</b> technique increased whiteness of the samples significantly more than those treated by power <b>bleaching</b> (p= 0. 965). The digital color evaluation data was in accordance with spectrophotometry and showed that laser <b>bleaching</b> outperformed power <b>bleaching</b> technique.
