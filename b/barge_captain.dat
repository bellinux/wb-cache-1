25|$|On 20 December, the Korean Coast Guard {{completed}} an initial investigation. According to their conclusions, blame is shared between the tug captains, the <b>barge</b> <b>captain,</b> {{and the captain}} of the Hebei Spirit. The tug captains and the <b>barge</b> <b>captain</b> are charged with negligence and violating the marine pollution prevention law. The captain of the Hebei Spirit has been charged with violating marine law.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the regional office of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries had twice tried to warn the <b>barge</b> <b>captain</b> that the barge was too close to the tanker two hours before the incident but was unable to do so. The <b>barge</b> <b>captain</b> is also under investigation for moving through the area in rough weather. The tanker is reported to have been at anchor when it was hit by the barge, which had broken free from its towing lines.|$|E

5000|$|Queen Victoria {{visited the}} castle yet again in 1843, {{as a guest}} of Robert Bell, {{accompanied}} by her husband, Prince Albert. The royal couple disembarked, quite unexpectedly, from the Royal <b>Barge</b> <b>captained</b> by Lord Adolphus FitzClarence at the Coastguard Station, East Cowes. They then were shown into a carriage and taken to her 'favourite Norris Castle', where she went straight to her former apartments and joyously told the Prince Consort that [...] "this was my room, and this was mine also".|$|R
50|$|Ling {{had been}} selling sexual favors {{for some time}} (though she dreams of a life as a singer) and had managed to buy herself, Binh, and Tam's {{way out of the}} refugee complex and onto a <b>barge</b> <b>captained</b> by the British Captain Oh. During the voyage Binh, Ling, and Tam suffer {{shortages}} of food and fresh water. A gambling game (two contenders shout off American brand names in succession) threatens the other passengers by unfairly winning their food, water, and money. Several people succumb to the conditions, as does little Tam. A heartbroken Binh and Ling give him a funeral at sea.|$|R

50|$|Metcalfe {{emigrated to}} the United States in 1928, where he began writing Arm's Length while serving as a <b>barge</b> <b>captain</b> on the East River. On 17 March 1930, Metcalfe married the American novelist Evelyn Scott.|$|E
50|$|Clive Cussler makes a {{habit of}} writing himself into cameo {{appearances}} in his books. In this one he makes a short appearance, working as a <b>barge</b> <b>captain</b> who gets roughed up by those working for this tale's antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Tholen {{established}} his reputation in The Hague with his landscapes {{of the countryside}} around Kampen and views of the woods near Baarn. He also frequently painted views of The Hague, the woods of Scheveningen {{and a series of}} interiors in which a window typically provides a view outside: a garden, a street illumined by sunlight or the rhythmically grouped roofs of a city. He painted the fishing boats on the beach in Scheveningen, but in contrast to Jacob Maris (whom he greatly admired), Tholen did not employ the desolate sea as a backdrop, but rather, the bustling village. He used the hustle-bustle of the city more often as a theme than was generally the case in the Hague School, depicting such subjects as construction sites, slaughterhouses, stonecutters and the sand excavations and sand <b>barge</b> <b>captains</b> on the canal between The Hague and Scheveningen.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} incident, also in December, {{resulted}} in the deliberate dumping of 3,600 cubic yards of dredged rock material about half of a mile north of the reef. Due to a punctured hull, the barge carrying the rock began to lean rapidly. To avoid possible sinking or flipping of the <b>barge,</b> the <b>captain</b> dumped the rock.|$|R
60|$|Brown made {{a sign to}} the Canarios, who dipped the oars, and as they slid {{past the}} Carsegarry, which lay with steam blowing off, and a water <b>barge</b> alongside, <b>Captain</b> Farquhar leaned over her rails. He had come in for coal {{on his way to}} Liverpool the {{previous}} day, and had spent part of the night with Brown.|$|R
5000|$|Immigrants being {{processed}} at Ellis Island had to {{be evacuated}} to lower Manhattan. Although one contemporary newspaper report estimated {{that as many as}} seven people died in the attack; 4 did definitely die, including a Jersey City policeman, a Lehigh Valley Railroad chief of police, [...] a ten-week-old infant, and the <b>barge</b> <b>captain.</b> Injuries numbered in the hundreds. Smaller explosions continued to occur for hours after the initial blast.|$|E
50|$|Crosbie {{intended}} {{to cross the}} Irish Sea, but as darkness fell early in the winter evenings, he decided to land at Clontarf. He attempted a channel crossing on 19 July 1785, (defying a ban on balloon flights by the Lord Mayor of Dublin because {{the population of the}} city was spending long periods gaping at the sky instead of working), but came down half way across due to a severe storm, and was rescued by the Dun Laoghaire <b>barge</b> <b>Captain</b> Walmitt, which was following his progress.|$|E
50|$|Ben Cutlet (Will Hay) is {{a retired}} <b>barge</b> <b>captain</b> who entertains his bar room {{audience}} with tales of his alleged days at sea, although his maritime experience extends no further than navigating a coal barge. His tall tales catch him out when he is conned into commanding the unseaworthy Rob Roy to the West Indies by a gang of criminals who mean to scuttle the ship for the insurance money. Cutlet gets the upper hand however {{when he and his}} companions fall in with West Indian natives who mistake their radio set for a god.|$|E
50|$|This {{backwater}} {{is called}} Wallabout Bay on charts; {{the men on}} the dredges call it Potter's Field. The eddy sweeps driftwood into the backwater. Also, it sweeps drownded bodies into there. As a rule, people that drown in the harbor in winter stay down until spring. When the water begins to get warm, gas forms in them and that makes them buoyant and they rise to the surface. Every year, without fail, on or about the fifteenth of April, bodies start showing up, and more of them show up in Potter's Field than any other place. In a couple of weeks or so, the Harbor Police always finds ten to two dozen over there - suicides, bastard babies, old <b>barge</b> <b>captains</b> that lost their balance out on a sleety night attending to towropes, now and then some gangster or other. The police launch that runs out of Pier A on the Battery - Launch One - goes over and takes them out of the water with a kind of dip-net contraption that the Police Department blacksmith made out of tire chains.|$|R
50|$|In 1718 {{an early}} settler and ferry owner, Cornelius Claes Vandenburgh, built a {{landmark}} stone {{house on the}} Mohawk west of Crescent. Cornelius Claes Ferry was later called Dunsbach Ferry.Dunsbach Ferry originated, as the name suggests, as a ferry crossing over the Mohawk River. The ferry was replaced {{for a short time}} by the Dunsbach Ferry Bridge, a bridge that had an unusual pier construction method involving cylinders with piles driven inside with heavy crib work outside. This bridge was constructed by the Dunsbach Ferry Bridge Company in 1898 in three spans, two were carried away by ice in 1903, and the third in 1905. When the creation of the New York State Barge Canal moved the Erie Canal to the Mohawk River in 1910 the hamlet became home to many <b>barge</b> <b>captains</b> and as a stop for provisioning the barges. A gauging station was established at Dunsbach Ferry in 1898 by D.J. Howell for measuring the discharge flow of the river and the record continued on at the West Troy Water Company dam and pumping station at the hamlet, it was located roughly 200 feet south (upstream) of the bridge. The dam was built in order to supply West Troy (later Watervliet) with water, and was partially removed in 1912.|$|R
50|$|In 1864, the Esmerelda was {{now owned}} by the Union Line of Captain Thomas E. Trueworthy. He sent her and the Victoria, a four-masted {{schooner}} converted from a <b>barge,</b> under <b>Captain</b> Charles C. Overman, to the Colorado River to establish the Union Line as the opposition line to George A. Johnson & Company there. The Victoria {{was to be a}} store ship {{at the mouth of the}} river, but she was soon broken up by the tidal bore soon after it reached the mouth of the Colorado in March.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to his writing, he supported himself in various ways. His experience working on docks and barges around the country had by the mid-1930s garnered him a position as <b>barge</b> <b>captain</b> in New York City. [...] On May 15, 1942 Huhta's body was found floating in the Hudson River, where it {{appeared to have been}} for several days. The death was ruled an accidental drowning although the exact circumstances were unclear. There was no funeral, and in the end Huhta was buried in a potter's field on Hart Island.|$|E
50|$|St. Valier was {{purchased}} by the Mexican-Colorado Navigation Company in December 1901 from the Santa Ana Mining Company's creditors, adding cabins on her upper deck allowing them to compete for passenger business. Under the command of a former <b>barge</b> <b>captain</b> of the Colorado Steam Navigation Company, they made regular trips between Yuma and Needles competing with the rival steamboat Cochan. Another serious rival appeared in 1902 when the Colorado River Transportation Company built the 91 foot long Searchlight another stern-wheel steamboat, the last built on the lower Colorado. It was launched at Needles in December 1902, its engines were installed {{and it was on}} the river by March 1903. It soon cut into the trade of Colorado Steam Navigation Company to Quartette Landing and Searchlight.|$|E
50|$|The worst rail {{disaster}} {{in the history of}} Amtrak occurred near Saraland on Big Bayou Canot on September 22, 1993. At approximately 2:53 AM, Amtrak's Sunset Limited train, powered by three locomotives, and en route from Los Angeles, California to Miami, Florida with 220 passengers and crew aboard, crossed the Bayou Canot bridge at high speed and derailed at a kink in the track caused by a <b>barge</b> <b>captain</b> who rammed the bridge by making a wrong turn in the waterway, and failed to report the accident. Forty-seven people, of whom 42 were passengers, were killed, many by drowning, others by fire. Much of the rescue efforts were average citizens of the community who journeyed out {{in the early morning hours}} in small fishing boats to help at the scene.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recurring}} pirate characters {{appear in}} this book, though {{on this occasion}} they sink their own ship rather than endure a fight with the Gauls. The captain's son Erix (seen in the previous book Asterix and the Banquet) is mentioned as having been left as a deposit {{to pay for the}} short-lived ship. After he and his crew have been forced to take jobs as galley slaves on Cleopatra's <b>barge,</b> the <b>captain</b> expresses the unusual determination to wreak revenge on the Gauls [...] - [...] in other books, he simply wishes never to encounter them again.|$|R
50|$|Following this, she obtains {{unauthorised}} access on to a <b>barge,</b> after the <b>captain</b> initially denies her access. He bandages {{her feet and}} tells her his life story, in particular about a bank robbery from ages ago. After a promised nightcap and before the captain can notify the police at a water lock, Isa successfully escapes whereby she finds a bag belonging to a man, who had killed himself.|$|R
50|$|Jongman {{takes time}} off, {{and decides to}} help Lisa reach Palestine, {{probably}} to make amends for his inability to save his Jewish girlfriend. Through his contacts in shipping circles, Jongman finds work for himself and Lisa on a Dutch <b>barge</b> owned by <b>Captain</b> Brandt. While traveling in the barge, Lisa and Jongman begin to fall in love, while slowly gaining {{the acceptance of the}} crusty but goodhearted Brandt.|$|R
5000|$|Notable new {{characters}} include Mr Swallow of Treddle's Wharf, Mr Rumpling the <b>barge</b> <b>captain,</b> Mr Cresswell, {{owner of}} Cresswell's Chigley Biscuit factory, Harry Farthing the potter {{and his daughter}} Winnie, Willie Munn, Mr Clamp's nephew, who is employed at the biscuit factory, Mr Bilton, the Winkstead Hall gardener, and, last but not least, the aristocratic Lord Belborough of Winkstead Hall and his butler Brackett, who also operate a private railway that seems to run through most of Trumptonshire. The pair are called on to transport or collect goods in every episode, much to Lord Belborough's delight, as he loves driving the engine, which is named Bessie. Another character frequently delighted by these excursions is Winnie Farthing, whom Lord Belborough and Brackett nearly always invite to join them for a ride on Bessie. The notable song unique to Chigley, [...] "Time flies by while I'm the driver of a train", was always sung during these sequences.|$|E
500|$|The 625-foot long by 125-foot wide flatbed barge has 14 dormitories and 100 {{cells for}} inmates. [...] For recreation, {{there is a}} {{full-size}} gym with basketball court, weight lifting rooms, and an outdoor recreation facility on the roof. [...] There are three worship chapels, a modern medical facility, and a library open to inmate use. The 47,326-ton facility was on the water, so when it opened, three or more maritime crew were maintained under Coast Guard regulations. According to John Klumpp, the <b>barge's</b> first <b>captain,</b> in 2002, [...] "the Coast Guard, after years of monitoring the prison barge, finally accepted the reality that that it was, de facto, a jail and not a boat." [...] The prison barge is about 5 miles away from SUNY Maritime college.|$|R
25|$|In the Royal Navy in {{the days}} of sail, the coxswain was a petty officer or chief petty officer who {{commanded}} the <b>barge</b> of a <b>captain</b> or admiral. Later the coxswain was the senior chief petty officer aboard a smaller vessel such as a corvette or submarine, who was responsible for the steering and also assumed the duties which would be performed by the chief boatswain's mate and master-at-arms aboard larger vessels.|$|R
25|$|Sreesanth courted {{controversy}} {{once again}} during the fourth day of the second test of India's 2007 tour to England at Trent Bridge. He was fined half of his match fee for deliberately shoulder <b>barging</b> England <b>captain</b> Michael Vaughan whilst walking back to his mark. He also bowled a beamer at batsman Kevin Pietersen, which the latter had to take drastic action to avoid. Sreesanth however did immediately apologise afterwards. After the match {{he said that the}} ball had slipped from his hand. Soon afterwards, he bowled a no-ball where he overstepped the crease by roughly , leading to speculation it was deliberate; the delivery was a bouncer to Paul Collingwood. Former England captain Michael Atherton called for Sreesanth to be banned for the Pietersen beamer, saying that Sreesanth could not control his on-pitch emotions.|$|R
50|$|Originally Stone's Ferry was a Colorado River {{crossing}} at {{the mouth}} of the Virgin River between the Virgin River and Muddy River settlements of the Mormons in Pah-Ute County, Arizona and the rest of Arizona Territory by a road southward to the mines at Chloride, Mineral Park and Cerbat and to the Hardyville - Prescott Road. It was informal, using boats that were left there for that necessity up until after the time Brigham Young visited the Muddy and Virgin River settlements in 1870. Stone's Ferry was also a landing for the <b>barges</b> of <b>Captain</b> L. C. Wilburn who poled and sailed his barges up river to bring down salt from the Mormon's Virgin River valley salt mines for the mills of El Dorado Canyon. The salt was used to process their silver ore.|$|R

50|$|On 7 March the Spanish sloop {{returned}} to the island. Although the sloop was well-armed and manned, Captain Herbert resolved to try to capture it. A total of 96 men boarded the <b>captains</b> <b>barge,</b> the yawl, a periagua (three periaguas had been captured near Cuba and carried on the Tyger) and a canoe and attacked the sloop. Although the boarding parties reached {{the deck of the}} sloop, the Spanish were able to force them back and sail away. The barge was sunk and several men wounded, but none of the Tygers crew were killed.|$|R
50|$|However, Khush again becomes {{impatient}} of his dark, cramped surroundings {{rocks the}} <b>barge,</b> forcing the <b>Captain</b> {{to make them}} disembark 200 miles from Cairo. After walking {{most of the way}} to the port, Tad leaves Cissie and the elephant to rest and continues ahead by himself. In Cairo, he is caught by Mr Jackson and Esther, who ply him for information and trick him into leading them to where Cissie and Khush should have been. Luckily, Cissie and the elephant have already left, spurred on by the thought of seeing Ketty in Nebraska. Tad stalls Mr Jackson and Esther and hurries to try and catch up with his friends.|$|R
50|$|With Johnson Company raising {{freight rates}} {{to and from}} his mines in El Dorado Canyon and the Freeman District in late 1863, and with the {{potential}} freighting profits to be made competing with it, Alphonso F. Tilden, of the Philadelphia Silver and Copper Mining Company, put a second Opposition steamboat on the river, the Nina Tilden. Built in San Francisco by Martin Vice and launched in July 1864, {{it was able to}} do 16 knots while it carried 120 tons and would tow a 100-ton <b>barge.</b> A veteran <b>captain</b> of the Sacramento and Fraser Rivers, George B. Gorman, steamed the Nina Tilden down the coast to the Colorado River. In September, Gorman also began to compete with the Johnson Company and the Union Line, towing the barge White Fawn, knocked down and shipped in a schooner to the estuary where it was reassembled.|$|R

6000|$|The reader has {{too often}} {{accompanied}} {{us over the}} ground between the abbey and the ocean, to require any description of the route pursued by the seamen during the preceding characteristic dialogue; and we shall at once pass to the incidents which occurred on {{the arrival of the}} party at the cliffs. As the man who had so unexpectedly assumed a momentary authority within St. Ruth had unaccountably disappeared from among them, Griffith continued to exercise the right of command, without referring to any other for consultation. He never addressed himself to Barnstable, and it was apparent that both the haughty young men felt that the tie which had hitherto united them in such close intimacy was, for the present at least, entirely severed. Indeed, Griffith was only restrained by the presence of Cecilia and Katherine from arresting his refractory inferior on the spot; and Barnstable, who felt all the consciousness of error, without its proper humility, with difficulty so far repressed his feelings as to forbear exhibiting in the presence of his mistress such a manifestation of his spirit as his wounded vanity induced him to imagine was necessary to his honor. The two, however, acted in harmony on one subject, though it was without concert or communication. The first object with both the young men was to secure the embarkation of the fair cousins; and Barnstable proceeded instantly to the boats, in order to hasten the preparations that were necessary before they could receive these unexpected captives: the descent of the Pilot having been made in such force as to require the use of all the frigate's boats, which were left riding in {{the outer edge of the}} surf, awaiting the return of the expedition. A loud call from Barnstable gave notice to the officer in command, and in a few moments the beach was crowded with the busy and active crews of the [...] "cutters," [...] "launches," [...] "barges," [...] "jolly-boats," [...] "pinnaces," [...] or by whatever names the custom of the times attached to the different attendants of vessels of war. Had the fears of the ladies themselves been consulted, the frigate's launch would have been selected for their use, on account of its size; but Barnstable, who would have thought such a choice on his part humiliating to his guests, ordered the long, low <b>barge</b> of <b>Captain</b> Munson to be drawn upon the sand, it being peculiarly the boat of honor. The hands of fifty men were applied to the task, and it was soon announced to Colonel Howard and his wards that the little vessel was ready for their reception. Manual had halted on the summit of the cliffs with the whole body of the marines, where he was busily employed in posting pickets and sentinels, and giving the necessary instructions to his men to cover the embarkation of the seamen, in a style that he conceived to be altogether military. The mass of the common prisoners, including the inferior domestics of the abbey, and the men of Borroughcliffe, were also held in the same place, under a suitable guard: but Colonel Howard and his companion, attended by the ladies and their own maids, had descended the rugged path to the beach, and were standing passively on the sands, when the intelligence that the boat waited for them was announced.|$|R
