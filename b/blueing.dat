"This {{aristocracy}} west of Pittsburgh is just {{twice as}} bad as the snobbery in Boston or New York, because back there, the families have had their wealth long enough--some of 'em got it by stealing real estate in 1820, and some by selling Jamaica rum and niggers way back before the Revolutionary War--they've been respectable so long that they know mighty well and good that nobody except a Britisher is going to question their blue blood--and oh my, what good <b>blueing</b> third-generation money does make. But out here in God's Country, the marquises of milling and the barons of beef are still uneasy.

6000|$|The honorable {{captain said}} he {{understood}} this {{question to be}} one implicating the liberties of everybody. He understood the matter literally, as it was propounded in the Allegory, and {{set forth in the}} resolution; and, as such, he intended to look at it with unprejudiced eyes. [...] "The natur' of this proposal lay altogether in color. What is color, after all? Make the most of it, and in the most favorable position, which, perhaps, is the cheek of a comely young woman, and it is but skin-deep. He remembered the time when a certain female {{in another part of the}} univarse, who is commonly called Miss Poke, might have out-rosed the best rose in a placed called Stunnin'tun; and what did it all amount to? He shouldn't ask Miss Poke herself, for obvious reasons--but he would ask any of the neighbors how she looked now? Quitting female natur', he would come to human natur' generally. He had often remarked that sea water was blue, and he had frequently caused pails to be lowered, and the water brought on deck, to see if he could come at any of this <b>blueing</b> matter--for indigo was both scarce and dear in his part of the world, but he never could make out anything by the experiment; from which he concluded that, on the whull, there was pretty much no such thing as color, at all.|$|E

Addition of a trace of any alkali to tap or distilled water also provides an effective <b>blueing</b> solution; {{a few drops of}} strong ammonium hydroxide or of saturated aqueous lithium carbonate, added immediately before use, are sufficient for a 400 ml staining dish full of water.

50|$|Woodturning tools must be {{sharpened}} {{more frequently}} than other edged woodworking tools to maintain a clean cut because the wood passes at great speed. Sharpening is usually accomplished {{with the aid of}} mechanical devices such as powered sharpening wheels and abrasives. This sharpening process requires either skill of the craftsman, or one of the many available sharpening jigs, which facilitate maintaining a specific bevel on the tool. As with any mechanical sharpening method, overheating or <b>blueing</b> is a danger to be avoided as it will ruin the steel's temper, rendering the steel too soft to maintain a sharp edge. When this happens, the blued area must then be ground away to expose fresh steel and the tool must then have the bevel reestablished and the edge re-honed. High speed steel is not prone to <b>blueing</b> (overheating) whereas carbon steel blues easily, requiring frequent quenching in water or oil to avoid losing temper.|$|E

50|$|Bluing {{only works}} on steel, cast iron, or {{stainless}} steel parts for protecting against corrosion. Because it changes iron into Fe3O4, {{it does not}} work on non-ferrous material. Aluminium and polymer parts cannot be blued, and no corrosion protection is provided. However, the chemicals from the <b>blueing</b> process can accomplish uneven staining on aluminium and polymer parts. Hot bluing should never be attempted on aluminium, as it will react violently with the bath of caustic salts, potentially causing severe chemical burns.|$|E
50|$|Blue {{eye disease}} {{typically}} begins in piglets that are between 2-21 days old; 90 {{percent of the}} pigs that become infected with the disease die. It usually begins with a sudden onset of fever, arched back, or depression. The disease then progresses with neurological symptoms including weakness, ataxia, muscle tremors, abnormal posture, and rigidity of the hind legs. Some other symptoms associated with this disease are conjunctivitis, blindness, nystagmus, constipation, and diarrhea. Younger pigs can suffer from neurological and respiratory signs which can be quite severe. Mature pigs may suffer <b>blueing</b> of the pupils in their eyes and reproductive difficulties.|$|E
5000|$|Alum or {{potassium}} {{aluminium sulfate}} {{used as the}} mordant usually dissociates in an alkaline solution, combining with HO− of water to form insoluble aluminium hydroxide. In the presence of excess acid, aluminium hydroxide cannot be formed, thus causing failure of aluminium haematoxylin dye-lake to form, {{due to lack of}} OH− ions. Hence, acid solutions of alum haematoxylin become red. During staining, alum haematoxylin-stained sections are usually passed on to a neutral or alkaline solution (e.g., hard tap water or 1% ammonium hydroxide) in order to neutralize the acid and form an insoluble blue aluminium haematin complex. This procedure is known as <b>blueing.</b>|$|E

Highly decorated armour is often called parade armour, a somewhat misleading term as such armour might well be worn on active military service.
