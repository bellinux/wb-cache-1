It was held at Barnard College on April 24, 1982, and was presented as the annual Scholar and Feminist Conference IX, {{an integral part of the}} Barnard Center for Research on Women. The theme of the Conference was Sexuality. The Conference was set up as a framework for feminist thought to proceed regarding topics that many felt uncomfortable talking about.

5000|$|Unionization {{has also}} been {{attributed}} to increased teaching workloads and financial difficulties imposed on graduate students, as since the 1970s universities have transferred more instruction tasks from tenure track faculty to adjunct faculty and graduate students as cost saving measures.

50|$|As {{the economy}} became unbearable, the Communist {{government}} authorized {{the increase in}} food prices for the summer of 1980. Once again a revival of labor disturbances erupted throughout the nation. Workers of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk ultimately went on strike in mid-August, sparked by the firing of Anna Walentynowicz. Led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, the workers {{took control of the}} shipyard and demanded labor reform and greater civil rights including the freedom of expression and religion, and the release of political prisoners. On the third day of the strike, on August 16, 1980, management granted Lenin Shipyard workers their working and pay demands. Lech Wałęsa and others announced the end of the strike, however the women of the shipyard, Anna Waletynowicz and Alina Pienkowska transformed a strike over <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> <b>issues</b> into a solidarity strike in sympathy with other striking establishments.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this essay is one such {{isolated}} incident of self-expression, from a pocket of Anti-Corn Law League supporters in {{a small group of}} Wiltshire parishes, between 1843 and 1846. It was an incident which represented more than just the articulation of the kind of grievances which might have prompted all protests in the period. In many ways it was an unusual form of protest for the time. It involved a degree of formal organisation, and, being part of a coherent national movement, was concerned with more than local <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> <b>issues.</b> It also linked the labourers' grievances with those of other groups in society; and it was strongly opposed to any form of violent or direct action as a means of remedying those grievances. Co-existing as it did with its more violent counterparts, this incident suggests that in some areas at least, there was considerable subtlety and variation in the forms of protest adopted by the rural poor. This essay outlines the main features of this form of protest in Wiltshire, seeking to pinpoint those factors which allowed it to flourish and to ascertain the part it played in the general pattern of unrest in the county between the 1830 s and the 1870 s...|$|R
40|$|Beginning in December 2010, {{a virtual}} tsunami of {{legislative}} change hit public sector labor law. The change {{was fueled by}} a view that public employee unions were exercising outsized power and a privileged position of exclusive access to public decision-makers to extract excessive wages and benefits, protect employees who were poor performers, stifle incentive to excel and stifle innovation. This article evaluates these reforms which increased public employer power to act unilaterally in light of my prior work on collective representation of public employees. That prior work focused on how public sector labor law doctrine channels union representation into narrow areas of <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> protection of employees {{from the effects of}} decisions made unilaterally by management and calls for reforms that provide workers with a voice, and hence a reason to invest in, the success of the public sector enterprise. The current article finds that the reforms blown in by the recent tsunami are doomed to failure. Rather than increase employer unilateralism, we need to increase worker involvement to improve public services. The article examines reforms in Indiana and Tennessee which, on their face, appear promising in this regard, and finds them to be largely illusory. It concludes by looking at a few glimmers of hope, coming from Ohio, Illinois and a joint task force of the American Federation of Teachers and the American Association of School Administrators...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} I {{argue that the}} highly centralized, fragmented, unaccountable and unresponsive {{character}} of rural administration in South Africa may persist into the future unless serious consideration is given to establishing a strong, decentralized rural local government system. The article has been adapted from a report commissioned by the National Land Committee, a body which {{has been instrumental in}} highlighting many of the concerns raised here within different public policy arenas. The rural local government debate is contextualized in the light of urban and regional government debates, highlighting the challenges implied by the establishment of an effective rural local government system (part 1); and suggests policy measures aimed at overcoming them (part 2). Contextualizing the Rural Local Government Debate The issue of rural local government has received relatively little prominence relative to other national debates (particularly those around urban and regional government issues) (exceptions are Tandy, 1992; Mclntosh, 1992). The rural local government question has generally only been considered incidentally in relation to these other issues. This holds obvious dangers, namely that rural people's concerns are unlikely to be addressed by rural structures which emerge out of processes which are residual to urban, regional and central government restructuring initiatives. The urban local government debate: The prominence of urban local government and service delivery issues over rural ones might be understood {{in the light of the}} important role played by largely urban-based civics in opposing apartheid policies generally. Their particular role in resisting government attempts to deflect demands for national democracy by creating avenues for black representation within ethnic local government bodies in the mid- 1980 s was a particularly important part of the United Democratic Front's (UDF) opposition to the bicameral parliament The role of such civics within the liberation struggle and their capacity to win significant victories over <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> <b>issues</b> within South Africa's urban heartlands has meant that th...|$|R
40|$|The Maine woods, {{together}} with the rocky coast, provide enduring images and metaphors associated with Maine's sense of itself as a place. Cultural, social, and economic changes in our society have fostered a new period of ferment and debate over the Maine woods, just {{at a time when}} the traditional <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> conservation <b>issues</b> appeared to be generally under control. A period of contention over spruce budworm spraying, forest practices legislation, and land development seemed likely to be simmering down. Yet a new period of even more bitter debate is emerging, in which more fundamental issues are being joined. A major Maine conservation group has advocated a strict new zoning policy for the wildlands. National environmental groups have advocated a new national park around Cobscook Bay, and a Maine Woods Reserve covering 2. 5 million acres surrounding Baxter Park. It is important to get beneath the surface of these events, as I attempt to do in a brief way here. The shifting role of public ownership and regulation is a significant aspect of Maine public policy about forests. Maine's pattern of private forest ownership ensures this (See Table 1. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} that Iraq hurt Blair {{is far from}} conclusive, argues David Burchell JUST ABOUT every Australian media outlet explained Tony Blair’s relatively narrow victory in this month’s British general election {{in exactly the same}} way. It was the war, stupid. So the story goes, British voters were so angered by Blair’s involvement in the Iraq conflict that they punished Labour via that modern equivalent of divine justice, the ballot box. It’s a persuasive explanation in large measure on account of the number of commentators who want to believe it. So rancorous and splenetic has been the public debate on the war, and so high-minded and thoroughly moral have been the loudest commentators, that there’s an almost limitless appetite on all sides for thunderbolts, comeuppances and just deserts. There’s only one problem with the story: it’s not at all clear that it’s true. Actually, nobody is absolutely sure how important Iraq was in the election result. But almost nobody on the ground there seriously believes Iraq was the single decisive issue. Moreover, the issues on which the main opposition Conservative Party gained some traction weren’t high-minded moral questions of international peace and friendship, but rather half-spoken, half-whispered home-grown anxieties about law and order, discipline and school discipline. There may be genuine reasons here for British Labour (like its Australian counterpart) to be concerned about its future. But if there are, Iraq is not obviously the key. British voters gave different answers on Iraq during the campaign - depending at least partly on what question they were asked. Where voters were asked to nominate what for them was the most important election issue, Iraq usually ranked well behind the usual <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> <b>issues</b> like the economy, health and education. In a number of mainstream polls, such as an IRQ poll held in late April, Iraq was nominated as an election issue by around 3 per cent of respondents. The two exceptions were a poll for the Guardian (a consistent Blair critic) in mid-April, and a poll for the famously anti-Blair BBC released a day before the election. The Guardian poll prompted respondents with a list of issues, and asked them to rank them in importance. Iraq was nominated as ‘very important’ by slightly fewer than one in five people - much higher than the other polls, though still behind the main <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> <b>issues.</b> Only in the BBC poll released on election eve the war suddenly leap ahead to 23 per cent, on a par with immigration. The BBC reported these results without much detail, and failed to explain the discrepancy. There is no doubt that some people were greatly influenced by Iraq when they travelled to the ballot-box. The problem for some commentators is that these tended to be quite specific sorts of people. Seats with large Muslim populations seem to have swung significantly more than the average against Labour. And Iraq presumably played a part in that. According to British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw - whose northern electorate is about one-quarter Muslim - fringe Muslim groups spent {{a large part of the}} campaign travelling the length and breadth of the country, preaching to fellow-Muslims about the need to vote for someone - anyone - other than Labour. Since Straw himself was comfortably re-elected with the lost of only a few thousand votes, it seems this campaign had only moderate success. Anecdotally, commitment to the pan-Islamic cause in the British Muslim community is largely the province of the young and the comfortably-off. Iraq arguably served to widen rifts within the British Muslim community, rather than unite it. Elsewhere, as in Australia, those most excited about Iraq tended to live in towns with high concentrations of the tertiary-educated - and particularly university centres. Cambridge swung from Labour to the staunchly anti-war centrist Liberal Democrats, as did other well-heeled seats in ‘varsity’ towns like Bristol, Leeds and Manchester. In the university town of Cardiff, South Wales, where the Lib Dems polled strongly, one Labour canvasser reported that almost one in three people she door-knocked raised the war. Yet across Wales in working-class Neath, another Labour canvasser reported that not a single person in fifty households had so much as mentioned Iraq. By all accounts, the major impact of Iraq on the Labour vote was its effect on the personal credibility of PM Tony Blair. Despite the passage of four public inquiries - none of which found him guilty of any untruths or personal wrongdoing - the simple fact that Blair’s arguments for going to war were proven wrong by events have inevitably stained his reputation, and left a residue of mistrust. Nowadays it’s hard for Blair to walk around in public without being accosted by some Old Testament prophet, whether from Left or Right, denouncing him to the heavens. Yet it’s arguable that Blair’s critics have greatly overemphasised the impact of the ‘Blair the Liar’ campaign. Many ordinary Australians suspect John Howard’s integrity in the ‘children overboard’ affair, but they showed themselves at the ballot-box to more concerned with political competence than moral virtue. British voters have tended in the past to be similarly pragmatic. In any case, Labour spent far less time rebutting the campaign about Tony Blair’s ‘lies’ than it did combating Conservative scare-campaigns on immigration and law and order. It’s been little reported in this country, but immigration regularly rated much higher than Iraq as an election issue. And the far-right anti-immigration British Nationalist Party more than doubled its support - securing double-figure percentage votes in several northern working-class electorates. Like Australia in 2001 - but on a much larger scale - Britain has recently seen a growing influx of refugees, along with those claiming to be refugees on sometimes flimsy grounds. On the whole the government has managed this sensitively, avoiding the excessive hard-heartedness of tin-pot Little Englanders on the one hand and the lofty but metaphysical arguments of the ‘no borders’ brigade on the other. But the issue still causes anxiety in older white working-class neighbourhoods. And the Conservative campaign director - former Liberal Party director Lynton Crosby - has been striving to create a ‘Howard’s battlers’ effect for British Conservative leader Michael Howard. Unfortunately for the ‘other’ Howard, though, Britain had no pre-election equivalent of the Tampa. Indeed, perhaps the most striking result of the British election - something only too familiar to Australian observers - has been the social realignment of the British electorate. Increasingly, the Liberal Democrats (like the Greens here) are pitching for the university-educated social activists, while the Conservatives are pitching for as many socially conservative blue-collar workers as they can lay their hands on. As in Australia, this leaves British Labour fighting a social battle on two fronts. It needs to keep faith with its traditional working-class, provincial base, and their generally pragmatic, socially protective concerns. But it can’t afford to lose all of the cosmopolitan tertiary-educated social idealists to the Lib Dems. Increasingly, as the two constituencies move further apart in their social views, it’s a difficult balancing-act. But of course, that doesn’t make for as good a story as ‘Tony got his comeuppance’ • David Burchell is a lecturer in humanities at the University of Western Sydney and associate editor of APO.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore whether there are {{distinguishing}} characteristics accounting for unionmember relationships and satisfaction with unions in Australia and South Korea. Over the past two decades, some research attention has been directed toward explaining overall, or global union satisfaction. Rather surprisingly however, there has been little systematic research effort expended into identifying discrete determinants of member-union satisfaction. What has emerged from the few extant studies [which employed U. S., Swedish, and South Korean data sets] is that explanations of member-union satisfaction can be distilled into two principal groupings: most importantly, members' satisfaction with the level of union democracy (or what can be described as member-union relationship issues) -and, important but less so, the traditional <b>bread</b> <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> or economic <b>issues.</b> The unionists utilised in this paper have endured dramatic workplace change: economic recessions, restructures, downsizing, whole-sale sell-offs of public utilities, and hostile political environments - all of which have reformed not only their working environments, but also the very fabric of trade unionism in Australia and South Korea. The findings of this paper suggests that despite contextual differences, that there are remarkable similarities between Australian and South Korean unionists in their reported levels of satisfaction with union representation. Indeed, like their U. S. and Swedish counterparts, it appears that a union's somewhat intangible resources of attention, time and patience, or in other words, relationship issues are foremost in accounting for their satisfaction with overall union representation...|$|R
