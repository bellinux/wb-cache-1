5|$|No {{military}} operations {{were conducted by}} NATO during the Cold War.

Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E
5|$|Similarly he is irreligious, {{his work}} making him {{aware of the}} {{fragility}} of life and consciousness's reliance on the functioning brain. His morality is nuanced, weighing both sides of an issue. When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his medical knowledge, {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them. As a sign of his rationalism, he appreciates the brutality of Saddam Hussein's rule as described <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> professor whom Perowne treated, at the same time taking seriously his children's concerns about the war.|$|E
5|$|The Su-25 {{also saw}} combat during the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–88. The first Su-25s were {{commissioned}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Air Force in 1987 and performed approximately 900 combat sorties {{towards the end}} of the war, carrying out the bulk of Iraqi air attack missions. During the most intense combat of the war, Iraqi Su-25s performed up to fifteen sorties per day, each. In one recorded incident, an Iraqi Su-25 was shot down by an Iranian, Hawk surface-to-air missile, but the pilot managed to eject. This was the only confirmed, successful Iranian attack against an Iraqi Su-25. After the war, Saddam Hussein decorated all of the Iraqi Air Force's Su-25 pilots with the country's highest military decoration.|$|E

5000|$|Iran used M47s against Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war. Iranian M47s {{performed}} poorly against Iraqi tanks such as T-54s, T-62s and T-72s. Large {{numbers of}} M47 tanks were captured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis.</b>|$|R

5|$|Leftist {{influence}} in Syria grew {{further in the}} immediate wake of the crisis; on 15 August, a high-ranking officer from Sidon, Lebanon with Marxist leanings, Afif Bizri, was appointed army chief of staff, and several mid-level officers were replaced with communist officers. Quwatli flew to Egypt amid apparent plans to resign from the presidency {{in favor of the}} Soviet-leaning Azm. However, he returned to Syria on 26 August. Tensions had been rising as rumors swept the region regarding a US-backed Turkish or joint Iraqi-Jordanian invasion of Syria to prevent a potential communist takeover. Quwatli's earlier success in repairing ties between Syria and Saudi Arabia proved particularly useful during this period. Saud immediately lent his full support to Quwatli, whom he viewed as a significant counterweight to the leftist movement, by rebuffing President Dwight D. Eisenhower's appeal to endorse the Eisenhower Doctrine, a policy aimed at containing communist and Arab nationalist {{influence in}} the Middle East. He also accepted an invitation to Damascus by Quwatli on 25 August, publicly stating that Saudi Arabia would support Syria in any aggression against it. Iraqi Prime Minister Ali Jawdat also proclaimed support for Syria when he visited on 26 August, in spite of support for an attack <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> monarchy. Both Saud and Jawdat privately criticized Syria's leadership for increasing dependence on the Eastern bloc.|$|E
