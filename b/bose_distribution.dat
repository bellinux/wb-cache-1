40|$|We {{investigate}} the ground-state properties of two-component Bose gases confined in one-dimensional harmonic traps {{in the scheme}} of density-functional theory. The density-functional calculations employ a Bethe-ansatz-based local-density approximation for the correlation energy, which accounts for the correlation effect properly in the full physical regime. For the binary Bose mixture with spin-independent interaction, the homogeneous reference system is exactly solvable by the Bethe-ansatz method. Within the local-density approximation, we determine the density distribution of each component and study its evolution from <b>Bose</b> <b>distributions</b> to Fermi-like distribution with the increase in interaction. For the binary mixture of Tonks-Girardeau gases with a tunable inter-species repulsion, with a generalized Bose-Fermi transformation we show that the Bose mixture can be mapped into a two-component Fermi gas, which corresponds to exact soluble Yang-Gaudin model for the homogeneous system. Based on the ground-state energy function of the Yang-Gaudin model, the ground-state density distributions are calculated for various inter-species interactions. It is shown that with the increase in inter-species interaction, the system exhibits composite-fermionization crossover. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

This agreement encompasses both statistical factors coming from the <b>Bose</b> <b>distributions</b> of string excitations and a prefactor which depends on the effective string radius.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the energy of a mode of a {{classical}} chaotic field, following the continuous exponential distribution as a classical random variable, can be uniquely decomposed into a sum of its fractional part and of its integer part. The integer part is a discrete random variable (we call it Planck variable) whose distribution is just the <b>Bose</b> <b>distribution</b> yielding the Planck law of black-body radiation. The fractional part is the dark part (we call is dark variable) with a continuous distribution, which is, of course, not observed in the experiments. It is proved that the <b>Bose</b> <b>distribution</b> is infinitely divisible, and the irreducible decomposition of it is given. The Planck variable can be decomposed into an infinite sum of independent binary random variables representing the binary photons (more accurately photo-molecules or photo-multiplets) of energies 2 ^s*h*nu with s= 0, 1, 2 [...] .. These binary photons follow the Fermi statistics. Consequently, the black-body radiation {{can be viewed as}} a mixture of statistically and thermodynamically independent fermion gases consisting of binary photons.

The assumption is valid because the time required to establish equilibrium in the electron gas is much less than the time for achieving equilibrium between the electrons and the surface-phonons.

40|$|To fix the {{background}} and notations, we shall first briefly revisit {{some aspects of the}} following Ewens-like randomized occupancy problem: as-sume distinguishable particles are to be placed at random into the cells of the unit interval which was previously broken into random pieces ac-cording to the (Poisson-) Dirichlet partitioning model. Particles being dis-tinguishable, the statistical structure of the problem can be understood within the Maxwell-Boltzmann setup. In this note, we shall address the following sampling problem of a dif-ferent nature: assume now that indistinguishable particles are to be placed at random within the cells with (Poisson-) Dirichlet distributed sizes. Then the statistical formalism to be used is the one of Bose-Einstein. We show that in the grand canonical ensemble, the Bose sampling procedure from (Poisson-) Dirichlet proportions is, to a large extent, amenable to exact analytic calculations. This concerns for example the full <b>Bose</b> occupancy <b>distributions,</b> the distribution of the number of distinct occupied frag-ments, the number of cells with a prescribed amount of particles.

On the basis of the original publications (from Planck's derivation of the black-body spectrum and Einstein's introduction of the photons up to the results of Born, Heisenberg and Jordan on the quantization of a continuum) a comparative study is presented on the first line of thoughts that led to the concept of quanta.
