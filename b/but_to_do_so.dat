5|$|By 1889, Manmohan had {{determined}} {{to pursue a}} literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, {{as well as to}} study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College. Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most of Australia, where {{exploration}} typically went inland {{from the}} sea, the Gippsland region was first explored and settled by Europeans who came overland from the Monaro region of New South Wales {{and headed down}} to the coastal regions.

25|$|To not be jostled out of {{the saddle}} and to not harm the horse by {{bouncing}} on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E.

In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the Sloan Great Wall. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation Eridanus. It coincides with the 'CMB cold spot', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model.

25|$|Linda Sharp was {{the head}} coach, with Colleen Riley serving as the {{assistant}} coach of the team representing the USA at the World University Games held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia in July 1987. The team {{started out with a}} 35-point victory over Poland and followed that with a 41-point victory over Finland. In the third game, the USA faced the host team Yugoslavia. The USA hit a high percentage of their shots from the free throw line, 16 of 19, but the Yugoslav team earned 43 shots from the line, of which they made 34. With a home crowd behind them, the game came down to the wire, and was tied at the end of regulation. In overtime, Yugoslavia out scored the USA and won the game 93–89. The USA still had a chance {{to make it to the}} medal round, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> had to win their next game against China, and do so by at least five points. The USA fell behind, and were down 16 points at halftime. They fell behind by 20 at one point, but made up the deficit and more in the second half. They went on to win the game, but by only a single point 84–83. They won their final game against Canada, but this left them in fifth place, the first time ever the USA team did not win a medal at the World University Games.|$|E

She manifests as a reddish torso with her {{intestines}} hanging out from under the hem of her T-shirt.

She makes a deal with Alana to save Marko's life in exchange for being taken with them when they leave the planet, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> has to bond her soul to Hazel's. Although Alana is initially reluctant to allow this, she finally relents and soon comes to appreciate Izabel's presence since she can act as a [...] "babysitter" [...] at night and allow Alana and Marko to rest. She has the ability to create realistic illusions with which she can disguise her appearance, although these do not work on machines such as the Robots.|$|E

The Edge said [...] "we heard Wim Wenders {{was looking for a}} song... so I had a go at finishing it." [...] U2 watched the film, Faraway, So Close!, for inspiration on how to craft the song. Bono said [...] "the film was about angels who want to be human and who want to be on Earth. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> they have to become mortal. That was a great image to play with- the impossibility of wanting something like this, and then the cost of having it." [...] Two versions of the song were crafted; the first was released on Zooropa, and the second, almost two minutes longer and featuring [...] "an edgier guitar and drum performance," [...] was included on the Faraway, So Close! soundtrack. Close to the completion of {{the recording}} Bono renamed the song [...] "Stay." [...] Wanting to further reference the Wenders film he then changed it once more, to [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)".|$|E

500|$|The film {{presents}} a legal system where the PreCrime office gathers the {{images from the}} minds of the precogs then organizes them into a coherent order for display in front of a set of judges. The judges appear via video feeds, analyze the images, and according to Cooper, they view the images, listen to Anderton rattle off [...] "a string of legalistic verbiage", then give it a [...] "pro forma ratification." [...] Thus the accused is never present, is not allowed a defense, and is convicted before he is aware he is on trial. The program is marketed in a similar basic fashion, as in its tag line: [...] "It works." [...] Cooper says that in a typical American courtroom drama, the audience is treated {{as if it were the}} jury, but in this system, instead of desiring the hero be proven innocent, the audience seeks instead to have the guilt transferred from Anderton to Burgess. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> Anderton has to disprove the system, which he does by proving the existence of the minority report. This renders the PreCrime justice system inoperable, as if there is doubt related not merely to the gathering of the images, or their ability to be interpreted, but their ability to be correct even in perfect circumstances, then the system of infallible guilt can not exist.|$|E
500|$|During the war years, {{a number}} of Butlin's camps were used as Royal Navy shore establishments. Skegness became , a {{training}} establishment for petty officers; Pwllheli became HMS Glendower, and Ayr became HMS Scotia. Filey became RAF Hunmanby Moor and Clacton, after being considered {{for use as a}} prisoner of war camp, was later used as a training site for the Pioneer Corps. Butlin was recruited by the Ministry of Supply and asked to look at the causes of low morale amongst the workers in Britain's munitions factories. His first stop was at the Royal Ordnance Factory, Chorley, where he found that the camouflaged huts and barbed wire fences used to house workers gave them the feeling of being interned. Using the knowledge and experience he had gained in setting up his holiday camps, Butlin was able to devise activities and systems to boost morale, which led to his appointment as Director General of Hostels. In this position, Butlin introduced games and entertainment similar to those used in his holiday camps. These included: whist drives, amateur dramatics, theatrical productions and cinema. In 1943, he encouraged workers to continue taking their holiday entitlement <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> at home, arranging various travelling fairs to visit towns on their [...] "holiday week". Butlin's appointment to this role gave cause for concern in some quarters, with questions being asked of the under-secretary, Harold Macmillan, about the nature of his involvement. However the appointment was a voluntary one with no salary or expenses and had been made after the consideration of other suitable candidates.|$|E
