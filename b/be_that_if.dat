Qapital directs each of its users to set savings goals, then automatically transfers money from their checking account to an account for savings, when a rule established in the app is met. It uses the [...] "if this then that" [...] (IFTT) rule-based web-service. For example, one rule could <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a user purchases a cup of coffee, then the app will round up the charge to the nearest dollar and deposit the difference into savings. Users connect their bank accounts to Qapital, so it knows when purchases are made. When a rule is met, money for savings are transferred to a Qapital account operated in partnership with Lincoln Savings Bank.|$|E

500|$|In 1888, Sedgwick {{said the}} {{apparent}} contradiction between {{the results of}} these experiments was a consequence of different heating rates used in the experiments: [...] "The truth appears to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the heating be sufficiently gradual, no reflex movements will be produced even in the normal frog; if it be more rapid, yet take place at such a rate as to be fairly called 'gradual', it will not secure the response of the normal frog under any circumstances". Goltz had raised the temperature of the water from 17.5°C to 56°C in about ten minutes, or 3.8°C per minute, in his experiment, whereas Heinzmann heated the frogs over the course of 90 minutes from about 21°C to 37.5°C, a rate of less than 0.2°C per minute. In [...] "On the Variation of Reflex Excitability in the Frog induced by changes of Temperature" [...] (1882) William Thompson Sedgwick writes: [...] "in one experiment by Scripture the temperature was raised at a rate of 0.002°C per second, and the frog was found dead at the end of 2½ hours without having moved." ...|$|E
500|$|Suggesting {{that many}} of the {{philosophical}} and political underpinnings of the author's short stories stemmed from his views on domestic life, Palmer's focus turned to Dick's common use of sterility as a metaphor. In [...] "The Gun", [...] "Second Variety", The Penultimate Truth, and [...] "The Last of the Masters", people and sometimes the earth itself have been driven to sterility. As Palmer noted of [...] "The Last of the Masters", Bors can be interpreted as a symbol of infertility: [...] "It is not clear why he does not replicate himself, or educate his human servants: it is simply a given that he is sterile. The old, technologically advanced, highly organized civilization is a civilization of production, but now under Bors it can do no more than maintain itself." [...] Following an inspection of other short stories with similar references to sterility, Palmer asserts that Dick's work presented a social and existential protest. Palmer interpreted Dick's social critique to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the act of creation validates existence, and genuinely expresses a form of individuality, then the process of reproduction is alienating, oppressive, and retards an individual's liberty. As Palmer explains, [...] "...this process disempowers consumers, and even technocrats, by making them dependent on a process of which they have become entirely ignorant." [...] Existentially, Palmer interpreted Dick to further mean that reproduction violated the author's concept of what made an object unique and valuable: [...] "A thing can't be a real thing unless it is in some sense an individual thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Belief in {{the afterlife}} varies among Wiccans, and does not occupy a central place within the religion. As the {{historian}} Ronald Hutton remarked, [...] "the instinctual position of most ... seems to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> one makes {{the most of the}} present life, in all respects, then the next life is more or less certainly going to benefit from the process, and so one may as well concentrate on the present". Although there are practitioners who do not believe in any form of afterlife, it is nevertheless a common belief among Wiccans that human beings have a spirit or soul that survives bodily death. Understandings of what this soul constitutes vary among different traditions, with Feri Wicca for instance having adopted a belief from Hawaiian religion that the human being has three souls.|$|E
2500|$|Regulated {{genes are}} {{categorized}} {{in terms of}} what they are and what they do, important relationships between genes may emerge. For example, we might see evidence that a certain gene creates a protein to make an enzyme that activates a protein [...] to turn on a second gene on our list. This second gene may [...] be a transcription factor that regulates yet another gene from our list. Observing these links we may begin to suspect that they represent much more than chance associations in the results, and that they are all on our list because of an underlying biological process. On the other hand, it could <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> one selected genes at random, one might find many that seem to have something in common. In this sense, we need rigorous statistical procedures to test whether the emerging biological themes is significant or not. That is where gene set analysis comes in.|$|E
