25|$|The {{substance}} of your answer was: That many people exhort others to charity from self-interest; that men of fortune must mind their fortune; that you cannot go about {{to look for}} poor people; {{that when you have}} seen them your-self, and relieved them, they were scarce ever satisfied; that many make an ill use of what you give them; that you cannot trust the account people give of themselves by letters; that nevertheless you do give to private persons by the hands of Colonel Hudson and others; that you have also given to several hospitals an hundred pounds at a time, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must support your family; that the Lowther family has continued above four hundred years; that you are for great things -- for public charities and for saving the nation from ruin; and that others may think as they please, but this is your way of thinking, and has been for many years...|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E

In 1779, while the American colonies were fighting Britain for their independence, Benjamin Franklin wrote to captains of colonial warships at sea, recommending {{that if they}} {{came into contact with}} Cook's vessel, they were to [...] "not consider her an enemy, nor suffer any plunder to be made of the effects contained in her, nor obstruct her immediate return to England by detaining her or sending her into any other part of Europe or to America; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> treat the said Captain Cook and his people with all civility and kindness, ... as common friends to mankind."

2500|$|In 1933 Dreyer {{was again}} {{commissioned}} by Kansas City Life Insurance {{to complete a}} sculpture of Mercury. [...] Dreyer chose to copy the Giambologna [...] "Flying Mercury" [...] at the Bargello National Museum in Florence, Italy (1580), but instead of using the breath of a zephyr to suspend Mercury (per Giambologna), Dreyer used a wave {{as he did with}} Goddess of Dawn. [...] Inscribed in the circumference of the pedestal is a quote from Horace, Satires 2.6: [...] "NO MORE I ASK, O SON OF MAIA, <b>BUT</b> <b>THAT</b> <b>YOU</b> MAKE THESE GIFTS MY OWN FOR LIFE". [...] Mercury ("SON OF MAIA") in this context is a bringer of good fortune. [...] Mercury is {{in the lobby of the}} main Kansas City Life Insurance building, surrounded by the murals of fellow Art Deco muralist Daniel MacMorris.|$|E
2500|$|Those who devour usury {{shall not}} rise again except as he rises, whom Satan of the touch prostrates; {{that is because}} they say, 'Trafficking (trade) is like usury.' God has {{permitted}} trafficking, and forbidden usury. Whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and gives over, he shall have his past gains, and his affair is committed to God; but whosoever reverts -- those are {{the inhabitants of the}} Fire, therein dwelling forever.God blots out usury, but freewill offerings He augments with interest. God loves not any guilty ingrate.Those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms - their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.O believers, fear you God; and give up the usury that is outstanding, if you are believers.But if you do not, then take notice that God shall war with you, and His Messenger; yet if you repent, you shall have your principal, unwronging and unwronged.And if any man should be in difficulties, let him have respite till things are easier; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should give freewill offerings is better for you, did you but know.

2500|$|Simeona's {{version is}} {{influenced}} by her Christian (Protestant and Catholic) education and her philosophical studies about India, China and Edgar Cayce. Like Hawaiian tradition she emphasizes prayer, confession, repentance, and mutual restitution and forgiveness. Unlike Hawaiian tradition, she describes problems only as the effects of negative karma, saying that [...] "you have to experience by yourself {{what you have done}} to others." [...] <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are the creator of your life circumstances was common knowledge for the people of old as [...] "things we had brought with us from other lifetimes." [...] Any wrongdoing is memorized within oneself and mirrored in every entity and object which was present when the cause happened. As the Law of Cause and Effect predominates in all of life and lifetimes, the purpose of her version is mainly [...] "to release unhappy, negative experiences in past reincarnations, and to resolve and remove traumas from the 'memory banks'." [...] Karmic bondages hinder the evolution of mind, so that [...] "(karmic) cleansing is a requisite for the expansion of awareness". Using her 14-step-process would dissolve those bondages. She did not use mantras or conditioning exercises.|$|E
