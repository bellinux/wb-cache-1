6000|$|My dear Brother and Sister--How {{is it that}} we {{have not}} heard from you from the Settlement yet? The letters must surely have miscarried. I am in {{expectation}} every day. Peachey wrote me a few days ago, saying some more acquaintances of his were preparing to set out for Birkbeck; therefore, I shall take the opportunity of sending you what I can muster in a sheet or two. I am still at Wentworth Place--indeed, I have kept indoors lately, resolved if possible to rid myself of my sore throat; consequently I have not been to see your Mother since my return from Chichester; but my absence from her has been a great weight upon me. I say since my return from Chichester--I believe I told you I was going thither. I was nearly a fortnight at Mr. John Snook's and a few days at old Mr. Dilke's. Nothing worth speaking of happened at either place. I took down some thin paper and wrote on it a little poem called St. Agnes's Eve, which you shall have as it is when I have finished the <b>blank</b> <b>part</b> of the rest for you. I went out twice at Chichester to dowager Card parties. I see very little now, and very few persons, being almost tired of men and things. Brown and Dilke are very kind and considerate towards me. The Miss R.'s have been stopping next door lately, but are very dull. Miss Brawne and I have every now and then a chat and a tiff. Brown and Dilke are walking round their garden, hands in pockets, making observations. The literary world I know nothing about. There is a poem from Rogers dead born; and another satire is expected from Byron, called [...] "Don Giovanni." [...] Yesterday I went to town for the first time for these three weeks. I met people from all parts and of all sets--Mr. Towers, one of the Holts, Mr. Dominie Williams, Mr. Woodhouse, Mrs. Hazlitt and son, Mrs. Webb, and Mrs. Septimus Brown. Mr. Woodhouse was looking up at a book window in Newgate Street, and, being short-sighted, twisted his muscles into so queer a stage that I stood by in doubt whether it was him or his brother, if he has one, and turning round, saw Mrs. Hazlitt, with that little Nero, her son. Woodhouse, on his features subsiding, proved to be Woodhouse, and not his brother. I have had a little business with Mr. Abbey from time to time; he has behaved to me with a little Brusquerie: this hurt me a little, especially when I knew him to be the only man in England who dared to say a thing to me I did not approve of without its being resented, or at least noticed--so I wrote him about it, and have made an alteration in my favour--I expect from this to see more of Fanny, who has been quite shut out from me. I see Cobbett has been attacking the Settlement, but I cannot tell what to believe, and shall be all out at elbows till I hear from you. I am invited to Miss Millar's birthday dance on the 19th--I am nearly sure I shall not be able to go. A dance would injure my throat very much. I see very little of Reynolds. Hunt, I hear, is going on very badly--I mean in money matters. I shall not be surprised to hear of the worst. Haydon too, in consequence of his eyes, is out at elbows. I live as prudently as it is possible for me to do. I have not seen Haslam lately. I have not seen Richards for this half year, Rice for three months, or Charles Cowden Clarke for God knows when.|$|E

40|$|Since English {{expressions}} {{vary according}} to the genres, it is important for students to study questions that are generated from sentences of the target genre. Although various questions are prepared, it is still not enough to satisfy various genres which students want to learn. On the other hand, when producing English questions, sufficient grammatical knowledge and vocabulary are needed, so it is difficult for non-expert to prepare English questions by themselves. In this paper, we propose an automatic generation system of multiple-choice cloze questions from English texts. Empirical knowledge is necessary to produce appropriate questions, so machine learning is introduced to acquire knowledge from existing questions. To generate the questions from texts automatically, the system (1) extracts appropriate sentences for questions from texts based on Preference Learning, (2) estimates a <b>blank</b> <b>part</b> based on Conditional Random Field, and (3) generates distracters based on statistical patterns of existing questions.

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} {{based on}} the sweep plane approach to determine the machined part geometry in 5 -axis machining with general APT tools is presented. Undercut and overcut can be determined. Collision detection between the toolholder, workpiece and workpiece fixture can also be detected. The subtraction of the removed material is obtained for each sweep plane by using a stencil buffer. A flat plane is swept through the <b>blank</b> <b>part,</b> fixture and tool swept volume geometry. The intersections of sweep planes and the swept tool volume are computed {{based on the}} canonical representation of a cone, torus and sphere. The necessary data to compute all the intersections is stored in a text file, here called the M-Plane file (Memory Plane). The equations of the intersections are approximated by a polygon with variable accuracy. The resulting APT tool intersection in each sweep plane is then clipped against the blank workpiece intersection with the current sweep plane. The stencil buffer provides automatically the union of all tool intersections and the subtraction from the blank workpiece. This algorithm provides a 3 D geometric model of the tool swept volume. The display algorithm {{is based on the}} Painter’s algorithm, but there is no time consuming sorting from back to front required, as the sweep proceeds from back to front. The accuracy of the algorithm can be varied {{as a function of the}} requirements by changing the polygon approximation and the distance between the sweep planes...|$|E
40|$|With the {{significantly}} {{increasing demand}} {{on a large}} scale of miniaturized parts, the fabrication of micro-parts by directly using sheet metal is proven to be a promising and efficient micro-manufacturing process. In this process chain, shearing is used to pre-pierce hole or <b>blank</b> cylindrical <b>part.</b> In this research, the material deformation behavior and the fracture effect in shearing are extensively studied and it is revealed that they {{have a significant effect on}} the subsequent operations and the quality of the fabricated parts. In addition, the influence of forming conditions on deformation behavior, fractured surface quality and dimensional accuracy in shearing operation are systematically investigated. The interactive effects of multi-factors including grain size, lubricated condition and shear velocity on the quality of both the <b>blanked</b> <b>part</b> and the pierced hole are discussed. It is revealed that the forming quality deteriorates with the increase of grain size and shear velocity. High viscosity lubricant leads to low deformation load and small work hardening as well as good surface finish. The rag at the pierced hole edge and the surface breakages on the <b>blanked</b> <b>part</b> exist under high shear velocity, and the shear velocity should be controlled within a certain limit to balance the productivity and surface quality. Furthermore, the ultimate shear strength, billet diameter and burr height have the extreme values when the initial grain size equals to the punch-die clearance. Therefore, the deformation behavior and the product quality in micro shearing process is affected by the interactive effect of material state, die dimension, lubricated condition and shear velocity.

40|$|Abstract. Blanking {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{manufacturing}} technologies in sheet metal processing, because nearly each sheet must be trimmed out of a semi-finished part or has to be blanked after a forming process to get the precast part in the manufacturing chain. In general, a high quantity of <b>blanked</b> <b>parts</b> should be manufactured without reworking the tool. Therefore a capable process is indispensable to avoid inadequate part quality or premature failure of the tool because of wear. The blanking process is affected by tool parameters, the press and the material properties of the <b>blanked</b> <b>part.</b> However, another important factor is the occurring temperature in the shearing zone of the sheet metal due to the dissipation of nearly 95 % of the plastic work during blanking and, in addition, frictional heating. This temperature impacts the blanking process features such as tool-wear and resulting cut edge quality. It has been presumed to be negligible by a lot of authors yet. In contrast some publications with experimental and analytical research assume that the temperature reaches values up to 1000 °C. Therefore, this report outlines a thermoelectric method to measure the resulting temperature distribution during the blanking process on the cutting edge of the blanking punch. The feasibility of the investigated measurement concept is shown on a concrete example...|$|R
