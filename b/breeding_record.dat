40|$|ABSTRACT. This review {{summarizes}} <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> of Ross’s gull in Greenland {{with special}} emphasis on the period between 1979 and 2007. The review comprises both previously published records (including some published only in Danish) and unpublished reports and <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> from 2004 and 2006. The majority of the Greenland <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> fall into two geographically isolated areas that differ in habitat and climate: the Disko Bay area in West Greenland and the Northeast Water Polynya in Northeast Greenland. Despite the fact that antagonistic interactions with arctic terns are common, Ross’s gulls show a nest site preference for the edge of tern colonies, suggesting breeding association between these species. A general increase in <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> in Greenland since 1978 is most likely the result of increased ornithological effort. Successful breeding {{has not yet been}} confirmed, and a Ross’s gull fledgling remains to be seen in Greenland. The Greenland <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> suggest an opportunistic strategy in choice of breeding site among vagrant and possibly first-time breeders...|$|R

50|$|In Britain {{there were}} {{intermittent}} reports of breeding {{in the nineteenth}} century, and again in 1946 and 1957, {{but none of these}} records were proven. The first proven British <b>breeding</b> <b>record</b> is from Yorkshire in 1984, and the second from Somerset in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|In New Guinea the bittern {{is found}} {{seasonally}} in the reed beds of the Waigani Swamp near Port Moresby from November to April, only being reliably recorded {{elsewhere on the}} island from the lowlands of the Trans-Fly region. [...] No firm <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> are from New Guinea, though a specimen taken in the middle Fly River lagoons was of a bird ready to lay, indicating breeding in the Fly River marshes in September. [...] The lack of good <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> suggests {{that at least some}} birds in New Guinea are seasonal migrants from Australia.|$|R
50|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season the Chinese egret occurs in shallow tidal estuaries, mudflats and bays, occasionally visiting rice-fields and fish ponds. All recent <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> {{have been from}} offshore islands.|$|R

50|$|Lathrop died of {{pernicious anemia}} in 1918. She was interred at West Cemetery in Granby, near her friends Chapin and Gray. Her notebooks, observations, and <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> {{are kept in}} the library of The Jackson Laboratory.|$|R
50|$|From the few known <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> in Kenya, {{egg-laying}} {{appears to}} take place from June to August. The clutch typically comprises three eggs. The egg is pea green with cinnamon rufous stains and chesnut-brown marks. It typically weighs about 50g and measures 56-58 x 40-41mm.|$|R
50|$|All known {{genes are}} on {{separate}} chromosomes, and therefore no gene linkage {{has yet been}} described among coat genes. However, they do share chromosomes with other major conformational genes, and {{in at least one}} case, <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> have shown an indication of genes passed on together.|$|R
50|$|This ibis breeds solitarily. Its first <b>{{breeding}}</b> <b>record</b> {{was made}} in 1910 on Mount Kenia at 9000 feet. Later breeding records of this ibis have been made adjacent to water in East Africa. One nest was discovered at {{the headwaters of the}} Pesi River in the northern Aberdares in mixed Juniperus/Podocarpus forest, and another at a streamlet near the Thiririka River in the southeastern Aberdares in mixed Podocarpus/Ocotea forest. In both cases, the nest measured 20-40 cm in diameter, was situated 2-4m above {{the surface of the water}} and precariously balanced in slender branches. Generally, the nest is loosely composed of dead branches supported on a tree limb and appears surprisingly unstable for a bird of its size. Additionally, both the male and female have been observed to silently construct the nest. Although only nests of akleyorum have been thus far discovered, those of the remaining subspecies are probably similar in structure and location (Chapin, 1932). The only <b>breeding</b> <b>record</b> in West Africa comes from Liberia in June.|$|E
50|$|Among landbirds are a rich {{assortment}} {{consisting of}} warblers, babblers, bee-eaters, bulbuls, buntings, chats, Painted francolins and quails. The Indian grey hornbill and Marshall's iora are also present. There are many {{birds of prey}} including the osprey, peregrine, Pallas' sea eagle, short-toed eagle, tawny eagle, imperial eagle, spotted eagle and crested serpent eagle. The greater spotted eagle has recently been recorded breeding here, a new <b>breeding</b> <b>record</b> for the species in India.|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{attributes}} {{associated with}} good breeding habitat {{is critical for}} understanding animal population dynamics. However, the association between environmental heterogeneity and breeding probability has been often overlooked in habitat analyses. We evaluated habitat quality in a metapopulation of the endangered Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus by analyzing spatiotemporal patterns in <b>breeding</b> <b>records.</b> Data summarizing successful production of litters after emergence from dens over four years within 13 lynx territories were examined. We designed a set of generalized linear mixed models representing different hypotheses regarding how patterns in <b>breeding</b> <b>records</b> relate to environmental heterogeneity. Environmental heterogeneity was described by two characteristics: 1) a landscape index measured in lynx territories indicative of time-averaged prey availability and 2) yearly variability in prey abundance not captured with this index. By including the random effect of the lynx territory we also accounted for other territory-specific effects on reproduction. We found significant differences in yearly prey density dynamics among lynx territories. However, temporal variation in prey density contributed poorly to explaining lynx breeding. The most parsimonious model included the landscape structure as the only effect explaining breeding patterns. A multinomial-model-representation of the landscape hypothesis explained nearly 50 % of variability in <b>breeding</b> <b>records.</b> Results pointed {{to the existence of}} a habitat quality gradient associated with particular landscape structures influencing lynx habitat selection an...|$|R
50|$|Chapeau d'Espagne was {{retired from}} racing {{to become a}} broodmare at Lord George Bentinck's stud. In 1841 she {{produced}} a filly sired by Bay Middleton, named All Round My Hat, who won the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood in 1844. Her other progeny were less successful and she was sold to M. Myslowski in 1847. As a broodmare for Ritter Anton and Myslowski-Koropiec, Chapeau d'Espagne produced five colts and three fillies between 1850 and 1858. There is no <b>breeding</b> <b>record</b> for her after 1858.|$|E
5000|$|Two major {{breeding}} {{records of}} this species have been made; in Southern Thailand in 1986, and in swamp forest in South Samatra in 1989. However, chicks in the Thailand <b>breeding</b> <b>record</b> were first observed in October [...] and those in Sumatra were first observed in early June. The differing recorded times of egg laying in this species therefore does not suggest a strict breeding season. Collective breeding records {{of this species}} are currently scant possibly because nests are difficult to accurately locate in the dense forest habitat.|$|E

50|$|In the 18th century, the {{hawfinch}} {{was recorded}} {{as only a}} rare winter visitor in Britain. The first <b>breeding</b> <b>record</b> was early in the 19th century; by the early 1830s, a well-documented colony was established at Epping Forest in Essex, and breeding was also recorded in other counties east and south of London. Further expansion of the range continued through the 19th and 20th centuries, with breeding occurring {{as far north as}} Aberdeenshire by 1968-1972. Peak numbers were in the period 1983-1990. Subsequently, there has been a significant decline of between 37% and 45% between 1990-1999.|$|E

She was voted the American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly of 1987. She won two minor races from six starts in the following year before being retired from racing. She had a solid <b>breeding</b> <b>record</b> as a broodmare, producing eight winners including the UAE Derby winner Essence of Dubai.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a small}} {{breeding}} {{population of}} 13 pairs of black-naped tern. A small colony of tropical shearwater was rediscovered in 2013, the first confirmed <b>breeding</b> <b>record</b> since the 1950s. Migratory bird numbers are huge and include globally significant numbers of crab plover and Saunders's tern. Seychelles’ largest concentrations of whimbrel, ruddy turnstone and grey plover have also been recorded here. The only land bird is the house sparrow and this is its most southerly outpost in Seychelles. Significant numbers of hawksbill turtles and green turtles nest on St François and Bijoutier, and {{the waters of the}} atoll provide important foraging habitat for immature turtles of both species.|$|E
