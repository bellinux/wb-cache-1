40|$|A {{study on}} Autonomous Maintenance (AM) {{implementation}} was conducted for CNC machine at automotive components manufacturing line {{in order to}} identify and measure equipment losses related to availability, performance and quality rate. These values were used to determine the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of the manufacturing line before and after AM implementation. The project started with AM team formation before it was continued with 5 S activities and fuguai (abnormality) detection and restoration. Kaizen was used for continuous improvement to restore deteriorated parts and components of the machine. Autonomous Maintenance standards such as cleaning, lubricating and inspection were developed. The AM team members consistently followed the operator maintenance standards to ensure that machine is always in good working condition. The OEE results were taken daily after AM implementation and compared with the data before the implementation. The average OEE result shows significant improvement from 65. 8 % to 80. 4 % after the AM implementation. However, the result still did not achieve the company’s target. The main reason was because the machine was very old, which almost reaches deterioration stage according to the <b>bath</b> <b>tub</b> <b>curve.</b> Some recommendations are suggested as to push the OEE value closer to the company’s target including a review on other pillars in Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) ...|$|E
40|$|Increasing cost {{pressure}} due to regulatory guidelines, changing topology of electrical power generation {{as well as}} ageing of equipment and very volatile load flows are the main challenges for {{transmission and distribution system}} operators. Minimizing the total cost and providing a high security of supply at the same time is the aim of system operators. An efficient asset management will help to achieve theses aims. The optimal usage of equipment as well as determining their maximal lifetime are essential aspects in this optimisation process. One of the basic requirements is a comprehensive knowledge about equipments, their type specific behaviour as well as the impact of maintenance strategies on minor and major failure occurrences. Modelling the type specific failure occurrences of high voltage circuit breakers is the objective of this dissertation. First, based on a comprehensive database of minor and major failures as well as empiric findings, the failure model in case of current maintenance actions will be developed and applied on a representative population of circuit breakers. The new type specific ageing models show clear advantages over the general <b>bath</b> <b>tub</b> <b>curve</b> approach. The minor to major failure model (m 2 M) developed in this thesis, enables the mapping between maintenance actions and failure occurrences for the first time. Based on a probabilistic approach the model describes the progression from a minor to a major failure. Here it is presumed, that due to deferred maintenance, the minor failure which is normally discovered is not remedied and can subsequently progress to a major failure. The estimated failure occurrence after the normal maintenance interval is exceeded as a superposition of the previously calculated failure occurrence (current maintenance activities) with additional major failures which occur as a result of minor failures. This modelling approach allows a prognosis for type specific failure occurrences in case of modified maintenance actions. Comprehensive analysis on real maintenance data demonstrates the applicability of this approach for circuit breakers as well as for other equipments. Hence, type specific models to predict the failure occurrence of high voltage circuit breakers are available for the first time...|$|E

The cover plate consist of insulating materials compacted to retain the heat in the <b>bath</b> <b>tub.</b> The thermal convection of air is less than thermal resistance of insulating materials used thus heat loss is negligible. Thermal convection air 0. 0579 w m k Thermal Resistance Insulator 7. 046 w m k. Thermal analysis report show at 450 C. Deformation is effecting end portion 2 - 3 mm. Stress amp Strain at that portion is also low 0. 1 - 0. 3 Mpa. Heat transfer of air is more than insulating materials. Thus Heat transfer rate of Insulating materials being low they dont conduct heat from the <b>bath</b> <b>tub</b> to the atmosphere. So temperature of the <b>bath</b> <b>tub</b> is maintained.
