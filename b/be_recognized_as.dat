5|$|Certain astronomical objects {{known as}} spiral nebulae such as M31 would later <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> conglomerations of stars when the true {{distance}} to these objects {{began to be}} discovered, {{and they would be}} deemed island universes.

5|$|Halley was {{the first}} comet to <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> periodic. Until the Renaissance, the {{philosophical}} consensus {{on the nature of}} comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Types B and C live {{close to}} the ice pack, and diatoms in these waters may be {{responsible}} for the yellowish coloring of both types. Mitochondrial DNA sequences support the theory that these are recently diverged separate species.

Advanced methods that sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome revealed systematic differences in DNA between different populations.|$|E
5|$|As deaf {{education}} and sign language research continued to evolve, {{so did the}} perception of ASL. With {{the publication of the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language, ASL began to <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to standardization {{and the development of a}} prestige dialect, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this standardization, ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL. This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to code switch to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL.|$|E
5|$|Cacti show a {{wide variety}} of growth habits, which are {{difficult}} to divide into clear, simple categories. They can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody trunk topped by several to many branches. In the genus Pereskia, the branches are covered with leaves, so the species of this genus may not <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> cacti. In most other cacti, the branches are more typically cactus-like, bare of leaves and bark, and covered with spines, as in Pachycereus pringlei or the larger opuntias. Some cacti may become tree-sized but without branches, such as larger specimens of Echinocactus platyacanthus. Cacti may also be described as shrubby, with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down, such as in Stenocereus thurberi.|$|E

5|$|Charles Sherrington {{published}} his influential 1906 work The Integrative Action of the Nervous System examining {{the function of}} reflexes, evolutionary development {{of the nervous system}}, functional specialisation of the brain, and layout and cellular function of the central nervous system. John Farquhar Fulton, founded the Journal of Neurophysiology and published the first comprehensive textbook on the physiology of the nervous system during 1938. Neuroscience during the twentieth century began to <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> a distinct unified academic discipline, with David Rioch, Francis O. Schmitt, and Stephen Kuffler playing critical roles in establishing the field. Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established the Neuroscience Research Program, an inter-university and international organisation, bringing together biology, medicine, psychological and behavioural sciences. The word neuroscience itself arises from this program.|$|E
5|$|For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors {{from the}} Actors Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast {{in part because}} they were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato decided to make the film in English to appeal to a wider {{audience}} and to lend the film credibility. However, he also needed to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film to <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.|$|E

Team Plasma is led by N, a young man who was brought up alongside Pokémon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport. Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pokémon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pokémon Champion Alder, he will <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pokémon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White.|$|E

5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} to <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> having standing when a fix {{is not used}} for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice Hugo Black (Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge Abner Mikva (McClure v. Carter, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E
5|$|John Bachman {{discovered}} the marsh rice rat in 1816, {{and it was}} formally described in 1837. Several subspecies have been described since the 1890s, mainly from Florida, but disagreement exists over their validity. The Florida Keys population is sometimes classified as a different species, the silver rice rat (Oryzomys argentatus). Data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicate a deep divergence between populations east of Mississippi and those further west, {{which suggests that the}} western populations may <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. The species is part of the genus Oryzomys, which also includes several others occurring further south in Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America, some of which have previously been regarded as subspecies of the marsh rice rat. One, Oryzomys couesi, occurs with the marsh rice rat in Tamaulipas and southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{were among}} the first animals to be domesticated by {{humankind}} (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in Mesopotamia. Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication. Today, Ovis aries is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival. Feral sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of feral horses, goats, pigs, or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough to <b>be</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> distinct breeds.|$|E
