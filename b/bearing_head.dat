40|$|Although {{concrete-filled}} tubular columns {{are becoming}} popular in multi-storey building frames, {{connections between the}} columns and beams using normal blind bolts are limited {{in the level of}} moment-carrying capacity and stiffness they can achieve. This is because of the extensive localised yielding of the thin tube wall caused by the blind bolts bearing {{on the inside of the}} tube wall. This paper reports the results of an innovative modified version of blind bolt that aims to develop economical semi-rigid to rigid connections that are simple to construct. It uses a high tensile threaded rod cut to the required length with two special nuts, one acting as a <b>bearing</b> <b>head</b> on the inner tube wall in association with ONESIDE split washer and the other as an anchoring device in the concrete core. The results from full-scale pullout tests on bolts connected to concrete-filled circular and square hollow sections are presented. The objective of this work was to investigate the anchorage performance of the special blind bolts, including failure modes, strength and stiffness. The parameters selected were tube wall thickness, blind bolt diameter, and concrete strength. The results show that the full tensile capacity of the threaded rod can be achieved in the circular columns with higher strength concrete, whereas the performance is compromised in the square column with lower strength of concrete. These test results provide valuable information for developing a novel concept of blind-bolted moment connections to ensure sufficient strength and stiffness when they are used in momentresisting frames in low seismic regions such as Australia...|$|E

Integrin &alpha;v&beta; 3 is a marker that is specifically and preferentially overexpressed on multiple tumor types and on angiogenic tumor neovasculature. Active targeting of NSs to integrin &alpha;v&beta; 3 {{offers the potential}} to increase accumulation preferentially in tumors and thereby enhance therapy efficacy. Methods: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and cell binding assay were used to study the in vitro binding affinities of the targeted nanoconjugate NS&ndash;RGDfK. In vivo biodistribution and tumor specificity were analyzed using 64 Cu-radiolabeled untargeted and targeted NSs in live nude rats <b>bearing</b> <b>head</b> and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) xenografts. The potential thermal therapy applications of NS&ndash;RGDfK were evaluated by subablative thermal therapy of tumor xenografts using untargeted and targeted NSs. Results: ELISA and cell binding assay confirmed the binding affinity of NS&ndash;RGDfK to integrin &alpha;v&beta; 3. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging suggested that tumor targeting is improved by conjugation of NSs to cyclo(RGDfK) and peaks at ~ 20 hours postinjection. In the subablative thermal therapy study, greater biological effectiveness of targeted NSs was implied by the greater degree of tumor necrosis. Conclusion: The results {{presented in this paper}} {{set the stage for the}} advancement of integrin &alpha;v&beta; 3 -targeted NSs as therapeutic nanoconstructs for effective cancer therapy.

Quantum dots with near-infrared emission spectra demonstrate excellent tissue penetration and photostability, and have recently emerged as important tools for in vivo tumor imaging. Integrin αvβ 3 has been shown to be highly and specifically expressed in endothelial cells of tumor angiogenic vessels in almost all types of tumors, and specifically binds to the peptide containing arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD). In this study, we conjugated RGD with quantum dots with emission wavelength of 800 nm (QD 800) to generate QD 800 -RGD, and used it via intravenous injection as a probe to image tumors in nude mice <b>bearing</b> <b>head</b> and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Twelve hours after the injection, the mice were still alive and were sacrificed to isolate tumors and ten major organs for ex vivo analysis to localize the probe in these tissues. The results showed that QD 800 -RGD was specifically targeted to integrin αvβ 3 in vitro and in vivo, producing clear tumor fluorescence images after the intravenous injection. The tumor-to-background ratio and size of tumor image were highest within 6 hours of the injection and declined significantly at 9 hours after the injection, but there was still a clearly visible tumor image at 12 hours. The greatest amount of QD 800 -RGD was found in liver and spleen, followed by tumor and lung, and a weak fluorescence signal was seen in tibia. No detectable signal of QD 800 -RGD was found in brain, heart, kidney, testis, stomach, or intestine. Our study demonstrated that using integrin αvβ 3 as target, it is possible to use intravenously injected QD 800 -RGD to generate high quality images of HNSCC, and the technique offers great potential in the diagnosis and personalized therapy for HNSCC.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} & submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of M. Sc. in Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 1425 H - 2004 GLeishmaniasis is a devastating parasitic disease affecting {{people all over the}} world except Australia and Antarctica. It is produced by the flagellated protozoa of the leishmania genus. WHO considers it as one of the six parasitic diseases to be eradicated. Three million individuals suffer from various forms of the leishmaniasis, the number of new cases being in the order of 1. 5 million each year. Pentavalent Antimonial in the form of Sodium Stibogluconate (Pentostam®: Welcome Ltd. UK) is being used as the first line of drugs in the treatment of Leishmaniasis especially for visceral form, for more than five decades. For studying the pharmacokinetic properties a daily dose of 200 mg/kg of Pentostam® was administered intramuscularly as multiple doses for 24 days. Animals (six animals for each interval) were sacrificed for blood collection at 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 12 and 24 hours following the last injection of the drug. Antimony was measured in whole blood by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results recorded suggested that the drug is rapidly absorbed, distributed and eliminated with a half-life of 5. 6 hours. A comparison of the data on mice with that on human and hamster showed that mouse is the fastest eliminating species of sb among the three. In spite of the fastest clearance of the drug from the mice, its apparent volume of distribution, as steady state (Vdss) in mice is the highest 5. 52 L/kg as against 1. 04 and 0. 162 L/kg in humans and hamsters, respectively. Mutagenic potentials of the drug are evaluated in somatic cells from bone marrow and germinal cells from testes of mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with two doses of the drug, dose I (40 mg/kg) and dose II (125 mg/kg), (1. 0 mg and 3. 12 mg per mouse, respectively) for 24 days, while the control animals were injected with sterile distilled water. Parameters investigated included evaluation of the effects of Pentostam® on cell division, on cell cycle kinetics and on somatic chromosomes. A strong mitodepressive activity exhibiting more than 70 % reduction in MI was recorded till 48 hours which fell to about 26 % at 72 hours and to a further lower level of 22 % at one week period. This suggested that Sb possess cytotoxic properties which are transitory and that the tissue shows a significant recovery from this effect. A comparison of the number of cells in interphase and M-phase in treated series with those in controls revealed higher numbers for interphase cells in the treated animals indicating a delay in cell cycle progression. This cell cycle delay was observed till 48 hours beyond which the number of cells in interphase reached almost control levels. Further, a return to the normal cell cycle indicates a repair of the genetic damage. Also the cell cycle delay could have indirectly influenced the observed mitodepression is suggested. Results from cytogenetic studies in bone marrow show some of the chromosome abnormalities scored in the Sb treated animals. These results indicated that Sb induced structural chromosome aberrations but failed to induce numerical abnormalities suggesting that the drug interacted only with DNA but not with the microtubular system of the spindle apparatus. A dose response was observed for all types of abnormalities. While the individual type of abnormalities were insignificant at all period with an exception of one or two, the total number of abnormal metaphases showed significance at all periods. Chromosome type aberrations were more frequent than chromatid type which shows a more pronounced action of the drug in the Gi phase of cell cycle. Six and 24 hour periods demonstrated the highest frequency of abnormalities. A reduction in their frequencies was observed at 48 hours and remained at almost the same level in the later periods till one week. Persistence of the drug for longer periods and conversion of the pentavalent antimony to trivalent form that binds more strongly to tissues and accounts for the toxicity has been reported in humans exposed to Sb. The drug may follow a similar course in the animal system (mouse) and thus account for the persistence of the chromosome damage recorded in the present studies. Alternatively, it is reasonable to propose that some of the stem cells in the bone marrow could have been affected by the action of the drug which may be responsible for the persistence of the damage over long period. The results presented in this thesis suggest a weak but persistent type of clastogenic property of the drug. The mutagenic potential of Sb in the male germ cells is estimated through the analysis of morphological changes induced in the spermatozoa of treated animals. Since the phenotype of the sperm (the shape and dimensions) are determined by the genotype of the spermatogenic cells, mutations (gene or chromosomal) induced in the spermatogenic cells could be scored as morphological changes in the spermatozoa. Since one spermatogenic cycle in mouse is completed in five weeks, results on the sperm abnormalities are evaluated at 24 hours and these results weekly intervals for six weeks from the last day of the drug treatment. Quantitative data from these results indicates that germ cells are highly sensitive to the action of Sb as evidenced by the presence of a high percentage of abnormal spermatozoa in the drug treated animals as against the control values. Abnormal spermatozoa are categorized into three groups, those <b>bearing</b> <b>head</b> abnormality, those that show tail abnormality and those that include both head and tail abnormality together. Dose response was observed for all the three categories suggesting that a higher dose could induce more damage. Spermatozoa with head abnormalities ranked higher than those with tail abnormality. Spermatozoa with tail abnormalities could affect the movement of the sperm and hence impair the fertilizing capacity of the organisms, as well as sperm with head abnormalities could also affect the fertilizing capacity. However, it is possible that spermatozoa with head abnormality could still participate in fertilization, and thus transfer genetic damage to the fertilized ovum that could affect the embryo in several ways. With respect to the sensitivity of the various stages of spermatogenic cycle to the drug, it could be said that spermatids and secondary spermatocytes were least sensitive while spermatogonia were the most sensitive and primary spermatocytes intermediate in sensitivity. The 6 th week of observation recorded the highest percentage of abnormal spermatozoa (60 %) which is indicative of a probable damage induced in the spermatogenic stem cells in the semineferous tubules. Alternatively, the highest level of damage in the last period could have resulted from the action of sb in the trivalent from. Whether the sperm abnormalities would persist for much longer period need to be investigated by extending the observation period beyond six weeks is suggested. Results confirm a strong mutagenic property of Sb in the germ cells. King Saud Universit...|$|E
