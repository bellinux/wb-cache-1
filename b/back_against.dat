5|$|Defensive {{structures}} such as spines may be {{used both}} to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight <b>back</b> <b>against</b> a predator. Methods of fighting back include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism.|$|E

5|$|But, the {{defendant}} {{does not have}} a right to a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions, even if the cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months, as long as the actual sentence does not. Factors other than actual and authorized sentences may be relevant to seriousness, but so far the Court has pushed <b>back</b> <b>against</b> expanding the jury right.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, a mixed {{group of}} black and white men play {{baseball}} in Roswell, New Mexico. Suddenly, a group of Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members arrive on horseback, seeking one of the players: Josh Exley (Jesse L. Martin), a talented black baseball player. Men from the team fight <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the KKK, and when the mask of the clan's leader is taken off, the leader is revealed to actually be an alien.|$|E
5|$|Some prey {{species are}} capable of {{fighting}} <b>back</b> <b>against</b> predators, whether with chemicals, through communal defence, or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by sacrificing certain body parts: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.|$|E
5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian ships was pushed back by the Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been pushed <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E

5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed <b>back</b> <b>against</b> her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, the Christian states, {{which had}} been {{confined}} to the north-western part of the peninsula, began to push <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the Islamic states in the south, a period known as the Reconquista. By about 1150, the Christian north had coalesced into the five major kingdoms of León, Castile, Aragon, Navarre, and Portugal. Southern Iberia remained under control of Islamic states, initially under the Caliphate of Córdoba, which broke up in 1031 into a shifting number of petty states known as taifas, who fought with the Christians until the Almohad Caliphate re-established centralised rule over Southern Iberia in the 1170s. Christian forces advanced again in the early 13th century, culminating in the capture of Seville in 1248.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy {{campaigned on}} the {{platform}} that Eisenhower was weak on defense {{and that he was}} not doing enough to solve the looming missile gap. After his win in the 1960 elections he was flooded with calls and letters urging that Zeus be continued. This was a concentrated {{effort on the part of}} the Army, who fought <b>back</b> <b>against</b> similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible, while taking out advertisements in major mass-market magazines like Life and The Saturday Evening Post promoting the system.|$|E

5|$|On September 28, 1862, Gwyn sent {{a letter}} to Colonel Barnes stating that the 118th Regiment did not provide the Philadelphia Inquirer with {{information}} that the paper used to publish a map and a report of the incident. Two days later, Gwyn issued a report on the Battle of Shepherdstown, noting the efforts he made to rally troops to fight <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the Confederate troops, though his efforts were in vain, as Colonel Barnes ordered to regiment to fall back.|$|E
5|$|Succeeding at the AHL level, Raymond {{recorded}} a five-point {{game with a}} hat trick and two assists during a match against the Rochester Americans on November 21, 2007. The Canucks recalled him the following month on December 11 following injuries to forwards Brendan Morrison and Brad Isbister. The next day, he scored his first NHL goal {{in his first game}} <b>back</b> <b>against</b> goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère of the Anaheim Ducks. The goal came assisted on a one-timer pass from Moose teammate Jason Jaffray, who had been called up from Manitoba the same day as Raymond. Later that game, he also assisted Jaffray's first NHL goal in the third period. The Canucks {{went on to win the}} game, 3–2.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Test saw Miller take a wicket in each innings, {{his victims}} being Wright and Evans. He also caught Yardley and Compton {{in the first}} and second innings respectively. After Miller scored 23 to help Australia make 253 in reply to England's 280, the {{tourists}} fell for 186 in their second innings, leaving the hosts with a target of 214 runs on a wearing wicket that was increasingly aiding spin. Miller came to the crease when Bradman fell with the score at 3/149. McCool joined Miller after the loss of Hassett and Ron Hamence in quick succession left Australia at 5/180. Wright then beat Miller with three consecutive leg breaks, before the batsman struck <b>back</b> <b>against</b> Bedser with consecutive boundaries for four. Together with McCool, Miller saw Australia to the target without further loss.|$|E

5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch-digging, {{in which}} the forefeet are placed against the substrate, the claws are entered into the substrate, and the forefeet are then drawn <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the body. Other {{parts of the body}} also show such specializations, {{including}} large hindlimbs and a broad tail. Some aspects of the vertebral column and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect, or sitting, posture. The animal may also have been capable of climbing, perhaps {{in a manner similar to}} gymnures and shrew tenrecs, which are small-eyed like Plesiorycteropus. It was probably myrmecophagous, eating insects such as ants and termites, but may also have eaten other soft food, and because of its small size probably did not forage in termite mounds, as the aardvark does.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in 2013, a year after creatures known as the Twisted have {{appeared}} from beneath Manhattan and decimated the city. To fight <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the Twisted, an investigatory team called the Counter Twisted Investigation (CTI) is formed. Among their number is series protagonist Aya Brea, who was found unconscious and suffering amnesia {{two years before the}} game's events. Using her Overdive ability, Aya travels into the past to alter the outcome of battles against the Twisted. At the same time, Aya attempts to find out the origin of the Twisted and regain her memories.|$|E

5|$|The shock {{from the}} Japanese sleeper ray is strong but not {{life-threatening}} to humans. There is an observation of a ray that reacted to being touched {{with a camera}} by rubbing its <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the camera port, suggesting that it may actively defend itself if disturbed. The Japanese sleeper ray adapts poorly to captivity. This and other species of electric rays are used in biomedical research because their electric organs have an abundance of ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, and {{can serve as a}} model for the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys talamancae is a medium-sized, {{brightly colored}} rice rat. It {{is similar to}} T.bolivaris and the two are often confused. They are about as large, but in T.talamancae the tail is longer and the hindfeet shorter. Both species share uniquely long vibrissae, with both the mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae {{extending}} to or beyond the back margin of the ears when laid <b>back</b> <b>against</b> the head, but those in T.bolivaris are substantially longer. H.alfaroi, a widespread species ranging from Mexico to Ecuador, is also similar. It is smaller and darker, but young adult T.talamancae are similar in color to adult H.alfaroi and often misidentified. Hylaeamys megacephalus, with which T.talamancae was synonymized for some decades, is similar in body size, but is not known to overlap with T.talamancae in range.|$|E
5|$|Wei strikes <b>back</b> <b>against</b> Wu, {{who have}} {{attacked}} them at Fan Castle. Cao Ren successfully defends the fortifications against Lu Meng, who fails to lay siege layers against the walls. At Shiting in 228 AD, Cao Xiu narrowly survives a defection ploy by Zhou Fang, with aid from Sima Yi, who destroys Lu Xun's army. The final battle is at He Fei Castle, where the Wei general Zhang Liao defeats Sun Jian {{in a series}} of ambushes. If Shu has been defeated first, Wei will attack the capital at Jianye and every member of the Sun family is killed as the Three Kingdoms come to an end.|$|E
