5|$|The {{land border}} {{disputes}} pertain to comparatively small strips of land. The Croatia–Slovenia border disputes are: along the Dragonja River's lower course where Slovenia claims three hamlets on the river's left bank; the Sveta Gera peak of Žumberak where exact territorial claims were never made {{and appear to}} be limited to a military barracks on the peak itself; and along the Mura River where Slovenia wants the border to <b>be</b> <b>along</b> the current river bed instead of along a former one and claims a (largely if not completely uninhabited) piece of land near Hotiza. These claims are likewise {{in the process of being}} settled by binding arbitration.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Voss Line was {{completed}} Norway had plunged into recession. Parliament {{was not willing to}} give more money to railways, and the country had to make do with a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow up with any funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (which later would get the Numedal Line). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final stage would <b>be</b> <b>along</b> the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, DSHD {{initiated}} traffic {{surveys and}} studies to inform plans {{to construct a}} four-lane divided highway south from Dover. The studies, completed in 1942, found that US13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the divided highway to the Maryland state line to <b>be</b> <b>along</b> the US13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US113 to a divided highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final link in the DoverDelmar divided highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC prioritized completing expansion of US13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, {{only a small portion}} of US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to a divided highway.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to <b>be,</b> <b>along</b> with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the same}} time as the Pythagoreans, Plato {{described}} a theory of matter in which the five elements (earth, air, fire, water and spirit) each comprised tiny copies of one of the five regular solids.

25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{flood control}} {{reservoir}} like Benbrook Lake, is that floodwaters from heavy rains are retained above the dam. This reduces river flows downstream of the dam, and so prevents property damage and losses, but lake levels above the dam rise, and lands surrounding the lake are inundated. In other words, flooding is not eliminated, but its location is predetermined—it will <b>be</b> <b>along</b> the undeveloped lakeshore area upstream of the dam, rather than along the industrialized or populated downstream river valley.|$|E
25|$|The {{programme}} has {{its roots}} firmly in the desire of Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner to get Elisabeth Sladen back into the TARDIS. He had wanted her to have the contract eventually awarded to Janet Fielding in late 1980. John Nathan-Turner's preferred plan for the transition from Baker to Davison was to have Sarah Jane <b>be</b> <b>along</b> for the ride from Logopolis to the second story of series 19. However, Sladen {{had no interest in}} returning simply to reprise a role and function identical to the one she had left years before.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} road races is highly {{important}} and the IAAF dictate that the courses must <b>be</b> <b>along</b> man-made roads, bicycle paths or footpaths. Courses set along major roads of cities {{are typical of}} road running events, and traffic is usually cordoned off from the area during the competition. While soft ground, such as grass, is generally avoided, races may start and finish on soft ground or within a track and field stadium. Road racing courses come in two primary types: looped and point-to-point. Courses may be measured and designed to cover a standardised distance, such as , or they may simply follow a set route between two landmarks.|$|E

Henry made some attempts to combine with the Mongols, and in the autumn of 1299 sent a small fleet of two galleys, led by Guy of Ibelin and John of Giblet, to join Ghazan. The fleet successfully reoccupied Botrun on the mainland (in modern times this would <b>be</b> <b>along</b> the coast of Lebanon), and for a few months, until February 1300, began rebuilding the fortress of Nephin.|$|E
25|$|A {{new view}} is {{developing}} that the regional tectonic boundary is not under Hood Canal, {{but just to}} the west, involving the Saddle Mountain fault zone (discussed below) and associated faults. This is supported by geologically recent scarps and other signs of active faulting on the Saddle Mountain faults, and also discovery of a geophysical lineament running through Pleasant Harbor (south of Brinnon) that appears to truncate strands of the Seattle Fault. In this view Hood Canal is only a syncline (dip) between the Olympic Mountains and the Puget Lowland, and such faults as have been found there are local and discontinuous, ancillary to the main zone of faulting to the west. North of the Seattle Fault accommodation of regional movement may <b>be</b> <b>along</b> the northwest-striking Dabob Bay Fault Zone.|$|E
25|$|Eglinton Crosstown LRT: The longest {{proposed}} corridor, at over , would <b>be</b> <b>along</b> Eglinton Avenue, from Kennedy {{subway station}} in Scarborough to Jane Street. Between Keele Street and Laird Drive, the road has been deemed too narrow for a right-of-way, {{and therefore the}} line will run in a tunnel (with underground stations), much like the cancelled Eglinton West subway line. The entire planned route is originally {{expected to be completed}} by 2020. The western section between Mount Dennis and Toronto Pearson International Airport was postponed as a result of provincial funding cuts. It is the only LRT line that survived Rob Ford's cuts, albeit modified to include an extended underground section in the eastern section and the removal of the western section. The eastern underground extension was later revised back to a surface alignment in the 2012 transit vote. Currently, the  long central and eastern sections are under construction with a projected completion date of 2021.|$|E

25|$|While Nehru {{exempted}} Muslim {{law from}} legislation and they remained unreformed, he did pass the Special Marriage Act in 1954. The idea behind this act {{was to give}} everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage. As usual the law applied to all of India, except Jammu and Kashmir (again leading to accusations of selective secularism). In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and thereby retain the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, {{that could not be}} found in the personal law. Under the act polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim Personal Law. Divorce also would be governed by the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would <b>be</b> <b>along</b> the lines set down in the civil law.|$|E
