To his right was a vision slit [...] with a similar thickness of bulletproof glass. The Germans replaced the original three colored lights used by the Czechs to communicate with the driver with an intercom system. The radio operator {{sat on the}} left and had his own [...] observation port with the same protection as the driver's. His radios were mounted on the left wall of the hull. The hull machine gun was between the driver and radio operator in a ball mount capable of 30° of traverse, 25° of elevation and depressing up to 10°. Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armoured trough. The mount had a spotting telescope, but open sights could be used if the plug at the top of the ball mount was removed. If necessary, the driver could lock the mount into position and fire it himself using a <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable.</b> The driver's hatch was exposed to direct fire and could be damaged from the front.|$|E
500|$|The LT vz. 34 was {{assembled}} from {{a framework}} of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams, to which armor plates were riveted. A [...] firewall separated the engine compartment from the crew. A door allowed access to the engine from the crew compartment. It also had ventilation openings that could be closed. The driver sat {{on the right side}} using a [...] observation port protected by two flaps. The inner flap had an episcope with a 25° field of view. It was connected to the armored outer flap so that opening one closed the other. The outer flap had a [...] slit. To his right was a vision slit [...] protected by [...] of bulletproof glass. The inner flap was padded so that the driver could rest his head on it when driving. The radio operator sat on the left and had his own [...] vision port with [...] of bulletproof glass and an armored shutter. His radios were mounted on the left wall of the hull.

50|$|Rather than {{hydraulic}} brakes {{the car has}} <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables</b> to each drum. Although requiring no more pedal force than any other non-power-assisted drum brake if they are well maintained, the drums themselves are small, and even in period it was a common modification to replace them with larger drums from later models.|$|R
50|$|EPB systems afford {{packaging}} and manufacturing advances, since {{it allows for}} an uncluttered central console {{in the absence of}} the traditional handbrake lever (many manufacturers have used the freed up space to place the controls for their infotainment systems), plus it reduces manufacturing complexity since it removes the need to route <b>bowden</b> <b>cables</b> underneath the vehicle.|$|R
2500|$|The Nelson gear proved {{reliable}} and accurate, {{but it was}} expensive to produce and the necessity for its cable {{to be given a}} straight run could create difficulties when it was to be installed in a new type. By 1929 the latest model (the E-4 gear) had a new and simplified impulse generator, a new trigger motor, and the impulse cable was enclosed in a metal tube, protecting it, and permitting shallow bends. While the basic principle of the new gear remained unchanged: virtually all the components had been redesigned, and it was no longer officially referred to as the [...] "Nelson" [...] gear. The gear was further modernised in 1942 as the E-8. This final model had a modified impulse generator that was easier to adjust and was controlled from the cockpit by an electrical solenoid rather than a <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|External gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} {{sprockets}} involved are readily visible. There may be up to 4 chainrings attached to the crankset and pedals, and typically between 5 and 11 sprockets making up the cogset attached to the rear wheel. Modern front and rear derailleurs typically consist of a moveable chain-guide that is operated remotely by a <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> attached to a shifter mounted on the down tube, handlebar stem, or handlebar. A shifter may be a single lever, or a pair of levers, or a twist grip; some shifters may be incorporated with brake levers into a single unit. When a rider operates the shifter while pedalling, the change in cable tension moves the chain-guide from side to side, [...] "derailing" [...] the chain onto different sprockets. The rear derailleur also has spring-mounted jockey wheels which take up any slack in the chain.|$|E
2500|$|Českomoravská Kolben-Daněk was {{determined}} not to repeat the problems of its earlier Tančík vz. 33 tankette and gave the gunner a turret for better observation and all-around fields of fire for its new AH-IV tankette. It was assembled from a framework of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams, to which armor plates between [...] thick were bolted. The driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by bulletproof glass and an armored shutter. To his right was a small vision slit. Also to his right, in all models except the Swedish Strv m/37, was a light Zbrojovka Brno ZB vz. 26 or vz. 30 machine gun that was usually locked in place and fired using a <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable.</b> The gunner sat on the left and manned a small turret fitted with a ZB vz. 35 or ZB vz. 37 heavy machine gun in a ball mount. Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armored trough. He had a large vision port {{to the right of the}} machine gun mount in the turret and a small vision slit on the left side of the superstructure. 3700 rounds were carried for the two machine guns. No radio was fitted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ― Over 450, 000 Americans {{suffer from}} debilitative {{disorders}} {{resulting in the}} loss of proper hand function. A lightweight, non-cumbrous, orthotic hand exoskeleton was designed to restore normal pinching and grasping finger motions. Three functional digit mechanisms were designed: a thumb, index, and grouped third digit, comprised of the middle, ring, and small fingers. Each phalange was enclosed by a series of cylindrical aluminum bands connected at the centers of rotation of each joint. <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables</b> were mounted beneath each digit to provide active flexion, mimicking the tendons in the hand. A spring extension mechanism maintained constant tension in the <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables,</b> and during relaxation, returned the actuated digits to a fully extended resting position. Individually controlled actuators mounted on a forearm assembly produced 15 N of tensile force in each cable. The orthotic hand exoskeleton will be integrated with a digital control system currently under development in this laboratory. The complete system was designed to restore hand functionality through the amplification of precision pinch and/or power grasp...|$|R

2500|$|The typical {{drag brake}} {{has long been}} a drum brake. [...] The largest {{manufacturer}} of this type of brake is Arai, whose brakes are screwed onto hubs with conventional freewheel threading {{on the left side of}} the rear hub and operated via <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables.</b> As of 2011, the Arai drum brake has been out of production for several years, with remaining stocks nearing depletion and used units commanding premium prices on internet auction sites.|$|R
25|$|Most bicycle {{brake systems}} consist of three main {{components:}} {{a mechanism for}} the rider to apply the brakes, such as brake levers or pedals; a mechanism for transmitting that signal, such as <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables,</b> hydraulic hoses, rods, or the bicycle chain; and the brake mechanism itself, a caliper or drum, to press two or more surfaces together in order to convert, via friction, kinetic energy of the bike and rider into thermal energy to be dissipated.|$|R
25|$|The primary modern {{mechanical}} {{actuation mechanism}} uses brake levers coupled to <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables</b> to move brake arms, thus forcing pads against a braking surface. Cable mechanisms are usually less expensive, but may require some maintenance related to exposed {{areas of the}} cable. Other mechanical actuation mechanisms exist: see Coaster brakes for back-pedal actuation mechanisms, and Rod-actuated brakes for a mechanism incorporating metal rods. The first Spoon brakes were actuated by a cable that was pulled by twisting {{the end of a}} handlebar.|$|R

50|$|An {{electronic}} gear-shifting {{system is}} a method of changing gears on a bicycle, which enables riders to shift with electronic switches instead of using conventional control levers and mechanical cables. The switches are connected by wire or wirelessly to a battery pack and to a small electric motor that drives the derailleur, switching the chain from cog to cog. An electronic system can switch gears faster, and because the system does not use <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables</b> and can calibrate itself, it may require less maintenance.|$|R
50|$|A {{flexible}} bronchoscope {{is longer}} and thinner than a rigid bronchoscope. It contains a fiberoptic system that transmits an {{image from the}} tip of the instrument to an eyepiece or video camera at the opposite end. Using <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables</b> connected to a lever at the hand piece, the tip of the instrument can be oriented, allowing the practitioner to navigate the instrument into individual lobe or segment bronchi. Most flexible bronchoscopes also include a channel for suctioning or instrumentation, but these are significantly smaller than those in a rigid bronchoscope.|$|R

50|$|The {{side mirror}} is {{equipped}} for manual or remote {{vertical and horizontal}} adjustment so as to provide adequate coverage to drivers of differing height and seated position. Remote adjustment may be mechanical by means of <b>bowden</b> <b>cables,</b> or may be electric by means of geared motors. The mirror glass may also be electrically heated and may include electrochromic dimming to reduce glare to the driver from the headlamps of following vehicles. Increasingly, the side mirror incorporates the vehicle's turn signal repeaters. There is evidence to suggest mirror-mounted repeaters may be more effective than repeaters mounted in the previously predominant fender side location.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "rod-actuated brake", {{or simply}} [...] "rod brake", (roller lever brake in Raleigh terminology) uses {{a series of}} rods and pivots, rather than <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables,</b> to {{transmit}} force applied to a hand lever to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface, which faces the hub, of the wheel rim. They were often called [...] "stirrup brakes" [...] due to their shape. Rod brakes are used with a rim profile known as the Westwood rim, which has a slightly concave area on the braking surface and lacks the flat outer surface required by brakes that apply the pads {{on opposite sides of}} the rim.|$|R
50|$|The {{braking system}} was also typical; the front brakes were disc brakes, using a solid iron disc and a single-piston sliding caliper. The rears were drum brakes (a {{technological}} backwards step from the 124, which used discs all round), utilising leading and trailing shoe design {{operated by a}} dual piston fixed slave cylinder. They were operated hydraulically, with a tandem master cylinder assisted by a vacuum servo using two separate circuits. A rear-mounted load sensing valve varied the bias of effort applied to the rear brakes, dependent on the load being carried (and also the pitch dynamics caused by braking effort and road levels). A centrally located floor mounted handbrake operated on the rear axle using <b>bowden</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{lived at}} 35 Bedford Place, London, W.C. [...] His first patent (English Patent 25,325 and U.S. Pat. No. 609,570) was granted in 1896. [...] The {{principal}} {{element of the}} <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> is a flexible tube containing a length of fine wire rope that could slide within the tube, directly transmitting pulling, pushing or turning movements on the wire rope {{from one end to}} the other without the need of pulleys or flexible joints. The cable was particularly intended for use in conjunction with bicycle brakes. The Bowden Brake was launched amidst a flurry of enthusiasm in the cycle press. Sir Frank Bowden, the founder and owner of the Raleigh Bicycle Company, was reputed to have started replacing the rigid rods used for bicycle brakes with a flexible wound cable around 1902. This may be the reason the invention of the <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> has been popularly attributed to him. In any case, the origin and invention of the <b>Bowden</b> <b>cable</b> is open to some dispute, confusion and popular myth.|$|E

50|$|As of 2009, {{one system}} was commercially {{available}} {{from a major}} parts manufacturer: Shimano's Di2 (Dura-Ace 7970) for road bicycles. While the traditional method of gear shifting uses mechanical control levers that pull and release <b>Bowden</b> <b>cables</b> and spring-loaded derailleurs, Di2 is controlled by electronic switches located either in the integrated shift levers and/or {{at the end of}} time trial bars. The switches send signals through a wiring harness to a battery pack, placed near the bottom bracket. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack supplies power to the derailleur motors, which move the derailleurs via worm gears. Shimano estimates that their 7.4-volt battery pack can last up to 1000 km per charge. The system also has an LED light to warn when it needs a charge.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} cable-driven {{manipulator}} (CDM) with instrumented structure for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -guided interventions.
