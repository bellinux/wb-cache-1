This paper focuses on the polymetalliferous mineralization recognised in the ancient S. Carlo Mine, which has already been subject of some studies and {{is part of an}} important discordant vein deposits system that are widespread in the Mandanici Unit (MaU). This Unit is characterized by a Variscan low-P, polyphasic and plurifacial metamorphic basement, exhibiting a prograde zoning, from chlorite zone of greenschist facies to oligoclase-almandine zone of amphibolite facies. The Variscan main foliation (Fv 2) is irregularly cut by mineralized veins of decimetric to metric width. They are also perpendicular to the Alpine mylonitic shear zones of metric thickness developing along the sub-horizontal tectonic contacts between the tectono-stratigraphic units. These vein deposits formed along late-Alpine systems of fractures and faults, after Peloritani nappe emplacement. Minerographic study reveals a metalliferous mineral association mainly composed of tetrahedrite associated with, in order of decreasing abundance, chalcopyrite, <b>bournonite,</b> pentlandite, stromeyerite, arsenopyrite, scheelite, galena, sphalerite, pyrite, bismuthinite, boulangerite, jamesonite, covellite, bornite and argentite. Quartz, siderite and ankerite among non-metalliferous minerals are predominant. This work has been supported by mineralogical studies and chemical analyses carried out by Atomic Absorption and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry on powdered and separated samples of minerals. Geochemical data (major and trace elements) have allowed a detailed characterization of the minerals. They have revealed that the most significant minerals with Au contents around 1 ppm are tetrahedrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and <b>bournonite.</b> The presence of this noble metal in all minerals is important and shows that the mineralizing event is late and widespread.

One of such old mining areas is located in north-east Kosovo, close to the Batlava Lake. Contemporary works include exploration activities and {{the goal of this}} research is to determine the features of mineralisation in that deposit. The name Drazhnje is used interchangeably with Cuka e Batllaves. In the close vicinity, there are known also several other base-metal ore bodies that may be of economic interest. During last years, an exploration gallery was built in Drazhnje, which gave an opportunity to collect mineralogical samples of ore from {{the upper part of the}} deposit. The Drazhnje prospect is located in area built of Paleozoic metamorphic complex, Jurassic sediments, ophiolite and Cretaceous flysch sediments. The volcanogenic-sedimentary complex of the Tertiary covers all the older rocks. The mineralisation in Drazhnje prospect is located within marbles, serpentinites and volcanic rocks. Mineralogical study is focused on the sulphide composition of the ore. Minimum two stages of mineralization can be distinguished. During the first one, pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite and galena were formed. The younger stage comprises marcasite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, stannite and Pb-Sb sulphosalts, mainly boulangerite. The gangue minerals are quartz and carbonates. Carbonates of different compositions belong to the youngest minerals in both stages. In the polished sections we have observed that stannite replaces sphalerite, and <b>bournonite</b> replaces galena. Galena is also being replaced by boulangerite. Evidence for boulangerite presence was confirmed by XRD method. Smithsonite was recognized as a main secondary mineral. It occurs as a greenish-to pinkish collomorphic coating on the surface of other minerals or it fills cavities in the ores. The Drazhnje deposit exhibits similarities to other Pb-Zn deposits in the area. The mineralization of stockwork character is hosted mainly by carbonates and its genesis is related to the volcanic activity. Preliminary data on ore chemistry indicate that the content of zinc is higher than content of lead, and is estimated at about 4 % and 2 %, respectively. In the other deposits of Kosovo, these values are reversed. High content of sulphosalts in the studied deposit, like <b>bournonite</b> and boulangerite, indicates that these minerals could be one of important bearers of lead in the Drazhnje deposit. Content of antimony reaches 0. 3 wt. %, which could be correlated with relatively low content of lead (around 2 wt. %). During the field studies, we have confirmed that boulangerite is the most common lead mineral in the upper (reachable) part of deposit, whereas galena is not so common. It is worth to add that some amounts of galena have been replaced by <b>bournonite.</b> In comparison to samples from the other Kosovo deposits, we have noticed unusually high content of stannite, which was found in nearly all of the studied polished sections. Further exploration and start of extraction of the deeper parts of the deposit will allow collecting more samples that are necessery for future mineralogical and geochemical studies.

40|$|Based on its {{mineral content}} (around 40 minerals) and certain solid {{solution}} mineral phases, Zletovo has been {{classified as a}} subvolcanic hydrothermal Pb-Zn ore deposit. The main ore minerals are galena and sphalerite. They occur in very characteristic structures, microstructures and textures, which often enclose sulphosalt mineral phases. The most common sulphosalts are <b>bournonite,</b> boulangerite, proustite and luzonite.

The composition of the tetrahedrite-tennantite solid solution ranges from pure tetrahedrite to pure tennantite, with the presence of minerals that are representatives of the processes of the intermixing of solid solutions.

40|$|Gold- and silver-bearing veins {{located in}} Mine Creek, Mount Rangitoto and Cedar Creek, Mount Greenland have been worked {{sporadically}} since 1875, for small returns. The Mine Creek workings (1875 - 1904) yielded unknown but presumably small quantities of silver, and possibly gold, before operations ceased due primarily to poor {{recovery of the}} lower than expected silver grades encountered. The Cedar Creek workings yielded some 112 kg (3, 969 oz) of gold from mineralised quartz veins, worked intermittently between 1885 and 1941, before operations finally ceased due to the poor financial position of the last company to work the ground, Mount Greenland Gold Limited, and their purchasing of an over-estimated ore reserve. The Mine Creek veins consist of a quartz-pyrite-sphaleritegalena- minor chalcopyrite - electrum ± tourmaline ± calcite assemblage hosted in narrow shear zones in hornfelsed Greenland Group country rock. The mineralised shears which strike northeast and dip at 20 - 40 ° NW, are located near {{the crest of the}} Mine Creek Anticline, a horizontal or gently plunging upright close fold, but cross-cut both bedding and the axial surface of the fold at high angles. Mineralisation of the shears probably occurred during the latest stages of emplacement of the strongly differentiated Triassic (c. 214 Ma) aged Kakapotahi Granite. Magmatic mineralising fluids rich in Fe, Pb, Zn, Sb, As, Ag and Au, but poor in Cu, derived from the Kakapotahi Granite, passed upwards along the Mine Creek Fault propylitically altering the Rangitoto Granite adjacent to the fault, and into the mineralised veins. Sub-economic disseminated gold-silver mineralisation accompanied this alteration. The mineralising fluids were probably Co 2 -rich with a salinity of approximately 18 % NaCl equivalent, as indicated by fluid inclusion study. Deposition of the ore minerals in the veins occurred as a fissure infilling process contemporaneous with fault movement, at estimated temperatures of 350 ° - 500 °C and PH 20 pressures of 1 - 2 kbars. The observed paragenetic sequence pyrite - sphalerite - galena - chalcopyrite - electrum,in order of decreasing age, reflects deposition of the ore minerals under conditions of decreasing activities of sulphur and FeS, probably accompanied by decreasing temperature. The major gold- and silver-bearing minerals, electrum and galena respectively, occur as replacements of earlier formed pyrite, a chemically favourable host for these minerals. The Cedar Creek veins consist of up to a few per cent in total, of pyrite - chalcopyrite - arsenopyrite - sphalerite - galena - boulangerite - (jamesonite) - <b>bournonite</b> - tetrahedrite - gold hosted in a quartz ± calcite vein system up to 4 m wide. Although the vein system located in the normally faulted crest of the William Tell Anticline is traceable for over a kilometre, known economic gold mineralisation is restricted to the ore shoot worked in the William Tell levels. The ore shoot which plunges steeply to the northwest along the strike of the vein and reputedly thins with depth, is probably located in a former zone of high permeability within the vein system, possibly due to increased fracturing. Vein formation and mineralisation occurred penecontemporaneously with emplacement of the Rangitoto Granite into the previously folded overlying Greenland Group sediments, approximately 295 - 314 Ma ago. Magmatically derived mineralising fluids, metals and sulphur migrated upwards, probably along bedding planes, into the crest of the William Tell Anticline and thence upwards along the William Tell Fault, parallel to the axial plane of the anticline. Deposition of the ore minerals from the fluids occurred as fissure infillings associated with fault movement, at estimated temperatures of 230 - 400 °C and maximum PH 20 pressures of less than 2 kbars. The observed paragenesis pyrite - arsenopyrite – chalcopyrite - sphalerite - galena - boulangerite - <b>bournonite</b> - tetrahedrite reflects ore deposition at successively lower temperatures, the late stage sulphosalts being deposited at estimated temperatures of 230 ° - 300 ° C. Changes in the composition of the mineralising fluids accompanied the decreasing temperature. The activity of sulphur decreased from approximately 10 - 12 atm – 10 - 4 atm during deposition, and was accompanied by the decreasing activity of PbS. Increases in the activity of Sb 2 S 3 and Cu concentrations accompanied the above decreases resulting in the late stage paragenesis (galena - bou 1 angerite - (jamesonite) - <b>bournonite</b> - tetrahedrite), observed. Gold, the youngest of the ore minerals present, was probably deposited as a response to cooling of the mineralising fluids resulting in the decreased solubility of gold in the aqueous solutions...|$|E

Sb-Bi alloys and Ag-Cu-Pb-Sb-Bi sulphosalts have been discovered in the Jialong vein-type Cu-Sn deposit in North Guangxi, South China. The Jialong deposit is hosted by schist within the contact zone of a Neoproterozoic granite. Four stages of ore formation are recognised, with the Sb-Bi alloy- and sulphosalt-bearing assemblage formed during the third stage. Sulphosalts include Pb-Bi-Ag sulphosalts (pavonite), Sb-Bi sulphosalts (tintinaite, terrywallaceite), and Sb sulphosalt (ullmanite, freibergite, <b>bournonite).</b> Grains of Sb-Bi alloy measure 2 – 20 μm in diameter, show rounded margins and occur together with galena along the edges or internal fissures of sulphosalts. The Sb-Bi alloys do not coexist with bismuthinite, BiS (an unnamed mineral), or with native bismuth. Two phases of Sb-Bi alloys are identified based on back-scattered electron image observations and electron microprobe analysis. The textural and thermodynamic relationships indicate that Phase I was formed before Phase II. Phase I contains high Sb (69. 15 – 80. 12 wt %) and lower Bi (18. 01 – 27. 85 wt %), while Phase II contains low Sb (0. 89 – 25. 24 wt %) and high Bi (72. 95 – 98. 89 wt %).

The isomer shift for this mineral is the most negative of any Sb(V) reported in the literature. The opposite was noted for the oxides, i. e. in all cases the antimony is Sb(V). Isomer shifts were often found to be dependent on the metal ligand which is not bonded directly to the antimony, but through an oxygen or sulfur bridge. Linewidth data often indicate whether one or more than one antimony site exist in the crystal.

40|$|Syntectonic {{hydrothermal}} Pb-Zn vein {{systems of}} the Ramsbeck deposit. Germany, have been extensively overprinted by late- stage fluids responsible for fissure vein mineralisation. This has caused remobilisation of vein components, notably of sphalerite and galena, {{as well as the}} formation of various Sb sulphosalt minerals. including boulangerite, semseyite, tetrahedrite and <b>bournonite.</b> A detailed sulphur isotope study of sphalerite, galena and sulphosalts related to different stages of recrystallisation. remobilisation and reaction has been carried out using an insitu laser combustion technique. Primary sphalerite-galena ores from flat-lying thrust zones are characterised by homogeneous positive delta S- 34 values in the range + 6. 5 to + 7. 7 parts per thousand. In contrast, recrystallised and remobilised sphalerite and galena from both overprinted thrust zones and extensional fissure veins show delta S- 34 values in the range - 1. 1 to + 2. 9 parts per thousand and - 0. 7 to + 8. 7 parts per thousand respectively. Sulphosalt minerals show a similar variation in their sulphur isotope compositions, which range between - 1. 7 and + 7. 7 parts per thousand. Fissure vein hosted sphalerite and sulphosalts display significantly more negative delta S- 34 values than the primary Pb-Zn ores. Sphalerite which recrystallised in situ and boulangerite which formed by reactive replacement of primary galena show slightly more positive delta S- 34 values than fissure vein hosted minerals. The compositional range of remobilised mineral phases can be best explained by varying contributions (variable mixing) of sulphur derived from (1) the primary sphalerite-galena ores of the flat thrust systems, and (2) the hydrothermal fluid responsible for the fissure vein mineralisation. Equilibrium fractionation temperatures calculated for sphalerite-galena pairs contrast strongly with fluid inclusion data. Isotopic fractionation related to the remobilisation has to be interpreted in terms of kinetic processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The metamorphosed Palaeoproterozoic Orivesi {{gold deposit}} in {{southern}} Finland is {{located within the}} Tampere Schist Belt, which belongs to the Svecofennian domain. The Orivesi mine, run by Outokumpu Mining Oy, was in production from 1994 to 2003, during which time a total of approximately 1. 7 million tons of ore was extracted, with an Au content of 9. 31  g/t, implying a total output 13. 115 tons of gold in concentrate. The hydrothermal alteration halo can be divided successively into chlorite-dominant, sericite-dominant and quartz-dominant rocks from the outer zone inwards. The host rocks of the ore are quartz rocks with andalusite-rich quartz rocks. Topaz-bearing rocks also occur in the inner part of the alteration halo. In addition to Au, the elements Ag, Te, Bi, Sb, S, As, Se, Cu, Zn, Pb, Sn and Mo are enriched to varying degrees within the alteration halo. The main ore minerals include base metal sulphides, sulphosalts and tellurides. Pyrite {{is the most common}} sulphide. The sulphosalts are represented by tetrahedrite, <b>bournonite,</b> boulangerite and meneghinite. The most common gold, gold-silver and silver tellurides are calaverite, montbrayite, petzite, kostovite, sylvanite and hessite. Other known tellurides include tellurobismuthite, altaite, melonite, frohbergite, tsumoite, tetradymite and rucklidgeite. Gold occurs mostly in fine-grained native grains containing an average of 5 % Ag. The native gold is usually of very small grain size, generally <  20  µm. Most of the gold grains in the deposit occur as intergrowths with tellurides. The adjacent hypabyssal intrusion is an obvious source of both hydrothermal fluids and metals. A comb quartz layering has been discovered in the transition zone between the intrusion and the alteration halo. The Orivesi deposit is thought to belong to the high-sulphidation epithermal type. Soon after its formation the deposit encountered deformation and metamorphism that amounted to lower amphibolite facies conditions. The subsequent retrograde metamorphism caused the reappearance of some hydrothermal minerals typical of high-sulphidation epithermal deposits...|$|E
40|$|Laser sulfur {{combustion}} in {{the presence}} of 0, is the most commonly used method of in situ sulfur isotope analysis. Previous workers indicated that a small but reproducible fractionation of (34 S) /S- 32 exists between the product SO, gas and the mineral. The magnitude of this fractionation varies with bond strength, as reflected in Gibbs free energy of formation at 298. 15 K. The correction factors are known for common sulfides and anhydrite but not, hitherto, for stibnite and the sulfosalt minerals, which are important constituents of many classes of ore deposits. We present the correction factors for the following chemically and crystallographically well- characterized minerals: stibnite (weighted mean = - 1. 2 %o), <b>bournonite</b> (+ 0. 6 %o), tetrahedrite (+ 1. 3 %o), and boulangerite (+ 1. 4 %o). The Gibbs free energies of formation of these phases have been approximated by the sulfide summation method, and the correlation of DeltaG(298) (0), with the correction factor for the sulfosalts fits well with the trend previously established for simple sulfides. There is an excellent correlation between the fractionation factor and mineral composition, a parameter that does result in bond strength variations (e. g., mol fraction of PbS in sulfosalts), allowing estimation of the correction factors for simple intermediate compositions. Finally, bond strength also varies with variation in interatomic distances, and we have, therefore, investigated the behaviour of stibnite, a strongly anisotropic mineral. Our results indicate that there is a significant variation in fractionation factor, depending on crystal orientation. The fractionation factor along the prismatic b-axis, which displays the strongest chemical bonds (as monitored by the shortest bond lengths), is more negative (- 1. 7 %o) than along the other crystallographic directions (- 0. 7 to - 1. 0 %o), which is in full agreement with theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the application of the technique in unravelling source- and process-related sulfur isotope systematics in two hydrothermal vein systems in the classic mining area of the NE Rhenish Massif, both studies requiring resolution beyond the scale of conventional sulfur isotope analysis...|$|E

The GaleChah-Shurab {{mining district}} {{is located in}} NW of the IEMA. Volcanic and subvolcanic bodies {{in the area are}} composed of calc-alkaline porphyry quartz-latite, porphyry dacite and rhyodacite and hornblende-biotite andesite, equivalent to I-type granite. They emplaced in Tertiary and intruded the Jurassic shale, siltstone and limestone basement (Shemshak Fm). The faults, joints and fractures, are the main controls on the mineralization, in forms of disseminated, vein, veinlet and minor stockwork and brecciation type mineralization of Pb, Zn, Cu, Sb and trace elements. Vein and veinlet of Pb+Zn±Cu±Sb in the Gale-Chah abandoned mine accompanied by carbonate and silicic alterations in association with galena, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, <b>bournonite</b> and tetrahedrite as the hypogene ore minerals and their supergene products including cerussite, covellite, digenite and second-generation colloidal pyrite. The Pb+Zn+Cu+Sb mineralization associated with sericitic and silicic alterations in the Shurab abandoned mine, is composed of two types of mineralization, veinlet and brecciation vein in the porphyry dacite boundaries with Jurassic shale and sandstones, and the disseminated and disseminated-veinlet mineralization which is hosted by the altered porphyry dacite and rhyodacite intrusive rocks. The mineral assemblages are galena, sphalerite, stibnite, As-bearing pyrite, chalcopyrite and tetrahedrite-tennantite complex hypogene-sulfide ore as a hypogene ore, and malachite, covellite, cerussite and melancoitic pyrite as a sulfide-oxide supergene ore. The Pb+Zn+Sb±As±Ag polymetallic occurrence is associated with sericitic, carbonate and chloritic alteration assemblage in the Chupan occurrence, in two forms, I) vein, veinlet-stockwork (30 m depth) confined to fault structures and II) disseminated-replacement (below 70 m) mainly hosted in rhyodacite and porphyry dacite rocks. The hypogene minerals are galena, sphalerite, stibnite, pyrite, realgar-orpiment, arsenopyrite, and chalcopyrite with extensive occurrence of oxide-sulfide supergene products, such as Mn-oxide, hematite, malachite and colloidal pyrite. Fluid inclusion study show that disseminated veinlet Cu and disseminated-replacement polymetallic mineralization at the Shurab and Chupan deposits, respectively occurred in the high temperature, salinity and depth compared to vein-veinlet Pb and Zn mineralization of Gale-chah deposit. It seems that the mineralization is related to hydrothermal fluid evolution affected by mixing with cold and low salinity meteoric water. ...|$|E

40|$|Removal of {{impurity}} {{elements in}} copper metallurgy {{is one of}} the major problems encountered today since pure copper ore reserves are becoming exhausted and the resources of unexploited ores often contain relatively high amounts of antimony, arsenic, mercury and bismuth, which need to be eliminated. The present work aims at pre-treating a tetrahedrite rich complex copper sulphide concentrate by selective dissolution of the impurities, therefore, upgrading it for pyrometallurgical processing. Characterisation of the complex concentrate was performed and the result shows that antimony and part of arsenic were present as tetrahedrite and <b>bournonite.</b> Dissolution kinetics of tetrahedrite in aqueous alkaline sodium sulphide solutions was investigated. It was found that the rate of dissolving tetrahedrite by the lixiviant increases with increase in reaction temperature, sodium sulphide concentration, sodium hydroxide concentration, and with decrease in mineral particle size. The kinetic study indicates that the rate of leaching tetrahedrite in the lixiviant under the selected conditions is chemically controlled through the particle surface reaction. The activation energies of the process were estimated as 81 kJ/mol and 75 kJ/mol, respectively, for antimony and arsenic dissolution from tetrahedrite. The estimated activation energies were within the range reported for a chemically controlled reaction process. Besides, the alkaline sulphide lixiviant proves selective and effective to dissolve these impurity elements from the concentrate with good recoveries. Further investigations on the factors influencing the leaching efficiency of the lixiviant were studied. Analysis of the leach residue indicates that copper content of the tetrahedrite has transformed into copper sulphides with the average chemical formula Cu 1. 64 S. The grade and economic value of the concentrate were improved greatly after sulphide treatment, and therefore, suitable as a feedstock for smelting. The impurities in the concentrate were found to have reduced to a level satisfactory for smelting operation. Furthermore, modelling and optimisation of alkaline sulphide leaching of a complex copper concentrate containing 1. 69 % Sb and 0. 14 % Sn were conducted. Response surface methodology, in combination with central composite face-centred design (RSM-CCF), was used to optimise the operating parameters. The leaching temperature, sulphide ion concentration and solid concentration were chosen as the variables, and the response parameters were antimony and tin recoveries, and the time required to achieve 90 % Sb dissolution. It was seen that the leaching process was strongly dependent on the reaction temperature as well as the sulphide ion concentration without any significant dependence on the solid concentration. Additionally, a mathematical model was constructed to characterise the leaching behaviour within the experimental range studied. The results from the model allow identification of the most favourable leaching conditions. The model was validated experimentally, and the results show that the model is reliable and accurate in predicting the leaching process.

40|$|The Arburese region (SW Sardinia) is {{well-known}} {{for a large}} swarm of mineralized veins hosted in low-grade metamorphic rocks, extending for about 20 km around the Late Variscan (304 ± 1 Ma) Arbus pluton, {{made up of a}} core of cordierite-bearing biotite leucogranites and an external shell of granodiorites with subordinate mafic rocks (Cuccuru et al., 2015). The largest veins occur in the northern and western sectors (past Montevecchio district), with a primary mineral association of Pb-Zn (Cu, Ag) sulfides in quartz and siderite. Recent works on the southern branch of the vein system (Naitza et al., 2015) evidenced a more complex metallogeny, with Ni-Co-As-Sb-Bi-Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag ores. New microscopy, SEM-EDS and EPMA data allow to highlight the depositional history of these ores, defining two stages of mineralization. In the Arsenide stage, early precipitation of quartz with abundant Ni monoarsenide (nickeline) was followed by growth of Ni antimonide (breithauptite) on nickeline, by Ni, Ni-Co, Co, Fe diarsenides, triarsenides, sulfoarsenides (rammelsbergite, skutterudite, safflorite/löllingite, cobaltite, gersdorffite/ullmannite) and Bi minerals (bismuthinite and native Bi), replacing nickeline and forming rims and inclusions on previously crystallized phases. The Sulfide stage was preceded by cataclasis of the ores; initial abundant precipitation of quartz, siderite and sphalerite, cementing the fragments of the arsenide ores, was followed by Pb-Cu-Ag sulfides (galena, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite/freibergite, <b>bournonite,</b> proustite/pyrargirite, stephanite), and, at last, by ankerite, calcite and pyrite. These sequences of mineralization suggest a relationship with distinct hydrothermal fluids: 1) an earlier fluid, carrying Ni, Co, As and Sb, deposited as arsenides and sulfoarsenides into structurally-controlled traps in response to variations in physicochemical conditions; 2) a late, carbonate and Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag -rich fluid, permeating fractures re-opened after a tectonic phase that involved the previous mineralization, and originating a “Montevecchio-type” mineral association. Depositional histories similar to the Arsenide stage have been reported in other hydrothermal Ni-Co deposits worldwide, as in the Bou Azzer district, Morocco (Ahmed et al., 2009). The geochemistry of these ores requires the presence in the geological sequence of a Ni-Co-rich source (e. g. mafic rocks) from which these elements could be leached by acidic and moderately oxidizing hot fluids. Analogous conditions may have been attained in the Arbus pluton, which includes an olivine-bearing end member (Secchi et al., 1991), possible Ni-Co source for fluids of magmatic origin. During the emplacement of the igneous complex, widespread uralitization of pyroxenes in granodiorites point to high fluid/rock interactions; moreover, quartz- Fe-cordierite graphic intergrowths in leucogranites support a late dehydration of magmas.

40|$|Despite {{its large}} area, the Armorican Massif {{provided}} only very few new mineral species: plombogummite, laumontite, bertrandite, natrodufrenite and lulzacite. This last species was recently discovered {{by one of}} us (Y. L.) in a sandstone quarry at Saint-Aubin-des-Châteaux (near Châteaubriant, Loire-Atlantique department) (Moëlo et al., 2000), and various studies permitted to reveal original mineralogical features, related to the superimposition of hydrothermal processes on an Ordovician oolitic ironstone interstratified in the sandstone sequence. This ironstone belongs to a very large sedimentary Fe deposit lying at the East margin of the Armorican Massif. At Saint-Aubin, ooliths are constituted essentially by siderite and chlorite, with abundant Srrich fluorapatite and organic matter. During Hercynian orogenesis, faulting controlled hydrothermal processes, which induced pronounced mineralogical changes, especially massive sulphidation of the ironstone (Gloaguen, 2002). Due to the abundance of primitive apatite and other peculiar geochemical features, it permitted the crystallisation of various Sr or lanthanoide phosphates. Lulzacite, Sr 2 Fe 2 +(Fe 2 +,Mg) 2 Al 4 (PO 4) 4 (OH) 10, is very well crystallised in small quartz veins crosscutting the ironstone, together with siderite and pyrite. It is isostructural with jamesite (Léone et al., 2000). It occurs as massive aggregates (up to some cm 3), as well as euhedral crystals up to 1 cm in size. It was formed by short-range remobilisation of synsedimentary apatite (process of lateral secretion). Later, its decomposition lead {{to the formation of}} goyazite (with amethyst colour), together with late fluorapatite, and some berthierine. Lanthanoide phosphates were formed directly within the ironstone. The very rare scandium phosphate pretulite, ScPO 4, has grown together with xenotime-(Y) in epitaxy on detrital zircon crystals (Moëlo et al., 2002). SEM as well EPMA revealed concentric zonation of pretulite and xenotime crystals, indicative of a multi-stage process. Monazite-(Ce) is present as minute anhedral neoformed aggregates, while detrital crystals are rare. Detrital zircon shows growth zones enriched with Sc-, Y- and HREE- phosphate components. EPMA of zircon and pretulite suggested a complete solid solution according to the heterovalent substitution rule: Zr + Si -> Sc + P. This solid solution has been confirmed experimentally in high temperature conditions (Dubost, 2003). A general metallogenic study is in progress (Gloaguen, 2002; Gloaguen et al., in prep.). After the main Fe-S-(As) stage, a Zn-Pb-(Cu) stage presents some Sb sulfosalts (boulangerite, <b>bournonite</b> and tetrahedrite), as well as traces of electrum. While the formation of lulzacite and subordinated goyazite {{is directly related to the}} hydrothermal process acting in the deposit of Saint-Aubin, that of xenotime and monazite begins very early within the ironstone formation, as observed in the neighbouring Fe deposit of Rougé, what may also permit the discovery of new pretulite occurrences. Thus, it seems that hydrothermalism of such ironstones is a major key and control when studying rare minerals associated with ironstones. Moreover, others phosphates have been previously described within ironstones: wolfeite (Fe 2 +,Mn 2 +) 2 (PO 4) (OH) (Brousse and Chauvel, 1969), lazulite (Chauvel, 1968) and are not yet recognized in the Saint-Aubin-des-Châteaux quarry. We propose that differences between these phosphates minerals parageneses are controlled by ironstone initial chemistry and hydrothermalism. Such hydrothermalism is favoured and associated with late orogenic context. In this way, the large European palaeozoic ironstone belt is probably an important target for potential new and rare minerals species. Actually, all armorican iron mines are closed and a re-examination of ironstones samples preserved in museums could probably allow the discover of new species. Brousse, R. and Chauvel, J. -J. Bull.
