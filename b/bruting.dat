25|$|The first {{brilliant}} {{cuts were}} introduced {{in the middle of}} the 17th century. Known as Mazarins, they had 17 facets on the crown (upper half). They are also called double-cut brilliants as they are seen as a step up from old single cuts. Vincent Peruzzi, a Venetian polisher, later increased the number of crown facets from 17 to 33 (triple-cut or Peruzzi brilliants), thereby significantly increasing the fire and brilliance of the cut gem, properties that in the Mazarin were already incomparably better than in the rose. Yet Peruzzi-cut diamonds, when seen nowadays, seem exceedingly dull compared to modern-cut brilliants. Because the practice of <b>bruting</b> had not yet been developed, these early brilliants were all rounded squares or rectangles in cross-section (rather than circular). Given the general name of cushion—what are known today as old mine cuts—these were common by the early 18th century. Sometime later the old European cut was developed, which had a shallower pavilion, more rounded shape, and different arrangement of facets. The old European cut was the forerunner of modern brilliants and was the most advanced in use during the 19th century.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bruting</b> {{is the art}} {{of cutting}} a diamond round. In a modern era {{diamonds}} are rounded using either a laser, a diamond disk, impregnated with diamonds, or two diamonds cutting against each other. Industrial diamonds can also be used for <b>bruting</b> a diamond round. Modern computer software measures the roundness of each diamond and [...] "Ideal Cut" [...] diamonds have to round within a 10th of a millimeter to qualify as a excellent cut diamond.|$|E
50|$|This is just one, {{although}} a fairly common way {{of creating a}} round brilliant cut. The actual process also includes many more stages {{depending on the size}} and quality of the rough stone. For example, bigger stones are first scanned to get the three-dimensional shape, which is then used to find the optimal usage. The scanning may be repeated after each stage and <b>bruting</b> may be done in several steps, each bringing the girdle closer to the final shape.|$|E

40|$|In chapter 1 a short {{account of}} raining and {{recovery}} of diamonds is given. Different properties of diamonds are also mentioned briefly. The various theories of crystal growth {{are described in}} short in chapter 2. Chapter 3 deals briefly with the cutting and shaping ofdiamonds. A diamond, when suitably divided may be shaped as desired. Cleaving and sawing which are two different methods for dividing large stones, are described. The shaping of a diamond is achieved in two ways: a) <b>bruting,</b> and b) grinding and polishing. These are also given briefly. All the experimental techniques employed {{during the course of}} the present work are given in chapter 4. It has been emphasized that before making any observations, the specimens should be thoroughly cleaned. This, undoubtedly, was achieved by ultrasonics. Different methods were tried for making a suitable replica for use in an electron microscope. The technique which was suitable of all is given in detail. Chapter 5 deals with the etching and dissolution. In addition to a cursory survey of the etching and recent developments in general, the existing information on the etching of diamond surfaces is also surveyed. It has been argued once again, in chapter 6, that trigons are due to the growth. For the first time, a systematic study of the etching of synthetic diamond surfaces has been reported in chapter 7 and theresult is compared with the etching of natural micro diamond surfaces. Micro percussion marks found on sawn, polished and cleaved diamond surfaces are described in chapter 8. Their presence is attributed to the occurrence of micro cleavages in a direction parallel to the dodecahedron planes. It is shown in chapter 9 that there is a high degree of resemblance between the etch patterns on matched cleavage faces. On a few cleavage surfaces triangular features were observed, and a possible explanation is given for their occurrence. The etch patterns on different polished dodecahedron sections, given in chapter 10, reveal a sectional history of the growth of the diamond. It has been argued that diamonds have a laminated structure. Evidence has been found which shows that diamonds, most likely, grow around a core. It is also shown that many diamonds are, in fact, very inhomogeneous. Calculations of the density of defects were made on different diamond surfaces andthey were in agreement. The density of defects, on one surface, in type I material was in excess of 4. 6 x 10 5 per mm. 2 and in type II material it was less than 8 x 10 3 per mm. 2. <p...|$|E

500|$|For {{the final}} {{installment}} in the Halo trilogy, Halo 3, designers had {{to refine the}} Covenant for the move to more powerful Xbox 360 hardware. Bungie was dissatisfied with the <b>Brutes</b> in Halo 2; they were added in late in development, resulting in the <b>Brutes</b> functioning merely as [...] "damage sponges" [...] and [...] "not interesting to fight." [...] Their design was also limited, being little more than hairy apes with a bandoleer (reminiscent of the Star Wars character Chewbacca). With the Elites leaving the Covenant in the game's story, the <b>Brutes</b> became the player's main enemy, necessitating radical changes in the character's behavior and design. For the new look of the <b>Brutes,</b> concept artists took inspiration from rhinoceros and gorillas. The designers added armor with buckles, gauntlets, and leather straps to bring them {{more in line with}} the Covenant aesthetic. The more seasoned the <b>Brute,</b> the more ornate clothing and helmets; the armor was designed to convey a culture and tradition to the species, and emphasize their mass and power. Designs for Halo 3 took cues from ancient Greek Spartans. Character animators recorded intended actions for the new <b>Brutes</b> in a padded room at Bungie. A new addition to the <b>Brute</b> artificial intelligence was a pack mentality; leader <b>Brutes</b> direct large-scale actions simultaneously, such as throwing grenades towards a player.|$|R

In addition to his episcopal duties and pastoral work, <b>Bruté</b> taught theology in his seminary and also in one of his academies. In 1836 <b>Bruté</b> returned from a trip to France with several clerical recruits, among them Benjamin Petit, who became a missionary to the Potawatomi. <b>Bruté</b> also recruiting old acquaintances such as Anthony Deydier who arrived on the same boat as <b>Bruté</b> in 1810. By the time bishop <b>Bruté</b> died, the number of clergymen had grown tremendously. <b>Bruté</b> knew, however, that much work remained to be done. For a number of years before his death he had sought a coadjutor bishop, including Nicholas Petit S.J. but the Superior of the Society of Jesus refused to allow Petit to be named. No no one had been named before his death.|$|R
