In cases where baseline data is not available, having normative data is useful to refer to in order to make appropriate return-to-play decisions. To date, normative data on the Wii Board <b>Basic</b> <b>Balance</b> Test is not available. Purpose: This study will compare the performance of concussed and nonconcussed individuals on the Wii <b>Basic</b> <b>Balance</b> Test. Method: A between subject design between the two groups of participants is used. The nonconcussed sample group consisted of 84 college students, 53 females and 31 males. The second group consists of 20 concussed participants, 12 males and 8 females. A parametric Univariate Analysis (1 way ANOVA) and a non-parametric Chi-Square test were used to compare between group performances. Results: Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the number of trials completed between groups (F(1, 102) = 6. 475, p=. 012, η 2 =. 060) and the difference, in time, required to complete trial 1 on the Wii <b>Basic</b> <b>Balance</b> Test (p 3 ̆c. 001).

40|$|Based on the national, state, {{and local}} statistics, {{the goals and}} {{objectives}} of Healthy People 2000 and the increased concern for weight loss in men and women, {{it was apparent that}} there is a need for sound weight management programs. <b>Basic</b> <b>Balance</b> is a weight management and well-lifestyle training program. This paper provides a brief overview of the <b>Basic</b> <b>Balance</b> program: listing the components; incentives and interventions, testing procedures, and follow up process. The focus of this paper is to examine the success of the <b>Basic</b> <b>Balance</b> program long-term and determine what part(s) of the intervention had the greatest impact on the participants' behavior changes. <b>Basic</b> <b>Balance</b> is a 12 -week program. All participants completed a post follow up evaluation consisting of a general fitness assessment, body composition analysis, health risk analysis, and a written evaluation of the program. All participants received an 18 -month post-follow up evaluation via health risk analysis, body composition analysis, and a qualitative structured interview process. The data collected helped determine whether a long-term follow up (intervention) program is needed in order to observe weight loss maintenance and sustained behavior change at 18 months. The sample size for the follow up process was approximately 10. The subjects were full-time white-collar employees of Lincoln Financial Group in Fort Wayne, IN. The follow up study was completely voluntary and the subjects were free to discontinue participation at any time without prejudice from the investigator. The data was analyzed as a group and all personal records were kept confidential. In summary, the <b>Basic</b> <b>Balance</b> programs does work short-term. This was clearly indicated in based on information collected at end-participation. However, long-term impacts of the program are less positive. The collected data provides support for: 1) upgrading the <b>Basic</b> <b>Balance</b> Program, and 2) evaluating the need for a one year follow-up program (Level 2) designed to help participants maintain and enhance their weight management goals and lifestyle changes.

Although born in an {{economic}} context, IOTs are increasingly used for the environmental impact assessment of product systems, e. g. in environmental policy analysis, and for several others such as the accounting of greenhouse gases. However, the use in these contexts does not ensure {{the validity of the}} IOT as a consistent and robust multidisciplinary modeling tool in itself. It is in respect to certain basic requirements that IOTs should find their legitimacy. In this paper, we study their validity with respect to a well-established scientific law: the mass balance.

Following such a track, we focus specifically on monetary input-output tables and we reach the conclusion that IOTs can fail in respecting the <b>basic</b> <b>balance</b> laws whenever prices differ per purchaser.

We argue that this Kluitenberg-Verhás body is the natural thermodynamical building block of rheology. An important feature of the presented methodology is that nontrivial inequality-type restrictions arise for the four parameters of the model.

40|$|Chemical fronts {{propagating}} in horizontal liquid layers with a {{free surface}} can induce localized steady Marangoni flow. Numerical integration of the Stokes equations coupled to a reaction-diffusion-convection equation for the concentration of the surface-active reaction product shows that the system reaches an asymptotic dynamic state characterized by a deformed front surrounded by a steady convection roll traveling at a constant speed. To understand the <b>basic</b> <b>balances</b> determining this steady dynamics, we present here an asymptotic analysis of the system based on the numerically obtained scalings at high Marangoni numbers M quantifying the interaction between reaction-diffusion processes and Marangoni convection. M is positive (negative) when the product decreases (increases) the surface tension behind the front. We obtain a semianalytical solution for the product concentration for large M> 0, showing that the key balances are between reaction, convection, and vertical (rather than axial) diffusion.

The {{goal of the}} {{research}} described in this paper {{was to investigate the}} causes and sources of financing this deficit. Hence, an analysis of disequilibrium measures in the balance of payments, for a period of the past five years, more precisely, from 2010 to 2014, was conducted. The analysis comprised the standard measures of disequilibrium, but also some nowadays not so frequently used measures such as the <b>basic</b> <b>balance,</b> the net liquidity balance and the official settlements balance. The cause of the current account deficit is the merchandise trade balance deficit, which is higher than the sum of the balance of services, balance of primary income and balance of secondary income surpluses. This deficit is financed largely by foreign direct investment, but also by debt instruments based on other investment, because of which the country 2 ̆ 7 s external debt grows. Given that the merchandise trade balance deficit was the main cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina current account deficit, in order to solve this problem, the country has to stimulate exports of goods and to lessen its import dependence. Simultaneously, the country needs to strengthen the balance of services surplus.

The aim of the second experiment is to check the impact of the initial SPI configuration. For this purpose, the unweighted algorithm is tested with an initial SPI configuration where the SPI is different for each service. Specifically, SPIVoIP= 2, SPIVIDEO= 13, SPIFTP= 5, and SPIWEB= 3. The last experiment aims to show how the weighted algorithm manages to prioritize the most populated services. Each experiment consists of 24 optimization loops (5 min per loop). Thus, 2 h of network time are simulated. It is checked a posteriori that, with the proposed controller, and for the initial QoE imbalance between services in the simulated scenario, such a number of loops is enough to ensure that the system reaches equilibrium.|$|R
