40|$|Abstract—In this paper, new pre- and {{post-processing}} schemes {{are developed}} to process shallow-water sonar data {{to improve the}} accuracy of target detection. A multichannel subband adaptive filtering is applied to preprocess the data in order to isolate the potential target returns from the acoustic backscattered signals and improve the signal-to-reverberation ratio. This is done by estimating the time delays associated with the reflections in different subbands. The preprocessed results are then <b>beamformed</b> to generate an image for each ping of the sonar. The testing results on both the simulated and real data revealed the efficiency of this scheme in time-delay estimation and its capability in removing most of the competing reverberations and noise. To improve detection rate while significantly minimizing the incident of false detections, a high-order correlation (HOC) method for postprocessing the <b>beamformed</b> images is then developed. This method determines the consistency in occurrence of the target returns in several consecutive pings. The application of the HOC process to the real <b>beamformed</b> sonar data showed the ability of this method for removing the clutter {{and at the same}} time boosting the target returns in several consecutive pings. The algorithm is simple, fast, and easy to implement. Index Terms—Adaptive filtering, high-order correlation, sonar, target detection, wavelet transform. I...|$|E
30|$|In the {{recognition}} stage, two cases are considered. The {{first one is}} a conventional single-channel speech recognition system as shown in Fig. 1. The other one is a multi-channel speech recognition system. In [38, 39], weighted prediction error (WPE) plus beamforming yielded good performances for REVERB challenge and CHiME- 3 challenge [40], respectively. Based on this, WPE-based dereverberation [41] is first carried out with a linear time-invariant filter. Next, we use a traditional beamformer [6] to extract <b>beamformed</b> speech signal from the multi-channel dereverberated signals. This is a linear and multiple input single output process. After beamforming, the one-channel <b>beamformed</b> signal {{will be used to}} verify the effectiveness of the proposed ASR system which incorporates a nonlinear front-end. For both the single-channel and multi-channel systems, normal recognition is conducted with hybrid DNN-HMM.|$|E

However, in the performance of cell edge users, the proposed <b>beamforming</b> scheme outperforms V-SINR-based eigen <b>beamforming</b> scheme.

40|$|Sonography {{techniques}} use multiple transducer {{elements for}} tissue visualization. Signals detected at each element are sampled prior to digital beamforming. The required sampling rates {{are up to}} 4 times the Nyquist rate of the signal and result in considerable amount of data, {{that needs to be}} stored and processed. A developed technique, based on the finite rate of innovation model, compressed sensing (CS) and Xampling ideas, allows {{to reduce the number of}} samples needed to reconstruct an image comprised of strong reflectors. A significant drawback of this method is its inability to treat speckle, which is of significant importance in medical imaging. Here we build on previous work and show explicitly how to perform beamforming in the Fourier domain. Beamforming in frequency exploits the low bandwidth of the <b>beamformed</b> signal and allows to bypass the oversampling dictated by digital implementation of beamforming in time. We show that this allows to obtain the same <b>beamformed</b> image as in standard beamforming but from far fewer samples. Finally, we present an analysis based CS-technique that allows for further reduction in sampling rate, using only a portion of the <b>beamformed</b> signal's bandwidth, namely, sampling the signal at sub-Nyquist rates. We demonstrate our methods on in vivo cardiac ultrasound data and show that reductions up to 1 / 25 over standard beamforming rates are possible...|$|E
30|$|The {{dedicated}} pilot {{feature is}} designed for beamforming and the standard explicitly states that only the <b>beamformed</b> pilots inside the <b>beamformed</b> clusters {{can be used for}} channel estimation and equalization. The weights are different from cluster to cluster. Since only those pilots can be used, there is no other side information that could be used since in the WiMAX case, the phase-change is incorporated into the channel just as any other type of beamforming weights would. Remember that there is no difference between our beamforming weights and normal beamforming weights from a channel estimation perspective. In both cases, {{there is no need for}} extra side information. Note that it is possible to design a system different from the WiMAX dedicated pilots setting that could use more side-information, but that is outside the scope of the this paper since it is focusing on WiMAX.|$|E

Therefore, combustion noise is contributing more to overall noise, especially at low jet velocities. Environmental regulations stipulate that gas emissions from a jet engine should be reduced. Thus, new techniques have been introduced in their operation, especially concerning the combustion process. Accordingly, {{there is a need}} for improved processing methods in order to extract combustion noise from other sources in new build engines. A novel processing technique to extract turbofan engine combustion noise called 3 S-Array is presented. It has been developed using a multiple coherence technique with data acquired in the in-duct and external sound fields of a jet engine. In-duct sensors are located in the combustion chamber and in the nozzle of the engine, and external data is acquired using an array of microphones. A <b>beamformed</b> signal focused on the nozzle of the engine is generated with the data from the external array. Jet noise and in influences of the room on the array output are reduced using this focusing technique, which is referred to as Focused <b>Beamformed</b> Output (FBO).

While this system functioned well, its utility was lim-ited to scenarios in which a single speaker was to be tracked. In this work, we remove this restriction by generalizing the IEKF, first to a probabilistic data association filter, which incorporates a clutter model for rejection of spurious acoustic events, {{and then to a}} joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), which maintains a separate state vector for each active speaker. In a set of experiments conducted on seminar and meeting data, the JPDAF speaker tracking system reduced the multiple object tracking errror from 20. 7 % to 14. 3 % with respect to the IEKF system. In a set of automatic speech recognition experiments conducted on the output of a 64 channel microphone array which was <b>beamformed</b> using automatic speaker position estimates, applying the JPDAF track-ing system reduced word error rate from 67. 3 % to 66. 0 %.

40|$|Beamforming is an {{indispensable}} feature for millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless communications {{in order to}} compensate for the severe path loss incurred due to high frequency operation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to evaluate the spectral efficiency (SE) of non-line-of-sight(NLOS) mmWave links with optimal analog beamforming. Optimality here implies the joint selection of antenna beams at the transmitter and receiver which simultaneously maximize the received power. We develop a mathematical framework based on the extended Saleh-Valenzuela channel model to embody the impact of optimal analog beamforming into the performance metrics for NLOS mmWave links. Practical mmWave channels are characterized by sparsity in terms of number of multi-path components; we exploit this feature to derive upper and lower bounds on SE of <b>beamformed</b> directional links. Simulation results reveal that the proposed approach is fairly accurate to model <b>beamformed</b> links in most practical operating scenarios.
