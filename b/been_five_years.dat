5|$|When the war ended, Herring {{wished to}} return to Australia and see Mary before {{resuming}} his studies at the University of Oxford in October 1919. Mary wrote back pointing out the impracticality of this idea; while she would be disappointed not to see him, he should remain in England and complete his course at Oxford first. The university had awarded him a wartime Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1915; the Rhodes Scholarship Trust allowed him to resume his scholarship, and he studied for a Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) degree. Since it had <b>been</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> since he had been awarded his BA, he was entitled to a MA as well, and graduated with both degrees in July 1920. After a holiday in Britain and France with his sister Kathleen, he arrived back in Melbourne on 26 November 1920.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} by Santa Clara for the 1992–93 season. At that time, it had <b>been</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> since the Broncos appeared in the NCAA tournament. That changed when Nash led the Broncos to a WCC Tournament title and an upset win over the No. 2 seeded Arizona {{in the first round}} of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In that game, Nash scored six straight free throws in the last 30 seconds of the contest. Although Santa Clara was defeated by Temple in the next round, the 1992–93 campaign was considered a successful one. However, the Broncos failed to sustain the momentum the following season, and only managed a 5–7 record in the conference. The team rebounded in the 1994–95 season, with Nash being named Conference Player of the Year and the Broncos topping the WCC. Featuring the league leader for scoring and assists in Nash, the Broncos returned to the NCAA tournament, but they were defeated by Mississippi State. After the season, Nash contemplated turning professional, and decided against it when he learned that he would probably not be considered as a first-round pick in the 1995 NBA draft.|$|E

25|$|Although he didn't {{have great}} {{success in the}} trial matches in 1927–28 he was an {{automatic}} choice for the West Indies' initial Test tour of England in 1928. He played in the three Tests during the tour but, turning 40 years of age during the tour, was not the power he had <b>been</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> earlier. In first-class matches, he scored 1,074 runs {{at an average of}} 27. All three Test matches were lost by an innings in just over two days; in each of them, Challenor made runs and shared in decent opening partnerships in the first innings, but then failed in the second innings.|$|E
25|$|In 1830 {{the company}} {{considered}} building a locomotive line from Derby to Smithy Houses, {{and two years}} later looked at the possibility of a locomotive line from Derby to Little Eaton. The first was surveyed by an engineer called Stephenson, presumed to be George Stephenson, but no further action was taken. Toll reductions were made from 1834, in an attempt to stay competitive, but by 1840 there were three main line railways in Derby. By 1845, tolls on the Little Eaton line were less than half what they had <b>been</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> earlier. The Derby and Gainsborough Company wanted to buy the Little Eaton line in 1846, and were quoted £30,000, as were the Midland Railway in 1847. Instead, they built a parallel line to Ripley, which opened in 1855.|$|E

Dana learns that Rufus had {{attempted}} to rape Alice, once his childhood friend. Dana convinces Isaac not to kill Rufus, and Alice and Isaac run away while Dana gets Rufus home. She learns that it has <b>been</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> since her last visit and that Kevin has left Maryland. Dana nurses Rufus back to health in return for his help delivering letters to Kevin. Five days later, Alice and Isaac are caught. Isaac is mutilated and sold to traders heading to Mississippi. Alice is beaten, ravaged by dogs, and enslaved as punishment for helping Isaac escape. Rufus, who claims to love Alice, buys her, and orders Dana to nurse her back to health. Dana does so with much care, but when Alice finally recuperates, she curses Dana for not letting her die, wracked with grief for her lost husband.|$|E

He is accompanied by his adolescent niece, Dorothy Gale (this {{is the first of}} the Oz books in which the reader learns her last name), while aboard a small steamship headed to Australia while Aunt Em and Dorothy's pet dog Toto, stay behind to look after the newly built farmhouse. While traveling on the sea, a terrible storm suddenly hits, bringing rain and lightning, tossing the little ship violently over the waves. Henry and Dorothy are separated when she is accidentally thrown overboard and cast away into the water along with Billina, a yellow hen that was also on board. The two take refuge in a wooden chicken-coop floating nearby.|$|E
25|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> {{since the}} events of the {{original}} Saints Row. Following the sudden disappearance of founder Julius Little, the 3rd Street Saints fell apart. In its place, three new gangs divide up Stilwater: the Brotherhood, an outlaw gang specializing in arms trafficking, the Ronin, a Japanese bosozoku gang that runs a network of casinos, porn distribution rings and strip clubs, and the Sons of Samedi, a Haitian voodoo gang that supplies most of the city's drugs. Johnny Gat, Julius's former chief lieutenant, is charged with 387 counts of murder and faces the death penalty. His girlfriend Aisha, despite having been forced to fake her death in the previous game, has become a record producer in her own right. After an earthquake leveled Saints Row, the Ultor Corporation bought up most of the land and converted it into a massive financial district run as their own personal fiefdom. The other remaining Saints have abandoned the gang; Dexter Jackson is now a security consultant for Ultor, and Troy Bradshaw, who was responsible for Julius's downfall, has been named the new Chief of Police.|$|E

According to Milton Kent of The Baltimore Sun, not only did Howard's statistics (approximately 18 points, 7 rebounds and 2.8 assists) compare favorably to both players, but his role as his team's primary scoring option made his statistics more significant than those of Mason and Sprewell.|$|E
500|$|... “Heartaches”, {{composed}} by Al Hoffman and John Klenner in 1931, was recorded as an unusual half-rumba, half washboard rhythm. [...] In 1933, Victor had assigned {{the recording of}} the song to Ted Weems and his Orchestra, and wanted it recorded quickly. [...] Weems and his band had time for only one rehearsal before recording the song. [...] Initially, Weems {{did not like the}} song; he decided to omit the lyrics by way of having Tanner whistle instead. [...] While running through the song at rehearsal, someone thought of trying it with a speedier tempo than initially written. It was not a large seller, and the master was filed away. In 1938, Weems was now working with Decca Records and was preparing to make another record. [...] When someone had forgotten to assign a song for the [...] "B" [...] side of the record, Weems and Tanner made another recording of [...] "Heartaches"; the Decca version was not any more successful than the Victor one had <b>been</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> earlier.|$|E

She explained that {{she did not want to}} wait until all the songs had been recorded; she rather wanted to split up the songs in three different releases. She chose to name the trilogy Body Talk after a gay club in London that a friend of hers owns, commenting that the title [...] "tickles [...] imagination". In June 2010, the first in the trilogy, Body Talk Pt. 1, was released, and was quickly followed by the announcement of Body Talk Pt. 2. The album's lead single, [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and the track [...] "Indestructible", were among the first songs to be recorded for the trilogy. Robyn said that [...] "we saved them for later because I knew they would be singles, or could be singles, and I wanted them to get that chance."

500|$|Fernandes {{was part}} of the West Indian side which toured England in 1928. After the success of their 1923 tour, three of the matches were granted Test status. The team played 30 {{first-class}} matches, but in contrast to their previous tour, they won just five of them. Altham and Swanton describe the side as being [...] "substantially less formidable combination than the West Indies of '23." [...] The touring side lacked a regular wicket-keeper, and as a result Fernandes and the West Indian captain Karl Nunes shared the duties, though Nunes kept in all three Tests. Both were expensive on occasion: against Ireland, Fernandes allowed 25 byes in one innings, and Nunes the same number against Nottinghamshire. Fernandes' batting was significantly less effective than it had <b>been</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> before; he passed fifty on only three occasions, making 73 against both Ireland, and Cambridge University, and 54 against Middlesex. He played in the first Test match, the West Indies' first appearance in Test cricket, facing England at Lord's. Batting at number three in each innings, he scored a duck in the first, and eight runs in the second after the West Indies had been forced to follow-on. England won the match by an innings and 58 runs. Fernandes played 20 of the first-class matches in the tour, and scored 581 runs at an average of 18.15.|$|E
