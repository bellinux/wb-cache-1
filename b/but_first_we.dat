60|$|What that is I {{will show}} you presently; and a {{wonderful}} tale hangs thereby. <b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> will let Analysis tell us what chalk is made of, {{as far as he}} knows.|$|E
40|$|What did Wittgenstein take {{description}} {{to involve}} ? What are {{the objects of}} his descriptions ? What did he think he was doing in and by describing what he described ? In order to answer these three questions it will be useful to appeal to an object of comparison. <b>But</b> which ? <b>First</b> <b>we</b> need an answer to another question...|$|R
5000|$|Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin did {{not rule}} out the idea of honouring the aid workers, saying [...] "Humanitarian workers are special people. They bring great honour on our country and {{certainly}} we will be looking at that issue. <b>But</b> <b>first</b> things <b>first,</b> <b>we</b> will welcome her Commins back warmly".|$|R
60|$|I {{recalled}} other queer {{things of}} Paterson, {{and they came}} back to me charged with new meanings. There was his way of shaking hands. He now did it in the ordinary way, <b>but</b> when <b>first</b> <b>we</b> knew him his arm had described a circle, and the hand had sometimes missed mine and come heavily upon my chest instead. His walk, again, might more correctly have been called a waddle.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I am awakened and {{my heart}} is with you.' And bow--bow royally. <b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> must get you black robes--for black is your colour. Do you mind? And then they will {{disperse}} to their homes." ...|$|E
6000|$|She stooped {{and kissed}} Dick between the eyes. 'That is for good-morning,' she said, going away. 'When thou art dressed we {{will speak to}} George and make {{everything}} ready. <b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> must open the little trunk. Give me the keys.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, my dear, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> {{had better}} read. I {{have been talking}} to your papa, and we have settled that on Wednesdays and Fridays we will go to church; but on these days we will begin by reading the Psalms and Lessons.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>first</b> of all <b>we</b> must examine our {{knowledge}} of universals. This consideration will occupy us in the following chapter, where we shall find that it solves the problem of a priori knowledge, from which <b>we</b> were <b>first</b> led to consider universals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{going home}} myself <b>first.</b> <b>But</b> <b>we</b> can {{have at least}} three weeks up there, because the school {{is going to be}} closed more than a month before and after Christmas." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had come}} out on a point {{extending}} into Apmoojenegamook, or Chamberlain Lake, {{where there was a}} broad, gravelly, and rocky shore, encumbered with bleached logs and trees. We were rejoiced to see such dry things {{in that part of the}} world. <b>But</b> at <b>first</b> <b>we</b> did not attend to dryness so much as to mud and wetness. We all three walked into the lake up to our middle to wash our clothes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Puteoli was a {{great place}} in old times," [...] said Rollo; [...] "and that's {{the reason why they}} had such an immense amphitheatre here. We are going to see the ruins of it presently; <b>but</b> <b>first,</b> <b>we</b> are going to see Solfatara." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The Galus {{have turned}} you out," [...] they cried. [...] "If {{you go back}} to them, you will die. If you remain here, you will die. We shall kill you; <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> shall have a dance and you shall dance with us--the dance of death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We heard a woman scream twice, once {{far away}} and once near at hand, and rowing to the sound, saw someone hanging to the arm of an {{overturned}} windmill {{only three or four}} feet above the water. Of course we knew that you had been taken to the mill; that man there told us. Do you remember him? <b>But</b> at <b>first</b> <b>we</b> could not find it in the darkness and the flood." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Composition" [...] {{can also}} {{refer to a}} binary {{operation}} on representations of integers by forms. This operation is substantially more complicated than composition of forms, <b>but</b> arose <b>first</b> historically. <b>We</b> will consider such operations in a separate section below.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so, sir. I {{will let}} you have half my men to go back with them. The rest of us had better stay here until they return. <b>But,</b> <b>first</b> of all, <b>we</b> will see to these poor fellows. They may not be all dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{time you}} two should {{know each other}} better.

6000|$|... 'I {{will pay}} thee dustoorie [commission] on my pay for three months,' said Kim gravely. 'Yea, two rupees a month. <b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> must {{get rid of}} these.'

6000|$|Geoffrey {{caught him}} by the arm. [...] "Steady, old boy," [...] he said; [...] "it is trying at <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> <b>we</b> shall soon get {{accustomed}} to it. Here, take a draught of wine from this flask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{a sincere}} regard for your father," [...] he began. [...] "On that account alone I should {{be glad to}} have you here; <b>but</b> <b>first</b> of all <b>we</b> had better {{understand}} each other. You mentioned that you had been in business in Minneapolis and afterward in Winnipeg. Didn't you like it?" ...|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{something}} needs to be added in order to obtain a nonsingular A for a real number p∈(1,∞]. We provide an answer further, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>first</b> introduce a class of strictly diagonally dominant tensors that involve a parameter p in the interval [1,∞].|$|R
6000|$|... "Give not way to despondency," [...] said Ravonino, {{though he}} could not smooth the lines of anxiety from his own brow. [...] "Does not the Lord reign? Let the earth rejoice!

6000|$|... "I ain't gone nuts. Wait 'til I gets t'rough. We meets de dicks, innocent-like; <b>but</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> caches de {{dough in}} de woods.

6000|$|... "I {{will write}} a kowl so {{soon as the}} ponies, the bullocks, and the other things are counted before me and sent back whence they came. <b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> will put the Government mark on such as have not been visited by Smallpox." [...] In an undertone, to the vaccinator: [...] "If you show you are afraid you'll never see Poona again, my friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to be {{attacked}} by the vagrants, mother. The last time you made us stay with you when there was fighting going on, except just at the <b>first,</b> <b>but</b> here <b>we</b> should see it all." ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the problem where we have two mixed sets of data on the same scatter plot. We want to {{calculate}} linear regression lines for each of the two sets, <b>but</b> <b>first</b> of all <b>we</b> need to decide which data belong to which set. We propose one possible solution to this problem involving data classification and parameters estimation...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we don't {{want any}} Jane Henderson," [...] said Corny. [...] "Poqua-dilla! that's {{a good name}} for a queen. <b>But</b> what <b>we</b> <b>first</b> want is to have her stop selling things at the front door. We'll do better for her than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well; {{that is the}} {{question}} for us to consider; <b>but,</b> <b>first,</b> <b>we</b> must all be in a proper state of mind to consider it, or else it will do us no good.

6000|$|... 'That is very important,' said General Booth, when he {{had heard}} this extract. '"Make use of all this {{charitable}} energy, now often misdirected for national ends!" [...] Why not, indeed? Heaven knows it is often misdirected. The Salvation Army has made mistakes enough. If only {{that could be done}} {{it would be a great}} thing. <b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> have got to make other people [...] "understand" [...] besides Roosevelt and yourself.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> {{all went}} {{to the office of}} the American Consul, and {{consulted}} him in regard to the proper measures to be taken for searching for the little Corinne in Paris. After that, for some days, Jonas and Pomona spent all their time, and Euphemia and I part of ours, in looking for the child. Euphemia's Parisian exhilaration continued to increase, but there were some things that disappointed her.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} movie, the {{characters}} don't receive any name. In the prequel, we know their fathers' surname <b>but</b> no <b>first</b> name. <b>We</b> {{also know that}} Ernest Krakenkrick and Bachir Bouzouk's sons {{need to go to}} DASS, but when they are recruited at the Tour Montparnasse, they are promised to become window cleaner as their fathers.|$|R
30|$|Our {{empirical}} strategy follows two separate <b>but</b> complementary approaches. <b>First,</b> <b>we</b> use vector error correction techniques {{to estimate the}} long-run relationship between electricity consumption and GDP growth. Second we apply Granger causality tests to determine the direction of this relationship. In addition, disaggregating GDP into its major sectors of agriculture, industry and services, we test for Granger causality between sectoral output growth and electricity consumption.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here's Nicholas Sabathier, my dear, come to {{say goodbye}} awhile,' said Grisel. She {{stood for a moment}} in her white gown, her face turned towards the clear green {{twilight}} of the open window. 'I have promised to walk part of the way with him. <b>But</b> I think <b>first</b> <b>we</b> must have some tea. No; he flatly refuses to be driven. We are going to walk.' ...|$|R
