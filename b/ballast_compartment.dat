5000|$|Captain Shuichi Sugino was {{appointed}} as Nagatos new captain on 24 July, {{but he was}} unable to take up his appointment until 20 August. Retired Rear Admiral Masamichi Ikeguchi was assigned as the ship's interim captain until Sugino arrived. The Yokosuka Naval District received an alarm on the night of 1/2 August that a large convoy was approaching Sagami Bay and Nagato was ordered to attack immediately. The ship was totally unprepared for any attack, but Ikeguchi began the necessary preparations. The water in the <b>ballast</b> <b>compartments</b> was pumped out and her crew began reloading the propellant charges for her 16-inch guns. The ship received more fuel from a barge later that morning, but no order to attack ever came because it had been a false alarm. Sailors from the battleship , Underwater Demolition Team 18, and the high-speed transport [...] secured the battleship on 30 August after the occupation began and Captain Cornelius Flynn, executive officer of the Iowa, assumed command. Nagato was stricken from the Navy List on 15 September.|$|R

5000|$|It {{may seem}} counter-intuitive, but pilots put water <b>ballast</b> into <b>compartments</b> {{in the wings}} to make their planes heavier. Modern gliders can take large {{quantities}} of water (a Nimbus-3 can hold 272 kg). The objective {{is to increase the}} gliding speed, while maintaining the same gliding angle. The downside is that the glider will climb more slowly in thermals. However in the right conditions, the time lost in climbing more slowly is more than recouped by the increased speed to the next thermal.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the instrumentation {{used for the}} measurements of various parameters of interest for a gravity based structure type offshore platform during its set-down model tests. The tests were conducted at the wave basin facility of National Research Council of Canada (NRC). The parameters of interest included motions of the model in six degrees of freedom, parameters describing the environmental conditions such as wave elevations on selected locations in the wave basin, inflow rate of the ballast water and the water levels in the ballast tanks {{as a function of}} time, all synchronized. The complexity of the instrumentation arose due to the need to model both external dynamics, i. e. motions, and internal dynamics, i. e. the dynamics of the ballasting operation. The set-down operation was simulated in different wave conditions. During the tests the motions of the model as it was lowered to the sea floor by the ballasting operation were measured by two different systems. The first one is a motion capture system, which uses cameras and associated software to determine the motions of the model. The second system consisted of an array of accelerometers and digital inclinometers installed inside the model. During the set-down tests the flow into the central compartment inside the model for ballasting operation was controlled by a peristaltic pump. It allowed start/stop/pause on command and ease of change of flow rate. Two associated parameters were recorded by the data acquisition system (DAS) : pump-on-off and flow rate. The water collected in the central compartment was eventually distributed into the surrounding <b>ballast</b> <b>compartments</b> during operation. Each compartment was instrumented to record the water levels as a function of time. Synchronization of the data enabled locating and investigating specific events recorded by the DAS.

50|$|A GBS {{can either}} be steel or {{concrete}} and is usually anchored directly onto the seabed. Steel GBS are predominantly used {{when there is no}} or limited availability of crane barges to install a conventional fixed offshore platform, for example in the Caspian Sea. There are several steel GBS in the world today (e.g. offshore Turkmenistan Waters (Caspian Sea) and offshore New Zealand). Steel GBS do not usually provide hydrocarbon storage capability. It is mainly installed by pulling it off the yard, by either wet-tow or/and dry-tow, and self-installing by controlled <b>ballasting</b> of the <b>compartments</b> with sea water. To position the GBS during installation, the GBS may be connected to either a transportation barge or any other barge (provided it is large enough to support the GBS) using strand jacks. The jacks shall be released gradually whilst the GBS is ballasted to ensure that the GBS does not sway too much from target location.|$|R
40|$|DHHS publication; no. (NIOSH) 98 - 146 Recently, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), {{through its}} Community Partners for Healthy Farming program in New York, {{received}} two separate reports of farm {{workers who were}} injured while attempting to drill holes into sealed plow frames in order to mount a hitch or a "slow-moving vehicle" sign. These workers received serious skin burns and other injuries when the drill bits penetrated the frames releasing and igniting flammable gases. Hydrogen and methane gas may be produced within sealed frames that are filled during manufacture with scrap metal ballast. The uncleaned, assorted machine shop metal scrap apparently reacts electrochemically with water and emulsion-type cutting oils to liberate flammable gases. Although the reported ignitions involved plows from the same manufacturer, the use of scrap metal fill may not be unique to plows or to that manufacturer. The potential for such ignitions exists in any equipment with similar <b>ballast</b> in sealed <b>compartments</b> during drilling, cutting, welding, or other operations that both release the gases and provide an ignition source.

40|$|The Deep Sea Research Submarine (Figure 1) is a {{modified}} VIRGINIA Class Submarine that incorporates a permanently installed Deep Sea Operations Compartment (Figure 2). Table 1 summarizes {{the characteristics of}} the Deep Sea Research Submarine and the Deep Sea Operations Compartment. The compartment, inserted as a 46 -ft parallel midbody section, carries a heavy lift system capable of retrieving a 15 -ton object (submerged weight) from depths greater than 2400 ft. A 26 -ft L x 22 -ft H x 12 -ft W payload bay external to the pressure hull is used to house the object for transport. This payload bay also serves as a fully functioning mid-ship Main <b>Ballast</b> Tank. The <b>compartment</b> is supported by a combination of ship service and compartment-specific auxiliary systems. Figure 1. Deep Sea Research Submarine The compartment also contains a 16 ft diameter x 17 ft high Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Chamber outfitted with a Triton ZX ROV capable of excursions to depths of 9800 ft. The ROV Chamber permits dry access to the ROV for maintenance and mission-related tasks. The control center for the lift system and the ROV and a "mission flexible" space are located on the compartment's upper deck Figure 2. Deep Sea Operations Compartment Table 1.

50|$|The ship's {{dimensions}} {{as built}} were 500 ft length overall, 485 ft between perpendiculars, 58 ft molded hull beam, 97 ft extreme beam over guards with extreme depth of hull at stem being 30 ft and 23 ft molded depth. The hull was entirely steel {{with a double}} bottom extending almost 365 ft feet containing water ballast and divided lengthwise with a watertight bulkhead and by transverse bulkheads into fourteen compartments. Above that 3 ft <b>ballast</b> <b>compartment</b> the ship was divided by eleven watertight bulkheads extending from keel to main deck with hydraulic doors operated from the engine room. In total there were seven decks: tank top, orlop, main, promenade, gallery, upper and dome. Steel was used to the promenade deck with fire protection for beams above that level and fireproof doors provided compartmentalization and steel fire curtains in cargo spaces. For fire alarm purposes the vessel was divided into fifty sections with fire hydrants spaced so that permanently attached hoses reached every point in the vessel and an extensive sprinkler system.|$|E
