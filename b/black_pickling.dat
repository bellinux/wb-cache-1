2500|$|In many {{of their}} dishes, the Taiwanese have shown their {{creativity}} in their selection of spices. Taiwanese cuisine relies on an abundant array of seasonings for flavour: soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil, fermented <b>black</b> beans, <b>pickled</b> radish, pickled mustard greens, peanuts, chili peppers, cilantro (sometimes called Chinese parsley), and a local variety of basil (...)

50|$|After this, {{the plates}} are still rough and not straight, {{so they are}} cold rolled several times. The rolling lengths the plates to their final dimension. They are then {{annealed}} again to remove any strain hardening. These plates are called <b>black</b> plate <b>pickled,</b> cold rolled, and close annealed (black plate p. cr. and ca.). To attain perfect cleanliness the plates are pickled again in a weak sulfuric acid. Finally they are rinsed and stored in water until ready to be tinned.|$|R
25|$|The kvass most {{commonly}} used in cooking is white okroshka kvass, {{which is much more}} sour than drinking kvass. Spices used include mustard, <b>black</b> pepper and <b>pickled</b> cucumber (specifically, the liquid from the pickles), solely or in combination. For the final touch, boiled eggs and smetana (similar to crème fraîche) are added.|$|R

50|$|The Italian {{sandwich}} {{was invented}} in Portland, Maine, by baker Giovanni Amato in 1903. While selling his bread on his street cart, Amato received requests from dockworkers to slice his long bread rolls and add sliced meat, cheese and vegetables to them. Amato later opened a sandwich shop named Amato's, and today the sandwich continues to be prepared by Amato's sandwich shops in Portland. The Amato's version is traditionally prepared using fresh-baked bread, ham, American cheese, slices of tomato, green pepper and sour <b>pickle,</b> <b>black</b> olives and salad oil.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} surface finish on rotary beam fatigue life of 0. 323 mm Nitinol (Ni 56 wt%-Ti) wire is studied. In {{preparation}} of the wire samples, processing parameters such as cold work reduction and annealing were held constant for all surface conditions investigated. Various Niti wire surfaces such as light oxide, dark oxide, <b>black</b> oxide, etched, <b>pickled,</b> mechanically polished, and electropolished are evaluated. These wires were subjected to alternating compression-tension cycles at strain levels ranging from 0. 7 % to 2. 5 % tested at ten degrees above the active Af temperature. The choice of surface preparation directly affects the ultimate rotary beam fatigue life and becomes an important engineering design consideration necessary for the optimization of wire based implant medical devices...|$|R
40|$|Eating {{habit of}} {{fermented}} wet green tea leaves (Pickled tea) in Myanmar and its culture, history, production, processing and health benefits {{are reported in}} this paper, together with drinking green tea and black tea. Types of tea plants found in Myanmar, include the indigenous species Camellia irrawadiensis. The antioxidant effects of Myanmar tea were determined for 3 -minutes and 30 -minutes infusion. The latter infusion is Myanmar's way of drinking tea and has 3 times higher antioxidant activity than 3 -minute infusion. Antioxidant activity of green tea is higher than <b>black</b> tea and <b>pickled</b> tea in both 3 min and 30 min infusions. This is the first report on the antioxidant properties of Myanmar tea, which needs to be studied further. This item was scanned with a HP 4850 Scanjet at 300 dpi and consists of 8 pages...|$|R
