30|$|The {{first stage}} was an {{in-depth}} examination of all 17 (8 [*]+[*] 9) individual cases studied independently (Appendix 1 and 2) {{to find a}} social business format based on the conceptual framework checklist. Firstly, nine social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> were studied carefully and key variables were identified (Appendix 2), and then the variables were set into the social business format checklist from social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> (Table  2). This checklist provides a general social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> format. Secondly, eight social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> from only the water sectors were studied carefully and key variables were identified (Appendix 1); then the variables were set into the social business format checklist from social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> for the water sector (Table  3). This checklist provides a general social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> format for the water sectors. Again, the summary of these two businesses format checklists {{provides an overview of}} social business format. In the second stage, the composed general social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> format was compared with the common social <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> for the water sector.

5|$|The {{government}} department {{in charge of}} the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison. Since 1991, the prison has been conserved as a recognised heritage site on state, national, and World Heritage lists, and various restoration works have been undertaken since the 1990s. New uses have been found for various sections of the prison, including a New <b>Business</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Centre in the New Division cell block, and wedding ceremonies in the prison chapels. It has also become a significant tourist attraction, with guided tours since 1991.|$|E
5|$|The Russian-American Company (RAC) was {{incorporated}} in 1799, {{putting an end}} to the promyshlenniki period and beginning an era of centralized monopoly. Its charter was laid out in a 1799 ukase by the new Tsar Paul, which granted the company monopolistic control over trade in the Aleutian Islands and the North America mainland, south to 55° north latitude (approximating the present border on coast between British Columbia and Alaska). The RAC was modeled on Britain's East India Company (EIC) and Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Russian officials intended the company to operate both as a <b>business</b> <b>enterprise</b> and a state organization for extending imperial influence, similar to the EIC and HBC. It was also hoped that the company would be able to conduct maritime trade with China and Japan, although this goal was not realized. In 1818 the Russian government took control of the RAC from the merchants who held the charter. The explorer and naval officer Ferdinand Petrovich von Wrangel was the first president of the company during the government period. In 1867, the Alaska Purchase transferred control of Alaska to the United States and the commercial interests of the Russian American Company were sold to Hutchinson, Kohl & Company of San Francisco, who then merged with several other groups to form the Alaska Commercial Company.|$|E
5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate <b>business</b> <b>enterprise.</b> He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula.. Retrieved 15 October 2011. However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and {{the responsibilities}} of <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> for human rights have been legally defined in international, European law and national law. This analysis, in turn, generates novel insights and impetus for reconsidering the international legal personality of <b>business</b> <b>enterprises.</b> If CSR has emerged in the law as a new category of legal obligations at the international level, which this thesis finds is not the case, {{this may be the}} breakthrough that renders <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> subjects of international law. Yet, CSR regulatory initiatives are trends in global governance that increasingly question the relevance of the (arguably still dominant) positivist perspective and, hence, conventional doctrines on international legal personality. This thesis confronts and tests the validity of, existing doctrinal approaches to the legal personality of <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> with the evolving realities of the emerging business and human rights regime. In doing so, insights are drawn from theoretical approaches to global governance to determine the impact of CSR, and {{the responsibilities of}} <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> for human rights, in the thorny topic of ‘subjects of (international) law’ and what, if anything, makes <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> ‘legal persons’ in a global governance context. nrpages: 497 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> are the {{backbone}} of economic growth and innovation. The existence of the Internet provides opportunities for these enterprises to gain the benefits of Information and Communication Technologies in their business operations. However, small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> often face a variety of challenges such as limited financial resources, a shortage of skilled workers, and inadequate infrastructure (such as communication connectivity or electricity supply particularly in rural areas) in adopting new technology in their business operations. Many small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> are not engaged with appropriate business strategies which lead to informal and mixed marketing approaches in their businesses. This paper proposes an Internet marketing adoption framework for small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises.</b> The proposed framework of Internet marketing would be incorporated {{as part of the}} business strategies for small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises</b> in order to assist owners and managers (who are often poor planners). This paper presents a review of the main indicators in the proposed framework, which are e-readiness, aims and strategies (which will lead to the Internet marketing approach by small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises),</b> the Internet marketing approach and the evaluation of the Internet marketing performance. The 4 C’s (customer, communication, convenience, and cost) (Smith, 2003) are the factors that will be considered while implementing the Internet marketing approach for small <b>business</b> <b>enterprises.</b> These 4 C’s are the ‘online’ extension of basic marketing principles. The Internet marketing performance will be evaluated to indicate whether the Internet marketing approach contributes {{to the success of the}} businesses or vice-versa...|$|R
