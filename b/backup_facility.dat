Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a <b>backup</b> <b>facility</b> in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E

25|$|Greenville was {{the largest}} {{transmitter}} site for the Voice of America shortwave broadcasts {{under the auspices of}} the U.S. government's International Broadcasting Bureau. Both transmitter buildings and three large antenna 'farms' were located just outside Greenville. The Greenville Transmitting Station provided shortwave broadcasts for U.S. government-funded, non-military, international broadcasting and served as a standby, alternate gateway for the Satellite Interconnect System to use to uplink programming, should the Washington, D.C., SIS gateway have become unavailable. The station was also a <b>backup</b> <b>facility</b> for uplinking programming to the Atlantic Ocean Region satellite and served as the primary return link of that satellite. For the VOA, the main target areas for the station's shortwave broadcasts were Latin America, the Caribbean with special emphasis on Cuba, and Africa. Three complexes, one for management, distribution, and monitoring, and the other two for actual transmitting, formed an approximately nineteen mile (30km) equilateral triangle around Greenville. At one time, these formed the largest international broadcasting site in the world. Two of the three sites have been decommissioned.|$|E
500|$|During the year, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued {{advisories}} on tropical cyclones {{west of the}} International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula, {{and north}} of the equator, in its role as the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in 1989. The JMA issued forecasts and analyses every six hours starting at midnight UTC using numerical weather prediction (NWP) and a climatological tropical cyclone forecast model. They used the Dvorak technique and NWP to estimate 10-minute sustained winds and barometric pressure. The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin, operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and supplying forecasts to the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The agency moved their <b>backup</b> <b>facility</b> from Yokosuka, Kanagawa in Japan to Monterey, California in 2002.

40|$|The use of {{emergency}} <b>backup</b> and storage <b>facilities</b> to supplement existing facilities {{in response to}} the potential effects of various natural and anthropogenic hazards (e. g., floods, fires, outages, and acts of malice) can be an effective way of reducing vulnerability and enhancing the resilience of supply chain and other logistics functions. Although there can be additional costs associated with utilizing emergency <b>backup</b> and storage <b>facilities,</b> they can be a particularly attractive and cost-effective alternative in those cases where long-term disruptions can, or should, be expected. In this paper we use set cover location modeling as a decision to determine the number of <b>backup</b> <b>facilities</b> to locate under varying cover, anticover, and complementary anticover distances. We then add the flexibility of allowing existing facilities to serve as <b>backup</b> <b>facilities</b> and explore the interrelationships among hazards, vulnerability, and location.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an estimate of}} the probability that a single earthquake could cause simultaneous operational failure of geographically disperse data centers operated by a California utility.
