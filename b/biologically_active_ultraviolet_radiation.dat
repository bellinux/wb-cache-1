40|$|We {{carry out}} 3 -D {{numerical}} simulations {{to assess the}} penetration and bombardment effects of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs), i. e. high-energy particle bursts during large flares and superflares, on ancient and current Mars. We demonstrate that the deposition of SEPs is non-uniform at the planetary surface, and that the corresponding energy flux is lower than other sources postulated to have influenced the origin of life. Nevertheless, SEPs may have been capable of facilitating the synthesis {{of a wide range}} of vital organic molecules (e. g. nucleobases and amino acids). Owing to the relatively high efficiency of these pathways, the overall yields might be comparable to (or even exceed) the values predicted for some conventional sources such as electrical discharges and exogenous delivery by meteorites. We also suggest that SEPs could have played a role in enabling the initiation of lightning. A notable corollary of our work is that SEPs may constitute an important mechanism for prebiotic synthesis on exoplanets around M-dwarfs, thereby mitigating the deficiency of <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> on these planets. Although there are several uncertainties associated with (exo) planetary environments and prebiotic chemical pathways, our study illustrates that SEPs represent a potentially important factor in understanding the origin of life.

40|$|Studies of the {{depletion}} of ozone which have been conducted from the TOMS instrument on the NIMBUS 7 satellite indicate that total ozone has declined by 5 {{percent over the last}} 12 years at most mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere typical of southern Ontario. The measurement of the actual resultant increases in UVB is now important. A monitoring program of UVB (<b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> solar <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation)</b> has been conducted for the last 24 months at a site near Bolton, Ontario. The sunburn time varies from less than 17 minutes in late July, to over 4 hours in December on clear days. The levels depend on solar insolation and total ozone column. The ultraviolet levels are strongly affected by cloud and sky conditions. The implications of present and future depletion on the sunburn time are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the habitability of Earth-analogs around stars of different masses, which is {{regulated by the}} stellar lifetime, stellar wind-induced atmospheric erosion, and <b>biologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) irradiance.

We conclude that planets orbiting most M-dwarfs {{are not likely to}} host life, and that the highest probability of complex biospheres is for planets around K- and G-type stars.

40|$|Abstract The main benefit {{involved}} in the mutualistic relationship between Paramecium bursaria and Chlorella has been traditionally interpreted as an adaptation to the struggle against starvation and nutrient limitation.

Here, we explore the photobiological adaptations and responses of P. bursaria and its algal symbionts when exposed to photosynthetically <b>active</b> and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation,</b> {{as well as the}} role of (photo-) oxidative and antioxidative defenses in the symbiosis.

40|$|In {{field studies}} {{conducted}} at the Kongsfjord (Spitsbergen) changes of the irradiance in the atmosphere and the sublittoral zone were monitored {{from the beginning of}} June until the end of August 1997, to register the minimum and maximum fluxes of <b>ultraviolet</b> and photosynthetically <b>active</b> <b>radiation</b> and to characterise the underwater light climate. Measurements of photosynthesis in three abundant brown algal species (Alaria esculenta, Laminaria saccharina, Saccorhiza dermatodea) were conducted to test whether their photosynthetic performance reflects changing light climate in accordance with depth. Plants sampled at various depths were exposed to controlled fluence rates of photosynthetically active radiation (400 - 700 nm), W-A (320 - 400 nm) and UV-B (280 - 320 nm). Changes in photosynthetic performance during the treatments were monitored by measuring variable chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II. In each species, the degree of inhibition of photosynthesis was related to the original collection depth, i. e. shallow- water isolates were more resistant than plants from deeper waters. The results show that macroalgae acclimate effectively to increasing irradiance levels for both photosynthetically <b>active</b> and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation.</b> However, the kinetics of acclimation are different within the different species. It is shown that one important strategy to cope with higher irradiance levels in shallow waters is the capability for a faster recovery from high light stress compared to isolates from deeper waters.

To measure stimulation or proliferation ability (one-way mixed leukocyte reactions), treated or untreated leukocytes were exposed to 2000 R X-radiation prior to mixing. Treatment of leukocytes with 8 -methoxypsoralen (0. 01, 0. 1, or 1. 0 Î¼g/ml) followed by 7, 000 to 87, 000 J/m 2 long-wavelength <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of mixed leukocyte culture reactivity. 0. 1 Î¼g/ml 8 -methoxypsoralen plus 7, 000 J/m 2 <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> resulted in a 48 % reduction (p < 0. 01) in mixed leukocyte reaction-induced tritiated thymidine incorporation in the two-way assay. 1 Î¼g/ml 8 -methoxypsoralen plus 87, 000 J/m 2 <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> virtually abolished reactivity in the two-way mixed leukocyte reaction and in both one-way mixed leukocyte reactions.
