5|$|As {{an author}} of six books, Blancornelas was {{regarded}} by the press as a leading expert on organized crime and drug trafficking during his time. He {{was also the first}} man to publish a photograph of Ramón Arellano Félix, the former drug lord of the Tijuana Cartel. In response to the photo publication, the cartel attempted to kill Blancornelas in 1997, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> survive the attack and continued to report on the workings of Mexico's criminal underworld.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket debut against South Australia in 1909–1910 and was disappointing, scoring three and one and taking 1/35. He played one further {{match for the}} season, against Victoria. For the next two seasons, his opportunities at first-class level were limited <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> play against the touring South African and English sides.|$|E
5|$|After recovering, {{he joined}} the Kimberley Mounted Corps and guided two {{officers}} from Lichtenburg to Klerksdorp, where they persuaded the Boers to surrender by bluffing that a strong British force was following close behind. The Boers soon retook the town and Guest was captured. He was sent with other prisoners to Pietersburg to be executed <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> escape and travelled to Warmbaths. After satisfying the authorities that he had actually been taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily, {{he returned to his}} depot at Kimberley. His unit had been disbanded and he was discharged.|$|E

5|$|After retiring, Pipp {{invested}} in the stock market, but lost his wealth in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. He authored a book, titled Buying Cheap and Selling Dear. He worked as a broadcaster on a pregame baseball show for the Tigers, wrote radio scripts, and worked in publishing. He organized baseball programs around his community for the National Youth Administration. He also spent time unemployed during the Great Depression. In 1940, Pipp {{was on the verge}} of bankruptcy, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> pay off his debts without going bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{withdrew from}} the war on 8 September. Kesselring {{immediately}} moved to secure Rome, where he expected an Allied airborne and seaborne invasion. He ordered the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division and 2nd Parachute Division to close on the city, while a detachment made an unsuccessful attempt to seize the Italian Army staff at Monterotondo in a coup de main. Kesselring's two divisions were faced by five Italian divisions, two of them armoured, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> overcome the opposition, disperse the Italian forces and secure the city in two days.|$|E
5|$|King Stephen gave {{permission}} {{for some of}} England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Reims in 1148. Stephen had expelled the papal legates, or representatives, who arrived in England to summon the bishops to Reims, and after that appointed three of the bishops as representatives of the English Church. These three, Bethune, Hilary of Chichester, and William de Turbeville, were allowed to attend the council. Theobald of Bec was expressly forbidden to attend, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> evade those watching him and arrived in Reims along with his clerk, Thomas Becket.|$|E

5|$|Sastre's {{team had}} been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E
5|$|As a young officer, Rowell {{served at}} Gallipoli but was invalided back to Australia with typhoid fever in January 1916. The {{end of the}} war found Rowell junior in rank to his contemporaries with more {{distinguished}} war records, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> catch up in the post-war period. Rowell spent five years with the British Army or at British staff colleges, establishing valuable contacts with his British counterparts. In 1939 he was appointed {{chief of staff of the}} 6th Division and later I Corps, serving in that capacity in the Battle of Greece and the Syria-Lebanon campaign. In 1942 he commanded I Corps in the Kokoda Track campaign but was sacked. His subsequent rise to become Chief of the General Staff demonstrated that the circumstances of his dismissal in 1942 were indeed extraordinary.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{after his}} release, Alfano left Naples and went from village to village to elude arrest. The Carabinieri located him in San Leucio, near Caserta, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> escape. He fled to Rome, {{obtained}} a false passport and sailed for the United States from Marseilles, France. He disembarked on March 17, 1907, in New York {{disguised as a}} member of the ship's crew, posing as a stoker. In New York he began to run a gambling den in the basement of 108 Mulberry Street. He became one of the primary underworld targets of police sergeant Joseph Petrosino of the New York City Police Department, who believed Alfano to be a big player in the New York branch of the Camorra.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptian army {{unleashed}} {{its full}} anti-aircraft arsenal and hit Alon's plane, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> crash-land unharmed at 20:05, performing a ground loop. Weizmann landed at 20:15. Eddie Cohen, a volunteer pilot from South Africa, crashed and died, {{although it is}} unknown whether {{he was hit by}} anti-aircraft fire, or a technical problem caused the plane to malfunction. A report by Dan Tolkovsky, the Israeli Air Force operations officer at the time, stated that Cohen likely attempted to land at the Hatzor Airbase instead of Ekron, where eyewitnesses saw a burning plane crashing in the distance. He was the first Israeli Air Force KIA, and was buried in Tel Aviv (Nahalat Yitzhak) after his remains were found at the end of 1949.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the shock}} of the Western public, the {{practice}} of Vietnamese monks self-immolating was not unprecedented. Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The French colonial authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Huế in the 1920s, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> starve himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of Harbin in 1948 when a monk seated down in the lotus position on a pile of sawdust and soybean oil and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the communists of Mao Zedong. His heart remained intact, as did that of Đức.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco {{missed out}} on Juventus's 2013 Supercoppa Italiana victory, and he {{initially}} went scoreless in the 2013–14 season until finally netting a notable goal in a 3–2 win over rivals Milan on the 6 October 2013. Giovinco fell out of form again and struggled to gain playing time, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> break his goal drought on 14 April 2014, with a goal against Udinese, taking the ball past a defender and scoring with a left footed curling shot from outside the box. Overall, Giovinco managed 2 goals in 17 Serie A appearances that season, and one goal in the Coppa Italia, as Juventus won their third consecutive Serie A title. During the 2014–15 season under Massimiliano Allegri, Giovinco scored two goals in a 6–1 win over Hellas Verona in the Coppa Italia, on 15 January 2015, helping Juventus to the quarter-finals of the competition; both of his goals came in the first half, with the first coming from a free kick, and the second in injury time.|$|E
50|$|In the end, Caine {{is convicted}} of murdering Alvarez and arms-dealing. He is {{sentenced to life in}} prison, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>manages</b> <b>to</b> escape and departs to Chicago. Elsewhere, Jones {{suggests}} to Tanner a beer and the two race back to the police headquarters.|$|R

5|$|In {{his first}} match since the US Open, del Potro was upset by world No. 189 Édouard Roger-Vasselin in {{straight}} sets at the Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships in Tokyo. He then lost his second straight match to Melzer {{in the second}} round at the Masters 1000 event in Shanghai, retiring while trailing in the second set. This retirement caused concerns over the length of the tennis season. He had to retire again in the Paris Masters quarterfinals when down 0–4 to Radek Štěpánek due to an abdominal injury. In November, del Potro competed in the ATP World Tour Finals, where he lost his first round-robin match against Andy Murray, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> defeat Fernando Verdasco in his second match to keep his hopes alive. After defeating Roger Federer in the following match, he qualified for the semifinals, ousting Murray by the slimmest possible margin of one game. He defeated Robin Söderling in the semifinals, before losing to Nikolay Davydenko in the final. Del Potro finished 2009 as the youngest player in the top 10, top-ranked Argentine, and highest-ranked South American for the second consecutive year.|$|E
5|$|Norreis went to Rome in {{the company}} of Thomas of Marlborough shortly before 1205 to lay the abbey's case before the papacy. Thomas {{remained}} in Italy, but Norreis returned to England in the middle of 1205. While in Rome, Norreis and Thomas borrowed 400 marks to finance the litigation at the papal curia. Norreis could not repay this sum and for a while was in danger of being imprisoned, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> leave Rome without suffering the fate of one of his companions who was detained for the debt and died while imprisoned. When Norreis made it back to England, Mauger excommunicated the abbot in April 1205. The monks won a victory {{on the question of the}} abbey's exemption from episcopal visitation in 1206, but other elements of the quarrel remained unresolved, including that of the disputed churches. Later that year the monks became so annoyed by Norreis's abuse that they abandoned the abbey and did not return until they secured the abbot's confirmation of their rights.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E

5|$|Waller {{was also}} {{involved}} in matters related the local railroads. On October 3, 1877, he sold some of his land in Bloomsburg to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{for the purpose of}} a new railroad station. He was {{also involved in}} the building of the North and West Branch Railway between 1880 and 1881. He started raising money for this railroad in 1872 and broke the ground for the railroad in March 1872. Waller put most of his money into the building of the North and West Branch Railway. The work on the railroad stopped during the Panic of 1873 but resumed in 1880. The North and West Branch Railway Company was sold in 1881 <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> regain much of the company. The company was leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad on November 23, 1881, but remained its own company for approximately 20 years. He was president of the North and West Branch Railway in the 1880s. In 1888, he sold a piece of land to the town of Bloomsburg for the purpose of building the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad through it. It was he who initially conceived the idea of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad. Waller also successfully convinced the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad to move its Bloomsburg station to his land on Market Street.|$|E
5|$|In the beginning, {{there was}} only Primus, the god of light and creation, who had been brought forth by Cybertron itself as the {{counterpart}} to another, unnamed being. Deeming that his power was too great to be contained by himself alone, he split his potency into five beings, including of course himself, and also Solomus, who possessed great wisdom; Epistemus, who was a fount of knowledge; Adaptus, who could alter his shape into an infinity of forms; and Mortilus, the embodiment of death, the necessary end of life. For a time, these five entities, known as the Guiding Hand, led life on Cybertron to heights of harmony and creation, but eventually Mortilus tried to {{change the course of}} life so that the Cybertronians would become a Universe-conquering army. What followed was a veritable war of the gods, which ended in tragedy and devastation. Mortilus himself perished, but not before dealing severe and irreversible damage to {{the other members of the}} Guiding Hand. On the verge of death, Primus withdrew into the planet itself, communicating from then on through the supercomputer Vector Sigma; while the other three only survive as relics which are essential to the Cybertronian race. Solomus' essence had been imprisoned by Mortilus in a crystal container, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> change it into a vessel which would let those who were worthy partake of his undying wisdom. In this form he is known as the Matrix of Leadership, which also provides a link to Primus and thus to life itself. Epistemus and Adaptus had been shred down to their very cores, but now became the first blueprints for the two most basic components of all Cybertronians from then on, namely the brain module and the transformation cog. With the death of Mortilus himself, a Cybertronian's life force would be immune to the ravages of time, rendering them effectively immortal.|$|E
5|$|There was {{evidence}} that Braham's judgement was becoming impaired. He had not taken much leave {{since the war began}} in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short-tempered with his family and those around him. He had spent much of the previous two years leading from the front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory. On 7 May 1944 he collected navigator Flight Lieutenant Donald Walsh from Group headquarters. He borrowed a Mosquito from 21 Squadron at Gravesend. He flew to Norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit, 141 Squadron, and spent the night at West Raynham. Over Roskilde, Denmark, he caught a Ju 88 after a 10-minute chase and shot it down—his 28th victory. On 12 May Braham repeated the operation. This time he took Bill Gregory with him. Operating over the Aalborg–Copenhagen line he spotted a Fw 190 near Hurning. Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109—his presence clearly detected by German radar. His Mosquito was hit in the port wing and the fuel line were ruptured. The Bf 109 then disappeared. Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190. At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames, stalled and crashed near Aalborg. The range was so close—around 100 yards—the Focke-Wulf nearly collided with Braham. The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground, meant that the chances of reaching England were slim. He climbed to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received. He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half. They took the dingy and watched the tail and wings remain afloat. He was retrieved with Gregory by air-sea rescue. Royal Navy trawlers sank the sections of aircraft remaining afloat. Regardless of the venture, on 13 June 1944 he received his final award—a second bar to his DSO.|$|E
