She was renamed Egmont in March 1904, and remained in Malta until 1914. Her role in Malta was assumed by the stone frigate Fort St Angelo. She was <b>brought</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Chatham that year, and served there as a depot ship under the successive names of Egremont (19 June 1916) and Pembroke (6 June 1919). The ship was sold for scrap on 26 January 1923 to the Granton Shipbreaking Co.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} virus is {{typically}} transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), {{direct contact with}} infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Which of these routes is of primary importance has not been determined; however, hand-to-hand and hand-to-surface-to-hand contact seems of more importance than transmission via aerosols. The viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment (over 18 hours for rhinoviruses) and can {{be picked up by}} people's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs. Transmission is common in daycare and at school due to the proximity of many children with little immunity and frequently poor hygiene. These infections are then <b>brought</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> other members of the family. There is no evidence that recirculated air during commercial flight is a method of transmission. People sitting in close proximity appear to be at greater risk of infection.|$|E
5|$|Luang Pu Sodh {{was born}} as Sodh Mikaewnoi on 10 October 1884 to a {{relatively}} well-off family of rice merchants in Amphoe Song Phi Nong, Suphan Buri, a province 102km west of Bangkok in central Thailand. His father was called Ngen and his mother Soodjai. He received part of his schooling in the temple of his uncle, a Buddhist monk, when he was nine years old. He therefore became familiar with Buddhism from an early age. He also showed qualities of being an intelligent autodidact. When Sodh's uncle moved to Wat Hua Bho, he took Sodh with him to teach him further. After a while his uncle left the monkhood, but Ngen managed to send Sodh to study with Luang Por Sub, the abbot of Wat Bangpla. This is where Sodh learnt the Khmer language. When he was thirteen years old, he finished his Khmer studies there and returned home to help his father. Father Ngen ran a rice-trading business, shipping rice from Suphanburi to sell to rice mills in Bangkok and Nakhon Chai Si District. At the age of fourteen, Ngen died, {{and he had to}} take responsibility for the family business, being the first son. This had an impact on him: thieves and other threats <b>brought</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> him the futility of the household life, and at the age of eighteen, he desired to be ordained as a monk. He had to take care of his family first though, and saved up money for them to be able to leave behind after he would become a monk. The biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya says that he had to calculate the rate of inflation for this, and work harder than before, but finally managed to gather enough funds after four years.|$|E

500|$|According to Singh, [...] "the {{events of}} 1937 had a tremendous, almost a {{traumatic}} effect upon Jinnah". Despite his beliefs of twenty years that Muslims could protect their rights in a united India through separate electorates, provincial boundaries drawn to preserve Muslim majorities, and by other protections of minority rights, Muslim voters {{had failed to}} unite, with the issues Jinnah hoped to bring forward lost amid factional fighting. Singh notes {{the effect of the}} 1937 elections on Muslim political opinion, [...] "when the Congress formed a government with almost all of the Muslim MLAs sitting on the Opposition benches, non-Congress Muslims were suddenly faced with this stark reality of near-total political powerlessness. It was <b>brought</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> them, like a bolt of lightning, that even if the Congress did not win a single Muslim seat... as long as it won an absolute majority in the House, on the strength of the general seats, it could and would form a government entirely on its own..." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} bodies of Privates Luther Ladd and Addison Whitney were <b>brought</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Lowell, Massachusetts, after the Baltimore Riot, city {{officials}} began planning {{the construction of a}} monument honoring their sacrifice and memorializing the first casualties of the Civil War. An appropriation of $2,000 was secured from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and a further $2,700 was provided by the city. The monument was constructed in front of the Lowell courthouse in what is now known as Monument Square. Ladd and Whitney had both been buried in the Lowell Cemetery. On April 28, 1865, their remains were re-interred in a vault beneath the monument. The monument was to be dedicated on April 19, 1865, on the anniversary of the Baltimore Riot, but the ceremonies were delayed due to the assassination of President Lincoln. It was instead dedicated on the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, a local holiday, June 17, 1865. The procession numbered more than 4,500 people. Governor Andrew gave the oration acknowledging the men whom he called [...] "the first martyrs of the great rebellion." ...|$|E

500|$|Bond's {{briefing}} {{also provides}} an opportunity for Fleming to offer his views on race through his characters. [...] "M and Bond... offer their views on the ethnicity of crime, views that reflected ignorance, the inherited racialist prejudices of London clubland", according to the cultural historian Jeremy Black. Black also points out that [...] "the frequency of his references and his willingness to offer racial stereotypes [...] typical of many writers of his age". The writer Louise Welsh observes that [...] "Live and Let Die taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling" [...] as the civil rights movements challenged prejudice and inequality. That insecurity manifested itself in opinions shared by Fleming with the intelligence industry, that the American National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was a communist front. The communist threat was <b>brought</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Jamaica with the 1952 arrest of the Jamaican politician Alexander Bustamante by the American authorities while he was on official business in Puerto Rico, {{despite the fact that he}} was avowedly anti-communist. During the course of the year local Jamaican political parties had also expelled members for being communists.|$|E
500|$|Rush was soundly beaten, Trickett winning {{by several}} lengths. A {{combination}} of factors led to Rush's defeat. Trickett had won a World Championship, at an international venue, and he <b>brought</b> <b>home</b> <b>to</b> Australia the [...] and self-confidence that arose from this experience. Trickett trained on the Thames, the home of championship sculling, by expert coaches including Harry Kelley. Rush, though trained by the ex-champion Richard Green, remained in effect an amateur, largely self-taught. Rush invented his own sculling technique, based on sheer strength and endurance; his style was often deprecated. Trickett was three inches taller than Rush, and had a longer reach. Finally, Trickett learned on the Thames to use racing-craft fitted with a sliding seat, which allowed a more efficient use of the sculler's whole body when rowing. Before the race, Rush tried a sliding seat racing-shell, but could not discover any advantage, and chose instead to row a fixed-seat outrigger. Once the news of Rush's decision became public, betting odds changed dramatically, favouring Trickett, {{and the result of}} the race was considered almost a foregone conclusion. Still, Rush was known as an honest sportsman and was expected to put up a mighty effort to beat Trickett. And so he did, but without success.|$|E
