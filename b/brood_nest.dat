5|$|Researchers {{speculate}} that acoustical mimicry {{is related to}} the level of interaction between the host and parasite. In the Phengaris genus, there are two different strategies: the cuckoo strategy used by P. rebeli and the predatory strategy used by Phengaris arion. In P. rebeli, the Phengaris larvae become integrated into the colony and are attended by worker ants. However, larvae in predatory species prey on the ants’ brood and consequently spend much of their life hiding in pockets of the <b>brood</b> <b>nest.</b>|$|E
500|$|The clutch the grey-necked wood rail lays usually {{consists}} of three to seven brown-blotched, slightly glossy, whitish eggs, although clutches consisting of five eggs are most typical. These eggs usually measure around [...] and weigh between [...] They are incubated by both sexes, each taking six to eight hour shifts, for around 20 days. In captivity, the male incubates during the day, and the female during the night. The chicks hatch precocial and are cared for by the parents {{for one or two}} days before leaving the nest, although chicks sometimes use the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> until they are 40 days old.|$|E
5000|$|Simply {{keep the}} <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> open. In {{preparation}} for swarming, bees fill the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> with honey. The queen stops laying to be trim enough to fly, and her newly unemployed nurse bees go with her. The concept {{of this method}} is to open the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> to employ those nurse bees and get the queen laying again and redirect this sequence of events. This is done by any number of slight variations from empty frames in the <b>brood</b> <b>nest,</b> frames of bare foundation in the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> or drawn combs in the <b>brood</b> <b>nest,</b> or moving brood combs to the box above to cause more expansion of the <b>brood</b> <b>nest.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Brood</b> <b>nests</b> are nests {{that are}} either newly {{constructed}} or have simply been converted from old egg nests after the eggs hatch. They are simply larger egg nests.|$|R
25|$|The American coot is a {{prolific}} builder and will create multiple structures during a single breeding season. It nests in well-concealed locations in tall reeds. There are three general types of structures: display platforms, egg <b>nests</b> and <b>brood</b> <b>nests.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since American coots {{build on}} the water, their {{structures}} disintegrate easily and have short life spans. Egg and <b>brood</b> <b>nests</b> are actually elaborate rafts, and must be constantly added {{to in order to}} stay afloat. Females typically do the most work while building.|$|R
5000|$|Checkerboarding. In {{the late}} winter, frames are rearranged above the growing <b>brood</b> <b>nest.</b> The frames above the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> are alternated between full honey frames and empty drawn out frames or even foundationless frames. It is {{believed}} that only colonies that perceive to have enough reserves will attempt to swarm. Checkerboarding frames above the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> apparently destroys this sense of having reserves.|$|E
50|$|Natural queen {{exclusion}} occurs {{more frequently}} in top-bar hives, because the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> is separated from the honey section by at least a full bar of honey comb, {{and not just a}} few centimetres of honey as may be the case in a multi-storey framed hive. And the more honey is gathered, the further the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> becomes from newly created comb.|$|E

40|$|Ornamental: Showy {{flowers and}} fruit make common buttonbush a popular choice {{for use in}} native plant gardens, shrub borders, and along pond shores and water gardens. The {{persistent}} fruits give the plant some winter interest. Wildlife: Waterfowl and shorebirds consume the seeds of common buttonbush. White-tailed deer browse foliage in the northeastern United States. Wood ducks use the plant‟s structure for protection of <b>brooding</b> <b>nests.</b> Butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds are attracted to common buttonbush for its nectar. Bees use it to produce honey...|$|R
50|$|The {{zebra finch}} breeds after {{substantial}} rains in its native habitat, which can occur {{at any time}} of the year. Birds in captivity are ready to breed year-round. Wild birds are adaptable and varied in their nesting habits, with nests being found in cavities, scrub, low trees, bushes, on the ground, in termite hills, rabbit burrows, nests of other birds, and in the cracks, crevices, and ledges of human structures. Outside of the breeding time, <b>brood</b> <b>nests</b> are constructed for sleeping in.|$|R
50|$|The striped earwig prefers dark, moist environments with shelter that it {{can hide}} during the daytime. They {{can be found in}} a variety of niches though, from cultured and uncultured farmlands, woodlands, and the margins of ponds and lakes. To save energy, the earwigs will occupy {{abandoned}} mole cricket burrows for <b>brooding</b> <b>nests.</b> Individuals are known to fly after a disturbance in search of a new nest as theirs may have become waterlogged or destroyed. Flight towards light has been observed due to their methods of orientation via the moon.|$|R
5000|$|Apparently, at {{the first}} time this type of {{backfilling}} behavior starts {{is the best time to}} do the Checkerboarding intervention. It requires filling two hive boxes above the broodnest each alternately with capped honey-filled frames and empty drawn frames. Alternating empty drawn combs above the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> [...] "fools" [...] the bees into thinking they don't have enough stores yet for swarming and causes them to expand the <b>brood</b> <b>nest,</b> giving both a bigger field force and avoiding reproductive swarming.|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} honey stored within the central brood frames, the bees store surplus honey in combs above the <b>brood</b> <b>nest.</b> In modern hives the {{beekeeper}} places separate boxes, called [...] "supers", above the brood box, {{in which a}} series of shallower combs is provided for storage of honey. This enables the beekeeper to {{remove some of the}} supers in the late summer, and to extract the surplus honey harvest, without damaging the colony of bees and its <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> below. If all the honey is [...] "stolen", including the amount of honey needed to survive winter, the beekeeper must replace these stores by feeding the bees sugar or corn syrup in autumn.|$|E
50|$|Eggs are {{approximately}} 27 x 19 mm, pale grey-brown, oval {{and covered with}} sepia and dusky hairlines. Clutch size is typically 2-6 eggs and nestlings fledge after 21-25 days. Unusually large clutches may result {{from the use of}} a single <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> by more than one breeding pair.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{closely related}} {{northern}} white-crowned shrike this species is highly sociable and will form small, tightly-knit groups of usually {{three to six}} individuals, but occasionally up to twenty outside the breeding season. They are not in general aggressive birds but will attack predators such as birds of prey. When foraging, they sometimes associate with Tockus hornbills, feeding on the insects they disturb as they walk around. Members of the group engage in cooperative breeding, joining together in building a <b>brooding</b> <b>nest,</b> take turns in sitting on the eggs and assist in the feeding of nestlings.|$|R

25|$|The female {{tarantula}} hawk wasp stings and paralyzes a tarantula, then drags {{the prey}} to a specially prepared <b>brooding</b> <b>nest,</b> where a single egg is {{laid on the}} spider's abdomen, and the entrance is covered. Sex of the larvae is determined by fertilization; fertilized eggs produce females, while unfertilized eggs produce males. When the wasp larva hatches, it creates a small hole in the spider's abdomen, then enters and feeds voraciously, avoiding vital organs {{for as long as}} possible to keep the spider alive. After several weeks, the larva pupates. Finally, the wasp becomes an adult and emerges from the spider's abdomen to continue the life cycle.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} shown that a larger bee colony will produce {{relatively}} more honey. Therefore, the early buildup and spring feeding and subsequent prevention of swarming are of high priority. Several different methods such as the Demaree method, Checkerboarding and opening up the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> have been advocated to prevent swarming.|$|E
5000|$|The Warre hive {{differs from}} other stacked hive systems in one {{fundamental}} aspect: when the bees need more space as the colony expands, the new box is [...] "nadired". i.e. positioned underneath the existing box(es). This serves {{the purpose of}} warmth retention within the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> of the hive, considered vital to colony health.|$|E
50|$|Drone {{producing}} hives produce abnormally {{large numbers}} of drones.By using drone foundation in the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> a beekeeper can produce a large drone population to saturate the Drone Congregation area with drones of a given stock.Saturating the drone congregation area improves the odds that the queen will mate with drones of a particular lineage, but does not guarantee it.|$|E
50|$|They reside {{often in}} high mountains, in the sub-alpine and alpine biome. They also {{are found in}} low foothills and forested regions, but to a much smaller extent. They build nesting burrows in the rocks of talus slopes, and rock covered scree. They often fill in rock {{fissures}} with excrement mixed with plant debris to form an insulated wall. Nests are built as a soft sphere of plant debris, and are functionally divided into <b>brooding</b> <b>nests</b> with separate areas for rest. The mountain vole has been seen being active {{in the day and}} at night, and movements of the vole under winter snow have been recorded.|$|R
5000|$|Among hosts not exhibiting {{parasitic}} egg ejection, some abandon parasitized nests {{and start}} over again. However, at high enough parasitism frequencies, this becomes maladaptive as the new nest will most likely also be parasitized. Some host species modify their nests to exclude the parasitic egg, either by weaving over the egg {{or in some cases}} rebuilding a new nest over the existing one. For instance, American coots may kick the parasites' eggs out, or build a new <b>nest</b> beside the <b>brood</b> <b>nests</b> where the parasites’ babies starve to death. [...] In the Western Bonelli's warbler Phylloscopus bonelli, a small host, experimental parasitism revealed that small dummy parasitic eggs were always ejected, whilst with large dummy parasitic eggs nest desertion more frequently occurred.|$|R
5|$|Macroolithus eggs {{have been}} found {{containing}} oviraptorid dinosaur embryos resembling Heyuannia. Multiple other associations between oviraptorid and elongatoolithids (including other eggs containing embryos, parents <b>brooding</b> on <b>nests,</b> {{and a pair of}} shelled Macroolithus-like eggs preserved within an oviraptorid's pelvis) confirm that the parent of Macroolithus was an oviraptorid.|$|R
5000|$|The Cloake board, {{also known}} as the [...] "bottom-without-a-bottom", is a {{specialty}} piece of hive equipment that is installed between two hive bodies of the <b>brood</b> <b>nest.</b> It allows the beekeeper to insert a sliding metal or wood panel, which will split the hive into two parts without having to lift the hive boxes, the objective being to split a single hive into two independent hives.|$|E

50|$|In the {{temperate}} zones, winter temperatures dip below 12 °C (54 °F) {{for extended}} periods. All brood rearing stops for some period during the winter. In early spring, brood rearing resumes inside the winter cluster when the queens starts to lay eggs again. Once a broodnest is established, the cluster must maintain a steady temperature between 34.5 to 36.7 °C (94.1 - 98.0 °F) inside the cluster. If {{the temperature in}} areas of the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> dips too low the brood dies - also called chilled brood.|$|E
50|$|It breeds {{from late}} March or April to June, raising two <b>broods.</b> The <b>nest</b> is {{a cup of}} grass and other plant {{material}} built in a hole in rocks, stones or a wall. Four to six eggs are laid and are incubated for 13 days. The eggs are pale bluish-white, sometimes with reddish-brown spots.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, due to {{bad weather}} and rot {{in the upper}} {{branches}} of the tree, the nest collapsed. Before the next season in 2005, a platform was constructed with help from local school children. In 2005 the Osprey pair returned, took up residence on the specially made platform, and raised the first known Welsh <b>brood.</b> The <b>nest</b> is being monitored via a webcam.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more that}} we learn about these animals the more we find that there is {{basically}} no difference between birds and their closely related dinosaur ancestors like velociraptor. Both have wishbones, <b>brooded</b> their <b>nests,</b> possess hollow bones, and were covered in feathers. If animals like velociraptor were alive today our first impression would be {{that they were just}} very unusual looking birds.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the modern}} Demaree method, the queen {{is placed in}} the bottom box, along with one or two frames of brood (but {{containing}} no open brood), as well as one or two frames of food stores, and empty combs or foundation. A queen excluder is placed above the bottom box, thereby restricting the queen to the bottom box but allowing bees to move freely between the bottom box {{and the rest of the}} hive. The original hive, along with all open brood, is placed above the queen excluder. The method works best if the nurse bees are remove far away from the queen. The distance between the queen and nurse bees can be increased by placing the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> at the very top of the hive, with the honey supers between the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> and the queen excluder. If any swarm cells are present, these must be destroyed by the beekeeper. The relative absence of queen pheromone in the top box usually prompts the nurse bees to create emergency cells. After 7-10 days, the beekeeper destroys the emergency cells, and then either removes the queen excluder (thereby ending the [...] "demaree") or repeats the process a second or a third time until the swarming impulse is over.|$|E
50|$|A domesticated {{bee colony}} is {{normally}} {{housed in a}} rectangular hive body, within which eight to ten parallel frames house the vertical plates of honeycomb that contain the eggs, larvae, pupae and food for the colony. If one were to cut a vertical cross-section through the hive from side to side, the <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> would appear as a roughly ovoid ball spanning 5-8 frames of comb. The two outside combs at {{each side of the}} hive tend to be exclusively used for long-term storage of honey and pollen.|$|E
50|$|Populous {{honey bee}} colonies are usually reduced to single hive bodies at the {{beginning}} of the honey flow when one or more comb honey supers are added. Comb honey can either be produced in wooden sections, shallow frames, or Ross Rounds. The successful production of comb honey requires that the hive remain crowded without inducing swarming. Young prolific queens help rapid colony population expansion with less likelihood of swarming. Caucasian honey bees are often preferred for their tendency to keep a constricted <b>brood</b> <b>nest</b> and for their production of white wax cappings, making more attractive honey combs.|$|E
40|$|Aim. The {{quantitative}} genetics underlying correlated behavioural traits (‘‘animal personality’’) have hitherto been studied mainly in domesticated animals. Here we report the repeatability () and heritability () of behavioural {{types in the}} highly social cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher. Methods. We tested 1779 individuals repeatedly and calculated the of behavioural types by variance components estimation (GLMM REML), using 1327 offspring from 162 broods from 74 pairs. Results. Repeatability of behavioural types was significant and considerable (0. 546), but declined from 0. 83 between tests conducted on the same day, to 0. 19 on tests conducted up to 1201 days apart. All estimates were significant but low (e. g., pair identity SE). Additionally, we found significant variation between <b>broods</b> <b>nested</b> within the parent(s), but these were not related to several environmental factors tested. Conclusions. We conclude that despite a considerable, in this cichlid species is low, and variability in behavioural type appears to be strongly affected by other (non) genetic effects...|$|R
50|$|Very often, {{there will}} be three hawks {{attending}} one nest: two males and one female. Whether {{or not this is}} polyandry is debated, as it may be confused with backstanding (one bird standing on another's back). The female does most of the incubation. The eggs hatch in 31 to 36 days. The young begin to explore outside the nest at 38 days, and fledge, or start to fly, at 45 to 50 days. The female sometimes breeds two or three times in a year. Young may stay with their parents for up to three years, helping to raise later <b>broods.</b> <b>Nests</b> are known to be predated by coyotes (Canis latrans), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and flocks of common ravens (Corvus corax), predators possibly too formidable to be fully displaced by the Harris's hawk's cooperative nest defenses. In Chile, black-chested buzzard-eagles (Geranoaetus melanoleucus) are likely predators.|$|R
