5|$|<b>Bird</b> <b>migration</b> routes {{have been}} studied {{by a variety of}} {{techniques}} including the oldest, marking. Swans have been marked with a nick on the beak since about 1560 in England. Scientific ringing was pioneered by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen in 1899. Other techniques include radar and satellite tracking. The rate of <b>bird</b> <b>migration</b> over the Alps (up to a height of 150 m) was found to be highly comparable between fixed-beam radar measurements and visual bird counts, highlighting the potential use of this technique as an objective way of quantifying <b>bird</b> <b>migration.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ronald Lockley (1903–2000), {{among many}} studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered {{the science of}} <b>bird</b> <b>migration.</b> He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the Manx shearwater, living on the remote island of Skokholm. These small seabirds make {{one of the longest}} migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year. This {{behaviour}} led {{to the question of how}} they navigated.|$|E

5|$|The Hawar Islands Protected Area {{provides}} valuable {{feeding and}} breeding grounds {{for a variety}} of migratory seabirds, it is an internationally recognised site for <b>bird</b> <b>migration.</b> The breeding colony of Socotra cormorant on Hawar Islands is the largest in the world, and the dugongs foraging around the archipelago form the second largest dugong aggregation after Australia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bird</b> <b>migration</b> is {{the regular}} {{seasonal}} movement, often {{north and south}} along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Aside from that, Damai is {{also one}} of the perfect places in Sarawak to see the Irrawaddy dolphin as the mammals can be spotted along the Salak River, Santubong estuary and at the Bako-Buntal Bay. The Santubong Peninsula offers a few sites for bird {{watching}} with the BirdLife International Organisation has registered the whole area on Bako-Buntal Bay as an 'Important Bird Area'. Between October and March, the Buntal River become an important wintering ground for <b>bird</b> <b>migration.</b> A number of birds that have been spotted by the Malaysian Nature Society (Kuching Branch) at Buntal including a variety of plovers, sandpipers, egrets, terns and other rare migrants, while resident birds including collared kingfisher, the white-bellied sea eagle and brahminy kite.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} {{downtown}} buildings, the tower's setbacks and spires are accented by colored lights at night. The building's managers were praised for dimming their lights during <b>bird</b> <b>migrations,</b> reducing <b>bird</b> mortality 80%.|$|R
5|$|The {{migration}} of birds also aids {{the movement of}} other species, including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice, which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health. Due to the global spread of avian influenza, <b>bird</b> <b>migration</b> has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission, {{but it has been}} found not to present a special risk; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat. Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as the West Nile Virus may however be spread by migrating birds. Birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton.|$|E
5|$|Portland Bill is the {{southern}} tip of the island of Portland. The Bill has three lighthouse towers: The Higher Lighthouse is now a dwelling and holiday apartments; the Lower Lighthouse is now a bird observatory and field centre providing records of <b>bird</b> <b>migration</b> and accommodation for visitors, which opened in 1961. The white and red lighthouse on Bill Point replaced the Higher and Lower Lighthouses in 1906. It is a prominent and much photographed feature; an important landmark for ships passing the headland and its tidal race. The current lighthouse was refurbished in 1996 and became remotely controlled. It now contains a visitors' centre giving information and guided tours of the lighthouse. As of June 2009, the lighthouse uses a 1kW metal-halide US-made lamp with an operational life of about 4000 hours, or 14 months.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during <b>bird</b> <b>migration</b> seasons.|$|E

25|$|TNO, a Dutch RD& Institute, has {{developed}} the successful ROBIN (Radar Observation of Bird Intensity) for the Royal Netherlands Airforce. ROBIN is a near real-time monitoring system for flight movements of birds. ROBIN identifies flocks of birds within the signals of large radar systems. This information {{is used to}} give Air Force pilots warning during landing and take-off. Years of observation of <b>bird</b> <b>migration</b> with ROBIN have also provided a better insight into <b>bird</b> <b>migration</b> behaviour, which has had an influence on averting collisions with birds, and therefore on flight safety. Since {{the implementation of the}} ROBIN system at the Royal Netherlands Airforce the number of collisions between birds and aircraft in the vicinity of military airbases has decreased by more than 50%.|$|E

30|$|As expected, <b>bird</b> <b>migrations</b> drove {{dramatic}} changes in the abundance and richness of shorebirds and gulls. Other waterbirds did not show a strong seasonal pattern. Fall migration was associated with a large and sustained increase in bird abundance and richness. In contrast, spring migration was brief and moderate in scope. Birds were uncommon in May and June. Local breeders (mostly snowy plovers and least terns) were limited to a few sites with active protection efforts.|$|R
25|$|Insect {{migration}} is the seasonal movement of insects, particularly those by species of dragonflies, beetles, butterflies and moths. The distance {{can vary from}} species to species, {{but in most cases}} these movements involve large numbers of individuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. This is a significant difference from <b>bird</b> <b>migration.</b>|$|E
