50|$|The {{field has}} also been used by Hollywood actor Cliff Robertson. He would fly into {{the field in the}} 1970s and hang around. John F.

5000|$|The name [...] "Movietone" [...] {{had been}} used by Fox Film Corporation since 1926, when it was coined by William Fox to name the process he had <b>bought</b> for <b>putting</b> sound on film for [...] "talkies". By the time the 1965 {{incarnation}} of the record label came along, Fox had issued some 78s on the Fox Movietone label decades earlier, but these were not commercial issues, as far as is known. [...] "Movietone" [...] was also the name Fox gave to its TV and newsreel coverage.|$|R
50|$|On 21 April 2017, {{the federal}} {{prosecutor}} {{announced that it}} had arrested a 28-year-old German-Russian citizen, identified only as Sergej W., on suspicion of 20-fold attempted murder, bringing about an illegal detonation of explosives, and aggravated battery. The man had been staying at the Borussia team hotel. He planted explosives along the road where the team bus would later leave to the stadium. During check-in, he chose {{a room with a}} window facing the road so {{he would be able to}} remotely trigger the explosion when the bus passed by. It was revealed that on the day of the attack, he had <b>bought</b> <b>put</b> warrants for €78,000 from an investment bank using the internet connection in his hotel room. These would have made him a large profit of up to €3.9 million if Dortmund's share price were to plummet after a successful attack, but it only dropped by 5% after the attack and later recovered. The unusual transaction raised suspicion of money laundering with bank employees, prompting them to alert authorities and pass to them the identity of Sergej W., which led to his arrest. Police also said Sergej W. left letters at the scene of the crime to frame Muslims for the attack.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, Far West Radio {{acquired}} the station. On August 9, {{the new owner}} changed its call sign to KRLV. [...] It aired a talk radio format for several years.

50|$|The Moe {{brothers}} {{were engaged in}} competition with the Kitsap County Transportation Company for dominance of the Seattle-Poulsbo route.

50|$|The Doyōbi was {{distributed}} by bookstores, with each store stocking 5 to 30 copies. To quickly boost sales, Saito delivered 20 to 30 {{copies of the}} Doyōbi to sponsoring cafés for free. The Doyōbis reputation then spread day by day, and many cafés <b>bought</b> and <b>put</b> the Doyōbi on tables. The Doyōbis circulation, which was 2,000 at first, increased to 8,000 at the peak. Nose and Nakai held editorial meetings at cafés like the Salon de thé François, which {{became the center of}} the Popular Front movement in Kyoto.|$|R
5000|$|The Cardboard to Caviar Project {{founded by}} Graham Wiles in Wakefield, UK is a {{cyclical}} closed-loop system using waste as a nutrient. [...] The project pays restaurants for their cardboard, shreds it, and sells it to equestrian centers for horse bedding. Then the soiled bedding is <b>bought</b> and <b>put</b> into a composting system, which produces {{a lot of}} worms. The worms are fed to roe fish, which produce caviar, which is sold back to the restaurants. This idea of waste for one as a nutrient for another {{has the potential to}} be translated to whole cities.|$|R

50|$|In March 1996 they <b>bought</b> WPAT and <b>put</b> a Spanish MOR format there, {{which would}} later grow to cover {{additional}} languages such as Korean. In 1997, Heftel restructured into Hispanic Broadcasters. They sold WPAT to Multicultural, and acquired WNWK from Multicultural.

60|$|Ice {{was very}} scarce that summer, and, as the wagons wound {{away from the}} opening of the shaft which led down to the glacier, {{carrying}} their loads to the nearest railway station, so money came to me; not in large sums at first, for preparations had not yet been perfected for taking out the ice in great quantities, but enough to enable me to go on with my work as rapidly as I could plan it. I set about renovating and brightening and newly furnishing my house. Whatever I thought that Agnes would like I <b>bought</b> and <b>put</b> into it. I tried to put myself in her place as I selected the paper-hangings and the materials with which to cover the furniture.|$|R
2500|$|In 1947, old-established (1860) {{privately owned}} Huddersfield gear and machine tools {{manufacturer}} David Brown Limited <b>bought</b> Aston Martin <b>putting</b> {{it under control}} of its Tractor Group. David Brown became Aston Martin's latest saviour. He also acquired without its factory Lagonda's business for its 2.6-litre W. O. Bentley-designed engine. Lagonda moved operations to Newport Pagnell and shared engines, resources and workshops. Aston Martin began to build the classic [...] "DB" [...] series of cars.|$|R
50|$|With this intention, two Dornier Do J Wal {{seaplanes}} were <b>bought</b> {{and were}} <b>put</b> into service for SCADTA. Services however {{were not as}} successful as planned, particularly because of the resistance of American authorities. The seaplanes were thus returned to Germany. The failure however became a golden opportunity for AeroLloyd to implement its own plans. A few months later two planes, one of them named Atlântico, were sent by ship to Montevideo and flown to Buenos Aires.|$|R
50|$|Working {{with family}} members, {{including}} his brother Edward Robert Kelly, and William Kelly {{who ran the}} printing press, Frederic Kelly expanded his directories to include cities and towns other than London, beginning in 1845. Over the rest of nineteenth century, his company <b>bought</b> out or <b>put</b> out of business several rival publishers of directories. The company branched into other publications, such as the Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes (1875). Well after Frederic Kelly's death, the company name Kelly and Co. {{was replaced by the}} new company Kelly's Directories Limited in 1897.|$|R
6000|$|Once {{upon a time}} {{a farmer}} planted a little seed [...] in his garden, {{and after a while}} it sprouted and became [...] a vine and bore many squashes.

[...] That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat [...] and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went [...] and bought it for her mother. She lugged it home, cut [...] it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it [...] with salt and butter, for dinner.

60|$|No sooner {{was this}} matter settled than Will took the coach to Fairham. Thence {{he drove to}} the village of Porchester, where Marie’s fiancé was confined. Here he put up at a little inn. He had, before {{starting}} from London, <b>bought</b> and <b>put</b> on the disguise of a countryman, as he could hardly have stayed in the village as a gentleman without exciting remark or suspicion. He had, however, brought other clothes with him, so that if necessary he could resume them, and appear either as a naval officer or as a civilian. His first step was to make a tour of the great wall which enclosed the castle and the huts in which the prisoners were confined. He saw at once that any attempt to scale the wall would be useless. At the inn he gave out that by the death of a relative he had just come into a few pounds and meant to enjoy himself.|$|R
5000|$|The risk of Deutsche taking large losses if the {{collateral}} was {{wiped out in}} a crisis was called the gap option. Ben-Artzi claims that after modelling came up with [...] "economically unfeasible" [...] results, Deutsche accounted for the gap option first with a simple 15% [...] "haircut" [...] on the trades (described as inadequate by another employee in 2006) and then in 2008 by a $1-2bn reserve for the credit correlation desk designed to cover all risks, not just the gap option. In October 2008 they stopped modelling the gap option and just <b>bought</b> S&P <b>put</b> options to guard against further market disruption, {{but one of the}} whistleblowers has described this as an inappropriate hedge. A model from Ben-Artzi's previous job at Goldman Sachs suggested that the gap option was worth about 8% {{of the value of the}} trades, worth $10.4bn. Simpson claims that traders were not simply understating the gap option but actively mismarking the value of their trades.|$|R
60|$|This {{undecided}} {{state of}} mind {{did not have a}} good effect upon her general appearance, and it was frequently remarked that her health was not what it used to be. Miss Nancy Shott thought there was nothing to wonder at in this. Mrs. Cliff had never been accustomed to spend money, and it was easy to see, from the things she had <b>bought</b> abroad and <b>put</b> into that little house, that she had expended a good deal more than she could afford, and no wonder she was troubled, and no wonder she was looking thin and sick.|$|R
50|$|Great Scott Broadcasting, who {{had also}} <b>bought</b> WSUX 98.5, <b>put</b> on a Classic Hits format, known as BIG-Classic Hits 98.5 & 101.7. The call letters were changed to WRBG to match {{the name of the}} station. In April 2001, 101.7 WRBG was broken off and flipped to Today's Hit Music B101-7 and the call letters were changed to WZEB. The station was {{targeted}} the females 18-49 demographic. Two years later, the station was paired with the WKDB for greater coverage area. On August 25, 2009, GSB cut the simalcast with 95.3 WKDB. In late 2011, WKDB brought back the simulcast of The B.|$|R
50|$|In March 2015, the Ministry of Transport {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} Alerce trains manufactured by the Emepa Group, the first train completely built in Argentina to run on the Belgrano Norte Line.

50|$|Laatsman {{received}} many testimonials came from pilots {{who had fallen}} behind enemy lines. For example, in Air Forces Escape & Evasion Society, Clayton and Ken dropped between the Zuider Zee and Kinselmere. Unseen by the occupants, they were found by the Schouten family who hid him. They then passed him on to the Dutch Underground. With the help of others, the Dutch-Paris line got him to Paris. When their Parisian agents were arrested, the men slipped away and walked south. At nightfall, they found a place to stay. The next day, French people <b>bought</b> tickets and <b>put</b> Clayton and Ken on a train heading for Toulouse.|$|R
50|$|Prior to Uganda's Independence in 1962 {{and through}} the 1960s and 1970s, Muyenga was an upscale {{residential}} area, {{on account of the}} excellent views and cool breezes. After the removal of the Obote II regime in 1986, there followed a period of rapid, unplanned and uncoordinated development of the real estate on Muyenga. As a result, it is an area with good houses but with a chaotic road and drainage system. Many of the property owners on the hill are from government and business who <b>bought</b> plots and <b>put</b> up expensive buildings without conforming to the rules of urban planning. Kabalagala, a neighborhood to the west of Muyenga, suffered from the same mismanagement of urban planning.|$|R
5000|$|In 1951, after Manny Duttenhofer's death, Ray and Frances Johansen of Twin Lake's South Shore Resort <b>bought</b> Michillinda and <b>put</b> an {{emphasis}} on modernization and innovation at the resort. One of their most notable new creations was the [...] "Evening Coffee Hour", which began a long-standing tradition of serving coffee and cookies at sunset. As Michillinda's reputation grew, it attracted the interest of local celebrities, including Nancy Fleming, who enjoyed a private retreat at the Lodge after being crowned Miss America in 1960. In 1965, the Johansens built a Chalet on the grounds to host evening programs, including a variety show on Friday nights; the same year, their daughter Judith married Don Eilers.|$|R
50|$|He was born, {{probably}} in Boucherville, {{the son of}} Jacques Trullier, dit Lacombe and Marie-Anne Levasseur, and studied in Montreal. In 1788, he married Angélique Laurent. Sometime between then and 1794, he {{established himself as a}} merchant in L'Assomption, involved in the grain trade and potash production. He also constructed several houses there and operated an inn. Trullier, dit Lacombe was a justice of the peace and served as a major in the militia during the War of 1812. His election in 1814 was appealed on the grounds that he had <b>bought</b> votes and <b>put</b> pressure on voters who owed him money; he was disqualified following an investigation. Michel Prévost won the subsequent by-election. Trullier, dit Lacombe died in office at L'Assomption at the age of 56.|$|R
