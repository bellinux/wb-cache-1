5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E

"Mutual Core" [...] was {{described}} as [...] "best" [...] and [...] "climactic" [...] by Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, which elected Biophilia as the CD of the Week, and [...] "literally volcanic" [...] by Heather Phares of Allmusic. Jim Fusilli of The Wall Street Journal stated that the track is [...] "earthbound". According to the Daily Mirror review, the track [...] "adds angry rebuke and glitchy distorted power chordings to the shimmering, ringing percussion and natural awe that feature on the astonishing tracks [...] "Virus" [...] and aptly named [...] "Crystalline"". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised {{the composition of the}} album and stated [...] "There’s something audacious and impressive about the way [...] "Hollow" [...] attempts to strike a weird balance between menace and calm, the vocals as lulling as the staccato backing is unsettling. Or [...] "Mutual Core"’s repeated shifts from a wheezing keyboard – it was doubtless built in a laboratory by the provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and professor Brian Cox, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like a 13th-century portative organ – to electronic bombardment". Möhammed Choudhery of Consequence of Sound analysed the use of Björk's voice in the album, stating: ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called [...] "Get Back" [...] a [...] "welcome girl-rock hit". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and said, [...] "She wrote {{this with the}} Jonas Brothers, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> more like a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or {{the sort of thing}} Greg Kihn was pining for when he sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'". Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does [...] "nearly everything Lovato touches". Masley concluded, writing, [...] "When she sings 'I {{want to get back to}} the old days,' what she means is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails." [...] Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an [...] "insidious, Go-Go's-like single".|$|E

500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, and neither does “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] was {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time on the season three finale of US The Voice. Mars performed the song with two piano players and no stage production except for blue lighting. Unlike, most performers he did not sing with a contestant from the show. Rap-Up considered that Mars [...] "rocked the stage" [...] during his performance, while EW's Hillary Bussis found the crowd to [...] "go crazy" [...] because of his lyrics or persuading Mars [...] "to ditch those Cee Lo shades". [...] He also performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on January 10, 2013. The performance had Mars with piano accompaniment. Kyle McGovern of Spin wrote that [...] "he swells and contracts with every new regret and heartbroken epiphany." [...] McGovern also stated, [...] "Mars might still be locked out of heaven, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like he's getting closer to the angels." [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was performed}} at The Jonathan Ross Show after an interview, on March 3, 2013. The song was performed at season five the finale of Let's Dance for Comic Relief, on March 9, 2013. On April 3, 2014, Mars performed the song live on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Carl Williott called the performance [...] "flawless". It was sung on the show Vivement Dimanche, on April 7, 2013. On May 26, 2013, the single was performed at the Radio 1's Big Weekend. [...] It was the twelfth song of his second and third worldwide tours, The Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013-2015) and 24K Magic World Tour (2017-2018), respectively.|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Ryder {{hinted at}} a {{possible}} {{return for the}} sequel as well by saying, [...] "I'm kind of sworn to secrecy <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like it might be happening. It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such {{a huge part of}} me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|... (emphatically) [...] "I don't {{listen to}} this (Mourning Has Broken). There is some mad guitar playing on there, some of the {{shredding}} is ridiculous, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> thrown together, {{which is why it}} shouldn't have had the Sabbat name on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Swedish actor Lars Ekborg, outside Sweden most {{known for}} his part in Ingmar Bergman's [...] "Summer with Monika" [...] made an album called [...] "I Tom Lehrers vackra värld" [...] ("In the {{beautiful}} world of Tom Lehrer"), with 12 of Lehrer's songs interpreted in Swedish. Lehrer {{wrote in a letter to}} the producer Per–Anders Boquist that [...] "not knowing any Swedish, I am obviously not equipped to judge, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> to me as though Mr Ekborg is perfect for the songs", along with further compliments to pianist Leif Asp for unexpected additional flourishes.|$|E
2500|$|Tracy E. Hopkins of Barnes & Noble {{wrote that}} the song [...] "won't wow too many fans with its nursery rhyme-like." [...] Spence D. of IGN was mixed, writing, [...] "The {{obligatory}} star power guest shot occurs with 'Call On Me' featuring Nelly. Janet goes for her delicate wisp, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> as if she's trying hard to maintain the crispness, straining to keep from cracking. Nelly delivers a slippery grind, making this also the obligatory 'time to get your sex on' number." [...] Don Baiocchi of Blogcritics was mixed, writing that [...] "to kick off a comeback with the mediocre 'Call On Me,' a duet where she actually makes Nelly sing, is just plain wrong. 'Call on Me' wasn't {{the way to do}} that." [...] He also noted that [...] "details like the tiny hand claps in 'Call On Me' are bizarre missteps." [...] Evan Serpick of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "it shamelessly re-creates 'Dilemma,' the St. Louis rapper's collaboration with Kelly Rowland." [...] Johnny Loftus of Metro Times was also negative, writing that the song [...] "falls flat." ...|$|E
60|$|Crosbie {{had seen}} him on first {{entering}} the room, and had seen every individual in it. He {{knew better than to}} omit the duty of that scrutinising glance; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> well in his line not to have observed Lord Dumbello.|$|R

5000|$|... "I {{ended up}} playing all the {{instruments}} {{on the record}} live and I {{had no idea how}} to play any records! I tried to program <b>it</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> cheesy. I ended up buying an electric guitar. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't us." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Miami" [...] has a trip rock style. It {{begins with}} a drum loop, with Mullen's hi-hats playing {{backwards}} through a very extreme equalization filter. Howie B explained, [...] "The main groove is actually just Larry's hi-hat, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like a mad engine running or something really crazy – about {{as far away from}} a hi-hat as you can imagine... the task in 'Miami' was to make it unlike anything else on the album, and also unlike anything else you'd ever have heard before." [...] Edge also comes in with a frenetic guitar riff and Bono's affected vocal style singing about Miami in metaphors and descriptions of loud, brash Americana. D. Leurssen described it as a [...] "sonic travelogue," [...] while the Edge termed it [...] "creative tourism." [...] In 2005, Q magazine included the song [...] "Miami" [...] in a list of [...] "Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists". However, Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine acknowledged the inclusion of the song in Q's list and said [...] "I’m pretty sure they gave this album some super-glowing review when it was first released, so clearly they’re not to be trusted in the first." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1994, {{the band}} issued a seven-track EP, Dick Sandwich. Its cover had [...] "a graphic {{drawing of the}} {{offending}} flaccid appendage draped over a sesame seed bun with lashings of bloody sauce." [...] Posters with a similar image that advertised the group had them banned at some venues. National youth radio station Triple J criticised the group as being immature {{and told them to}} [...] "grow up". The EP was described as having [...] "good songs <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like it was recorded under a doona" [...] and had the group banned from some radio stations and retail outlets. One of its tracks, [...] "I Wish I Was as Credible as Roger Climpson" [...] (aka [...] "Roger"), attracted attention of its subject, Roger Climpson – a Seven News anchor on TV – who posed with the group for a photo. The E.P also features fan favourites [...] "Chemotherapy", and a cover of the TV series theme [...] "Home And Away". The E.P featured an alternate cover depicting rabbits on the flipside of the liftout to appease record stores or people who may have been offended by the original artwork. In October of that year, they released a single, [...] "Sorry About the Ruse", on their own label, How Much Did I Fucking Pay For This Records? The group were the local support act on the Australian leg of separate tours by United States punk rockers Bad Religion, The Offspring, and Blink-182.|$|E
2500|$|The band entered Jackson Browne's private {{recording}} studio named Groovemasters in January 2006, after Panunzio had suggested {{it would be}} a suitable recording location. New Found Glory strove to achieve a [...] "clean kind of classic guitar sound" [...] when recording, using a Vox AC30 amp on almost the entire record. The amp, known for its [...] "jangly" [...] high-end sound, was used with several classic guitars in the studio including a Fender Tele, Les Paul, Gibson 335-S and a Rickenbacker. Gilbert enthused that, [...] "It sounds huge. When you put our old records on and our new record, there's actually less guitars on our new album, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> bigger." [...] Jordan Pundik likewise accounted; [...] "he [...] brought this classic vibe to it, especially with the tones he got. We learned we don't have to double-up 15 Mesa cabinets and make it all distorted to make it sound big." [...] Pundik also spoke of the band's desire to challenge themselves musically; [...] "Usually with every record we think, 'We’ve got to put the fast punk song on it or people won't like it', but this wasn't anything like that." [...] He did admit that around thirty songs were written, including some fast-paced songs, but were excluded as, [...] "(they) didn't really fit." [...] Steve Klein, the band's principal lyricist and rhythm guitarist, also praised Panunzio for helping the band bring new elements to their sound. Describing the sessions as [...] "best recording experience ever", he added, [...] "It's this empty mansion where we were able to set up all our equipment, we just woke up and wrote songs. We were really relaxed and able to set our own pace. Everything about the record is way more classic rock sounding because Thom has done a bunch of classic rock records like Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen and Ozzy, and {{the list goes on and}} on. He kind of brought this different element to our band. This disc is less guitar driven and more melody driven, more than any other of our records." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{these words}} Alonzo {{burst into a}} shout of laughter; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> so harsh and loud that Julia shrank away shuddering.

6000|$|... "Dee, dee, dee, chickadee! See me! See me!" [...] Tommy Tit the Chickadee {{kept saying}} this over and over, as he flew from the Green Forest {{up through the}} Old Orchard {{on his way to}} Farmer Brown's dooryard, and his voice was merry. In fact, his voice was the merriest, cheeriest sound to be heard that bright, snapping, cold morning. To be sure there were other voices, but they were not merry, nor were they cheery. There was the voice of Sammy Jay, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> peevish and discontented. And there was the voice of Blacky the Crow, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> harsh and un{{pleasant}}. And there was the voice of Chatterer the Red Squirrel, but Chatterer was scolding just from habit, and his voice was not pleasant to hear.|$|R

'It {{is better}} for me to beat the drum,' {{he thought to himself}} again, and so he began to beat <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> horrid, and an echo came out from the kiln that seemed almost like the howl of a wolf.

60|$|Imprimis, {{there was}} some sort of a dispute between New York and Chicago as to which town should give an {{exhibition}} of products to be hereafter holden, and through the medium of their more dignified journals the two cities were yahooing and hi-yi-ing at each other like opposition newsboys.

"I can't {{remember}} anything definitely until I {{woke up in}} that chapel," [...] Graham continued, [...] "but when they searched me {{and found that the}} pocketbook had gone, Fischer, the big American, muttered some woman's name.
