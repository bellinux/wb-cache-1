A compelling public speaker, <b>Butler</b> was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1853. He successfully ran for a Massachusetts Senate seat in 1859.

50|$|Along {{with these}} changes of scope and context, <b>butlering</b> attire has changed. Whereas <b>butlers</b> have {{traditionally}} worn a special uniform that separated them from junior servants, and {{although this is}} still often the case, <b>butlers</b> today may wear more casual clothing geared for climate, while exchanging it for formal business attire only upon special service occasions. There are cultural distinctions, as well. In the United States, <b>butlers</b> may frequently don a polo shirt and slacks, while in Bali they typically wear sarongs.|$|R

50|$|Following varied {{shifts and}} changes {{accompanying}} accelerated globalisation {{beginning in the}} late 1980s, overall global demand for <b>butlers</b> {{since the turn of the}} millennium has risen dramatically. According to Charles MacPherson, President of Charles MacPherson Associates and owner of The Charles MacPherson Academy for <b>Butlers</b> and Household Managers, the proximate cause is that the number of millionaires and billionaires has increased in recent years, and such people are finding that they desire assistance in managing their households. MacPherson emphasises that the number of wealthy people in China has increased particularly, creating in that country a high demand for professional <b>butlers</b> who have been trained in the European <b>butlering</b> tradition. There is also increasing demand for such <b>butlers</b> in other Asian countries, India, and the petroleum-rich Middle East.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Judith <b>Butler's</b> {{account of}} performative agency {{in relation to}} its critics, in particular, {{the question of whether}} <b>Butler's</b> thesis disavows materiality and thereby agency. These questions are answered by reading <b>Butler's</b> work through the work of Merleau-Ponty, in particular, by comparing <b>Butler's</b> account of performative agency to Merleau-Ponty's account of bodily intentionality. It is argued that a common ground underlies these featured concepts. I identify this common ground through the institution of the concept "simultaneity" to express a relationship of reciprocity between meaning and materiality through which ontological and epistemological significance is, reciprocally, sedimented and transformed; stabilised and destabilised...|$|R
