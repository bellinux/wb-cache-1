5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of darts in many superfamilies of the Stylommatophora, {{it seems}} likely that love darts {{appeared}} during the early evolution of the Pulmonata, and that the ancestors of the Stylommatophora possessed darts already.|$|E
5|$|From 1943 to 1946 {{he worked}} at the Los Alamos National Laboratory as a group leader for the Manhattan Project. He found in April 1944 that Thin Man, the {{proposed}} plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon, would not work <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of plutonium-240 impurities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of auxins in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can {{be applied}} as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of {{seedlings}} of various species of plants, including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it {{was used as a}} folk cure for tuberculosis, though it had no effect. In more recent times, it has been found that L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.|$|E
50|$|The city is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most European-fashioned in all Mexico, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{historic}} <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Spaniards and French.|$|R
50|$|Partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low-income {{group in}} Sham Shui Po, {{the area has}} bred many pro-grassroots politicians.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of their}} newer songs can be {{classified}} as surrealist <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequent <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> puns, word play, and unusual images.|$|R
5|$|Durio {{is often}} {{included}} in Bombacaceae <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of monothecate anthers, {{as opposed to}} the bithecate anthers common {{to the rest of the}} mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should actually be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesize that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).|$|E
5|$|French tirailleurs {{occupied}} the dominant positions, especially {{one on a}} knoll overlooking {{the square of the}} 27th. Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the tirailleurs. That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings, who lost two-thirds of their strength within that three or four hours.|$|E
5|$|George Tennant {{incorporated}} the southern section into his Tennant Canal. The northern branch over the Crymlyn Bog was derelict by 1918. It branches northwards in Crymlyn Burrows and terminates at the Crymlyn Bog nature reserve, now a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The SSSI covers {{an area of}} , and has been designated <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of fen and wet woodland habitats. It is also a RAMSAR site and a Special Area of Conservation. Rare flora and fauna include slender cottongrass, the fen raft spider, and groupings of rare and scarce invertebrates.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, Wicca [...] "found a {{receptive}} {{social environment}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-standing <b>presence</b> and familiarity of Aboriginal culture with its 'pagan' (i.e. 'non-Christian') beliefs and practices".|$|R
50|$|The {{flora and}} fauna <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siachen region are also {{affected}} by <b>the</b> huge military <b>presence.</b> <b>The</b> region is home to rare species including snow leopard, brown bear and ibex that are at risk <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military <b>presence.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{genes in}} {{mammalian}} genomes have CpG islands associated with <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gene (promoter regions). <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a CpG island {{is used to}} help in the prediction and annotation of genes.|$|R
5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of star spots combined with {{the rotation of the}} star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The codex, {{although}} displaying Mixtec stylistic features, {{is judged}} to be Maya (if genuine) based upon the use of bark paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Maya day signs and numbering. The Mixtec interpretation of the iconography may simply be due to incomplete knowledge of highland Maya iconography during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the second}} phase of expansion, the runway would be {{lengthened}} to , allowing jet aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 to land at Mysore Airport. The runway cannot be extended to the west <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of a railway line, while an extension to the east requires diverting National Highway 766. The State Government initially decided to hold off on this phase, preferring to wait until air traffic increased and the cost of diverting the runway was justified.|$|E
50|$|In the 2003 Columbia disaster, {{large parts}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{spacecraft}} reached {{the ground and}} entire equipment systems remained intact.

50|$|The {{fruit is}} an oblong drupe, yellow to white in colour {{and up to}} 6 mm long. However, the fruit appears greenish when ripe <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visible <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green seeds within. This feature {{gives rise to the}} {{specific}} name.|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BASC's <b>presence,</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} remained closely {{guarded by}} United States military guards, with access granted only to select members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four powers. This led to mysterious legends and ghost {{stories about the}} eerie, dark facility with its grand, granite statuary overlooking the beautiful park.|$|R
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of her son, Cupid.|$|E
5|$|Until {{late in the}} 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae {{was assumed to be}} over 30,000K <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E
5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} month, 659 emaciated Banabans {{were brought}} to Nauru from neighboring Ocean Island, which was also under Japanese occupation. They told the Nauruans about the drought in their land, which had become barren <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese <b>presence,</b> forcing them to eat grass and tree bark for survival.|$|R
40|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{researches}} {{focus on}} the secure and reliable communications in Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> <b>of</b> malicious nodes, unreliable wireless media, host mobility and lack <b>of</b> infrastructure. However <b>the</b> basic idea <b>of</b> forming an Ad Hoc network is utilizing the cooperation between nodes which becomes critical to maintain QOS. Nodes which are non-cooperative are called as selfish nodes. Not much {{work has been done}} to find <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> selfish nodes in a MANET. In this paper, it is proposed to evaluate <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> a network under <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> selfish nodes. Simulations are conducted using Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol to evaluate <b>the</b> performance degradation <b>of</b> MANET based on <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> selfishness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nodes...|$|R
50|$|In many Western Christian traditions {{including}} Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, and Anglican churches, {{the area}} around the altar is called the sanctuary; it is also considered holy <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> God in <b>the</b> Eucharist, both during the Mass and in the tabernacle on the altar <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|R
5|$|Da Matta, Andretti, and Franchitti contended {{for third}} {{position}} until the field closed up <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of slower cars. The third caution was shown fourteen laps later when Adrián Fernández lost engine power driving {{into the second}} turn, {{and he went to}} the bottom of the track on the backstretch to retire. Oil was laid on the track heading into turn two, and marshals were required to clean it. It was announced on lap 90 that Kniefel had reduced the number of laps to be run from 168 to 140 because of the danger from fading sunlight. All of the leaders (including Bräck) chose to make pit stops for fuel and tyres under caution on lap 100. Castroneves passed da Matta and Andretti around the inside in the pit lane and Newman/Haas Racing believed he had committed an infraction. The team informed CART of Castroneves' passing, which was observed by their co-owner Paul Newman.|$|E
5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of developing pin feathers.|$|E
5|$|In Tallahassee, Florida, on December 21, 1999, a {{memorial}} service is held for a former FBI agent named Raymond Crouch. His widow is approached by a mysterious man, Mark Johnson (Holmes Osborne), {{who claims to have}} worked with her husband. After the other mourners have left, Johnson returns to the funeral parlor, dons the corpse's clothes, and places a cell phone in the coffin. One week later, Johnson is monitoring Crouch's grave when his phone rings; he walks towards the grave with a shovel. Subsequently, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called in to examine Crouch's empty grave. They notice damage done to the interior of the casket; Scully theorizes that the scene was staged. A briefing is held by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who notes that Crouch is one of four former FBI agents whose graves have been exhumed; all four men had committed suicide. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of goat's blood encircling the grave, Mulder states that the crime was an act of necromancy. After the briefing, Skinner takes the agents aside and asks them to investigate Crouch's possible ties to the Millennium Group, which is now dissolved.|$|E

50|$|Occasionally, {{monitoring}} <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> {{a target}} program {{can help to}} highlight random errors that appear (or sometimes disappear) while monitoring but not in real execution.

5|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops under caution. Fittipaldi had his {{engine control unit}} and spark box changed on lap 17 after he {{reported}} a problem with his car. Bräck remained the leader at the lap-21 restart and {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Andretti began to reduce the gap between Bräck and himself between laps 31 and 33. Tagliani reduced his pace between the second and third turns on lap 42, and was ordered by his engineer to enter the pit lane. His crew removed his car's left sidepod and retired on the next lap with a battery problem. A second caution was necessitated on the 46th lap when debris was located in turn two. The leaders made their pit stops because of the mandatory pit stop window. Fittipaldi's car problem re-emerged on the 44th lap despite having his vehicle's coils and springs changed; he drove to the pit lane to retire because his team's mechanics could not rectify the issue. Franchitti stalled his car because of a clutch issue. Bräck maintained the first position at the lap-52 restart, followed by Takagi. Nine laps later, Takagi attempted to pass Bräck around the outside for the first position but was unable to complete the manoeuvre <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of slower cars.|$|E
5|$|Tagliani ran {{in sixth}} gear after his team {{ordered him to}} {{conserve}} fuel {{and was unable to}} generate enough heat into his tires to challenge Andretti on the restarts. On lap 87, Fittipaldi tried an overtaking manoevure on Junqueira around the outside of turn three which resulted in Fittipaldi and Junqueira making contact and both drivers slid into the outside tire barrier. Andretti's lead of 7.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when the eleventh (and final) caution was displayed on the next lap to allow course officials to extract Fittipaldi's and Junquiera's cars from the track. Racing resumed on lap 90 with Andretti retaining the first position and pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Fernández's radio had malfunctioned and was in another gear in an attempt to save fuel which allowed Tagliani to pass him for second. However, Tagliani was unable to close the gap to Andretti <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Junqueira's lapped car which cost him more than two seconds. He drove on the track's dirty side on the backstraight and his tires were cleaned in the next five turns on the track.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} routes towards Syria from Iraq, one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal (Now known as Skaka) {{and the other}} was through Mesopotamia passing though Raqqa. Since the Muslim forces in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, Khalid avoided the {{conventional}} route to Syria via Daumat-ul-Jandal because it was a long and would take weeks to reach Syria. He also avoided the Mesopotamian route <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> of Roman garrisons in northern Syria and Mesopotamia. Engaging them at the time when Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria, was also ruled out since it would mean fighting on two fronts. Khalid selected a rather shorter route to Syria which unconventionally passed though the Syrian Desert. He marched his army though the desert, where traditions tells that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water, before reaching a pre-decided water source at an oasis. Khalid is said to have solved the water shortage issue using a Bedouin method. Camels were made to drink water after intentionally denying them water for a lengthy time period, encouraging the camels to drink a lot of water at one time. Camels have the ability to store water in their stomach which in turn could be obtained by slaughtering them when necessary. Muslim troops rode entirely on camels and this method became an effective one for the Muslim army.|$|E

In 2003 Outside Magazine named Olympia one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best college towns in the nation for its vibrant downtown and access to outdoor activities.|$|R
50|$|The {{eggs are}} {{interesting}} <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> an external zone, <b>the</b> outer layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eggshell which is rare outside of bird eggs. If correctly interpreted, this would prove that Styloolithus in fact represents bird eggs. However, it cannot be proven {{to have an}} external layer until its shell is examined by scanning electron microscopy.|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. In the {{following}} thesis I use three post-apartheid South African novels, namely Ivan Vladislavi's The Exploded View, Marlene Van Niekerk’s Triomf and Kgebetli Moele’s Room 207, {{to argue for}} <b>the</b> persistence <b>of</b> geopathic disorders in post-apartheid Johannesburg. I use the protagonists in the novels and their intertwined relationships with setting as nodes through which to examine the complex and disordered place of this contemporary urban environment and {{to show how the}} city’s apartheid history informs the present. I suggest that these narratives portray conflicted instances of integration, inhabitation and navigation within this city <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> <b>of</b> historical forms and patterns which continue to colour <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> life within <b>the</b> changing city.
