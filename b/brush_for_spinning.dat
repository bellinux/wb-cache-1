40|$|Purpose: Routine toothbrushing is the {{principal}} method by which in-dividuals remove plaque and control plaque-related diseases, such as periodontitis and caries. Oral health care professionals generally rec-ommend at least 2 minutes brushing with an appropriate technique, and yet the average brushing time {{in the general population}} is closer to 45 seconds. Our understanding of the relationship between brushing time and plaque removal, in an untutored general population using a conventional manual toothbrush and dentifrice, is limited. The role of dentifrice in plaque removal is also unclear. Methods: This study was undertaken to measure plaque removal dur-ing untutored brushing over timed periods between 30 and 180 seconds with 1. 5 g dentifrice, using an Aquafresh Flex ® brush and Aquafresh Advanced ® dentifrice. Plaque removal after brushing without dentifrice was also determined (at the 60 second time point only). Forty-seven subjects participated in the study, in which plaque level was assessed using the Quigley-Hein (Turesky-modification) Index. Results: Plaque removal increased with brushing time across the range studied, tending towards a maximum at longer brushing times. At the extremes, <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 180 seconds removed 55 % more plaque than <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 30 seconds. <b>Brushing</b> <b>for</b> 120 seconds removed 26 % more plaque than <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 45 seconds. The use of dentifrice did not increase plaque removal during 60 seconds of brushing. Conclusions: Oral health care professionals should reinforce efforts to persuade patients to <b>brush</b> <b>for</b> longer periods of time, as increasing brushing time to the consensus minimum of 2 minutes from a more typical 45 seconds increases plaque removal to an extent likely to pro-vide clinically significant oral health benefits...|$|R
5000|$|Routine tooth {{brushing}} is {{the principal}} method of preventing many oral diseases, {{and perhaps the most}} important activity an individual can practice to reduce plaque buildup. Controlling plaque reduces the risk of the individual suffering from plaque-associated diseases such as gingivitis, periodontitis, and caries - the three most common oral diseases. The average <b>brushing</b> time <b>for</b> individuals is between 30 seconds and just over 60 seconds. Many oral health care professionals agree that tooth brushing should be done for a minimum of two minutes, and be practiced at least twice a day. <b>Brushing</b> <b>for</b> at least two minutes per session is optimal for preventing the most common oral diseases, and removes considerably more plaque than <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> only 45 seconds ...|$|R

This study was done to {{understand the relationship between}} brushing time and plaque removal, in an untutored general population using a conventional manual toothbrush and dentifrice. Methods: The present study was undertaken to measure plaque removal by brushing over time periods between 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 seconds with 1. 5 g dentifrice. (FULLSTOP) colgate 360 ° whole mouth clean tooth brush and Colgate total tooth paste were used in this study.

Results: The study showed increased plaque removal with increased brushing time,Plaque removal significantly improved while <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 180 seconds when compared to <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 30 seconds. Conclusions: Oral health care professionals should motivate patients to <b>brush</b> <b>for</b> longer periods of time. A minimum duration of 2 minutes or more should be advised to the patients instead of 45 seconds. Special emphasis should be given in motivating all patients to brush of 2 minutes or more for plaque removal.

This study investigated {{effects of these}} two oral hygiene factors on enamel remineralisation (measured as surface microhardness recovery [SMHR]), enamel fluoride uptake (EFU), and net acid resistance (NAR) post-remineralisation in a randomized clinical study using an in situ caries model. Methods Subjects (n = 63) wore their partial dentures holding partially demineralised human enamel specimens and <b>brushed</b> twice-daily <b>for</b> two weeks, following each of five regimens: <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 120 or 45 s with 1. 5 g of 1150 ppm F (as NaF) dentifrice; for 120 or 45 s with 0. 5 g of this dentifrice; and for 120 s with 1. 5 g of 250 ppm F (NaF) dentifrice. Results Comparing <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 120 s against <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 45 s, SMHR and EFU increased by 20. 0 % and 26. 9 % respectively when 1. 5 g dentifrice was used; and by 22. 8 % and 19. 9 % respectively when 0. 5 g dentifrice was used. Comparing brushing with 1. 5 g against brushing with 0. 5 g dentifrice, SMHR and EFU increased by 35. 3 % and 51. 3 % respectively when <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 120 s, and by 38. 4 % and 43. 0 % respectively when <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 45 s.
