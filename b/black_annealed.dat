40|$|Alloy 22 (N 06022) is {{a nickel}} (Ni) based alloy {{containing}} nominally 22 % Chromium (Cr), 13 % Molybdenum (Mo) and 3 % tungsten (W). Alloy 22 is highly resistant to general and localized corrosion such as pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking. Due {{to the formation}} of a stable passive film, when Alloy 22 is immersed in certain electrolytes, its corrosion potential (E{sub corr}) increases and its corrosion rate (CR) decreases {{as a function of the}} immersion time. This paper discusses the evolution of E{sub corr} and corrosion rate (CR) of creviced Alloy 22 specimens in six different mixtures of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium nitrate (KNO{sub 3 }) at 100 C. Two types of specimens were used, polished as-welded (ASW) and as-welded solution plus heat-treated (ASW+SHT). The latter contained the <b>black</b> <b>annealing</b> oxide film on the surface. Results show that, for the two type of materials, as the immersion time increases, E{sub corr} increased and the CR decreased.

40|$|The {{resistance}} of Alloy 22 (N 06022) to localized corrosion, mainly crevice corrosion, {{has been extensively}} investigated {{in the last few}} years. The effect of influencing variables such as temperature, applied potential, chloride concentration and nitrate inhibitor concentration have been addressed previously. At this time, it was important to address the effect an oxide film or scale that forms during the high temperature annealing process or solution heat treatment (SHT) and its subsequent water quenching. Electrochemical tests such as cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) have been carried out to determine the repassivation potential for localized corrosion and to assess the mode of attack on the specimens. Tests have been carried out in parallel using mill annealed (MA) specimens free from oxide on the surface. The comparative testing was carried out in six different electrolyte solutions at temperatures ranging from 60 C to 100 C. Results show that the repassivation potential of the specimens containing the <b>black</b> <b>anneal</b> oxide film on the surface was practically the same or higher as the repassivation potential for oxide-free specimens...|$|R
40|$|Alloy 22 is {{a nickel}} base alloy highly {{resistant}} to {{all forms of}} corrosion. In very aggressive conditions (e. g. hot concentrated chloride containing brines) Alloy 22 could suffer localized attack, namely pitting and crevice corrosion. The occurrence of localized corrosion in a given environment is governed by {{the values of the}} critical potential (E{sub crit}) for crevice corrosion and the corrosion potential (E{sub corr}) that the alloy may establish in the studied environment. If E{sub corr} is equal or higher than E{sub crit}, localized corrosion may be expected. This paper discusses the evolution of E{sub corr} of Alloy 22 specimens in 5 m CaCl{sub 2 } + 5 m Ca(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } brines at 100 C and 120 C. Two types of specimens were used, polished as-welded (ASW) creviced and noncreviced specimens and as-welded plus solution heat-treated (ASW+SHT) creviced specimens. The latter contained the <b>black</b> <b>annealing</b> oxide film on the surface. Results show that, for all types of Alloy 22 specimens the E{sub corr} was higher at 120 C than at 100 C, probably because a more protective film formed at the higher temperature. Specimens with the black oxide film on the surface showed more oscillations in the potential. None of the tested specimens suffered crevice corrosion probably because of the relatively high concentration of nitrate in the electrolyte, R = [NO 3]/[Cl] = 1...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the impact of {{fabrication}} processes on the localized corrosion behavior of Alloy 22 (N 06022). The four fabrication processes that were analyzed are: (1) Surface stress mitigation of final closure weld, (2) Manufacturing of the mockup container, (3) <b>Black</b> <b>annealing</b> of the container and (4) Use of different heats of Alloy 22 for container fabrication. Immersion and Electrochemical tests performed in the laboratory are generally aggressive and do not represent actual repository environments in Yucca Mountain. For example, to determine the intergranular attack in the heat affected zone of a weldment, tests are conducted in boiling acidic and oxidizing solutions according to ASTM standards. These solutions are used to compare the behavior of differently treated metallic coupons. Similarly for electrochemical tests many times pure sodium chloride or calcium chloride solutions are used. Pure chloride solutions are not representative of the repository environment. (1) Surface Stress Mitigation: When metallic plates are welded, for example using the Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) method, residual tensile stresses may develop {{in the vicinity of the}} weld seam. Processes such as Low Plasticity Burnishing (LPB) and Laser Shock Peening (LSP) could be applied locally to eliminate the residual stresses produced by welding. In this study, Alloy 22 plates were welded and then the above-mentioned surface treatments were applied to eliminate the residual tensile stresses. The aim of the current study was to comparatively test the corrosion behavior of as-welded (ASW) plates with the corrosion behavior of plates with stress mitigated surfaces. Immersion and electrochemical tests were performed. Results from both immersion and electrochemical corrosion tests show that the corrosion resistance of the mitigated plates was not affected by the surface treatments applied. (2) Behavior of Specimens from a Mockup container: Alloy 22 has been extensively tested for general and localized corrosion behavior both in the wrought and annealed condition and in the as-welded condition. The specimens for testing were mostly prepared from flat plates of material. It was important to determine if the process of fabricating a full diameter Alloy 22 container will affect the corrosion performance of this alloy. Specimens were prepared directly from a fabricated container and tested for corrosion resistance. Results show that both the anodic corrosion behavior and the localized corrosion resistance of specimens prepared from a welded fabricated container were the same as from flat welded plates. That is, rolling and welding plates using industrial practices do not hinder the corrosion resistant of Alloy 22. (3) Effect of <b>Black</b> <b>Annealing</b> Oxide Scale: The resistance of Alloy 22 to localized corrosion, mainly crevice corrosion, has been extensively investigated in the last few years. This was done mostly using freshly polished specimens. At this time it was important to address the effect an oxide film or scale that forms during the high temperature annealing process or solution heat treatment (SHT) and its subsequent water quenching. Electrochemical tests such as cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) have been carried out to determine the repassivation potential for localized corrosion and to assess the mode of attack on the specimens. Tests have been carried out in parallel using mill annealed (MA) specimens free from oxide on the surface. The comparative testing was carried out in six different electrolyte solutions at temperatures ranging from 60 to 100 C. Results show that the repassivation potential of the specimens containing the <b>black</b> <b>anneal</b> oxide film on the surface was practically the same as the repassivation potential for oxide-free specimens. (4) Heat-to-Heat Variability [...] Testing of Ni-Cr-Mo Plates with varying heat chemistry: The ASTM standard B 575 provides the range of the chemical composition of Nickel-Chromium-Molybdenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) alloys such as Alloy 22 (N 06022) and Alloy 686 (N 06686). For example, the content of Mo is specified from 12. 5 to 14. 5 weight percent for Alloy 22 and from 15. 0 to 17. 0 weight percent for Alloy 686. It was important to determine how the corrosion rate of welded plates of Alloy 22 using Alloy 686 weld filler metal would change if heats of these alloys were prepared using several variations in the composition of the elements even though still in the range specified in B 575. All the material used in this report were especially prepared at Allegheny Ludlum Co. Seven heats of plate were welded with seven heats of wire. Immersion corrosion tests were conducted in a boiling solution of sulfuric acid plus ferric sulfate (ASTM G 28 A) using both as-welded (ASW) coupons and solution heat-treated (SHT) coupons. Results show that the corrosion rate was not affected by the chemistry of the materials within the range of the standards...|$|R

40|$|Alloy 22 is {{a nickel}} base alloy highly {{resistant}} to {{all forms of}} corrosion. In conditions where tight crevices exist in hot chloride containing solutions and at anodic potentials, Alloy 22 may suffer crevice corrosion, a form of localized attack. The occurrence (or not) of crevice corrosion in a given environment (e. g. salt concentration and temperature), is governed by {{the values of the}} critical potential (E{sub crit}) for crevice corrosion and the corrosion potential (E{sub corr}) that the alloy may establish in the studied environment. If E{sub corr} is equal or higher than E{sub crit}, crevice corrosion may be expected. In addition, it is generally accepted that as Alloy 22 becomes passive in a certain environment, its E{sub corr} increases and its corrosion rate (CR) decreases. This paper discusses the evolution of E{sub corr} and corrosion rate (CR) of creviced Alloy 22 specimens in six different mixtures of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium nitrate (KNO{sub 3 }) at 100 C. The effect of immersion time on the value of E{sub crit} was also determined. Two types of specimens were used, polished as-welded (ASW) and as-welded plus solution heat-treated (ASW+SHT). The latter contained the <b>black</b> <b>annealing</b> oxide film on the surface. Results show that, as the immersion time increases, E{sub corr} increased and the CR decreased. Even for highly concentrated brine solutions at 100 C the CR was < 30 nm/year after more than 250 days immersion. Some of the exposed specimens (mainly the SHT specimens) suffered crevice corrosion at the open circuit potential in the naturally aerated brines. Immersion times of over 250 days did not reduce the resistance of Alloy 22 to localized corrosion...|$|R
50|$|At this point, {{the plates}} {{are covered in}} scale and {{therefore}} must be pickled. This involves dipping the plates in sulfuric acid for five minutes. The pickling turns the scales into a greenish-black slime which is removed via annealing. The plates are annealed for approximately 10 hours and then allowed to slowly cool. At this point the plates are known as pickled and <b>annealed</b> <b>black</b> plates. These plates were commonly sold for stamping and enameling purposes.|$|R

40|$|Alloy 22 is {{a nickel}} base alloy highly {{resistant}} to {{all forms of}} corrosion. In very aggressive conditions (e. g. hot concentrated chloride containing brines) Alloy 22 could suffer localized attack, namely pitting and crevice corrosion. Chloride ion {{is known to be}} the most detrimental aggressive agent for Alloy 22 and is able to promote crevice corrosion when tight crevices exist in hot chloride containing solutions of different concentrations. Nitrate ion is an effective inhibitor of chloride induced crevice corrosion when present in a high enough [NO{sub 3 }{sup -}]/[Cl{sup -}] ratio. The occurrence of localized corrosion in a given environment is governed by the values of the critical potential (E{sub crit}) for crevice corrosion and the corrosion potential (E{sub corr}) that the alloy may establish in the studied environment. If E{sub corr} is equal or higher than E{sub crit}, localized corrosion may be expected. This paper discusses the evolution of E{sub corr} and corrosion rate (CR) of Alloy 22 specimens in 18 m CaCl{sub 2 } + 9 m Ca(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } and 18 m CaCl{sub 2 } + 0. 9 m Ca(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } brines at 155 C. Two types of specimens were used, polished as-welded (ASW) creviced and non-creviced specimens and as-welded plus solution heat-treated (ASW+SHT) creviced specimens. The latter contained the <b>black</b> <b>annealing</b> oxide film on the surface. Results show that, in a few immersion days E{sub corr} reached a stable value higher than the open circuit potential of a platinum electrode in 18 m CaCl{sub 2 } + 9 m Ca(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } for all specimens tested. Specimens tested in this solution did not suffer any type of localized attack. On the other hand, E{sub corr} showed oscillations of up to 600 mV in 18 m CaCl{sub 2 } + 0. 9 m Ca(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 } during the entire immersion period. These oscillations were due to pitting corrosion development. Crevice corrosion was not observed in any testing case. Corrosion rates for specimens in the latter solution ([NO{sub 3 }{sup -}]/[Cl{sup -}] = 0. 05) were one order of magnitude higher than for specimens in the second one ([NO{sub 3 }{sup -}]/[Cl{sup -}] = 0. 5). Nitrate showed to be able to inhibit localized attack even in hot concentrated chloride brines when present in a ratio of [NO{sub 3 }{sup -}]/[Cl{sup -}] = 0. 5. Localized corrosion occurred only in condition where E{sub corr} > E{sub crit}...|$|R

Transmittance reduced as the concentration of carbon black in TiO 2 increased (i. e., increase in pore size). Currents and voltages (I-V) characteristics of the films were measured by a 4 -point probe. Resistivity (ρ) and conductivity (σ) of the films were computed from the I-V values.

40|$|MAPbI 3 with {{chloride}} additive is the suitable {{material for}} planar architecture of perovskite solar cells {{and it also}} have very good photoluminescence property. Addition of chloride ions highly enhances the carrier life time, diffusion length, crystal formation and film morphology in MAPbI 3. Different chloride based additives are highly crucial in deciding most of the physicochemical properties in lead based perovskite CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3. In the present study optimized quantity and nature of chloride precursor used for formation of large perovskite crystals with minimal disorder were explored. It {{was found that the}} addition of ethyl ammonium chloride (EACl) increased the crystal size, which is nearly twice (158 nm) the size of standard perovskite crystals (93 nm) having a preferential orientation towards the (110) plane. Photoacoustic studies demonstrated that the disorder in the perovskite crystals was highly reduced by the addition of the EACl precursor. The effect of the alkyl chain length of an alkyl ammonium chloride precursor on the crystal growth of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 was systematically investigated. In addition, we also used the different solvents in two step method with EACl to reduce the surface roughness of the perovskite layer. Recently, bismuth based perovskites with the structure (CH 3 NH 3) 3 Bi 2 I 9 (MBI) are rapidly emerging as eco-friendly and stable semiconducting material as a substitute for the lead halide perovskites. Relatively wider bandgap of MBI (~ 2. 1 eV) {{has been found to be}} a bottleneck in realizing the high photovoltaic performance similar to that of lead halide based perovskites. Therefore, we demonstrated the bandgap engineering of novel bismuth based perovskites obtained by in-situ sulfur doping of MBI via the thermal decomposition of Bi(xt) 3 (xt = Ethyl Xanthate) precursor. Color of the obtained films were clearly changed from orange to <b>black</b> when <b>annealed</b> from 80 ?C to 120 ?C with bandgap of 1. 45 eV, which is even lower than that of most commonly used lead halide perovskites. After successfully reduced the bandgap of the materials, the electronic properties of the material was also studied to find its suitability in the solar cells. The electronic properties such as carrier concentration, mobility, and carrier life time was found to be higher in sulfur doped MBI when compared to undoped MBI. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:生工博甲第 279 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 3 月 24 日 1.
