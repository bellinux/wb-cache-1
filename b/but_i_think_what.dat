500|$|Fincher and Savides {{used the}} {{photographs}} of William Eggleston, Stephen Shore's work from the early Seventies, and actual photos from the Zodiac police files. The two men worked hard to capture {{the look and feel}} of the period as Fincher admitted, [...] "I suppose there could have been more VW bugs <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> we show is a pretty good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle was built in the old post office in the Terminal Annex Building in downtown Los Angeles. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. Production began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, bringing the film in under budget, wrapping in February 2006. The film took 115 days to shoot.|$|E
500|$|Israel entered one golfer {{into the}} Olympic tournament. Laetitia Beck (world no. 237) {{qualified}} directly {{among the top}} 60 eligible players for the women's event based on the International Golf Federation (IGF) World Rankings as of 11 July 2016. This {{marked the first time}} Israel sent a golfer to the Olympics. Due to Israel's inexperience representing golf athletes, Beck was required to procure all of her equipment to prepare for Rio, such as her uniform and hats. Israel's Olympic committee reimbursed her for the equipment. [...] On the topic of representing Israel at the Olympics, Beck said [...] "I think its because of what my grandparents had to go through, not just my grandparents but everyone during World War II, all the Jewish people during World War II and the holocaust, that obviously brings me anger, <b>but</b> <b>i</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> i'm trying to do is bring the anger and try to do something meaningful." [...] Beck finished tied for 31st with a score of two over par. Her best round was the third round, where she was tied for 13th place.|$|E
2500|$|According to Loveless, [...] "...I {{learned so}} much about what to feel in a song from those years of playing those clubs. I was saddened {{sometimes}} because I thought 'I left Nashville, I left all that for this? What happened to me? What is wrong with me?' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> was happening was that I was beginning to find... me. Find who I really was. And {{what kind of person}} I was inside and out. I still believe to this day it happened the way it was supposed to happen.|$|E

2500|$|Cowell {{was once}} the fastest [...] "Star in a Reasonably Priced Car" [...] on BBC's {{motoring}} show Top Gear, driving a Suzuki Liana around the show's test track {{in a time of}} 1:47.1. When Top Gear retired the Liana along with its rankings after the eighth series, Cowell was the eighth fastest overall and the third fastest non-professional driver. On 11 November 2007 Cowell yet again appeared on Top Gear, achieving a time of 1:45.9 thus putting him ahead of chef Gordon Ramsay and back {{at the top of the}} table. His time of 1:45.9 was then tied with English rock singer Brian Johnson of AC/DC and Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud for the second fastest time, just 0.1 seconds behind Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay. In March 2015, Cowell backed Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson after he was suspended by the BBC for punching a colleague, with Cowell stating on Good Morning Britain: [...] "He's apologised. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> is quite obvious is that the public are behind him, but you know, that's Jeremy." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> Jeff {{liked best}} of it all {{was the sort of}} public {{recognition}} that it meant. He'd stand there in the shop, hardly bothering to shave, and explain to the men in the arm-chairs how he held her, and they shoved her, and he clung to her, and what he'd said to himself--a perfect Iliad--while he was clinging to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he reflected, [...] "they'll want to {{make the}} most of the darkness, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> they'll aim at chiefly is to get here unobserved. Therefore, I think they won't start until it's dark, {{probably}} from three or four different bases. That means they'll be here a little before dawn. I shall just motor my people up to Harrow and get back again by midnight." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{mean to say}} nothing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> please, you know, Mr. Helstone, {{both about}} France and England; and about revolutions, and regicides, and restorations in general; and about the divine right of kings, which you often stickle for in your sermons, and the duty of non-resistance, and the sanity of war, and----" ...|$|R

Only think of young persons going over to the Church of Rome. Why, they are just naturals!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took out}} the {{photograph}} and tried, as it were, to think of my father as alive and with his eyes open. I couldn't remember the eyes. Jane {{told me they were}} blue; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> she said was the sort of impression the face produced upon me. A man not unjust or harsh in his dealings with myself, but very strong and masterful. A man who would have his own way in spite of anybody. A father who ruled his daughter as a vessel of his making, to be done as he would with, and be moulded to his fashion.|$|E
60|$|When {{he left me}} I {{remained}} with a more kindly feeling towards him than I should have expected. He puzzled and interested me. And {{a few days later}} I met his wife. I knew they had been married for five or six years, and I was surprised to see that she was still extremely young. When he married her she {{could not have been more}} than sixteen. She was adorably pretty. She was no darker than a Spaniard, small and very beautifully made, with tiny hands and feet, and a slight, lithe figure. Her features were lovely; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> struck me most was the delicacy of her appearance; the half-caste as a rule have a certain coarseness, they seem a little roughly formed, but she had an exquisite daintiness which took your breath away. There was something extremely civilised about her, so that it surprised you to see her in those surroundings, and you thought of those famous beauties who had set all the world talking at the Court of the Emperor Napoleon III. Though she wore but a muslin frock and a straw hat she wore them with an elegance that suggested the woman of fashion. She must have been ravishing when Lawson first saw her.|$|E
60|$|I hear of a {{convention}} {{to be held}} at Baltimore, or elsewhere, for the selection of a candidate for the Presidency, made up chiefly of editors, and men who are politicians by profession; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>what</b> is it to any independent, intelligent, and respectable man what decision they may come to? Shall we not have the advantage of his wisdom and honesty, nevertheless? Can we not count upon some independent votes? Are there not many individuals in the country who do not attend conventions? But no: I find that the respectable man, so called, has immediately drifted from his position, and despairs of his country, when his country has more reason to despair of him. He forthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected as the only available one, thus proving that he is himself available for any purposes of the demagogue. His vote is of no more worth than that of any unprincipled foreigner or hireling native, who may have been bought. Oh for a man who is a man, and, as my neighbor says, has a bone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through! Our statistics are at fault: the population has been returned too large. How many men are there to a square thousand miles in this country? Hardly one. Does not America offer any inducement for men to settle here? The American has dwindled into an Odd Fellow--one who may be known by the development of his organ of gregariousness, and a manifest lack of intellect and cheerful self-reliance; whose first and chief concern, on coming into the world, is to see that the almshouses are in good repair; and, before yet he has lawfully donned the virile garb, to collect a fund for the support of the widows and orphans that may be; who, in short ventures to live only by the aid of the Mutual Insurance company, which has promised to bury him decently.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Deronda, {{looking at}} her coolly; [...] "I think that is quite excusable sometimes. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>what</b> you were last saying was {{altogether}} artificial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Polly Ann," [...] says he, very serious, [...] "I ain't a boaster. <b>But</b> when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{come through}} to git here, I wonder that I {{come back at}} all. The folks shut up at Harrod's said it was sure death ter cross the {{mountains}} now.

6000|$|... "You <b>think</b> so now, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> otherwise. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> {{did last}} night I did against your will, and that I can do again, only much more easily. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> had rather do it with your will, who work not for my own sake only, but {{for the sake of}} all of us. And now let us talk no more of the matter, lest we should grow angry." [...] Then he rose and went away.|$|R
5000|$|She added, [...] "And it's not ideological. Obviously, {{there are}} many {{commentators}} who have conservative, liberal, centrist, and everybody understands that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> {{is fair to say}} about FOX and certainly the way we view it is that it really is more a wing of the Republican Party." ...|$|E
5000|$|Klara Skrivankova, Trafficking Programme Coordinator at Anti-Slavery International, said: [...] "Slavery {{and this}} case {{which appears to}} be a case of forced labour is a reality in Britain today <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> it shows to us is that the police have finally been given proper powers in the new law that has been {{mentioned}} in order to investigate and really go after those who are still behaving like slave-masters in the 21st century." ...|$|E

We are not idiots about the {{commercial}} realities. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> happens is that we all identify what we are convinced is a sure-fire thing. It was a bestselling author and a mystery genre. But I was sort of surprised there was as much resistance."" ...|$|E
5000|$|In September 2009, Gardner {{was ranked}} {{as the top}} quarterback {{prospect}} in the United States by Rivals.com. He was ranked as the No. 4 quarterback nationally by Scout.com and the No. 5 quarterback in the ESPNU 150. In November 2009, Allen Trieu of Scout.com said of Gardner:"He {{is considered one of}} the top handful of quarterbacks in the country and is firmly entrenched as a five-star prospect. As far as upside goes, I don't see many quarterbacks that have his potential. He has improved as a passer, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> is overlooked is that he has gotten faster and has broken longer runs. We've also seen several times where he has put this team on his shoulders and pulled out victories in tough situations." ...|$|E
5000|$|Telling history through things, whether it's an Egyptian mummy or {{a credit}} card, is what museums are for, {{and because the}} British Museum has {{collected}} things {{from all over the}} globe, it's not a bad place to try to tell a world history. Of course, it can only be [...] "a" [...] history of the world, not [...] "the" [...] history. When people come to the museum they choose their own objects and make their own journey round the world and through time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> they will find is that their own histories quickly intersect with everybody else's, and when that happens, you no longer have a history of a particular people or nation, but a story of endless connections.|$|E
5000|$|All {{aspects of}} {{documentary}} filmmaking involve choice {{and are therefore}} manipulative.

5000|$|On March 6, 2001, Jaroff, {{along with}} Edward, James Van Praagh, Sylvia Browne, Paul Kurtz and Shmuley Boteach {{appeared}} on Larry King Live {{to discuss the}} article. Edward claimed {{the details of the}} article were completely wrong, and indicated that if Jaroff had simply asked, he could have cleared up any misunderstandings. Edward admitted the show was edited for time but not content. Jaroff reiterated that he had attempted to talk with Edward directly, but was denied access. When asked directly whether Jaroff thought Edward and people like him are frauds, he responded by saying, [...] "Yes. I'm willing to say two things.

The other band members have also said that the show would be much more laid back and intimate for the fans which would show a different side to Steps. Lisa also said, [...] "We're going to do a mix of the new album and also our classic hits, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> we would like to do is to actually have an alternative version with some of them so they're not necessarily the songs as you know them".|$|E
5000|$|During {{the first}} Democratic presidential debate in October 2015 the {{candidates}} were asked for their opinion of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.

He did—he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> he did in educating us should be taken into consideration." [...] Journalist Norman Solomon praised Sanders's reply saying, [...] "I think Bernie Sanders handled it the best in terms of scoping out and describing the terrain.
