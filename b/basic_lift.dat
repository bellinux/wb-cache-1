40|$|The {{principal}} {{topic of}} this thesis {{is the study}} of Riemannian submersions and Riemannian foliations of Lie groups. We classify Riemannian submersions of tori T with left invariant (hence bi-invariant) metric. In this case, the fiber through the identity F_e of the torus is a subgroup of T, and the submersion itself must be the coset projection T → T/F_e. Then we characterize Riemannian submersions f: G → H where G and H are Lie groups with left invariant metric. These are homomorphisms if and only if the <b>basic</b> <b>lift</b> of a left invariant vector field in H is a left invariant vector field in G. A similar theorem is proven to characterize antihomomorphisms. We then study a Ricatti equation associated with a Riemannian foliation, giving new proofs of several results of Walschap. We also give a relationship that must hold between the fiber dimension and base dimension of a Riemannian submersion, thus partially answering a question of Wilhelm. We then turn to the study of homogeneous Riemannian foliations. First we give a sufficient condition for a Riemannian foliation to be homogeneous, and use it to show that any Riemannian submersion of a compact Lie group with totally geodesic connected fibers is homogeneous if the fiber through the identity is a Lie subgroup. This is a result related to work of Ranjan Ranjan 2. Finally, we discuss the homogeneity of flat foliations of symmetric spaces of compact type, culminating in a proof that compact simple Lie groups with bi-invariant metric do not admit Riemannian foliations of codimension 1 with closed leaves...|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{relational}} models combine {{aspects of}} first-order logic, databases and probabilistic graphical models, {{enabling them to}} represent complex logical and probabilistic relations between large numbers of objects. But this level of expressivity comes at a price: inference (i. e., drawing conclusions on the probability of events) becomes highly intractable. Nevertheless, relational models of real-life applications often exhibit {{a high level of}} symmetry (i. e., substructures that are modeled in a similar manner).

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} the upper extremity (UE) {{at the level}} of impairments and related activity limitations and participation restrictions in people with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Methods The study was conducted using web-based questionnaires that were distributed amongst people with FSHD in the Netherlands. Eighty-eight respondents started the survey, and 71 completed it. The questionnaires covered the following dimensions: Function, Activity and Participation of the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health. Results More than 40 % of the respondents experienced pain in one arm or both the arms. Increased pain and stiffness scores and longer disease duration were associated with increased limitation scores. For <b>basic</b> activities, <b>lifting</b> the arm above shoulder-level was most frequently reported as most limited, coherent with the clinical picture of FSHD. Among the respondents, 50 % indicated restrictions at school, 78 % indicated restrictions at work and more than 80 % indicated restrictions whilst participating in sports, hobbies, household activities and romantic relationships. Conclusions This study has shown that alongside the well-known problem of lifting the arms above shoulder-level, UE activities below shoulder height during vocational and occupational activities are also problematic in patients with FSHD. Alongside disease duration, pain and stiffness are associated with UE activity limitations. Implications for Rehabilitation Attention is needed for pain and experienced stiffness in the upper extremity as it is frequently present in patients with FSHD. Rehabilitation professionals need to be aware that patients with FSHD not only experience problems with activities above shoulder height, but also with activities below shoulder height.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a class of ellipsoidal sets (ellipsoids and elliptic cylinders in Rm) which are determined by a freely chosen m×m positive semidefinite matrix. All ellipsoidal sets in this class are similar to each other through a parallel transformation and a scaling around their centers by a constant factor. Based on the <b>basic</b> idea of <b>lifting,</b> we first present a conceptual min-max problem to determine an ellipsoidal set with the smallest size in this class which encloses a given subset of Rm. Then we derive a numerically tractable enclosing ellipsoidal set of a given semialgebraic subset of Rm as a convex relaxation of the min-max problem in the lifting space. A main feature of the proposed method {{is that it is}} designed to incorporate into existing SDP relaxations with exploiting sparsity for various optimization problems to compute error bounds of their optimal solutions. We discuss how we adapt the method to a sparse variant of Lasserre’s hierarchy SDP relaxation for polynomial optimiza-tion problems and to a standard SDP relaxation for quadratic optimization problems.

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Mathematical modelling is widely used {{in the field of}} biomechanics. The traditional approach to investigate spine related injuries is to check the strength of the components of the spine. Spinal stability approach focuses on the force polygons formed by the body weight, muscle forces, ligament forces and external load. This force polygon is expected to stay within the boundaries of the spine to ensure stability. Proving the possibility of one force polygon within the spine boundaries proves the stability of the spine. This study focuses on the full curvature of the spine for spinal stability investigations in a lifting activity. An experiment has been designed to investigate the postural differences in males and females by measuring the full spinal curvature with a skin surface device. Distributed body weight force, with increased detail of muscle and ligament forces acting on the spine have been modelled by writing a code in Visual <b>Basic,</b> while <b>lifting</b> a load from the boot of a car in the sagittal plane. This model is flexible enough to reflect changes in body weight parameter. Results show that {{there is a difference between}} male and female postures during the full span of lifting activities. Application of individual muscle forces provides greater control of stability at each vertebral level. By considering the elongation of the ligaments and the force requirements of the muscle groups, it is possible to diagnose soft tissue failure. The differences in posture result in different moment arms for muscles and ligaments causing different loading on the spine. Most critical postures have been identified as the fully flexed postures with external load acting on the spine. Conceptual design ideas have been proposed to assist lifting a load from the boot of a car to eliminate the excessive flexion and loading on the spine...|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a {{systematic}} study of Sobolev, Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces on a noncommutative d-torus T^d_θ (with θ a skew symmetric real d× d-matrix). These spaces share many properties with their classical counterparts. We prove, among other <b>basic</b> properties, the <b>lifting</b> theorem {{for all these}} spaces and a Poincaré type inequality for Sobolev spaces. We also show that the Sobolev space W^k_∞(T^d_θ) coincides with the Lipschitz space of order k, already studied by Weaver in the case k= 1. We establish the embedding inequalities of all these spaces, including the Besov and Sobolev embedding theorems. We obtain Littlewood-Paley type characterizations for Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces in a general way, {{as well as the}} concrete ones in terms of the Poisson, heat semigroups and differences. Some of them are new even in the commutative case, for instance, our Poisson semigroup characterizations improve the classical ones. As a consequence of the characterization of the Besov spaces by differences, we extend to the quantum setting the recent results of Bourgain-Brézis -Mironescu and Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova on the limits of Besov norms. The same characterization implies that the Besov space B^α_∞,∞(T^d_θ) for α> 0 is the quantum analogue of the usual Zygmund class of order α. We investigate the interpolation of all these spaces, in particular, determine explicitly the K-functional of the couple (L_p(T^d_θ), W^k_p(T^d_θ)), which is the quantum analogue of a classical result due to Johnen and Scherer. Finally, we show that the completely bounded Fourier multipliers on all these spaces do not depend on the matrix θ, so coincide with those on the corresponding spaces on the usual d-torus...|$|R
