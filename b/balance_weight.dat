The review recommends that all sweeteners be consumed in moderation.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in September 1942, a {{steel strap}} was fitted {{internally}} across the rear fuselage transport joint, although this was soon superseded by Mod 286 (modification number 286), in which 20 alloy [...] "fishplates" [...] were riveted externally across the rear fuselage transport joint, while internally {{some of the}} rear fuselage frames were strengthened. This was a permanent measure designed to stop rear fuselage structural failures and was introduced on the production line from the 820th aircraft; between December 1942 and March 1943, all Typhoons without Mod 286 were taken out of service and modified. Modified <b>balance</b> <b>weight</b> assemblies were fitted from May 1943. Finally the entire unit was replaced with a redesigned assembly from August 1944.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the side}} rods (UK: {{coupling}} rods) of a locomotive can be completely balanced by weights on the driving wheels since their motion is completely rotational, the reciprocating {{motions of the}} pistons, piston rods, main rods and valve gear cannot be balanced in this way. A two-cylinder locomotive has its two cranks [...] "quartered" [...] — set at 90° apart — so that the four power strokes of the double-acting pistons are evenly distributed around the cycle {{and there are no}} points at which both cylinders are at top or bottom dead center simultaneously. A four-cylinder locomotive can be completely balanced in the longitudinal and vertical axes, although there are some rocking and twisting motions which can be dealt with in the locomotive's suspension and centering; a three-cylinder locomotive can also be better balanced, but a two-cylinder locomotive only balanced for rotation will surge fore and aft. Additional <b>balance</b> <b>weight</b> — [...] "overbalance" [...] — can be added to damp this, but at the cost of adding vertical forces, which are known technically as [...] "dynamic augment" [...] and colloquially as [...] "hammer blow". This can be extremely damaging to the track, and in extreme cases can actually cause the driving wheels to leave the track entirely. The heavier the reciprocating machinery, the greater these forces are, and the greater a problem this becomes.|$|E

40|$|A {{stationary}} and non-transient Markov chain may {{be defined}} by a <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> function or by its transition probabilities, and these are mathematically equivalent. But starting with <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> functions {{gives rise to a}} different and somewhat liberating attitude. Because these functions are additive, complexmodels can be built rather easily, and such functions arise naturally from weighted circuits. The idea of a <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> function extends to a multi-particle system called an induced field, in which each particle is influenced by the other particles as a function of their locations, and yet the invariant distribution of the system is still immediately available. This simplicity encourages the formulation of relatively complex models with the expectation that their invariant behavior will be available for interpretation and application. Three different and somewhat novel processes are created this way and for each the invariant distribution is given explicitly. These results may be of some independent interest as well as illustrating the method...|$|R

When all the eight gates close the sluice, the <b>balance</b> <b>weight</b> moves to the top of its swing and the float {{to the bottom of the}} well. The well has an inlet pipe of abbr=on 1 ft diameter from the reservoir that allows water in when the reservoir reaches maximum permissible level causing the float to rise, the <b>balance</b> <b>weight</b> to fall pulling the gates up allowing discharge of water.
