40|$|AbstractA 4 -year-old female was {{referred}} to our institution with acute pancreatitis due to a choledochal cyst. A protein plug {{was found to be}} deeply impacted in the main pancreatic duct. She underwent preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) followed by sphincteroplasty and extraction of the protein plug with a <b>basket</b> <b>extractor.</b> After the ERCP procedure, the patient successfully underwent total choledochal cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. In cases in which a huge protein plug is located deep in the pancreatic duct, therapeutic ERCP is useful as preoperative management for choledochal cyst excision with hepaticojejunostomy...|$|R
50|$|The Model 1910 {{differed}} {{in many ways}} from the previous M1909 design, that had been rejected by the War Department. The grip was changed from an 84 degree angle to 74 degree angle, which created a more natural grip when being fired from an outstretched hand. The M1910 was not manufactured with a mechanical safety mechanism by Colt, which was one problem the War Department saw in the design. Browning developed a type of relatively simple safety that could be retrofitted {{on the outside of}} the pistol, that would keep the slide locked in the forward position, and could be easily disengaged with a movement of the thumb. Another improvement was that the <b>extractor</b> <b>mechanism</b> was redesigned to fit on the inside of the slide, unlike the exterior extractor from the M1909 and other early Browning automatics.|$|R
40|$|Pattern {{recognition}} {{has become}} more & more popular and it induces attractive attention coming from a wider areas. Pattern recognition is able to describe the actual problems via mathematical models. In this paper, we are classifying various south east trees by the help of pattern recognition. The training data are the cone and needle length for which we can easily classify the corresponding trees. This paper reviews the basic pattern recognition procedures for classifying various trees by taking their patterns. feature <b>extractor</b> <b>mechanism</b> takes a possible non linear combination of the original variables to form new variables. c) A classifier: It classifies or describes the observations relying on the extracted features. The aim of pattern classification is to utilize the information acquired from pattern analysis to discipline the computer {{in order to accomplish}} the classification. The composition of a pattern classification system [1] is shown in figure 1. 2...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{occurrence}} of urolithiasis in pregnancy represents {{a challenge in}} both {{diagnosis and treatment of}} this condition, because it presents risks not only to the mother but also to the fetus. Surgical treatment may be indicated for patients with infection, persistent pain, and obstruction of a solitary kidney. We present our experience on the management of pregnant patients with ureteral calculi and a review of the literature. Materials and Methods: The charts of 19 pregnant patients with obstructive ureteral calculi were retrospectively reviewed. Gestational age ranged from 13 to 33 weeks. In all patients, ureteral stone was diagnosed on abdominal ultrasound. In regard to localization, 15 calculi were in the distal ureter, 3 in the proximal ureter, and 1 in the interior of an ureterocele. Calculi size ranged from 6 to 10 mm (mean, 8 mm). The following criteria were used to indicate ureteroscopy: persistent pain with no improvement after clinical treatment, increase in renal dilation, or presence of uterine contractions. Nine patients (47. 3 %) were submitted to ureteroscopy. All calculi (100 %) were removed with a stone <b>basket</b> <b>extractor</b> under continuous endoscopic vision. None of the calculi demanded the use of a lithotriptor. Results: Nine patients (47. 3 %) treated with clinical measurements presented no obstetric complications and spontaneous elimination of the calculi. Nine patients (47. 3 %) submitted to ureteroscopy had no surgical complications. There was remission of pain in all cases after ureteroscopy and ureteral catheter placement. Conclusion: The diagnosis and treatment of ureteral lithiasis in pregnant women present potential risks for the fetus and the mother. Conservative management is the first option, but ureteroscopy may be performed with safety and high success rates...|$|R

5000|$|The modern {{process of}} water removal by {{spinning}} {{did not come}} into use until electric motors were developed. Spinning requires a constant high-speed power source, and was originally done in a separate device known as an [...] "extractor". A load of washed laundry would be transferred from the wash tub to the <b>extractor</b> <b>basket,</b> and the water spun out in a separate operation. These early extractors were often dangerous to use, since unevenly distributed loads would cause the machine to shake violently. Many {{efforts were made to}} counteract the shaking of unstable loads, such as mounting the spinning basket on a free-floating shock-absorbing frame to absorb minor imbalances, and a bump switch to detect severe movement and stop the machine so that the load could be manually redistributed.|$|R
40|$|Pattern {{matching}} is a {{programming language}} construct considered essential in functional programming. Its purpose is to inspect and decompose data. Instead, object-oriented programming languages {{do not have a}} dedicated construct for this purpose. A possible {{reason for this is that}} pattern matching is useful when data is defined separately from operations on the data – a scenario that clashes with the object-oriented motto of grouping data and operations. However, programmers are frequently confronted with situations where there is no alternative to expressing data and operations separately – because most data is neither stored in nor does it originate from an object-oriented context. Consequently, object-oriented programmers, too, are in need for elegant and concise solutions to the problem of decomposing data. To this end, we propose a built-in pattern matching construct compatible with object-oriented programming. We claim that it leads to more concise and readable code than standard object-oriented approaches. A pattern in our approach is any computable way of testing and deconstructing an object and binding relevant parts to local names. We introduce pattern matching in two variants, case classes and extractors. We compare the readability, extensibility and performance of built-in pattern matching in these two variants with standard decomposition techniques. It turns out that standard object-oriented approaches to decomposing data are not extensible. Case classes, which have been studied before, require a low notational overhead, but expose their representation, making them hard to change later. The novel <b>extractor</b> <b>mechanism</b> offers loose coupling and extensibility, but comes with a performance overhead. We present a formalization of object-oriented pattern matching with extractors. This is done by giving definitions and proving standard properties for a calculus that provides pattern matching as described before. We then give a formal, optimizing translation from the calculus including pattern matching to its fragment without pattern matching, and prove it correct. Finally, we consider non-obvious interactions between the pattern matching and parametric polymorphism. We review the technique of generalized algebraic data types from functional programming, and show how it can be carried over to the object-oriented style. The main tool is the extension of the type system with subtype constraints, which leads to a very expressive metatheory. Through this theory, we are able to express patterns that operate on existentially quantified types purely by universally quantified extractors...|$|R
40|$|Loran is a radio-based {{navigation}} system originally designed for naval applications. We show that Loran-C’s high-power and high repeatable accuracy are fantastic for security applications. First, we show how to derive a precise location tag—with a sensitivity of about 20 meters—that {{is difficult to}} project to an exact location. A device can use our location tag to block or allow certain actions, without knowing its precise location. To ensure that our tag is reproducible we make use of fuzzy <b>extractors,</b> a <b>mechanism</b> originally designed for biometric authentication. We build a fuzzy extractor specifically designed for radio-type errors and give experimental evidence to show its effectiveness. Second, we show that our location tag is difficult to predict from a distance. For example, an observer cannot predict the location tag inside a guarded data center from a few hundreds of meters away. As an application, consider a location-aware disk drive that will only work inside the data center. An attacker who steals the device and is capable of spoofing Loran-C signals, still cannot make the device work since {{he does not know}} what location tag to spoof. We provide experimental data supporting our unpredictability claim...|$|R
50|$|It uses a turret {{that has}} a similar layout to the M109A1 155mm/39-cal {{self-propelled}} howitzer. The Iranian Defense Industries Organization claimed that the 155 mm HM44 howitzer manufactured by the Hadid facility of the Iranian Defense Industries Organization had a high firing rate and accuracy. It was described as being able to fire five rounds per minute. The gun's range was reported as 30 km, and it also includes features such as a laser range-finder and a semi-automatic loading system. The gun looks exactly like 155mm/39-cal M185 gun from M109A1 and is fitted with a double baffle muzzle brake, fume <b>extractor,</b> screw breech <b>mechanism,</b> hydro-pneumatic recuperator and a hydraulic recoil brake. It uses the Iranian-made Boragh APC chassis, a conversion of the either the Russian BMP-1 or Chinese Type 86 (WZ-501) IFV. It was described as being able to move with a speed of 70 km/h (43 mph) on the battlefield.|$|R
