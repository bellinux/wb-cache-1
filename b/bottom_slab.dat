40|$|Abstract. To {{obtain the}} seismic {{responses}} of typical subway stations in Beijing, a nonlinear {{analysis was conducted}} using a pushover method for seismic analysis and design of underground structures. The analysis mainly focuses on stress in columns and side walls and relative displacement between top and <b>bottom</b> <b>slabs</b> under 3 different levels of PGA (peak ground acceleration). From the analysis, the column shows good ductility due to its high ratio of reinforcement, {{and it has a}} good performance under strong motions. Compared with columns, side walls suffer from brittle failure and lose bearing capacity prior to column for its lower ratio of reinforcement. The calculated displacement indicates that the relative displacement between top and <b>bottom</b> <b>slabs</b> is linear proportional to peak ground relative displacement (PGRD). And compared with peak ground acceleration (PGA), PGRD is a more reliable design parameter of ground motion for underground structures. And the typical subway stations in Beijng can withstand the earthquake with design PGA up to 0. 2 g...|$|R
30|$|Zhang et al. [52] {{studied the}} {{influence}} of structural dimensions on structure-borne noise; their results showed that bridge-borne noise was negatively associated with slab thickness. The overall SPL at each field point was most sensitive to {{the thickness of the}} top slab, followed by the web and the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab,</b> respectively, possibly because the deck directly supported both the track structure and upper train load and transmitted them to the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> through the web. Overall, deck stiffness was the most important factor determining a bridge’s dynamic response under a running train and thus controlled the noise levels radiated by the structures. Hence, deck thickness could be reasonably increased for the purpose of reducing noise levels. Meanwhile, decreasing web thickness, especially that of the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab,</b> was a feasible noise reduction measure with sufficient carrying capacity; however, this had less influence on structure-borne SPL.|$|E
30|$|Chang [19] {{conducted}} a vibration test on a 25 -m-long, simply supported concrete box girder (top width: 8.5  m, bottom width: 4.18  m, girder height: 1.53  m) on Wuhan Urban Rail Transit Line 1. The measurement points were {{located at the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>slab,</b> web, and flange slab. The running train was a Metro C (dynamic axle weight: 13 t, trailer axle weight: 14 t) with four-car marshaling and running speed 50  km/h. The strongest vibrations appeared {{at the bottom and}} flange slabs, with the dominant frequencies of vibrational energy at 40 – 90  Hz. Gao et al. [20] tested a 25 -m-long, simply supported concrete box girder (top width: 9.0  m, bottom width: 4.3  m) from the Beijing Airport Fast Rail Line. The running train was a linear induction motor train with four-car marshaling and running speed 70 – 90  km/h. The vibratory velocity level of the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> had a dominant frequency range of 63 – 100  Hz, and the vibration velocities of the box girder’s web and <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> were about 20  dB smaller than that of the top slab.|$|E
30|$|Generally, the {{vibratory}} velocity {{levels of}} the web and the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> of the U-shaped girder are concentrated in the frequency range 32 – 64  Hz. As train speed increases, vibratory velocity level increases gradually, {{and the frequency of}} the maximum vibratory velocity also increases (e.g., from the frequency band centered at 40  Hz to that at 50  Hz). On the other hand, because of the open nature of U-shaped girders, the supporting effect of the two web slabs to the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> is limited. Thus, the vertical vibratory velocity of the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> is greater than that of the box girders, as shown in Fig.  1 a, b, and the lateral vibratory velocity of the web slab is also high. Thus, even at lower operational speeds, U-shaped girders are likely to radiate more noise than box girders. For example, the simulation results of Wu and Liu [22] demonstrated that the structure-borne sound power radiated from a box-section viaduct was slightly lower (by 2.5  dB) than that from a U-section viaduct. They concluded, considering the differences in train excitation and the acoustic measurement environment, that the A-weighted SPL measured from the U-shaped structure should be about 2  dB higher than that from the box-section structure under the same excitation and acoustic conditions.|$|E

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{has been used}} to study the boundary layer flow around three different bottom-fixed offshore wind turbine foundation designs. Two of the designs are gravity-based foundations, where one has a hexagonal <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> and one a circular <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> (bottom part). The third design is a monopile. Three-dimensional analyses have been performed with Spalart-Allmaras Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation using a Reynolds number 4 * 10 ^ 6 based on the free stream velocity and the diameter of the monopile, D. The boundary layer size is D in all the analyses. Time averaged results for velocities, pressure and bed shear stress were obtained. The dependence of the results on the mesh resolution was investigated and comparisons with published data were made. The results were found to be reasonably accurate. A distinct horseshoe vortex was found in front (upstream side) of the monopile foundation. Vortex shedding was present in the wake of all the foundations. Two smaller horseshoe vorticies were found in front of the hexagonal gravity-based foundation, were one was {{on the top of the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> and one was near the seabed in front of the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab.</b> Three horseshoe vortices in total were found in front of the circular gravity-based foundation, due to the presence of two horseshoe vortices near the seabed in front of the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab.</b> A large region of downflow exists in front of the monopile, reaching all the way down to the seabed. This causes a backflow in front of the foundation near the seabed due to conservation of mass. The gravity-based foundations were found to have two main regions of downflow, one in front of the cylindrical shaft (upper part) on top of the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> and a smaller region in front of the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> near the seabed. The gravity-based designs are found to limit the downflow near the seabed. Pressure distributions around the foundations were studied. A positive vertical pressure gradient was found in front of the monopile foundation. It was also found in front of the cylindrical shaft and in front of the <b>bottom</b> <b>slab</b> near the seabed on the gravity-based foundations. A larger volume of increased pressure exists in front of the monopile foundation than in front of the gravity-based foundations due to its geometry. The bed shear stress in the flow direction along the upstream symmetryline on the seabed was investigated. The horseshoe vortex size, measured as the distance from the separation point to the foundation surface along this line, was found to be 0. 40 D for the monopile foundation, 0. 125 D for the hexagonal and 0. 22 D for the circular gravity-based foundation. Bed shear stress distributions near the foundations were obtained. The magnitude of the bed shear stress, normalized by the far field bed shear stress, was used. A maximum value of 4. 89 was found near the surface of the monopile foundation at phi = +- 66. 5 degrees, where phi is the angle measured from the stagnation point in front of the foundation. Similarly, 2. 86 at phi = +- 60. 1 was found for the hexagonal gravity-based foundation. The larger values of the hexagonal foundation are concentrated around the corners at phi = +- 60 degrees, and the rest of the seabed has shear stresses close to the far field shear stress. The results of the circular foundations were found to be slightly asymmetric, with a maximum value of 2. 59 at phi = 68. 9 degrees for the upper distribution (for positive phi) and 2. 72 at phi = - 85. 4 degrees for the lower (for negative phi) ...|$|E

If the concrete reaches a certain age, the tensile stress does not cause creaks in the cross-section. The shrinkage stress changes with the moisture gradient in the box section.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{simulating}} the structural response of composite bridges with corrugated steel webs. Numerical modelling methods with various model dimensionalities {{have been widely used}} in the simulation of this type of structure. Among these methods, one-dimensional finite element model can satisfactorily capture the general reponse but it fails to give the stress result in the structure, which is necessary for refinement design. Also, the intensive computation and convergence issue of 3 D solid model make this model less attractive, though it might be more capable of accurately simulating the local response of composite bridges. The spatial grid model is proposed as a simple but accurate solution to model the general and local responses of the composite bridges with corrugated steel webs. In this model, top <b>slabs,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>slabs</b> and webs are characterized by orthogonal beam elements, wherein the stiffness of these beam elements are determined by the principle of equivalent displacements. For simplicity, the corrugated steel webs were modelled by steel plates of the same depth as the original webs. The folding effect of the corrugated steel webs was simulated by the reduction of the elastic moduli of the longitudinal element for webs. Thorough comparison was carried out between the proposed model and 3 D solid model in terms of the vertical displacements, normal stresses, shear stresses under various loading cases. The shear lag effect in the concrete slabs was also investigated by the proposed model. The result verifies the applicability and precision of the proposed method in the refinement design of composite bridges with corrugated steel webs. Postprint (published version...|$|R

The horizontal and vertical stress distribution and chambers displacement under the radial force are respectively researched. The results show that appropriate size should be used in the angle between both sides and the end of a box beam with a large span; the box beam lower, the girder webs bending stress generated by the radial force greater; the bending stress of the webs weakens their own principal stress state.
