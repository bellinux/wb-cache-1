5|$|Adult {{birds in}} Asia can be {{confused}} with the similar lesser whistling duck, although that species is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E
5|$|P. c. capitalis {{is found}} in the {{southern}} Rocky Mountains from eastern Idaho, south-central Montana, and western and southern Wyoming south through eastern Utah, and western and central Colorado, to east-central Arizona and north-central New Mexico. American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird described this subspecies in 1873. It has a wholly whitish head with a pale band on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> and overall more ashy grey plumage. It is also generally larger than the nominate subspecies canadensis.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hixon was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In his letter to the editor, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to the forehead and <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could then be used to determine the distance in two dimensions.|$|E

5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} has a {{dark brown}} or black coat which is slightly paler {{in summer and}} coarser and shaggier in the winter. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-coloured fur. Males are darker than females. They have bushy and dark-tipped manes that, as in the blue wildebeest, stick up from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> The hairs which compose this are white or cream-coloured with dark tips. On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair. It also has long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly. Other physical features include a thick neck, a plain back, and rather small and beady eyes.|$|E
5|$|Three {{losses in}} four games, capped by a 5–0 defeat against the Boston Bruins on March 27 left the Flames six points {{out of the}} eighth and final playoff spot with seven games remaining. The team also lost second-line centre Daymond Langkow after he {{was taken off the}} ice on a {{stretcher}} in Minnesota after being struck in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> by a slapshot. However, a 5–3 road victory against the Eastern Conference leading Washington Capitals and a 2–1 home win against the Phoenix Coyotes, coupled with the Colorado Avalanche losing six of their final seven games to end the month of March, left the Flames two points behind the Avalanche heading into April.|$|E

5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} (Podiceps nigricollis), known in North America as the eared grebe, {{is a member}} of the grebe family of water birds. It was {{described}} in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. There are currently three accepted subspecies, including the nominate subspecies. Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage that extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. When in its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest of the body is a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. The subspecies californicus can be distinguished from the nominate by the former's usually longer bill. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, can be differentiated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its smaller size. P. n. gurneyi can also be told apart by its lack of a non-breeding plumage. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.|$|E

25|$|There are ten {{cervical}} vertebrae in {{the neck}} of Xingxiulong. The proatlas, an atrophied vertebra positioned {{in front of the}} atlas, is bounded in front by top sides of the foramen magnum. While it is difficult to say much about the atlas itself due to damage, the immediately following axis has a relatively short centrum, which is slightly compressed on its sides and bottom. Overall, the remainder of the cervical vertebrae are relatively short, being only 2.5 to 3 times {{as long as they are}} tall; they become increasingly shorter towards the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> like Lufengosaurus. Other basal sauropodomorphs, including Jingshanosaurus, have cervical vertebrae that are generally 3 to 4 times as long as they are tall. On the bottom of the centra of cervical vertebrae 4-9, there is a prominent keel as in Lufengosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, and other basal sauropodomorphs. Near the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> the neural spines become somewhat table-like.|$|E
