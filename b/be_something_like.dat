25|$|At {{many places}} in the Gigantomachy frieze, other Greek works of art can be {{recognized}} as having served as models. For example, Apollo with his idealized stance and good looks recalls a classical statue by the sculptor Leochares, produced about 150 years before the frieze and famous already in antiquity; a Roman copy has survived {{and is now in}} the Vatican Museum (The Belvedere Apollo). The important group which includes Zeus and Athena moving in opposite directions recalls the scene showing the struggle between Athena and Poseidon on the western pediment of the Parthenon. Such allusions are not accidental since Pergamon considered itself to <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a reborn Athens.|$|E
25|$|Often, when {{counting}} objects, {{one does}} not {{keep track of what}} numerical label corresponds to which object: one only keeps track of the subgroup of objects which have already been labeled, so as to be able to identify unlabeled objects necessary for Step 2. However, if one is counting persons, then one can ask the persons who are being counted to each keep track of the number which the person's self has been assigned. After the count has finished it is possible to ask the group of persons to file up in a line, in order of increasing numerical label. What the persons would do during the process of lining up would <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this: each pair of persons who are unsure of their positions in the line ask each other what their numbers are: the person whose number is smaller should stand on the left side and the one with the larger number {{on the right side of}} the other person. Thus, pairs of persons compare their numbers and their positions, and commute their positions as necessary, and through repetition of such conditional commutations they become ordered.|$|E

500|$|The casting of American {{actor and}} comedian Robin Williams as the Genie {{inspired}} {{the studio to}} recruit similarly talented voice actors capable of matching his pace. The filmmakers had originally envisioned Jasmine's voice as {{similar to that of}} actress Lauren Bacall. Jasmine's speaking voice is provided by American actress Linda Larkin. The role was only one of several auditions Larkin had scheduled during the same week in which she auditioned for Aladdin, and she originally underestimated the scope of the project, joking, [...] "I {{thought it was going to}} <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> Duck Tales (sic)". Initially presented with only a few pages of the screenplay, Larkin found that she was particularly drawn to Jasmine's [...] "spirit of activism", in addition to the ways in which character was both similar to and different from previous Disney heroines. Princesses Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora had been childhood favorites of the actress. Larkin's first audition was held in a Burbank, California recording studio, in which she performed solely for the film's casting director. The side used for Larkin's first audition was the scene in which Jasmine meets Aladdin in the marketplace – their first encounter. Jasmine's line [...] "It's all so magical" [...] helped convince Larkin that she was [...] "meant" [...] to voice the character. Although Larkin's voice was significantly different from what the filmmakers had originally envisioned for the character, her interpretation gradually changed their minds.|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band.

McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E
