2500|$|In late January 1944, the US Army Air Corps adapted a new {{strategy}} for P-47s to escort bombing runs as they returned from their missions. The first attempted mission, on 24 January, was disrupted by bad weather. On 29 January, 13 P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang fighter groups escorted a bombing mission of B-17 Flying Fortresses to Frankfurt, Germany, and Whisner was among the pilots in the group. German aircraft launched heavy resistance against the bombing, {{and it would be}} the first time he could engage enemy aircraft. Whisner and the 352nd Fighter Group joined the mission over Namur, Belgium, as the bomber group was already under attack. Whisner, who was the wingman of Captain George Preddy, joined the chaotic battle, and within 10 minutes Whisner spotted two Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters which had just shot down a B-17. Whisner pursued one of the Fw 190s down to , pursuing it closely as it attempted evasive maneuvers. As the Fw 190 attempted to dive behind a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> Whisner struck it with three bursts from his machine gun, and it descended to [...] before its pilot bailed out. By the end of the day, The American pilots claimed 47 German aircraft destroyed and 5 probables, losing 14 of their own.|$|E
60|$|Then I looked, {{following}} his glance, and saw many leagues {{way across the}} water two snowclad peaks rising above a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|E
60|$|The sunset was gorgeous. The mass <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> {{broke and}} rolled. There was {{exquisite}} golden {{light on the}} peaks, and many rose- and violet-hued <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud.</b>|$|R
60|$|Towards evening, low <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> {{were seen}} to the south, {{and the sky}} looked dim and misty in the {{opposite}} direction.|$|R
60|$|The next land {{we saw was}} Wales. It {{was high}} noon, and {{a long line of}} purple {{mountains}} lay like <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> against the east.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then the}} full moon {{appeared}} out of a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> and as it rose higher, flooding the world with light, Jeekie's spirits rose also.|$|E
60|$|From {{behind a}} <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> the pale, {{crescent}} moon suddenly emerged {{and threw a}} faint silvery light on the now deserted scene of the dastardly outrage.|$|E
60|$|At daybreak {{they were}} on the way again. The sun had come up, but soon it was hidden by a heavy <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> and then the snowflakes {{commenced}} to fall.|$|E
60|$|A {{slight breeze}} had sprung up {{within the last}} half-hour, and had succeeded in chasing away the heavy <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> which had hung over the sky earlier in the evening.|$|R
60|$|Josey {{looked in}} the {{direction}} in which they were going, which was towards the south-west, and he saw a long, white <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud,</b> extending over that quarter of the heavens.|$|R
60|$|The sun was sinking {{over the}} distant hills. Already it was shorn of its beams, a globe of ruddy gold, {{hanging over the}} great <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> that would {{presently}} engulf it.|$|R
60|$|The bright hot morning {{had changed}} slowly to a grey, oppressive afternoon; a heavy <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> {{with the yellow}} tinge of coming thunder, had risen in the south, and was {{creeping}} up.|$|E
60|$|In the hot, sultry morning Yaqui {{appeared}} at camp, after {{long hours of}} absence, and he pointed with a long, dark arm toward the west. A <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> was rising above the mountain barrier.|$|E
60|$|Profound {{silence was}} {{maintained}} until {{the other end}} of the lake was reached, when the moon came out from a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> and enabled the girl to find the reedy source of the little river without difficulty.|$|E
60|$|The air {{was close}} and oppressive; fitful flashes of heat {{lightning}} shimmered {{here and there}} over the heavy <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> on the horizon; little wavelets sobbed {{at the base of}} the rocks.|$|R
60|$|Another breathless climb {{brought our}} adventurers {{to a third}} landing {{where there was a}} rift in the mountain. On peering out all they could see was rolling <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> so thick that they {{obscured}} all else.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something's surely coming," [...] Devine replied, {{glancing at}} a great <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> that had changed its color to an oily black. [...] "If this weather holds for another week, the crop will be wiped out, but somehow I can't believe we'll all go broke." ...|$|R
60|$|What ho! a {{dark and}} heavy <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds!</b> whence come ye, ye disturbers of the moon's serenity? Nay! but {{we are in a}} hurry, the wind drives us at breathless speed, we cannot stay to explain whence we have come.|$|E
60|$|He {{was tired}} and I was ready to drop, and those last few miles were long. We reached the {{outskirts}} of the town perhaps a couple of hours before sundown. A <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> had spread out of the west and threatened rain.|$|E
60|$|In the {{distance}} {{the sound of}} repeated firing was heard. Chauvelin tried to peer along the beach below, but {{as luck would have}} it, the fitful moon once more hid her light behind a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> and he could see nothing.|$|E
60|$|The winter {{had been}} slow in coming, {{but it had}} come at last. An icy wind blew from across the sea. Overhead the sky was the colour of lead and great <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> chased one another wantonly above the hills that tower over Jerusalem.|$|R
60|$|She {{understood}} {{enough not}} to raise her head. Lessingham was gazing out through the chaotic shadows <b>of</b> the distant <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> from which the moon was rising. Already the pain had begun, and yet with it was that queer sense of exaltation which comes with sacrifice.|$|R
60|$|Then {{followed}} a sad scene of altercation; interrupted at last {{by a sudden}} loud roaring of the sea. Rushing to the deck, they beheld themselves sweeping head-foremost toward a shoal making out from a cluster of low islands, hitherto, by <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds,</b> shrouded from view.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ship rolling {{heavily in}} a high cross swell," [...] he began again, and commented to himself, [...] "Heavily is no word for it." [...] Then he wrote: [...] "Sunset threatening, with a low <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> to N. and E. Sky clear overhead." ...|$|E
60|$|Her cheeks {{no longer}} glowed, they seemed pale and {{transparent}} {{like those of}} an ascetic; her lips were slightly parted, her eyes appeared unconscious of everything round her, and gazing at something enchanting beyond that <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> which glimmered, snow-white, through the trees.|$|E
60|$|This {{advice was}} followed, but try their {{best they could}} not locate their camp, {{although}} they saw Firefly Lake at a distance {{to the south of}} them. The sun was setting behind a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> and soon it grew positively black beneath the trees.|$|E
60|$|While she was {{speaking}} the sun descended behind a <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> heavy <b>clouds.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of Rice Stadium, showing the graded incline {{down to the}} football field. Construction workers are visible, with {{only a small portion}} of the bleachers already in place. Hermann Hospital can be seen in the upper left-hand distance, along with large <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds.</b> Original resource is a black and white photograph...|$|R
60|$|It {{was blowing}} now in short {{frequent}} puffs, which ruffled {{the surface of}} the water, and caused the Black Eagle to surge slowly forward over the rollers. A few drops of rain came pattering down upon the deck. The great <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> was above the ship, still hurrying wildly across the heavens.|$|R
60|$|The moon {{peered out}} from beneath the <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> which had {{obscured}} her for so long; smiling, she drew her pencilled silver lines {{along the edge of}} towers and pinnacles, the frowning Beffroi and those stony walls which seemed to Marguerite as if they encircled a gigantic graveyard.|$|E
60|$|At last Dominick awoke with a long-drawn sigh, and, {{raising his}} head, {{looked over the}} side of the boat. An exclamation of {{surprise}} and joy broke from him, for there, like a speck, where something like a heavy <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> rested on the horizon, was the long-expected sail.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite gazed upward {{with a more}} calm {{feeling that}} was akin to gratitude. That pale light, though so wan and feeble, was thrice welcome after that inky {{blackness}} wherein shadows were less dark than the lights. She watched eagerly the <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds</b> driven by the dying gale.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was behind}} the banks--the <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud,</b> you know," [...] he went on, a little wistfully. [...] "I {{think that that was}} one of the few moments in my life when I peered out of my prison-house. I must have known what was coming. I must have remembered afterwards--for I came here." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{increasing}} daylight {{showed them}} that the <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> was spreading quickly over the sky towards the zenith, while a soft hissing sound told of the approaching wind. Soon the blackness on the sea intensified, and white gleams as of flashing light showed where the waves were torn into foam by the rushing wind.|$|R
60|$|Many {{faces were}} turned towards the East just then, for the rising sun, tearing with one {{gigantic}} sweep the <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> asunder, now displayed his magnificence in a gorgeous immensity of flaming crimson. The sea, in response, turned to liquid fire beneath the glow, whilst the whole sky was irradiated {{with the first}} blush of morning.|$|R
