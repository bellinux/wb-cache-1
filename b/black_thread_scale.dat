50|$|Blackwork, {{sometimes}} historically termed Spanish blackwork, {{is a form}} of embroidery generally using <b>black</b> <b>thread,</b> {{although other}} colors are also used on occasion. Sometimes it is counted-thread embroidery which is usually stitched on even-weave fabric. Any <b>black</b> <b>thread</b> can be used, but firmly twisted threads give a better look than embroidery floss. Traditionally blackwork is stitched in silk thread on white or off-white linen or cotton fabric. Sometimes metallic threads or coloured threads are used for accents.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 90 - 92) This study {{compared the}} strength (single strand/loop breaking load and breaking elongation), shrinkage, and seam strength of nine brands of all-purpose polyester home sewing threads to 1) determine {{differences among the}} various brands, between the types, among the white <b>threads</b> and <b>black</b> <b>threads</b> of each brand, and between the white <b>threads</b> and <b>black</b> <b>threads</b> of each type, and 2) ascertain whether any associations exist between thread strength, shrinkage, and/or seam strength and the thread variables of twist, diameter, breaking load and breaking elongation. Microscopic examination revealed that two brands were core spun and seven were tow spun type threads. Data resulting from the standard testing procedures were tested statistically by analysis of variance or the Student's "t" test. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differences occurred among and within both the brands {{and the types of}} thread. Single strand breaking load varied significantly only among the tow spun <b>black</b> <b>threads.</b> The loop breaking strength of the tow spun threads was greater than that of the core spun threads. The core spun <b>black</b> <b>threads</b> were stronger than the core spun white threads in loop breaking strength. The core spun threads had the higher single strand breaking elongation. A significant variation in single strand elongation occurred among the white <b>threads</b> and the <b>black</b> <b>threads</b> of both the tow spun and core spun threads. Variation in loop breaking elongation existed among the brands. Variation in loop breaking elongation also occurred among the white tow spun threads and between the <b>black</b> core spun <b>threads.</b> The core spun threads exhibited more shrinkage than the tow spun threads. Seams sewn with the white tow spun threads were stronger than those sewn with the white core spun thread. Significant correlations resulted between three variables: single strand breaking load and loop breaking load, single strand breaking load and diameter, and diameter and yarn number...|$|R

5000|$|Tartan is {{recorded}} by counting the threads of each colour {{that appear in}} the sett. The thread count not only describes {{the width of the}} stripes on a sett, but also the colours used. For example, the thread count [...] "K4 R24 K24 Y4" [...] corresponds to 4 <b>black</b> <b>threads,</b> 24 red <b>threads,</b> 24 <b>black</b> <b>threads,</b> 4 yellow threads. The first and last threads of the thread count are the pivot points. Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6 inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a necktie. In this case the thread count has to be reduced in proportion (about 3 inches).|$|R

5000|$|Babubhai was {{a regular}} art {{director}} for various movies produced Wadia Movietone owned by JBH and Homi Wadia brothers along with Fearless Nadia. Here he discovered his penchant for handling camera and trick photography. He trained with Vijay Bhatt at Basant Pictures as a special effects director from 1933 to 1937. Khwab Ki Duniya (1937) came to him after Vijay Bhatt asked him to go and watch American film The Invisible Man (1933) and later asked whether {{he would be able}} to replicate them for a film, thus started his career in special effects. In fact his special effects in the film earned him the nickname Kala Dhaga (<b>black</b> <b>thread)</b> for the <b>black</b> <b>threads</b> he used in the film for performing various tricks. Thus Khwab Ki Duniya was the first film in which he was credited as [...] "trick photographer". In the coming years, he also received acclaim for his effects in Basant Pictures' Hatimtai (1956) directed by Homi Wadia and Ellis Duncan's Meera (1954).|$|R
