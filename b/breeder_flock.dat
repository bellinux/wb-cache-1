40|$|In {{the broiler}} it is {{recognized}} that chick viability {{is related to}} <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> age. Young flocks produce eggs with a lower hatchability and chick survival than flocks beyond peak production. Field observations indicate that problems occur when chicks originating from younger flocks are mixed with chicks from older flocks and reared together, perhaps because of a difference in thermoregulation. In this experiment, heat production, rectal temperature after heat or cold stress, and T- 3 of chicks originating from two different aged parent stocks were determined. Chickens originating from older breeder flocks showed a remarkably better body weight and better thermoregulation after cold treatment than chickens originating from young breeder flocks. In contrast, chicks from young breeder flocks {{seem to be more}} resistant to heat at an older age. This implies that age of <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> alone can cause {{a significant difference in the}} thermoregulatory ability of broiler chickens. Thus <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> age should be considered as an additional factor in thermoregulatory experiments. It also may have practical husbandry implications. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to study mechanical eggshell traits (weight, specific gravity, eggshell thickness and eggshell breaking strength) and ultrastructural properties from layer breeder hens at different ages (25, 47 and 61 weeks). The present {{results showed that the}} brown eggshell had significantly higher specific gravity, shell thickness and breaking strength compared to white eggshell. Concerning <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> age, it could be noticed that the age of hen significantly affected mechanical eggshell traits, where specific gravity, shell thickness and breaking strength decreased significantly as the breeder age was advance. With respect to eggshell ultrastructural properties, the brown eggshell had significantly higher effective thickness (palisade %) compared to white ones. Opposite trend was observed for relative cap thickness. With regard to layer <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> age effect, the results indicated that the effective thickness (palisade %) was significantly decreased as the layer <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> age increased. Conversely, the relative cap thickness was increased with age increased. With respect to confluence trait, the present results observed that both brown and white eggs owned shells with similar values of confluence. Significant difference observed between strains regarding fusion (early or late) trait.

Six <b>breeder</b> <b>flocks</b> supplying broiler eggs to hatcheries were examined for cloacal carriage of C. jejuni. Of 240 birds tested, 178 (74 %) were C. jejuni-positive. Eggs from these birds examined for C. jejuni penetration of the egg shell indicated that 185 of 187 were campylobacter-free.

40|$|A free-range broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> was {{studied in}} order to {{determine}} the natural patterns of Campylobacter colonization over a period of 63 weeks. Campylobacter sequence types (STs) were not mutually exclusive and on average colonized only 17. 7 % of the birds tested at any time. Campylobacter STs typically reached a peak in prevalence upon initial detection in the flock before tailing off, although the ST and antigenic flaA short variable region in combination were stable over a number of months. There was evidence that, with a couple of exceptions, the ecology of C. [*]jejuni and C. [*]coli differed, with the latter forming a more stable population. Despite being free range, no newly colonizing STs were detected over a 6 -week period in autumn and a 10 -week period in winter, towards the end of the study. There was limited evidence that those STs identified among broiler chicken flocks on the same farm site were likely to colonize the <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> earlier (R 2 0. 16, P 0. 01).

After an outbreak of IBH in a 10 -d-old pullet broiler <b>breeder</b> <b>flock,</b> we serologically monitored the flock from 8 to 46 wk of age, using the agar gel precipitation test (AGPT) offered by diagnostic laboratories and an FAdV group-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbemt assay (ELISA) developed earlier. In addition, we tested 1 -d-old progeny for possible vertical transmission of FAdV when the <b>breeder</b> <b>flock</b> approached the peak of egg production by performing virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures on target organs. As in previous studies comparing the 2 tests, ELISA was more sensitive than AGPT. With ELISA, a few birds had weakly positive results at 8 wk of age, and all the birds had strongly positive results from 12 wk of age until the end of the study. This group-specific ELISA is therefore a sensitive and practical way to monitor FAdV antibodies in commercial flocks. None of the 1 -d-old chicks tested were positive by PCR, nor was FAdV isolated from the same tissues, indicating an absence of transmission of infectious virus to the progeny.

Selected eggs were collected from broilers that were 30 (young), 36 (peak), 43 (after peak), 53 (old), 60 (very old) and 82 (molted) weeks old. Collected eggs were stored during 3 to 4 days in the ambient temperature. Qualitive and quantitive aspects of eggs including egg weight, albumen height yolk, height thickness of egg shell, yolk color, Albumen and yolk PH and Hugh unit were studied. Trait Analysis was done by ANOVA procedure of SAS statistical software. To compare the means, Duncan test was used. The effects of age and breeder farms on the egg weight, yolk color, yolk and albumen PH, yolk and albumen height, shell egg thickness and Hugh unit were significant (p< 0. 05). The lowest difference was seen between the age of 53, 60 and 82 week old (p< 0. 05). Albumen PH and alkaline is increased by increase of age, but yolk PH is the variance. Influence of age on the traits including yolk and albumen height and Hugh unit was decreased and the color of yolk was faded by increasing age.
