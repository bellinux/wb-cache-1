40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} gives {{designers and}} engineers a geometric design {{space for the}} product development that is almost without limits. More complex shapes can not only be thought off and designed but also manufactured. <b>Back-cuts,</b> joints or flexible areas can be manufactured at once, thus presenting the opportunity {{to reduce the amount}} of products to be assembled as well as assembly time. With the new manufacturing processes we can move faster and more direct towards solutions for technical problems initially being difficult to manufacture or requiring complex assemblies. This includes not only complex outer shapes but also functional inner structures which can be integrated into the challenging lightweight products of the future. The Fraunhofer IPA is concentrating on the research and systematic development of possibilities that will arise by these new manufacturing processes introduced as processes in industrial scale and quality. One of the main goals of these efforts is to find and define solutions and functions with the possibility to be integrated directly in products. Achieving this goal will also increase the value of the manufactured products. This paper is presenting examples and alternative solution for various industrial gripper types currently on the market. The examples were developed with additive manufacturing in mind. The applicable functions of the traditional grippers were investigated in order to find alternative designs and layouts to produce a gripper fulfilling the same purpose but being manufactured in one step and consisting of one piece. This is only possible using additive manufacturing. Some of these examples are already saleable products being offered by the partners to the industry illustrating the viability of additive manufacturing as being a growing alternative to conventional manufacturing methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the Dan yr Ogof Caves located in the Carboniferous Limestone of the north outcrops of the South Wales Coalfield. The caves consist of one major system, called Dan yr Ogof, and one other major cave called Tunnel Cave, as well as a variety of smaller caves and potholes. Despite extensive discoveries in the past ten years large extents of cave passages remain unentered and only minimal progress has been made from the major stream input points. While they at present total over 17 kilometres their ultimate extent is likely to at least double this figure. The caves are shown to be comparatively youthful, having been initiated subsequent {{to the start of the}} Pleistocene Period, but show a maturity of form which is largely attributable to their favourable geological setting and to the recent climatic history of the area in which they are located. The latter is also held to account for the variety within the three main north-south limbs, for rejuvenation and intensive <b>back-cutting</b> by the River Haffes has been responsible for river capture and the termination of main stream flow into the eastern-most of the limbs. Jointing and faulting are shown to be of very great importance to the orientation and structure of passages throughout the catchment area. However, a hitherto unrecognised syncline is shown to be of major importance in controlling the trend of the most southerly passages which form the main conduit between the bottom end of the north-south feeder limbs and the resurgence. This syncline is the outermost manifestation of a major structural disturbance lying to the south. The large number of faults identified in the cave has led to a detailed consideration of relationships with the surface and it is suggested that an extensive and complex network of faults exists. These are arranged en echelon and are for the most part sub-parallel and trending slightly east of north. A considerable quantity and variety of sediments exists within the caves and some observations are made concerning the origins and chronology of these deposits although it is recommended that they are subjected to specialist investigation at a subsequent date...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{quantitative}} replacement of soyabean meal with raw sword bean meal in grower rabbit diets was investigated using twelve grower rabbits {{in a completely}} randomised design experiment. There were four dietary treatments and three rabbits were allocated {{to each of the}} diets, therefore by implication, one rabbit per replicate. The experiment lasted for 56 days. The result showed that {{there was no significant difference}} (p> 0. 05) among the treatments with regard to the growth performance parameters. The highest gross margin of N 1660. 2 k was obtained with 15 % dietary level of inclusion (96. 76 % replacement of soyabean meal). The cut-parts and organ weights showed no significant difference (p> 0. 05) among the treatment means with the exception of the thigh and <b>back-cut</b> for cut-parts and liver and spleen for organ weights. The highest value for <b>back-cut</b> and thigh occurred in diets three and four respectively. The liver and spleen values did not follow any specific trend. Based on the above results, 15 % dietary level of inclusion of raw sword bean (96. 76 % quantitative replacements soyabean meal) compared favourably with control diet (soyabean meal based diet) and hence recommended...|$|E
30|$|The tissues {{used in this}} {{technique}} {{are considered to be}} natural superfluous lip tissues. From a certain point of view, the mucosal flaps in this study are very similar to the M and L flaps of Millard. Millard had proposed the M flap to cover the defect created by the intraoral mucosal <b>back-cut</b> incision for inner downward rotation [5]. This maneuver effectively elongated the medial lip segment. Currently, many cleft surgeons actually cut off this superfluous tissue because lip length can be maintained if muscular reorientation and draping are definitely performed. Actually, the medial mucosal flap in {{this technique}} is quite different from Millard’s M flap in its dimension and the usage. The extended intranasal incision that is continuous with the skin incision is the same, but the lower mucosal incision is extended intraorally along the gingivomedial sulcus of the greater alveolar segment to the incisive foramen. This flap is composed of basal nasal mucosa and caudal lip mucosa and used for the nasal floor posterior to the nostril floor. As a result, anatomically matched tissues are engaged in the reconstruction of the nasal floor.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSome of Earth's {{greatest}} relief occurs where glacial processes act on mountain topography 1, 2. This dramatic {{landscape is}} thought to be an imprint of Pleistocene glaciations 3, 4. However, whether the net effect of glacial erosion on mountains is to increase 5, 6, 7 or decrease 8, 9, 10 relief remains disputed. It has been suggested that in the European Alps, the onset of widespread glaciation since the mid-Pleistocene climate transition 11 led to the growth of large, long-lived and strongly erosive alpine glaciers 12, 13 that profoundly influenced topography 14. Here we use 4 He/ 3 He thermochronometry 15 and thermal-kinematic models to show that the Rhône Valley in Switzerland deepened by about 1 - 1. 5 [*]km over the past one million years. Our results indicate that while the valley was incised and <b>back-cut,</b> high-altitude areas were preserved from erosion. We find an approximately two-fold increase in both local topographic relief and valley concavity, which occurred {{around the time of the}} mid-Pleistocene transition. Our results support the proposed link 12, 13, 14 between the onset of efficient glacial erosion in the European Alps and the transition to longer, colder glacial periods at the middle of the Pleistocene epoch...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{work on the}} Great Bahama Bank's western, leeward margin has centred chiefly on seismic-scale {{expressions}} of carbonate sequences and systems tracts. However, periplatform, slope sediments also exhibit very well developed cyclicity on scales of decimetres to several metres. It is these small-scale, high-frequency cycles within the larger-scale facies successions of the Quaternary which form the main topic of this paper. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the small-scale cycles correlate to the orbitally forced, high-frequency sea-level changes. Therefore these cycles should indicate how sea level has affected the slope development and thus platform-margin evolution during this period. Through detailed, high-resolution sequence stratigraphy of the Great Bahama Bank's leeward margin, obtained via delta 18 O isotope and mineralogical (XRD) analyses, confined by U/Th dating and nannofossil bioevents, a greater understanding of the bedding geometries within the Pleistocene-Holocene seismic sequences and clues as to the nature of the slope development has been achieved. The high-resolution seismic profiles indicate that since the Plio-Pleistocene change in geometry, in which the Great Bahama Bank developed into a rimmed platform, continued steepening and subsequent progradation of the leeward margin has typified slope development during the Quaternary, which is described as an accretionary slope. However, on the basis of our observations we conclude that only the early to lower middle Pleistocene section (isotope stages 45 - 20) and the Holocene (isotope stage 1) of the leeward margin is accretionary. This indicates that a degree of erosion and/or by-passing has occurred on the leeward margin since the lower middle Pleistocene (isotope stage 19). During the first part of this period (isotope stages 19 - 12) erosion and/or by-passing occurred in the middle to lower slope regions and toe-of-slope. By the end of the upper middle to late Pleistocene phase (isotope stages 11 - 2) erosion also occurred on the upper slope. This erosion by currents at the toe-of-slope and oversteepening of the upper and middle slopes have led to <b>back-cutting</b> upslope and resulted in the progressive retreat of the toe-of-slope towards the platform to the east. However, the rise in sea level since the Last Glacial Maximum to its present-day level has allowed high productivity on the platform top during the Holocene and the deposition of a thick sediment wedge on the slope and sedimentation across the entire leeward flanks. This has led to the redevelopment of an accretionary slope and continued westward progradation of the Great Bahama Bank's western, leeward margin...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of pterygium colli (“webbed neck”) is 75 % {{in patients with}} Turner syndrome. This congenital deformity manifests as a bilateral cervical skin fold stretching from the mastoid to the acromion. Although the visibility of this skin fold varies among patients, it frequently has negative social effects. The surgical management of this malformation remains challenging as it requires the achievement of a harmonious neck profile and natural hairline implantation. Methods: We describe a series of 5 girls with Turner syndrome who were managed in our department at the University Hospital Center of Toulouse-Rangueil, France. All patients benefited from a surgical approach based on a new posterior technique, including half-moon resection of the skin fold with an inferior <b>back-cut</b> and suturing of the superficial lamina of the cervical fascia. To ensure solidity, the fascia was fastened to the nuchal ligament. Results: Patients’ mean age at surgery was 10 years (range, 6 – 13 y). The mean duration of follow-up was 13. 7 years (range, 2 – 20 y). No scar enlargement or recurrence was remotely authenticated. The patients {{were satisfied with the}} cosmetic results, including an esthetic neck profile and recovery of hairline implantation. Conclusion: The “posterior cervical lift,” an innovative surgical technique for the management of pterygium colli, achieved satisfying cosmetic outcomes and stability over time...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of vitrification technology for converting radioactive waste {{into a glass}} solid {{began in the early}} 1960 s. Some problems encountered in the vitrification process are still waiting for a solution. One of them is wicking. During pouring, the glass stream flows down the wall of the pour spout until it reaches an angled cut in the wall. At this point, the stream is supposed to break cleanly away from the wall of the pour spout and fall freely into the canister. However, the glass stream is often pulled toward the wall and does not always fall into the canister, a phenomenon known as wicking. Phase 1 involves the assembly, construction, and testing of a melter capable of supplying molten glass at operational flow rates over a break-off point knife edge. Phase 2 will evaluate the effects of glass and pour spout temperatures as well as glass flow rates on the glass flow behavior over the knife edge. Phase 3 will identify the effects on wicking resulting from varying the knife edge diameter and height as well as changing the <b>back-cut</b> angle of the knife edge. The following tasks were completed in FY 97 : Design the experimental system for glass melting and pouring; Acquire and assemble the melter system; and Perform initial research work...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{trial was}} {{conducted}} using 150 birds of day-old Anak broiler chicks, {{to assess the}} effect of substituting raw sword bean meal for soybean meal in broiler finisher diets. 30 and 10 birds respectively constitutes a treatment and a replicate in a completely randomized design. Five experimental diets were used. Diet one was soybean based (control), while the test feedstuff quantitatively replaced 22. 42, 44. 84, 67. 76 and 89. 69 % of soybean in diets 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Feed intake of birds significantly (p> 0. 05) decreased as the quantity of raw sword bean increased in the diets. Weight gain followed the same pattern while feed-to-gain ratio significantly (p 0. 05) differences among treatment groups except for breast-cut and <b>back-cut</b> where diets 1 and 2 (24. 03, 24. 02) performed better than the others. The blood constituents showed significant difference (p< 0. 05) for all the parameters measured only {{with the exception of}} white blood cell. The PCV values fall within the normal range for all the treatment means. The RBC, MCH, MCHC, MCV values were abnormal starting from treatment 3 with the exception of MCHC starting from treatment 2. Serum albumin, creatinine, urea and alkaline phosphatase were higher in the test diets than in the control diet with the exception of treatment 2 where the value for alkaline phosphatase and albumin were lower than the control diet. The control diet had higher globulin value than the test diets. Liver, kidney and spleen were affected histopathologically.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{replacing}} maize with ripe plantain peels and yam peels in the diets of weaner rabbits were investigated using 15 weaner rabbits. There were five treatment diets in all designated T 1, T 2, T 3, T 4 and T 5 with plantain peel and yam peel meal replacing maize meal as energy source at 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 % levels, respectively. The diets were fed to the rabbits {{in a completely}} randomized design. This experiment lasted 56 days. Data were collected on feed intake, weight gain and were used to calculate other growth performance parameter. At {{the end of the}} trials two animals were selected from each treatment, slaughtered and were used to evaluate the carcass characteristics. The cost effectiveness of the diets was also evaluated. Data collected were subjected to analysis of variance and significant means were separated using Duncan?s multiple range test. There was significant (p< 0. 05) difference for the values obtained for total feed intake, feed conversion ratio and cost per kg weight gain. Diet 3 had favourable weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, moderate cost per kg weight gain. Based on this, diet 3 is recommended. For organ weight there were significant differences (p< 0. 05) in all parameters measured except the heart. Diet 2 compared more favourably with control diet. This was followed by diet 3. For cut-parts, there were significant differences (p< 0. 05) in all the parameters measured except for <b>back-cut.</b> Diet 4 compared more favourably with control diet, this is followed by diet 3.

40|$|The optimal dietary {{level of}} {{inclusion}} of cooked sword bean meal was investigated. One {{hundred and twenty}} (120) day-old Anak broiler chicks were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments, each having 3 replicates of 10 chicks in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). Diet 1 was soybean-based control. While the test feedstuff (cooked sword bean meal) quantitatively replaced 27. 27 %, 36. 36 % and 45. 45 % of soybean meal in diets 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Each diet was offered ad-libitum to the birds {{for a period of}} 28 days. There was a general decrease as the quantity of the test diets increased for final live weight, daily weight gain and feed-intake. For feed conversion ratio, diet 2 had the lowest value (1. 65) as opposed to (1. 87) control diet, (2. 2) diet 3 and (2. 70) diet 4. For gross margin, diet 2 had the highest value (N 163. 45) when compared with control diet (N 130. 05), diet 3 (N 120. 37) and diet 4 (N 85. 47), making diet 2 a choice. Values of cut-parts showed significant (p< 0. 05) differences for <b>back-cut</b> only, which followed no specific pattern that can be attributed the effect of diets. It follows then that any of the treatment could serve for cut-parts. Values of organs showed significant (p< 0. 05) difference with respect to proventriculus only in favour of diet 2. For blood constituents, the PCV, HB, RBC, WBC, MCV, fall within the normal range for all the diets while MCHC for control diet only, falls within the normal range established for broiler chickens. The MCH for control diet and diet 2 fell within the normal range. (33. 2433, 34. 18), as opposed to other diets (40. 06, 23. 51). For Serum chemistry, diet 4 (25. 13) urea value was numerically higher than all other values (23. 6, 24. 00, 22. 9). Creatinine values also follow similar trend (1. 033, 1. 100, 1. 000, 1. 166). Diet 2 had the highest numerical value for globulin and total protein (15. 1, 38. 9) while diet 4 (. 536. 00) had the highest value for alkaline phosphatase.
