The community of Santa Cruz, Puebla still creates fine petates with geometric designs. Those of Santa María Chigmecatitlan create miniatures of figures such as musicians and circus performers along with complete nativity scenes.|$|R
5000|$|The town of Collinsville was {{originally}} named Moongunya; {{a name that}} {{is said to be}} an Aboriginal word meaning [...] "coal". This name was given to the town by the Railway Department when Moongunya consisted of <b>bag</b> humpies, <b>bark</b> huts, corrugated-iron shacks and canvas tents. In 1918 the site for the Collinsville State Mine site was chosen and in March 1919 the mine began operations. As the Queensland State Government decided that the town would service the State Coal Mine {{and that it would be}} a model of a good contemporary township it was renamed Collinsville in 1921 for the MLA of Bowen, Charles Collins who represented Bowen from 1915 until his death in 1936.|$|R
50|$|Marc Anthony is {{guarding}} {{a construction}} site when he catches a <b>bag</b> and begins <b>barking</b> at it. Coming out of the bag, it reveals Pussyfoot and he barks at her. However, she isn't afraid, believing the dog is her friend and Marc Anthony's emotions softens. Before returning to guard duty, he leaves Pussyfoot a sausage for her to snack on and she gratefully kisses him. However, trouble is ahead thanks to a hungry alley cat who has seen the sausage and wants it for himself.|$|R
5000|$|The {{breeding}} season is November to March in India, February to May in Sri Lanka. The nest is {{built by the}} female which may however be accompanied by the male. Two eggs are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. The eggs are incubated only by the female for about 15 days. The nest is a <b>bag</b> of webs, <b>bark</b> and caterpillar frass. The nest is built by the female and young are fed by both parents. Nests may sometimes be reused for a second brood. It often builds its nest within the nests of [...] "social spiders" [...] (Eresidae).|$|R
5000|$|Departing the Ship Island {{station on}} 25 June, the bark patrolled the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River before {{she took up}} a {{blockade}} station off Galveston, Texas, on 6 July. At the end of August, while on station off Galveston, William G. Anderson bagged her second prize—the English-owned schooner Lilly. The cargo manifest for Lilly showed that she was apparently carrying only salt, drugs, and quinine. Closer investigation, however, revealed 350 kegs of gunpowder and a consignment letter authorizing the British skipper to turn the material over to the first Confederate Army commander he encountered. William, G. Anderson placed a prize crew of six men, under Acting Master C. W. Harriman, on board Lilly and sent her to Key West, Florida, while the bark resumed her patrols. On 4 September, she intercepted and captured the schooner Theresa, laden with cavalry carbines. Two weeks later, the Union <b>bark</b> <b>bagged</b> another blockade runner, the schooner Reindeer (ex-Jeff Davis) laden with 288 bales of cotton en route to Havana.|$|R
40|$|This study, {{which is}} part of a {{research}} on resistance factors of spruce against Ips typographus, analyses relationships between the intensity of the bark beetle's attacks and anatomical characteristics of the <b>bark.</b> <b>Bags</b> of synthetic pheromones were hung on 10 healthy trees in each of the two stands of 50 and 70 years old spruce trees. Two months later, these variables and the intensity of the insects attacks were quantified. In the 70 years old stand, the intensity of attacks was hardly related to the anatomical characteristics of the bark. However, for the other stand, 59 % and 83 % of the variability of the attacks at 3 and 6 meters respectively are explained by the anatomical characteristics, mainly due to the thickness of dead parenchyma and phloem of the outer bark. This may be partly due to chemical substances impregnating these tissues. Moreover, {{it would seem that the}} resiniferous system is not a major resistance factor of the tree against the bark beetle. Lastly, the intracellular starch content decreases the most on heavily infested trees...|$|R
40|$|Genre: Medicine/huru. Simon Somba narrates {{one of his}} two 'huru', 'huru watu woko' ("stone cover/bag"). It {{is first}} a curse on coconut, orange and other fruit trees. He hangs a small bag made from coconut fibre ('nio pabhune', usually 'kunu') and inserts five small stones, the 'watu woko', inside. Then he pierces the bag with a {{pineapple}} stick (small sharp) across (up down, side to side). When somebody comes and picks fruits, steals, he will fall ill. To be cured he has to come to Simon who will cure the person, who has swollen wounds all over the body, for a fee of 100 or 200 thousand IDR (='peju'). The cure is chewed areca nut and piper betel (sirih pinang) with ginger, applied to the wounds. Recorded by Pidhu at Simon's home in kampong X, 21 Oct - 15, with the AT lavelier mic that we used intermittently these months. It gets loud easily, so turn down the volume. Notes: lea.

5000|$|Stationed off Pilot Town, Louisiana, between 27 May and 24 June, William G. Anderson {{subsequently}} resumed her blockading operations off the Texas coast. On 25 August, she {{captured the}} schooner Mack Canfield laden with 133 bales of cotton off {{the mouth of}} the Rio Grande. Two days later, the armed Union <b>bark</b> <b>bagged</b> the cotton-laden schooner America; and, although the prize capsized while under tow, William G. Anderson's crew retrieved 40 bales of cotton from the sea. After cruising off Galveston, Texas, William G. Anderson departed that vicinity on 17 September and took station off New Orleans, Louisiana. She remained there until 30 November, when she sailed back to Galveston and another stint of blockading off the Texas coast. William G. Anderson shifted to Pensacola Bay, Florida, on 19 February 1864 and served there protecting the navy yard until 1 April 1865. Entering Mobile Bay on 3 April 1865, William G. Anderson was there six days later when Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, assuring the speedy end of the Civil War. William G. Anderson remained in Mobile Bay into the late summer and was then once more stationed at Pensacola Bay, this time from 13 September to 25 November. Alternating between that port and New Orleans until mid-June 1866, the bark set course north from Pensacola on 15 June 1866, bound for the New York Navy Yard.|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{the morning}} of Tuesday 25 January 1898 the smart little {{coasting}} steamer Koonya in a thick fog ran aground at the northern end of Cronulla Beach outside Merries Reef onto Doboy reef about three-quarters of a mile from the shore.The steamer left Moruya at 10 a m on Monday for Sydney, with 14 passengers, amongst whom were a number of ladies and children All was right until about 3 a.m. yesterday, the weather being intensely thick and raining, when the steamer ran ashore on a fungus-growth patch at the northern- most end of Cronulla Beach The land could not be seen, and there is no light there. The captain was on the bridge, it being his watch, he having relieved the mate at midnight [...]The master is Captain T [...]Nicholson, and his chief officer Mr F Basclain. Immediately the vessel struck all hands were at once on deck, and the stewardess routed out the ladies and children, and lifebelts were supplied. There was a heavy sea, and the belts were put round the passengers. Soon after the Captain, who behaved coolly, told the people there was no real danger. They might take the belts off, as he could easily land them at daylight. No seas broke aboard the steamer lying on her side in a comparatively sheltered spot.The women and children all got on the bridge. When daylight came in the boat was launched and took a line ashore. This was made fast to a tree, the vessel being about 50 or 60 yards from the land. By these means all the passengers were got ashore- that is, that the crew worked the boat between the ship and shore by the hand-line thus established, the women and children being landed first, next the male passengers, and afterwards their luggage and the effects of the crew, with the exception of those of the stewardess, which were lost , Miss Rankin being so busy looking after those in her charge that her personal goods were overlooked. The passengers speak in unmeasured terms of praise of Miss Rankin's noble efforts in helping the women and children during the trying time They also have a good word for the master and crewAfter getting ashore an impromptu camp was put up, in winch the whole party breakfasted, plenty of everything being available by boat from the vesselVery soon after, however, whether owing to the tide rising and the heavy easterly swell setting in (wind at time of wreck was S E to E [...] ), the vessel began to range about, and presently broke in halves, and at high water only a little of her stern could be seen Then the action of the sea soon smashed her up, and wreckage was strewn along the beach Cheese were particularly in evidence, and some 20 pigs out of 25 that were on board were seen gambolling on the beach At this time no person had put in an appearance at the scene, and the captain sent a message into Sutherland, whence it was dispatched to Sydney, asking for conveyances to be sent to take the people to the hotel at Port Hacking In response to this message a conveyance came, and took the party with their effects to the hotel The road is a pretty rough one, so that progress was slow, and the people had to get out and walk at intervals At the hotel all their requirements were attended toThe vessel struck the Doboy reef about three-quarters of a mile from the shore the vessel was going at the rate of about eight knots.... and she broke up in a few hours The stern portion of the vessel, with the ladies' cabin intact, was washed up on the rocks to high-water mark, where it remained fast.The list -Mrs. Jones Miss F Holder, Mrs. Warren and four children, Mrs. Walters and one child, Mrs. Craig, Messrs Cleary, Hopkins, M.
