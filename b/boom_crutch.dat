5000|$|Once {{the sail}} is reefed, raise the main, stow the <b>boom</b> <b>crutch,</b> raise the jib, and bear off. If the reefing is done while moored or in {{sheltered}} waters, the sail to be reefed {{need not be}} lowered entirely. One crewman must pull the reefing line as another crewman lowers the sail.|$|E
5000|$|Lower the jib {{and main}} sail. Leaving the jib up {{allows it to}} turn the boat away from the wind. Lowering the main just enough to reef {{runs the risk of}} having the wind change directions, blowing the main {{outboard}} and filling the sail. Set the boom in the <b>boom</b> <b>crutch</b> and pull the sheet tight.|$|E
25|$|Another large builder's {{model is}} {{situated}} aboard the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth 2, currently located in Dubai. This model was also originally Lusitania, and, like the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic's model, it was converted into Mauretania after Lusitania was lost. When inspecting the model, {{one can tell}} it was Lusitania by examining the different <b>boom</b> <b>crutches</b> and bridge front, {{which is on the}} boat deck level.|$|R
