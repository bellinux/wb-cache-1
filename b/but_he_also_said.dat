5|$|Sky Sports {{said that}} during the 2011–12 season McLean had begun to emerge {{as one of the}} top young talents in the SPL. His first game of the season was on 6 August, in a 1–1 draw against Dundee United, where he came on as an 80th-minute substitute. His first start came a week later in a 1–0 loss to Motherwell. McLean then played {{regularly}} in the first team over the next few months and was in excellent form. He scored his first senior goal in a 1–0 win over St Johnstone on 29 October and was rewarded with the SPL Young Player of the Month award for October 2011. After this, team-mate Gary Teale said that he thought McLean was very similar to former Rangers and Scotland captain Barry Ferguson, and that he thought McLean would have a brilliant future in the game. In the weeks leading up to his award, McLean had been watched by English Championship clubs Burnley and Crystal Palace, with Celtic also reportedly interested in him. Lennon encouraged interest from other clubs, saying that he took it as a compliment to McLean's development. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>said</b> that he would not consider selling McLean in the near future and expressed his delight at the fact that he had already signed McLean on a long-term contract. On 19 November, McLean scored his second goal for St Mirren, in a 2–1 win over Dunfermline Athletic. He then scored St Mirren's first goal, on 10 December, as they came from behind to secure a 2–2 draw against Aberdeen. McLean was one of the four players nominated for the SPL young Player of the Year Award. In January 2014 it was announced that McLean would be out-of-action for 6 weeks following knee surgery.|$|E

His view was that the church [...] "seems superior to the generality of Welsh buildings of the kind", with its double roof and two bells, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "the interior of the building has little to attract notice". Angharad Llwyd described it in 1833 as [...] "a spacious structure, containing several good monuments".|$|E

Although the [...] "first {{half of the}} night felt rushed and had too many tag matches", the show still held his [...] "interest from start to finish" [...] and its final three matches were [...] "amazing". Powell described several matches as overtaking each other as the night's best as the event progressed: the [...] "very physical" [...] Ishii–Makabe, then Naito–Styles, then Ibushi–Nakamura. English-language commentators Ross and Striker were endorsed as an overall positive. Lastly, Powell thought the [...] "pay-per-view broadcast is fantastic", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>said</b> some Pro Wrestling Dot Net readers [...] "reported issues with the Flipps app [...] feed for the show.|$|E

500|$|Along {{with his}} estrangement from McCartney, Lennon always felt a musical {{competitiveness}} {{with him and}} kept an ear on his music. During his five-year career break he was content to sit back as long as McCartney was producing what Lennon saw as mediocre material. Lennon took notice when McCartney released [...] "Coming Up" [...] in 1980, which was the year Lennon returned to the studio and {{the last year of}} his life. [...] "It's driving me crackers!" [...] he jokingly complained, because he could not get the tune out of his head. That same year, Lennon was asked whether the group were dreaded enemies or the best of friends, and he replied that they were neither, and that he had not seen any of them in a long time. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I still love those guys.

Hugh McIntyre from Forbes said that the track [...] "is a noticeable departure from anything Gaga has ever released before". He described it as a [...] "fun, catchy tune", but felt it was less risky or less dance-like than previous songs like [...] "Bad Romance", [...] "Telephone" [...] (2009), [...] "Applause" [...] (2013) or [...] "Million Reasons" [...] (2016). Melinda Newman from the same publication wrote that [...] "The Cure" [...] might be Gaga's pathway back onto pop radio, as it is a [...] "swaying, instantly infectious slice of synth-pop that sounds like it's straight out the '80s and feels ready-made for blaring out of car stereos this summer".|$|E
500|$|Hans Lundgren {{was born}} on 3 November 1957 in Spånga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (née Tjerneld), a {{language}} teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spånga {{until the age of}} 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Ångermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and vented his frustration on his wife and eldest son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a [...] "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with." [...] He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most notorious}} police {{shooting}} in Montreal {{during this period}} was the 1991 shooting death of Marcellus François, an unarmed black man. In 1992, coroner Harvey Yarosky issued a report into François's death that condemned [...] "the existence of a racist attitude that is totally unacceptable" [...] within Montreal's police force. Yeomans responded by agreeing that racism should be eradicated within the force, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>said</b> that Yarosky had [...] "exaggerated" [...] {{the extent of the}} problem by presenting the image of a generally dysfunctional department. In 1994, retired judge Albert Malouf released a review of the François shooting that was also strongly critical of police conduct; Yeomans acknowledged that the report was basically fair, though he added that Malouf's criticisms should not be regarded as applicable to the force as a whole.|$|E

John Howard denied any knowledge {{of the existence of}} such a fund. Abbott was also accused of offering funds to One Nation dissident Terry Sharples to support his court battle against the party. However, Howard defended the honesty of Abbott in this matter. Abbott conceded that the political threat One Nation posed to the Howard Government was [...] "a very big factor" [...] in his decision to pursue the legal attack, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>said</b> he was acting [...] "in Australia's national interest". Howard also defended Abbott's actions saying [...] "It's the job of the Liberal Party to politically attack other parties – there's nothing wrong with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buffett {{described}} {{the health care}} reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. Buffett thinks health care costs should head towards 13 to 14% of GDP. (Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the CMS actuary has projected health care costs will reach almost 20% of GDP by 2020.) Buffett said [...] "If you want the very best, I mean if you want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>said</b> that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).|$|E
50|$|It {{is written}} that his birth was {{announced}} {{to his father}} by the Angel Gabriel in a dream, as was his name Zay'ā, which derives from the verb to shudder in fear - because {{not only did the}} earth shake {{at the time of his}} birth, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> is <b>also</b> <b>said</b> to make demons, and the evil and ruthless shudder in fear. According to the legend Simon was 120 and Helena was 93 years of age at the time of the Saint’s birth. At age three Zayya was taken by his father to a teacher named Jonathan who taught him to read and recite the Holy Scriptures. After two years of study, he decided he had learnt enough and began to study the scriptures on his own at home.|$|R
5000|$|The fate of {{head coach}} Herman Edwards {{and his staff}} {{remained}} uncertain {{after the end of}} the 2008 season in which the Chiefs finished with a franchise-worst 2-14 record. The team was 6-26 in the past two years under Edwards, who had one year left on a four-year, $12 million contract and was lobbying to be allowed another year to get his rebuilding movement off the ground. Team owner Clark Hunt voiced his support of Edwards, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> had <b>also</b> <b>said</b> the new general manager Scott Pioli would have [...] "significant input" [...] into the decision on whether to retain him.

5000|$|Ichazo is {{considered}} by many to be the father of the Enneagram of Personality (usually just called the Enneagram) movement which uses an enneagram figure. The United States Court of Appeals ruled that Ichazo is the original author of the application of the enneagram figure to a theory of ego fixations (which are the precursor to personality disorders). However, this ruling denied copyright injunction under the [...] "fair use" [...] doctrine of copyright law. Because the enneagram symbol is a discovery (not an invention), the legal issue was not use of the symbol but rather the copyrightability of specific [...] "enneagrams", meaning symbol plus descriptive words (or other information) associated with each point. Ichazo had earlier described the enneagrams as a set of immutable laws <b>but</b> <b>he</b> had <b>also</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> [...] "developed" [...] the enneagrams.|$|R

2500|$|Rockabilly {{was most}} popular with country {{fans in the}} 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of rockabilly in country music.

Biti insisted that the MDC had never agreed to the allocation of any ministries and that it was deceptive for ZANU-PF to claim that there were only two in dispute. He expressed hope that Mbeki could help resolve the situation, saying that if Mbeki was unsuccessful the only remaining hope was divine intervention. It was reported at this time that the power-sharing agreement was near collapse; reportedly, some members of the ZANU-PF leadership were adamant that the party needed to hold the key portfolios, believing that ZANU-PF would be in grave danger if it did not control those ministries. ANC President Jacob Zuma said {{on the same day that}} he hoped the Zimbabwean parties could reach an agreement on their own, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>said</b> that Mbeki was available to facilitate the negotiations if necessary.|$|E

5|$|In {{the story}} group, monsters {{were the first}} thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full {{drawings}} rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> has <b>also</b> <b>said</b> that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka.
