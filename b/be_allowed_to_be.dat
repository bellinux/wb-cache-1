5|$|In December 2006 it was {{announced}} that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 event would take place. The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses. In June 2007 it {{was announced}} that alcohol would not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken on site, but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena. Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused much controversy.|$|E
5|$|On October15, the {{governor}} of the United States Virgin Islands announced the final preparations for Hurricane Omar as he signed a State of Emergency declaration for the territory. Public schools would be closed on October16. All non-essential workers would be dismissed at 10 a.m. local time. At 6 p.m. curfew was put in place for the same day. Only those with valid passes would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out after the curfew was put in place. That same day, a Hurricane Warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane-force winds and torrential rains from Omar. The American Red Cross planned to open shelters throughout the islands before the hurricane struck. Sandbags were also being distributed in St. Croix. A large oil refinery, which produces , was shut down and only necessary workers remained at the refinery.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} then {{attempted to}} elect Vidoni again, but Chigi was now opposed to {{him out of}} anger at the French for excluding d'Elci. The Spanish cardinals also worked against Vidoni, implying {{at one point that}} Mariana of Austria, the Queen regent of Spain, had excluded Vidoni's candidacy. The Spanish then attempted to elect Benedetto Odescalchi, but d'Ailly declared that no one would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected unless they owed loyalty to Louis XIV. The Spanish soon sent word that their cardinals were free to vote for anyone. The letter was brought by courier and announced that Mariana of Austria had not actually excluded Vidoni nor any member of the college.|$|E

Evans was keen to return to radio. Indeed, it was reported that his agent, Michael Foster, had approached Matthew Bannister to ask if Chris would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> return to Radio 1, and he had gone as far as commencing negotiations to buy Talk Radio.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 1995, Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis {{announced}} that Greece would be sending humanitarian aid consisting of medicine, food, and clothing to Serbian refugees from Krajina. The first two planes carrying the aid left on 8 August. Greece also {{announced that}} Greek doctors {{would be sent}} to the region and that some of the wounded would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated at Greek military hospitals. Regarding the conflict itself, the government criticized the West for its role. Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias condemned the Croatian offensive and Deputy Foreign Minister for European Affairs Georgios Alexandros Mangakis criticized the United States and Germany for backing Croatia's offensive against the Krajina Serbs.|$|E
25|$|NATO {{decided in}} 1957 to build arsenals {{for nuclear weapons}} in all member countries, {{including}} Norway. Because the weapons were to be operated only by American personnel, this was in violation with Norwegian base policy. However, foreign personnel was allowed to be based in Norway during war, and therefore infrastructure would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built in Norway to allow nuclear weapons to operate from Norway in such a scenario. Norway approved that seven air stations, including Torp, would have conventional ammunition storages that could be converted to nuclear weapons storage facilities in war, and allow the weapons to be transported into Norway following the declaration of war. The arsenals were built underground in bedrock with reinforced concrete.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{also moved}} to introduce into evidence a recorded conversation between Constand's mother Gianna Constand and Cosby discussing the alleged assault. The defense moved {{to have the}} deposition from Andrea Constand's 2005 civil deposition thrown out. The judge said he would rule on all these motions at a later date. On September 16, 2016, O'Neill ruled that the recorded call between Constand's mother and Cosby would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played in court. In his ruling he said that since the call was recorded in Canada, which deems recordings lawful with consent from only one party, it would be admissible. On December 5, 2016, O'Neill ruled that the deposition in the Constand civil case and any other evidence gathered by using it, would be allowed into the trial.|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 2016, {{a federal}} judge ruled that Hinckley would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{released}} from St. Elizabeth's on August 5, as {{he was no longer}} considered a threat to himself or others. The pivotal conditions of his release are that he has no contact with the Reagan family, the Brady family, or Jodie Foster. He will live with his 90-year-old mother and be restricted to a 50-mile zone around her home in Williamsburg, Virginia. Hinckley was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, and will live full-time at his mother's home. As part of his release, he is excluded from speaking to the press, has to work three days a week, can drive no more than 30 miles from his mother's home or 50 miles if attended, and must see a psychiatrist twice a month.|$|E
25|$|Dwarfs {{were treated}} with {{considerable}} respect in Ancient Egyptian society, notably during the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. Their natural nanism {{was seen as a}} celestial gift, and discrimination and social exclusion seem to have been unknown to the Egyptians. In most cases in which dwarfs were brought into a new family, they seem to have been accepted at once as full-fledged members. They were assigned special, exclusive duties, which were normally performed by the highest-ranked officials, such as priests and treasurers. Even in many royal households, next to the king, dwarfs were allowed to serve and work. The unusually high ranks and social positions that dwarfs enjoyed explain, for example, their important presence in subsidiary tombs around those of the 1st Dynasty pharaohs. These subsidiary tombs were reserved for the direct and most loyal servants of the ruler. To <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried so close to the king shows how respected dwarfs were at that time.|$|E

25|$|Kovel {{uses the}} term “Eco-socialist revolution” to {{describe}} the transition to an eco-socialist world society. In the immediate socio-political transition, he believes that four groups will emerge from the revolution – revolutionaries, those “whose productive activity is directly compatible with ecological production” (such as nurses, schoolteachers, librarians, independent farmers and many other examples), those “whose pre-revolutionary practice was given over to capital” (including the bourgeoisie, advertising executives and more) and “the workers whose activity added surplus value to capitalist commodities”. In terms of political organisation, he advocates an “interim assembly” {{made up of the}} revolutionaries that can “devise incentives to make sure that vital functions are maintained” (such as short-term continuation of “differential remuneration” for labor), “handle the redistribution of social roles and assets”, convene “in widespread locations”, and send delegates to regional, state, national and international organisations, where every level has an “executive council” that is rotated and can be recalled. From there, he asserts that “productive communities” will “form the political as well as economic unit of society” and “organize others” to make a transition to eco-socialist production; he adds that people will <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> members of any community they choose with “associate membership” of others, such as a doctor having main membership of healthcare communities as a doctor and associate membership of child-rearing communities as a father. Each locality would, in Kovel’s eyes, require one community that administered the areas of jurisdiction through an elected assembly. High-level assemblies would have additional “supervisory” roles over localities to monitor the development of ecosystemic integrity, and administer “society-wide services” like transport in “state-like functions”, before the interim assembly can transfer responsibilities to “the level of the society as a whole through appropriate and democratically responsive committees”.|$|E
