D) [...] School of Biological Sciences. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2010. The virion host shutoff protein (Vhs) is a {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) protein involved in early shutoff of the host cell. It is {{a component of the}} infecting virion, located in the tegument region, that works by rapidly degrading both viral and cellular messenger RNA (mRNA). in vivo and within infected cells, Vhs is selective for degrading messenger RNA opposed to non-messenger RNA. This dissertation sought to examine Vhs cleavage of an mRNA that utilizes the cap-dependent scanning mechanism for translation initiation and to see if cleavage was connected to early events of translation initiation. mRNA encoding HSV- 1 thymidine kinase (pBK 2) was used {{for the majority of the}} experiments, and studies were designed to map the cut sites produced by Vhs in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) system. Additional experiments investigated whether Vhs was selective for degrading certain types of mRNAs over others, particularly IRES-containing mRNAs. 	Studies revealed that Vhs specifically cleaves pBK 2 mRNA within the first 300 bases from the 5 ' cap, and these cut sites are close to and slightly upstream from the first three AUG codons of the sequence. The proximity of the cutting to the AUG codons led to speculations that early events of translation initiation might be involved in Vhs degradation of mRNA. This was found to be true, where data revealed that blocking early stages such as (1) recruitment of translation initiation factors to the 5 ' cap and/or (2) ATP hydrolysis RNA helicase activity important for unwinding RNA secondary structure and the scanning process hinder Vhs cleavage. However, blocking later stages of translation initiation only had a modest effect on RNase activity. Results also found that a 5 ' cap analog inhibits Vhs site-specific cleavage of mRNA at regions near the 5 ' cap. Interestingly, a cap appears to be required for Vhs production of specific cleavage sites within the first 300 bases of the transcript. 	Work went on to study whether there was a difference between Vhs cleavage of circularized RNA that normally experiences cap-dependent scanning and circularized RNA that initiates translation in a cap-independent manner. Results indicated that Vhs requires a free 5 ' end for specific cleavage of mRNA that undergoes cap-dependent scanning. However, Vhs does not require a free 5 ' end to specifically cleave a circular RNA that utilizes cap-independent methods for translation initiation. Mutational work, with pBK 2 mutants which contained mutations in or surrounding the AUG codon, further supported a mechanism for Vhs cleavage that involved Vhs association with the scanning complex to reach some of its preferred cut sites. Mutating the first AUG to a non-AUG inhibited Vhs specific cleavage of pBK 2 mRNA at a region just upstream from the AUG codon. Additionally, mutating bases surrounding the AUG codon to put it in an optimal context enhanced cleavage at regions near the start codon. Inserting a stable hairpin near the 5 ' cap to <b>block</b> <b>scanning</b> also reduced Vhs cleavage at prominent sites within the first 300 bases of the transcript. To conclude, this work provides several indications that Vhs associates with components of the translational apparatus to access at least some of its cut sites.

40|$|AbstractAn {{analysis}} of laser-dotted engraving technological specifics and laser-impulse machines control problems is presented. The main problem for material processing with impulse laser emission is {{the necessity to}} maintain the impulse frequency in a fixed interval. Any violation of this interval isn’t allowed, because it leads to significant energy dispersion between impulses and, as a result, to uneven material processing. The traditional control method with impulse confirmation waiting could be realized in any NC System. However, it leads to performance loss and incomplete use of machine capabilities. An approach is developed via impulse processing control based on the combination of advance NC <b>blocks</b> <b>scanning</b> method and speed profile adaptation for impulse frequency limit conditions. Experiments show that the developed approach allows to greatly increase the processing speed compared to the method with impulse confirmation waiting.

40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN 4 mRNA 5 ′-leader {{contains}} four upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and the CPA 1 leader {{contains a}} single uORF. To determine how these uORFs control translation, we examined mRNAs containing these leaders in cell-free translation extracts {{to determine where}} ribosomes were loaded first and where they were loaded during steady-state translation. Ribosomes predominantly loaded first at GCN 4 uORF 1. Following its translation, but not the translation of uORF 4, they efficiently reinitiated protein synthesis at Gcn 4 p. Adding purified eIF 2 increased reinitiation at uORFs 3 or 4 and reduced reinitiation at Gcn 4 p. This indicates that eIF 2 affects the site of reinitiation following translation of GCN 4 uORF 1 in vitro. In contrast, for mRNA containing the CPA 1 uORF, ribosomes reached the downstream start codon by scanning past the uORF. Addition of arginine caused ribosomes that had synthesized the uORF polypeptide to stall at its termination codon, reducing loading at the downstream start codon, apparently by <b>blocking</b> <b>scanning</b> ribosomes, and not by affecting reinitiation.

40|$|Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is a DNA-containing pararetrovirus replicating {{by means}} of reverse {{transcription}} of a terminally redundant pregenomic 35 S RNA that is also used as a polycistronic mRNA. The leader of 35 S RNA is long, highly structured, and contains multiple short ORFs (sORFs), which strongly interfere with the ribosome scanning process. Translation of this RNA is initiated by a ribosome shunt mechanism, in which ribosomes translate the most 5 ′-proximal short ORF (sORF A), then skip a large region of the leader containing a putative RNA encapsidation signal and reinitiate translation at the first long viral ORF. Here, we demonstrate that {{the efficiency of the}} sORF A-mediated ribosome shunt is an important determinant of viral infectivity. Point mutations in sORF A, which reduced the basal level of shunt-dependent expression and the degree of shunt enhancement by a CaMV-encoded translation transactivator (TAV), consequently reduced infectivity of the virus in turnip plants. First- or second-site reversions appeared in the viral progeny. The second-site reversions restored shuntdependent expression to an extent correlating with their relative abundance in the progeny. Mutations that abolished both the basal and TAV-activated components of shunting proved to be lethal.
