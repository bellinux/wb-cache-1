5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapy</b> are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. Cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapy</b> {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour in children and adolescents.|$|E

40|$|With the {{dominance}} of cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapies</b> within mental health nursing educational and practice settings, a danger exists that a narrow application of therapy interventions and micro skills will result. Given the rich and diverse variations of presenting circumstances to community mental health services, an incorporation of therapy approaches beyond the cognitive behavioural model is essential. This paper initially aims to demonstrate the core values of mental health nursing as being at least partially incongruent with those of cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapies.</b> This paper also aims to provide brief examples {{of the use of}} alternate evidential practice-based therapies more reflective of mental health nursing values across a spectrum of community mental health service where the authors are employed...|$|R

25|$|Counseling {{may be used}} by {{offenders}} {{to minimize}} the risk of future domestic violence. Most commonly, to date, convicted or self-referring offenders undertake programmes for perpetrators of intimate partner violence. These are delivered in a group format, one or two hours per week, over a set time period. Programme facilitators guide participants through a curriculum of adult-education style modules, which draw on a variety of therapeutic approaches, but predominantly cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapy</b> and psycho-education. A debate on the effectiveness of these programmes is on-going. While some (ex-) partners of offenders have experienced improvements in their situation, others have not, and there also appears to be a risk of doing harm.|$|E
40|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a condition characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention or hyperactivity. The condition impacts on multiple aspects of an individual's life, as it can affect motor skills, social relationships, self-esteem and educational success. The diagnosis and management of this condition is of concern to healthcare professionals and is a topic often debated by the media. The most recent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on diagnosing and managing ADHD in children, young people and adults has triggered a resurgence of this debate. The NICE guidance is particularly interesting because it states that <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapies,</b> rather than medications, should be the first-line treatment. While this apparent reversal in approach will be welcomed by some, this is an emotive issue and will no doubt also meet with strong opposition. This paper seeks to explore and discuss the existing evidence relating to medication versus <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapies,</b> and difficulties that may arise in implementing the latest NICE guidance...|$|R

40|$|Memories {{formed as}} a result of {{threatening}} events can have debilitating effects on quality of life. Solutions to treat these memories are limited to <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapies</b> and non-specific pharmacotherapy. Neither <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapies</b> nor current pharmacotherapy have a lasting effect on memories and quality of life. Pavlovian threat (fear) conditioning results in changes to neural plasticity in the amygdala, specifically in the dorsal subdivision of the lateral amygdala (LAd), where plastic changes to the microcircuitry occur. Plastic changes include increases in the number of neurons expressing pMAPK/ERK activity and changes to the structure and shape of the neuron including changes to dendritic spines. Modifications to plasticity occur during both initial memory consolidation and subsequent reconsolidation of fear memories. MEK inhibitors, upstream inhibitors of pMAPK/ERK activity are known to block pMAPK/ERK activity when administered both intra brain and systemically and also block initial consolidation and reconsolidation of threat memories. However the precise effect of MEK inhibitors on different sub-regional microcircuitry is unknown. Our initial data suggests that the number of neurons in the LAd expressing pMAPK/ERK is significantly reduced (by up to 90 %) following a systemic injection of the MEK inhibitor SL 327. In conclusion these data provide initial microcircuit level analysis of the effects of MEK inhibitor on neural microcircuits underlying threat memories...|$|R
40|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS) is {{a disorder}} characterised by multiple motor and vocal tics and is frequently associated with behavioural problems. Tics {{are known to}} be affected by internal factors such as inner tension and external factors such as the surrounding environment. A number of behavioural treatments have been suggested to treat the symptoms of TS, in addition to pharmacotherapy and surgery for the most severe cases. This review compiled all the studies investigating <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapies</b> for TS, briefly describing each technique and assessing the evidence in order to determine which of these appear to be effective. Different <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapies</b> that were used included habit reversal training (HRT), massed negative practice, supportive psychotherapy, exposure with response prevention, self-monitoring, cognitive-behavioural therapy, relaxation therapy, assertiveness training, contingency management, a tension-reduction technique and biofeedback training. Overall, HRT is the best-studied and most widely-used technique and there is sufficient experimental evidence to suggest that it is an effective treatment. Most of the other treatments, however, require further investigation to evaluate their efficacy. Specifically, evidence suggests that exposure with response prevention and self-monitoring are effective, and {{more research is needed to}} determine the therapeutic value of the other treatments. As most of the studies investigating behavioural treatments for TS are small-sample or single-case studies, larger randomised controlled trials are advocated...|$|R
2500|$|Panic {{disorder}} {{is a serious}} health problem {{that in many cases}} can be successfully treated, although there is no known cure. Identification of treatments that engender as full a response as possible, and can minimize relapse, is imperative. Cognitive <b>behavioural</b> <b>therapy</b> and positive self-talk specific for panic are the treatment of choice for panic disorder. Several studies show that 85 to 90 percent of panic disorder patients treated with CBT recover completely from their panic attacks within 12 weeks.
