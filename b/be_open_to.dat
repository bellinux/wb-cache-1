5|$|Health: Brown said {{he wanted}} doctors' {{surgeries}} to open at weekends, and GPs to be on-call in the evenings. Doctors {{had been given the}} right to opt out of out-of-hours care two years before under a controversial pay deal signed by then-Health Secretary John Reid, that awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006.

5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah.

There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} plan was shelved, {{the need for a}} highway in western Nassau County still existed. In 1963, the Department of Public Works revived the project; however, the routing was altered to extend from the Sunrise Highway (NY27) north to an intersection with CR101 (Middle Neck Road) in Sands Point. Part of the route would use modern NY101 and the right-of-way of an abandoned Long Island Rail Road line. In 1971, several proposed crossings of the Long Island Sound were studied. One crossing, a bridge connecting Sands Point to New Rochelle to Westchester County, may have become a northward extension of the highway if it was constructed. By 1971, though, hopes had begun to fade on the highway's prospects of becoming reality. Even if construction had begun in that year, the highway would not <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> traffic until 1975. The project was eventually shelved.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E
5|$|Due to Gourcuff's {{impressive}} season, his parent club {{announced that}} it would <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the player returning to Milan for the 2009–10 season.

Despite general manager Adriano Galliani and new manager Leonardo's efforts to persuade Gourcuff to return, on 28 May, it was announced that Bordeaux had signed Gourcuff permanently from Milan with Gourcuff agreeing to a four-year deal. The transfer fee was €13.6 million.|$|E
5|$|In 1712, Britain and France {{declared}} an armistice, {{and a final}} peace agreement was signed the following year.

5|$|In 2011, Sega {{noted that}} the game was {{frequently}} requested by fans as a title for re-release.

In 2010, the head of Sonic Team, Takashi Iizuka, expressed interest in developing a sequel to the game. Also taking an interest was Christian Whitehead, the developer of the 2011 remaster of Sonic CD, who said in a 2014 interview that he would possibly <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> remaking the game using the Retro Engine.|$|E
5|$|In the church's teaching, sexual {{activity}} is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or {{in a natural}} marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage, partners are called to practise continence, {{in order to test}} mutual respect and fidelity. Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> the possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.|$|E
5|$|In view {{of growing}} labor shortages, on July 1, 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an {{important}} decision, ruling that {{from then on}} all hiring of male employees in the country was to be done through the United States Employment Service (USES). By that time the USES followed strict anti-discrimination employment practices. The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that would <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> all applicants, regardless of race. The company accepted eight black applicants (three from the USES and five from its own ranks) to train as streetcar coachmen. Their training was {{to take place in}} late July, and they were to start taking an empty streetcar on the lines from August 1. It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike.|$|E
