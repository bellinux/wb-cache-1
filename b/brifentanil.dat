5000|$|<b>Brifentanil</b> (A-3331) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{that is an}} analogue of fentanyl and {{was developed in the}} early 1990s. [...] <b>Brifentanil</b> is most similar to highly potent, short-acting fentanyl analogues such as alfentanil. The effects of <b>brifentanil</b> are very similar to those of alfentanil, with strong but short lasting analgesia and sedation, and particularly notable itching and respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects of}} {{fentanyl}} analogs {{are similar to}} those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear. The risk of respiratory depression is especially high with potent fentanyl analogues such as alfentanil and <b>brifentanil,</b> and these drugs pose a significant risk of death if used outside of a hospital setting with appropriate artificial breathing apparatus available.|$|E
