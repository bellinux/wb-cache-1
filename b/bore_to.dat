5|$|Around 1900, Dr. Richard H. Stein, a Berlin musicologist, made a quarter-tone clarinet, {{which was}} soon abandoned. Years later, another German, Fritz Schüller of Markneukirchen, built a quarter tone clarinet, with two {{parallel}} bores of slightly different lengths whose tone holes are operated {{using the same}} keywork and a valve to switch from one <b>bore</b> <b>to</b> the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, not {{to mention}} the millions of dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the <b>bore,</b> <b>to</b> daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E
5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal <b>bore</b> <b>to</b> overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E

The twin-cam four-valve head was replaced by the single-cam three-valve head, possibly from the Arab. An increase in <b>bore</b> <b>to</b> 120mm allowed space for these larger valves.|$|E

25|$|In 1854, Armstrong {{approached}} the Secretary of State for War, proposing that he construct a rifled breech-loading 3-pounder gun for trial.

25|$|The Type 100 had a {{chrome-plated}} <b>bore</b> <b>to</b> {{help fight}} corrosion in Asian jungle conditions. Its complex ammunition feed included a feature whereby {{the firing pin}} would not operate until the round was fully chambered; frequent stoppages in firing were experienced in the field. The round was the underpowered and relatively ineffective 8x22mm Nambu pistol round. The curved box magazine extending {{from the left side}} made for poor weapon balance when full. The sights were canted to the left.|$|E
25|$|Often called {{conventional}} heavy oil, this low-density oil can {{be recovered}} by conventional drilling techniques or by waterflood, a technique of injecting {{water into the}} reservoir to increase pressure, thus forcing the oil toward the well bore. When these techniques work, heavy oil is like the more commercially attractive lighter grades of oil. But heavy oil can also be quite viscous. It can need some form of heat or solvent and pressure before it can flow into a well <b>bore</b> <b>to</b> be produced. When heavy oil requires these techniques to go into production, it is known as non-conventional heavy oil.|$|E

25|$|The {{method by}} which Glock barrels are rifled is {{somewhat}} unusual; instead of using a traditional broaching machine to cut the rifling into the bore, the Glock process involves beating a slowly rotating mandrel through the <b>bore</b> <b>to</b> obtain the hexagonal or octagonal shape. As a result, the barrel's thickness {{in the area of}} each groove is not compromised as with conventional square-cut barrels. This has the advantage of providing a better gas seal behind the projectile as the bore has a slightly smaller diameter, which translates into more efficient use of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet, slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities, and increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Scarce {{information}} on Kim Jong-un's early life comes from North Korean defectors {{and people who}} have claimed to witness him abroad, such as during his school attendance in Switzerland. Some of the information has been conflicting and contradictory, perhaps confusing him with his brother, Kim Jong-chul, who also attended school in Switzerland around the same time. Nevertheless, there has been some consensus on information about his early life. North Korean authorities have stated that his birthdate is 8 January 1982, but South Korean intelligence officials believe the actual date is a year later. Former basketball star Dennis Rodman said that the birthdate is 8 January 1983 after meeting Kim in September 2013 in North Korea. Kim Jong-Un was the second of three children Ko Yong-hui <b>bore</b> <b>to</b> Kim Jong-il; his elder brother Kim Jong-chul was born in 1981, while his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, {{is believed to have been}} born in 1987.|$|E
25|$|MotoGP-class {{motorcycles}} are {{not restricted}} to any specific engine configuration. However, the number of cylinders employed in the engine determines the motorcycle's permitted minimum weight; {{the weight of the}} extra cylinders acts as a form of handicap. This is necessary because, for a given capacity, an engine with more cylinders is capable of producing more power. If comparable <b>bore</b> <b>to</b> stroke ratios are employed, an engine with more cylinders will have a greater piston area and a shorter stroke. The increased piston area permits an increase in the total valve area, allowing more air and fuel to be drawn into the engine, and the shorter stroke permits higher revs at the same piston speed, allowing the engine to pump still more air and fuel with the potential to produce more power, but with more fuel consumption too. In 2004 motorcycles were entered with three-, four-and five-cylinder configurations. A six-cylinder engine was proposed by Blata, but it did not reach the MotoGP grids. Presently four-cylinder engines appear to offer the best compromise between weight, power, and fuel consumption as all competitors in the 2009 series use this solution in either 'V' or in-line configuration.|$|E

25|$|In the 15th century, {{when the}} Sforza ruled the city, an old Viscontean {{fortress}} was enlarged and embellished {{to become the}} Castello Sforzesco, the seat of an elegant Renaissance court surrounded by a walled hunting park. Notable architects {{involved in the project}} included the Florentine Filarete, who was commissioned to build the high central entrance tower, and the military specialist Bartolomeo Gadio. The alliance between Francesco Sforza and Florence's Cosimo de' Medici <b>bore</b> <b>to</b> Milan Tuscan models of Renaissance architecture, apparent in the Ospedale Maggiore and Bramante's work in the city, which includes Santa Maria presso San Satiro (a reconstruction of a small 9th-century church), the tribune of Santa Maria delle Grazie and three cloisters for Sant'Ambrogio. The Counter-Reformation in the 16th–17th century was also the period of Spanish domination and was marked by two powerful figures: Saint Charles Borromeo and his cousin, Cardinal Federico Borromeo. Not only did they impose themselves as moral guides to the people of Milan, but they also gave a great impulse to culture, with the creation of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, in a building designed by Francesco Maria Ricchino, and the nearby Pinacoteca Ambrosiana. Many notable churches and Baroque mansions were built in the city during this period by the architects, Pellegrino Tibaldi, Galeazzo Alessi and Ricchino himself.|$|E
