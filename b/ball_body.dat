50|$|An {{exercise}} ball, {{also known}} as a Swiss Ball, is a ball constructed of soft elastic with a diameter of approximately 35 to 85 centimeters (14 to 34 inches) and filled with air. The air pressure is changed by removing a valve stem and either filling with air or letting the ball deflate. It is most often used in physical therapy, athletic training and exercise.It can also be used for weight training.The ball, while often referred to as a Swiss ball, is also known by a number of different names, including balance ball, birth <b>ball,</b> <b>body</b> ball, ball, fitness ball, gym ball, gymnastic ball, physio ball, pilates ball, Pezzi ball, stability ball, Swedish ball, therapy ball, or yoga ball.|$|E

40|$|We generalize the {{classical}} Hardy and Faber-Krahn inequalities to arbitrary functions on a convex body Ω⊂R^n, not necessarily vanishing on the boundary ∂Ω. This reduces {{the study of}} the Neumann Poincaré constant on Ω to that of the cone and Lebesgue measures on ∂Ω; these may be bounded via the curvature of ∂Ω. A second reduction is obtained to the class of harmonic functions on Ω. We also study the relation between the Poincaré constant of a log-concave measure μ and its associated K. <b>Ball</b> <b>body</b> K_μ.

40|$|Conventional {{ball valves}} {{are based on}} {{elastomeric}} sealing technologies which exhibit restricted wear resistance {{in the presence of}} network impurities while requiring high operating torques. In the described investigations, the elastomeric sealing of a 2 -inch floating ball valve was replaced by a metal-to-metal seating for attaining specific application requirements, without major dimensional changes. In order to avoid the use of elastomerics and achieve a high performance rating of the valve (Class VI shut-off), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were employed to predict the optimum contact geometry of ball/seating. A high accuracy contact was obtained through precision turning of the hardened metal shell (ball seating) and by grinding of its counter <b>ball</b> <b>body.</b> Both components, ball and seating, were appropriately heat treated and subsequently coated with a nanostructured diamond like carbon (DLC) coating, applied by physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques, providing superior surface strength characteristics and nearly frictionless operation. Nanoindentations provided information regarding the coatings properties, while nanoimpacts were employed to determine the impact abrasive wear of the developed components...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} ball convexity, {{considered}} in finite dimensional real Banach spaces, {{is a natural}} and useful extension of usual convexity; one replaces intersections of half-spaces by suitable intersections of balls. A subset $S$ of a normed space is called ball convex if it coincides with its ball hull, which is obtained as intersection of all balls (of fixed radius) containing $S$. Ball convex sets {{are closely related to}} notions like ball polytopes, complete sets, bodies of constant width, and spindle convexity. We will study geometric properties of <b>ball</b> convex <b>bodies</b> in normed spaces, for example deriving separation theorems, characterizations of strictly convex norms, and an application to complete sets. Our main results refer to minimal representations of <b>ball</b> convex <b>bodies</b> in terms of their ball exposed faces, to representations of ball hulls of sets via unions of ball hulls of finite subsets, and to ball convexity of increasing unions of <b>ball</b> convex <b>bodies...</b>|$|R

Patrick Hayashi, who stood quietly with a sheepish grin on his face as the scrum continued, eventually held the historic ball up for a TV camera to reveal that he had possession of it.
