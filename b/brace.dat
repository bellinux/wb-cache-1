5000|$|Traditional metal wired <b>braces</b> are {{stainless-steel}} and {{are sometimes}} used {{in combination with}} titanium. Traditional metal <b>braces</b> {{are the most common}} type of <b>braces.</b> These <b>braces</b> have a metal bracket with elastic (rubber band) ties holding the wire onto the metal brackets. The second-most common type of <b>braces</b> are self-ligating <b>braces</b> that do not require elastic ties. Instead, the wire goes through the bracket. Often with this type of <b>braces,</b> treatment time is reduced, there is less pain on the teeth, and fewer adjustments are required than with traditional <b>braces.</b>|$|R

40|$|The elasto- plastic {{behavior}} of <b>braced</b> frame becomes very complicated on the onfluence ofthe slender's ratio {{and the shape}} of cross section, etc. of <b>bracing</b> members. This is mainly be-cause of the instability of compression member. The <b>braced</b> frame is commonly used as K-braced or X <b>braced</b> frame. In such a case, the restoring force characteristics of the frame largelydepend upon the slender's ratio of the <b>braces</b> as following. (1) When the slender's ratio of the <b>braces</b> x is less than 30, the experiment of this <b>braced</b> frameproduces the stable hysteritic loops. (2) If the <b>braces</b> are relatively light (x> 200), the <b>braced</b> frame shows the deteriorating hysteri-tic loops. (3) The frame with ordinary <b>braces</b> (200 >x> 30) shows the reversed S-shaped hysteritic loops,which is caused by inelastic lengthening of the <b>braces</b> while in tension and by their bucklingwhen in compression. These tendencies of the <b>braced</b> frame are caused by the buckling of the <b>braces.</b> The authers would like to improve the restoring force characteristics by introducing the newbrace system, what we call, "Y-braced frame". The exprimental results and the elasto-plastic behaviors of "Y-braced frame" are describedin detail herein...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Bracing</b> {{elements}} and their connections {{have played a}} key role in the steel <b>bracing</b> frame energy dissipation through yielding and buckling. Whereas it is normally expected that gusset plates yield and buckle after that of <b>bracing</b> elements. Moreover, <b>bracing</b> elements buckling go with the plastic hinge formation in gusset plates. However, the geometry requirement to provide plastic hinge formation leads to larger and consequently thicker gusset plate. This article presents a research concerning steel <b>bracing</b> connection detail. In this proposed steel <b>bracing</b> connection, Hinge Plate manages the formation of the plastic hinge in the <b>bracing</b> connections. To verify the proposed idea a monotonic compression test was conducted on a <b>bracing</b> element; that was detailed with Hinge Plate. As a primary observational goal of the test, buckling mode of <b>bracing</b> element was depicted to be well managed by Hinge Plate. In addition, it was observed that the hierarchy of yielding in <b>bracing</b> element and then in Hinge Plate coincided with expected energy dissipation requirement in <b>bracing</b> frame...|$|R
5000|$|SureSmile has a lingual {{or behind}} teeth <b>braces</b> option called SureSmile QT. [...] With lingual <b>braces,</b> {{brackets}} are {{adhered to the}} underside of the teeth on the top arch, bottom arch or both arches. Most patients choose lingual <b>braces</b> for aesthetic reasons, as they cannot be seen. Orthodontists that offer lingual <b>braces</b> will often suggest putting lingual <b>braces</b> on the upper teeth and clear ceramic <b>braces</b> on the bottom though patients can choose to have lingual <b>braces</b> on both arches. A news segment on WGN-TV Medical Watch recently featured SureSmile QT and explains that the same SureSmile robotic technology is used for the behind teeth <b>braces.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, seismic {{analysis}} of multi storey RC building frames {{have been carried}} out considering different types of <b>bracing</b> systems. <b>Bracing</b> systems are very efficient in resisting lateral forces. STAAD. Pro software has been used for analysis purpose. Analyses of multi storey RC building frames are carried out in 2 parts I) Building frame without <b>bracing</b> systems and II) Building frames with <b>Bracing</b> systems Three different type of <b>bracing</b> systems i. e. X <b>Bracing,</b> K <b>Bracing</b> and V <b>Bracing</b> including <b>bracing</b> core and outer pattern have been considered. Results are collected in terms of maximum moments in beams, axial force, shear force, maximum displacement and storey displacement which are critically analysed to quantify the effects of various parameters. This approach focuses on the arrangement of <b>bracing</b> in a structure and their effectiveness in reducing the lateral displacement ultimately to achieve economy in construction with similar structural frames...|$|R

Revised design rules are proposed, which, if implemented, should solve the problems currently being experienced with timber roofs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the different mechanical behavior of column-bracing system between fixed-ended and pin-ended column base, {{a large number of}} column-bracing systems with fixed-ended and pin-ended column base were studied using the ANSYS program, in which random combination of the initial imperfections between columns and <b>braces</b> was well considered by the Monte Carlo method. Based on the above comparative study, probability density function of the <b>bracing</b> force was found through probability statistics and the design <b>bracing</b> force is obtained. The results show that the ultimate load-carrying capacity and the <b>bracing</b> forces of the mid-height horizontal <b>braces</b> of column-bracing systems with pin-ended column base are higher than that of column-bracing systems with fixed-ended column base, and the higher ultimate load-carrying capacity of the former more significantly increases the <b>bracing</b> forces of the mid-height horizontal braces; that the <b>bracing</b> forces of the mid-height horizontal <b>braces</b> in compression or in tension have also randomness because of the randomness of the initial imperfection of both columns and <b>braces...</b>|$|R

50|$|In general, <b>bracing</b> {{allows a}} stronger, lighter {{structure}} than {{one which is}} unbraced, but external <b>bracing</b> in particular adds drag which slows down the aircraft and raises considerably more design issues than internal <b>bracing.</b> Another disadvantage of <b>bracing</b> wires is that they require routine checking and adjustment, or rigging, even when located internally.|$|R
