40|$|The Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of The University of Texas at San Antonio {{conducted}} an archaeological {{survey of the}} proposed Retama/Selma Monopole Project for Southwestern Bell Wireless. The investigations included two <b>backhoe</b> trenches, four <b>shovel</b> tests, and a 100 -percent pedestrian survey of the project area and access road. The <b>backhoe</b> trenches and <b>shovel</b> tests did not encounter any subsurface artifacts or features, but the pedestrian survey discovered a lithic scatter in the access road. This site, designated 41 GU 39, contains an Early Archaic component as evidenced by a Gower point. The artifacts appear to be confined {{to the surface and}} a 10 -cm-thick plow zone.

40|$|From May to June 2002, the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR), The University of Texas at San Antonio, under {{contract}} with Texas Army National Guard (TXARNG), conducted National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and State Archeological Landmark (SAL) eligibility testing at selected sites within the Camp Maxey training facility in north Lamar County, Texas. The {{purpose of the}} current investigations was to assess, through excavation of <b>backhoe</b> trenches, <b>shovel</b> tests, and excavation units, the archaeological significance and NRHP and SAL eligibility of seven prehistoric sites (41 LR 137, 41 LR 214, 41 LR 222, 41 LR 225, 41 LR 233, 41 LR 244, and 41 LR 254) determined potentially eligible during a previous survey effort. This work was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 2809 issued to Dr. Steve A.

40|$|Test {{excavations}} were undertaken at 41 EP 880 {{in northwest}} El Paso County, Texas in January of 1994 by archeologists from the Environmental Affairs Division of the Texas Department of Transportation. The site is located along the lower portion of an alluvial {{fan of the}} Franklin Mountains overlooking the Rio Grande Valley. The project calls for an additional 18 m (60 ft.) of right-of-way {{in the vicinity of}} the archeological site, which extends both to the north and the south of the existing road. All additional right-of-way will be acquired from the northern side of Artcraft Road. Since the existing roadway cuts through the site, a large amount of disturbance is evident across the surface of the site. Testing, in the form of 1 m 2 test units, <b>backhoe</b> trenches, <b>shovel</b> tests, and the cutting of two profiles, indicated that the disturbances are extensive and extend into the new right-of-way. The information garnered about the site indicates that the portion of site to be impacted by road construction is not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Extensive disturbances have secondarily deposited much of the prehistoric occupational debris, leaving little in the way of intact subsurface deposits...|$|R
40|$|November 15 and 16, 2006, The Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio {{conducted}} an intensive survey of 3. 5 miles of Callaghan Road between Ingram and Bandera Roads and along Zarzamora Creek in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The City of San Antonio {{is planning to}} widen this section of Callaghan Road and to re-channelize Zarzamora Creek north of Callaghan Road to alleviate flooding in the area. The intensive linear survey was conducted under the Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4320 with Steve A. Tomka serving as Principal Investigator and Jennifer L Thompson as Project Archeologist. This project serves {{to satisfy the requirements}} of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The project area is in urban west San Antonio and crosses both residential and commercial zones. Buried utilities along Callaghan Road and Zarzamora Creek cross {{the entire length of the}} project area. Sections of new right-of-way (ROW) that are relatively undeveloped were selected for shovel testing while both side of Zarzamora Creek were examined by <b>backhoe</b> trenches and <b>shovel</b> tests in efforts to find deeply buried cultural deposits. Other sections of the roadway are paved making subsurface examination difficult. Because of the level of development, CAR targeted approximately. 35 miles of the 1. 5 new ROW along Callaghan Road. At Zarzamora Creek, wetland mitigation and efforts to reduce flooding will impact 2. 31 acres. CAR excavated <b>backhoe</b> trenches and <b>shovel</b> tests in portions of this area most suitable for excavation, away from construction dumps, buried utility lines, fences, etc. While some cultural material were found in one shovel test and in two backhoe trenches in the area of Zarzamora Creek, the artifacts were not in primary context or associated with other artifacts. Fire-cracked rock lay in association with modern plastic and construction material in one shovel test and with alluvial deposits above creek channel gravels in one backhoe trench. Because the APE has seen so much development and the limited cultural material recovered were in questionable context, CAR recommends that the planned construction project proceed. No artifacts were collected during this survey.

40|$|Prewitt and Associates, Inc., {{conducted}} test excavations at site 41 HM 46 in Hamilton County, Texas, {{to determine}} its eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The work was performed in September 2003 {{in conjunction with a}} proposed bridge replacement on County Road 294 over the Leon River. The excavations consisted of three <b>backhoe</b> trenches, eight <b>shovel</b> tests, and seven hand-dug test units totaling 7 m 3. Excavations yielded a small assemblage of chipped stone artifacts (tools, cores, and unmodified debitage), two features, and other cultural materials that appear to be associated with occupations ranging from the Late Archaic to possibly the Late Prehistoric. Although most of the artifacts and other cultural materials were recovered from an undisturbed cumulic soil, there was no clear vertical separation of deposits or discrete components. The low artifact frequency, lack of well-defined features, and scarcity of potential temporal indicators such as diagnostic tools or charcoal for radiocarbon dating make the site unlikely to yield important information. Based on these factors, it is recommended that 41 HM 46 be judged ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places...|$|R

The investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 2180. The Phase II testing fieldwork consisted of excavation of <b>backhoe</b> trenches, <b>shovel</b> tests, and excavation/test units across the sites to investigate significant cultural deposits encountered during the previous survey phases. In concert with the archaeological field investigations, the following special analyses and studies were performed to aid the determination of site integrity and eligibility: geoarchaeology, radiocarbon, lithic, native ceramic, and magnetic sediment susceptibility. The synthesis of these analyses has provided adequate data to determine temporal integrity and recommendation of National Register eligibility for 41 LR 152, 41 LR 164, 41 LR 186, and 41 LR 187. Further cultural resources investigations {{in the form of}} Phase III data recovery excavations are thus recommended for these sites prior to proposed development. Conversely, due to lack of significance criteria: sites 41 LR 153, 41 LR 155, 41 LR 156, 41 LR 157, 41 LR 158, 41 LR 160, 41 LR 163, 41 LR 168, 41 LR 170, 41 LR 202, 41 LR 204, 41 LR 207, 41 LR 208, 41 LR 212, 41 LR 260, 41 LR 266, 41 LR 268, 41 LR 285, and 41 LR 286 are recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and require no further cultural resource investigations...|$|R
40|$|In November of 2002 and March of 2003, a {{crew from}} the Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio {{conducted}} archeological and geoarcheological investigations along Salado Creek in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The {{purpose of this}} fieldwork was to investigate, using <b>shovel</b> testing and <b>backhoe</b> trenching, {{the impact of the}} proposed construction of an approximately three-mile-long hike and bike trail along the creek. The work included testing for the presence of the historic Alsbury Family Cemetery and Homestead that may be in close proximity to the trail’s right-of-way. Work was performed under contract with HNTB Corporation of San Antonio. This work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 2917, with Steve A.

40|$|From September through December of 2003, the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at The University of Texas at San Antonio {{performed}} archaeological {{testing and}} monitoring at site 41 BX 1598, the {{location for the}} proposed San Fernando Community Center. The site is adjacent to Military Plaza in downtown San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The work performed by CAR was done under contract with the San Antonio Archdiocese, and was conducted in accordance with and {{under the jurisdiction of}} the City Preservation Ordinance (Article VI, Historic Preservation and Urban Design, City of San Antonio, Unified Development Code). Dr. Steve Tomka served as the Principal Investigator and Antonia Figueroa was the Project Archaeologist. The proposed San Fernando Community Center will consist of a City Public Service (CPS) vault for utilities, two parking areas, and one large Community Center building. The initial phase of construction work consisted of excavations associated with the construction of the CPS vault. CAR’s involvement in the project was initiated after that excavation was complete and it became evident that the vault excavation cut through what appeared to be Colonial-age deposits. Using a variety of methods, including archival research, <b>backhoe</b> trenches, <b>shovel</b> tests, and hand excavations, CAR archaeologists sampled two Colonial-age middens, recorded a variety of wall segments, including one which may be Colonial in age, and documented use of the location from the 1700 s through the early 1900 s. Our work at the site recovered over 1, 400 ceramics, 174 pieces of metal, 181 fragments of glass, 291 pieces of chipped stone debitage, two projectile points, six gun flints, more than 13, 000 fragments of animal bone, and numerous pieces of burned rock. The remains of several domesticated and wild taxa, including bison, antelope, and fish, were recovered from the middens. Flotation analysis of matrix from one of the middens produced charcoal from a variety of different locally available woods, and while several carbonized mesquite seeds and nut shell fragments (pecan) were recovered, no domesticated species were present in the ethnobotanical samples. Analysis of the faunal material from the middens suggests the possibility that subsistence changed during the Colonial period. Faunal remains from the earliest deposits are dominated by small body sized animals, while later deposits reflect an increased emphasis on large and very large mammals. The stratified nature of selected midden deposits also allowed us to question some of the commonly assumed date ranges for selected ceramic types. Following the completion of field work, CAR obtained site trinomial 41 BX 1598 for the location from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin. After analysis, the bone and the burned rock were discarded in conformance with Texas Historical Commission guidelines and in agreement with the City of San Antonio Historic Preservation office. The remaining artifacts, along with all associated field and laboratory notes, project maps, photos, and other documents, are curated at the Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio under this trinomial...|$|R
40|$|An archaeological {{survey and}} a geoarchaeological {{investigation}} of four segments of new water line in west-central Sutton County, Texas {{was performed on}} March 30, 2009 and April 2 - 5, 2009 by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) and Charles D. Frederick (consulting geoarchaeologist) for the City of Sonora under Antiquities Permit 5202. The archival research indicated that several prehistoric sites have been recorded in the vicinity. One of the three segments (Area 4) had been examined by a professional archaeologist in 1970 and 1971 prior to construction of Interstate Highway 10. Since the proposed route of the water line in Area 4 passes within seventy-five feet of the Sutton County Cemetery, this area was evaluated {{in order to determine}} if scraping for unmarked graves would be necessary. In the segment adjacent to the cemetery, the new line will replace an existing line and will occupy the same footprint. Following a consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), it was decided that monitoring during the installation of the trench in this area would be required. At Area 2, a sparse scatter of one scraper, two flakes, two chert fragments, and fire-cracked rock was found on the surface. In addition, two pieces of burned limestone were observed within the A horizon of <b>Backhoe</b> Trench 2. <b>Shovel</b> tests were excavated {{in the vicinity of the}} backhoe trench, but no cultural materials were observed. Although the burned rock and the flake scatter may represent human activity in the project area, it was decided that the cultural materials were too few in number and too scattered to warrant assigning a site number. Previous disturbance by the landowner may have dispersed any concentration of cultural materials making it impossible to locate the locus of the site associated with these specimens. Copies of the final report have been submitted to the THC, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), Charles D. Frederick, the City of Sonora, and BVRA...|$|R
40|$|Archaeological test {{excavations}} were undertaken at 4 IBX 126 on Culebra Creek {{to offset}} the impact from a proposed Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) highway improvement project on Loop 1604 in northwest Bexar County. Archaeological investigations were conducted in three field seasons: the first two seasons were conducted by TxDOT archaeologists and the third was directed by personnel from the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of The University of Texas at San Antonio. During the three projects, 55 hand-dug units, 29 <b>backhoe</b> trenches, 36 <b>shovel</b> tests, and eight Gradall trenches were excavated. Seventeen features were recorded; 25 radiocarbon assays were conducted; over 59, 000 lithic artifacts were recovered and analyzed; 1, 655 liters of sediment float samples were processed; 3, 337 kg of burned rock were analyzed; and nearly 300 g of fatmal material and 25 archaeomagnetic samples were analyzed. The testing revealed utilization of the site in the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods. The analysis of materials and results of all three field efforts are presented in this single volume. Geoarchaeological investigations show that four terraces (TO, Tl, T 2, and T 3) in the immediate site area accumulated from the Late Pleistocene through the Holocene. Five Stratigraphic Units (I-V) make up these terraces and overlap one another. The T 2 terrace is composed of Stratigraphic Units IT, ill, and IV, while the Tl terrace consists mostly of Stratigraphic Units IV and V. Archaeological materials were discovered in situ within the Tl and T 3 terraces and primarily within Stratigraphic Units ill and IV. Radiocarbon assays indicate that Stratigraphic Unit IV formed between at least 4000 - 2000 B. P., Stratigraphic Unit ill accumulated between approximately 11, 500 - 4000 B. P., and Stratigraphic Unit IT was accreting at least 17, 500 years ago. Too little evidence exists to determine the full time ranges of sediment accumulation, and whether significant temporal gaps exist between the sedimentation of these geological units. Archaeological excavations focused on three separate areas: A, B, and C. Area A is a new right-of-way east of the existing right-of-way. Excavations in this area defined a Late Archaic Montell component dating to approximately 2700 B. P. These materials include two burned rock features in situ within Unit IV on the scarp of the T 2 terrace. This area probably was occupied by a small residential group during the Late Archaic period. Area B is east of Loop 1604 in the existing right-of-way and on the T 2 terrace. Area B contains a Middle Archaic Nolan component in the upper portion of Stratigraphic Unit ill, below a Late Archaic burned rock midden with a central subsurface oven in Unit IV. Area C is in the existing right-of-way west of Loop 1604. Excavations in this area investigated {{the possibility of an}} intact Early Archaic occupation; however, no evidence of one was found. In Area B, the Nolan component consisted of lithic artifacts scattered among small burned rock features that probably served as hearths. This component is radiocarbon dated to approximately 4600 B. P. The Late Archaic burned rock midden was apparently used between 4000 B. P. and 2000 B. P. Subfeatures within the central oven indicate multiple cooking events. Ethnographic evidence suggests earth ovens contained food wrapped with insulating material over a layer of hot rocks heated by a coal bed. This was capped with dirt to seal the oven. When cooking was complete, the earth cap is removed to reach the food. CAR conducted earth-oven hot-rock experiments which indicated that local limestone could be used once or at the most twice. Local hot-rock cooking should generate a great deal of burned limestone debris. The framework ofthe feature at 41 BX 126 represents the cap and rock heating-element dumpings from separate cooking events as well as a few small intact burned rock features that served as ovens or hearths. At the base of the midden were a few depressions that may represent borrow pits used to obtain sediment for the central oven cap. Mixing of temporally distinct artifacts from the Nolan and later occupations occurs in and beyond the midden due to sediment excavation and transportation across the site, and redeposition of materials through erosion of materials off the framework...|$|R
