50|$|In practice, due to {{the concept}} of limited liability, most {{companies}} in developed legal systems will be de facto bankruptcy remote from other members of the group (except in limited circumstances where creditors are permitted to pierce the corporate veil). However, in financial structuring, references to <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>remoteness</b> usually imply additional steps being taken to protect group members from attendant liability, such as by using an orphan structure to remove the legal ownership of the bankruptcy remote vehicle from the group, whilst retaining the economic benefits of it. Such structures are used where the vehicle's activities may give liability to the group as a whole, for example, under certain environmental protection legislation, or in relation to tax liabilities in certain countries.|$|E
40|$|How does asset {{encumbrance}} affect {{the fragility of}} intermediaries subject to rollover risk? We offer a model of covered bonds that features the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>remoteness</b> and replenishment of the asset pool that backs secured funding. Encumbering assets allows a bank to raise cheap secured debt and expand profitable investment, but it also concentrates risk on unsecured debt and thus exacerbates fragility. Deposit insurance or guarantees induce excessive encumbrance, shifting risks to the deposit insurance fund or the guarantor. Prudential regulation to correct this negative externality are limits on encumbrance, capital requirements, and surcharges on deposit insurance premia...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on a key {{property}} of asset-backed securities (ABS); namely, that ABS are designed to achieve "bankruptcy remoteness" of securitized assets from the borrowing firm. This provides lenders with protection from dilution that is not available with contracts such as secured debt. ABS allows firms to commit to more efficient investment decisions in bankruptcy. Securitization of replaceable assets (such as receivables) prevents inefficient continuation, but securitization of necessary assets can produce ex-post inefficiency, which favors secured debt. We test a prediction of our model using the LTV Steel bankruptcy, in which <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>remoteness</b> was successfully challenged. We find that ABS spreads for Chapter 11 [...] eligible securitizers increased significantly more than spreads for Chapter 11 [...] ineligible securitizers following LTV. The Author 2010.

40|$|Modern {{corporations}} use complex {{debt instruments}} and pursue acquisitions. In orderto analyze {{the properties of}} some of these contracts {{in the event of an}} acquisition, thispaper considers a company that has an incumbent capital structure, comprising one of five practically important structured debt contracts. An opportunity for an acquisition comes along that was not ex-ante contractible. The equityholder decides on the financing of this expansion by trading off tax advantages of debt against costs of bankruptcy. The modelyields a number of insights for structured debt and acquisitions, four of which are as follows: First, a seniority clause offers the bondholder protection from agency, but it also decreases the equityholder’s incentives to finance the acquisition. Second, embedded call options are valuable even if interest rates are constant, because they allow the equityholder to issue a new bond at fair value. Third, <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>remoteness</b> is valuable, if assets are very risky. Fourth, convertible bonds are vulnerable to agency and the conversion option bears the same incentive problem as a seniority clause. These properties explains, for example, the otherwise puzzling practice of companies buying out convertible bond holders prior to anacquisition...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a key {{property}} of asset-backed securities (ABS); namely, that ABS are designed to achieve “bankruptcy remoteness ” of the securitized assets from the borrowing firm. This provides lenders with maximal protection from dilution in bankruptcy that is not available with other contracts, such as secured debt. ABS can have real effects in allowing firms to commit to more efficient investment decisions in bankruptcy. We show that securitization of replaceable assets, such as accounts receivable, prevents inefficient continuation in bankruptcy, but securitization of neces-sary assets can lead to inefficient liquidations. In these circumstances, secured debt and/or leases can be preferred. We provide empirical support {{for the importance of}} <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>remoteness</b> in ABS contracts using a controversial decision in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of LTV Steel, in which a securitization contract was unexpectedly treated as a secured loan. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that ABS spreads for securitizers eligible for Chapter 11 increased significantly more than spreads for insured bank securitiz-ers, who are not Chapter 11 -eligible, in the period following the LTV filing. The results demonstrate that the creditor protection provided by “bankruptcy remoteness” is indeed valuable and priced in financial markets...|$|E
40|$|The {{past year}} has seen a {{dramatic}} pick-up on domestic securitizations in the People's Republic of China (PRC). This article {{provides an overview of}} the two main government-sponsored securitization schemes in the PRC-one administered by the China Bank Regulatory Commission (CBRC), the other administered by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The article mainly focuses on the legal, regulatory, constitutional, and other issues that must be addressed before a viable public crossborder securitization market out of China can be developed. As with many financial initiatives in China, the CBRC and CSRC schemes are fairly new, and as such untested or inadequately tested in PRC courts. Moreover, the CBRC and CSRC regulations are administrative regulations and not statutory law. Concepts such as legal isolation, commingling, and <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>remoteness</b> as they apply to securitizations are new to this market and untested in its courts. From a legal point of view, the single best thing that could happen for a securitization market to develop in China, for both domestic and cross-border transactions, is for the National People's Congress (NPC) to enact a securitization statute as other civil law jurisdictions in Asia, such as Korea, have done...|$|E
40|$|The {{future of}} housing finance is {{in a state}} of flux. In February 2011, the Obama Administration {{released}} a proposal outlining three plans for the future of housing finance. In all three plans, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will be phased out over a period of years and replaced with a private securitization market, which may be backed, in whole or in part, by a government guarantee. Whether the final plan relies upon government-guaranteed securities or private-label securities, Congress will have to resolve a range of complex legal aspects of securitization, from the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>remoteness</b> of pools of securities to setting national standards for loans and financing. One issue that does not appear to be getting much attention is the potential liability of the parties to a securitization for the unlawful actions of loan originators. In this paper, the authors take the position that any new housing finance system must clarify the liability of participants in the securitization pipeline so that the market can more accurately price securities up front and create incentives for more effective compliance programs to stop problem loans from entering the pipeline.

In this paper, we focus on a key property of these contracts; namely, that ABS are designed to achieve bankruptcy remotenessof the securitized assets from the borrowing 8 ̆ 5 rm. This pro-vides lenders with maximal protection from dilution in bankruptcy that is not available with other contractual forms, such as secured debt.

We show that securitization of replaceable assets, such as accounts receivable, is particularly valuable in preventing ine ¢ cient continuation in bankruptcy, but securitization of nec-essary assets can lead to ine ¢ cient liquidations. In these circumstances, secured debt and/or leases can be preferred because they provide stronger limitations on creditor rights. We provide empirical support for the model by examining the e¤ects on credit spreads in the ABS market following the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of LTV Steel, which cast doubt on the ability to achieve <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>remoteness</b> of securitized assets.

40|$|Annual {{issuance}} of {{asset backed securities}} reached to $ 3. 650 billion globally {{at the end of}} 2005 and the securitisation activities have taken several forms ranging from traditional securitisation transactions to different types of synthetic structures. Continuous studies for the establishment of international standards and harmonisation of national regulations for accounting and regulatory capital treatment of securitisation transactions, as constituent parts of International Accounting Standards and Basel II, resulted in a very complex and widely accepted framework for securitisation activities. Turkey has also been introduced to securitisation activities with future flow securitisation transactions backed by diversified payment rights, amounting to 4. 3 billion as of June 2006. Preparation of a draft law on housing finance recently, which is establishing the legal and regulatory infrastructure for housing finance and a general securitisation framework has increased the appetite of Turkish banks for traditional ABS transactions. As a result of my analysis and overview of major concepts and developments both in a domestic and international context, some necessary actions have been addressed for a well functioning securitisation market and mitigation of major risks in Turkish banking sector. These actions can be summarised as; the maintenance of tax neutrality and <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>remoteness</b> of the domestic SPV like structures, provision of hedging opportunities through derivative transactions, limiting the level of government intervention, avoiding crowding-out effect of public borrowing requirements, establishment of domestic credit rating agencies and a national rating scale and structuring of some transactions in domestic currency. It is strongly believed that a successful implementation of securitisation together with a well functioning housing finance system will have important contributions to economic development and stability of Turkey...|$|E
