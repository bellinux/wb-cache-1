500|$|Despite Blackpool's dominance, Arsenal {{managed to}} equalise seconds before half-time. From the left wing, Holton got the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> Eddie Shimwell {{by taking the}} ball off him, and {{proceeded}} to cross; the ball found Tommy Lawton who scored from the byline. Once play resumed in the second half, Blackpool struggled to reproduce {{the same kind of}} intensity that had merited their earlier lead. Arsenal dictated play the longer the match went on, and looked more assured in defence – The Times singled out Mercer’s growing influence, adding [...] "…one noticed the improvement of [...] Dodgin at centre-half, and the high promise of young [...] Wills, playing only his second game at right back." ...|$|E
5000|$|Steve Coote {{put up a}} valiant {{battle against}} Phil Taylor. The first set went to the {{deciding}} leg, and Coote held a 2-1 lead in the second - but Taylor always had the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> when it mattered and won the match 3-0.|$|E
5000|$|After this match, The Miz {{entered the}} ring and {{verbally}} berated the live crowd, insulting them and John Cena claiming, [...] "He's like a lovable loser, much like the Chicago Cubs." [...] He then turned his attention specifically to the Cubs' left fielder, Alfonso Soriano, who was in attendance, insulting him before being interrupted by Santino Marella, who took exception to The Miz's comments, leading to a fight between the two. The Miz got the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> ending by delivering a DDT. Chavo Guerrero also came out to attack Marella after comments made by the latter about Guerrero's aunt Vickie Guerrero.|$|E
5000|$|As Rocking/Uprocking developed, body {{movements}} called [...] "jerks" [...] {{and hand}} gestures called [...] "burns" [...] (as defined above in this article), would {{be added to}} emulate a fight against an opposing dancer. Being skillful in this new dance form, Apache would get the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> by skillfully using burns. Dancers throughout New York City in all Boroughs continued to invent new movements and gestures to create a street dance. Many gang members began to perform this dance. It became commonplace to see gang members hanging out in corners dancing against each other. Rocking/Uprocking became a competitive dance that caught on very quickly.|$|R
50|$|Fulk was {{a natural}} {{horseman}} and a fearsome warrior, with {{a keen sense of}} military strategy that saw him get the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>opponents.</b> He was allied with the goals and aims of the Capetians against the dissipated Carolingians <b>of</b> <b>his</b> era. With his county seat at Angers, Fulk’s bitter enemy was Eudes II <b>of</b> Blois, <b>his</b> neighbor 128 km east along the Loire River, at Tours. The two men traded towns, followers and insults throughout their lives.|$|R

50|$|In May, Monfils {{reached the}} semifinals of the Rome Masters, before losing to {{eventual}} champion Rafael Nadal in straight sets. En {{route to the}} semifinals, Monfils defeated former world No. 1 Andy Roddick. He then entered the Hamburg Masters event, where he lost in straight sets to fellow teenager Andy Murray in the first round. After that, he faced Murray once more, {{this time in the}} first round of the French Open. After a tough five-set battle, Monfils emerged victorious. Monfils then proceeded to play the Belgian Dick Norman in the second round. Once again, the match went to five sets, and Monfils got the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>opponent.</b> He then faced his toughest opponent yet, the American James Blake. Blake was the favourite for the win, as the eighth seed, while Monfils was seeded 25th. However, Monfils defeated Blake in another five-set match. Monfils described this run as a marathon. Blake said of Monfils that 'he was the fastest man on the tour'. The fourth round was Monfils' last, as he lost to Novak Djoković in straight sets.|$|E
50|$|Mackenzie's {{feud with}} the Macdonells of Glengarry {{may be said}} to have its origin in the revenge taken by two cousins of Glengarry for the murder of their fathers in Lochcarron in 1580. They burned the house of one of the murderers at Applecross, killing him and his family, and also slew in his bed Donald Mackenzie, who lived at Kishorn. Kenneth Mackenzie and Glengarry both went to Edinburgh to present {{complaints}} against each other, but Mackenzie is said to have got the <b>better</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> by producing before the Privy Council Donald Mackenzie's shirt, covered in his blood. Glengarry fled the city and, although repeatedly summoned, failed to put in an appearance. The Records of the Privy Council under the date show of 9 September 1602 that he was declared outlaw and rebel. A commission of fire and sword was granted to Mackenzie against him and all his followers, with a decree of ransom for the loss of those who were burnt and plundered by him, and for Kintail's charges and expenses, making altogether a very large sum.|$|E

Enough! you've knocked all the breath out of my body [...] Carry me off Old Bullion!" His appeal for help is to conservative Democratic senator Thomas Hart Benton, who stands to the left wondering, "I didn't think old Gas would have funked so soon; these d [...] d Barnburners must have frightened his pluck out of him. " One of the "Barnburners" (i. e., radical Democrats), former President Martin Van Buren (far left), comments, "If old Gas comes round in my neighborhood I'll give a poke that will soon settle his hash. " On the far right stands Henry Clay, who lost the Whig nomination to Taylor. His aside: "As I couldn't get the match myself I am glad Old Rough and Ready has got it. "Published by J.
