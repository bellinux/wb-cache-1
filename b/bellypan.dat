50|$|Designers and {{engineers}} of the Fiat 500e worked to minimize drag {{while keeping the}} iconic styling of the conventional powered Fiat 500. For the 500e to achieve a 0.311 coefficient of drag (Cd), {{as compared to the}} 2013 Fiat 500 Lounge model's 0.359 Cd, eight exterior refinements were developed in the wind tunnel to enable the 48 count drag reduction. The result of hours of wind-tunnel testing allowed the 500e to achieve an additional five miles of range compared to its gasoline-powered sibling. Among these changes are front fascia sealing, aerodynamically optimized front fascia design, drag reducing rear fascia design, liftgate-mounted aerodynamic spoiler, and Under vehicle <b>bellypans.</b>|$|R
