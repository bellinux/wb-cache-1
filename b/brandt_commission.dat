5000|$|Ten {{years after}} the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, most of the global {{environmental}} challenges had clearly not been adequately addressed. In several ways, these challenges had grown. Particularly, the underlying {{problem of how to}} reduce poverty in low-income countries through more productive and industrialized economy without, in the process, exacerbating the global and local environmental burdens, remained unresolved. Neither high-income countries in the North nor low-income countries in the South were willing to give up an economic development based on growth, but environmental threats, ranging from pollution, acid rain, deforestation and desertification, the destruction of the ozone layer, to early signs of climate change, were impossible to overlook and increasingly unacceptable. There was a tangible need for a developmental concept that would allow reconciling economic development with environmental protection. Views differed on several questions: were local environmental problems the result of local developments or of a global economic system that forced particularly low-income countries to destroy their environmental basis? Did environmental burdens result mainly from destructive economic growth-based development or from a lack of economic development and modernization? Would reconciling the economy and the environment require mainly technical means by using more resource-efficient technologies or mainly social and structural changes that would include political decision-making as well as changes in private consumption patterns?The 1980 World Conservation Strategy of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, was the first report that included a very brief chapter on a concept called [...] "sustainable development". It focused on global structural changes and was not widely read. The UN initiated an independent commission, which was asked to provide an analysis of existing problems and ideas for their solution, similar to earlier commissions such as the Independent Commission on International Development Issues (<b>Brandt</b> <b>Commission)</b> and the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues (Palme Commission).|$|E
40|$|The 1980 {{report of}} the <b>Brandt</b> <b>Commission,</b> calling for "a global {{agreement}} [...] . between oil producing and consuming countries" to assure adequate production at reasonable prices, states the gist of innumerable reports, articles, speeches, and resolutions, urging cooperation, dialogue, and interdependence. ...|$|E
40|$|Plans and {{proposals}} for stimulating {{the world economy}} and thus aiding economic recovery in the developing countries have been many and varied, ranging from massive transfer of resources, whether automatic or discretionary, through the immediate programme of the <b>Brandt</b> <b>Commission</b> to a concentration first of all on recovery in the industrial countries. This article takes a critical look at the most important proposals to date...|$|E
40|$|This article (1) {{analyzes}} the Willy <b>Brandt</b> <b>Commission</b> Report and the WHO Alma Ata Declaration within the socio-economic and political context that determined them, and (2) makes {{a critique of}} the ideological and political assumptions that both documents make. Through an assumingly apolitical and technological-administrative discourse both documents reproduce the major positions upheld by the hegemonic development establishments of the Western world. The article analyzes (through a study of what is being said and not said) how those positions appear in the documents. It is indicated that (1) their understanding of the causes of underdevelopment and its major health and disease problems and (2) their suggestions for change based on 'moral calls for social justice' and 'enlightened self-interest' are faulty and insufficient. Alternative explanations and solutions are presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Globally, {{the number}} of people in {{absolute}} poverty has been in decline for around 25 years, yet in Africa it is still increasing. The challenge of poverty reduction in Africa is of a different order from that elsewhere and will require different strategies (Collier, 2007). According to <b>Brandt</b> <b>Commission</b> (1980), cited in Henderson (1980), hundreds of millions of people in the poorer countries are preoccupied solely with survival and elementary needs. For them work is frequently not available or, when it is, pay is low and conditions often barely tolerable. Homes are constructed of impermanent materials and have neither piped water nor sanitation. Electricity is a luxury. Health services are thinly spread and in rural areas only rarely within walking distance. Primary schools, where they exist, may be free and not too far away, but children are needed for work and cannot be easily spared for schooling. Permanent insecurity is the condition of the poor. There are no public systems of social security in the event of unemployment, sickness or death of a wage earner in the family. In Ghana, according to Bortei-Doku, E., (2007), there is widespread evidence of social security failures among those who rely largely on their social assistance arrangements within the informal economy, indicating that this channel is no longer able to cushion workers and their families against shocks...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Brandt</b> <b>Commission</b> Report, {{published}} in 1980, broke ground in vital areas. It {{was the first}} international body to develop such concepts as interdependence, globalization, sustainable development, and alternative sources of development financing. It grappled with the difficult problem of global monetary imbalances, not in a vacuum, but rather, situated in the Commission’s stance that reforms in poverty, aid, debt, armaments expenditures, environment, technology, trade, and finance will not effectively meet their goals until they are supported by a totally-restructured monetary system. Virtually all sustainable development initiatives since then have missed that need for restructuring. The Brandt Report warrants this first treatment of a full political economic framing because the world continues to operate with those structural imbalances and faces a global economic crisis. Nations with current account deficits are required {{by the rules of}} the marketplace and international institutions to adjust their fiscal balances by paying off their loans. Yet nations with current account surpluses are not under similar obligation because there is no adjustment mechanism for recycling their trade surpluses and currency reserves. Compelling examples of this disequilibrium today are the current account imbalances between the surplus nations of China and other Asian states on the one hand, and deficit nations like the United States and United Kingdom on the other. A mitigating factor is the use of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, which allows the US to avoid adjusting its deficits on a timely basis. A major global financial adjustment is needed to eliminate the financial and monetary superbubble that has been forming {{as a result of these}} deep contradictions in the international system. The Brandt Report anticipated that unless these global imbalances were corrected through coordinated international action, there would be a series of sovereign debt crises, resulting in an emergency monetary readjustment. Brandt also demonstrated that any international stimulus program to merge the development needs of the global South, the underused capacity of the global North, and the needs of the entire world for a low-carbon environment, must be directly linked to the restructuring of the international monetary regime, including a new global currency and reserve system. A return to the principles and analyses spelled out in the Brandt Report is needed now to reform the global economic infrastructure. Brandt’s call for an international monetary conference to address these issues is even more pressing and salient today than it was 30 years ago...|$|E
