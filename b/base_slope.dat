50|$|At {{the same}} level of the Schwabentor, the water volume is {{regulated}} by means of a watergate. That way, 200 liters (according to a different source, 250 liters) of water can flow into the Bächle's network. Thereby it is completely refilled every 8 minutes. Thanks to the difference in altitude between east and west of Freiburg's old town, the Bächle flow downwards in a north-west direction with a natural <b>base</b> <b>slope</b> of 1° to 2°. The main distribution happens in Oberlinden. It's also possible to branch off some water in order to water the alte Linde (old lime-tree) from the year 1729. After running through the city, the water flows back into the canals at Predigertor. It is redirected into the Dreisam at the Höllentalbahnbrücke and near Lehen. However, some of the canal's water is also flowing from the northern stream course through different streams into the Glotter. Back when the Bächle were still used for the watering of fields, it was also redirected at the Christoffeltor and the Mönchstor over the city walls.|$|E
5000|$|Semerkhet's burial {{site was}} {{excavated}} in 1899 by archaeologist and Egyptologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie at Abydos {{and is known}} as [...] "Tomb U". While excavating, Petrie found no stairways like he did at the necropolis of Den and Adjib. He found a ramp, four metres wide and leading straight into the main chamber. The ramp starts around ten metres east outside the tomb and has a <b>base</b> <b>slope</b> of 12°. Inside the tomb the ramp shows irregular graduations. Petrie was also confused by {{the small number of}} clay seals. Only 17 seals were found. For archaeologists and Egyptologists, the complete arrangement of the burial site looks like the builders were pressed for time. When Petrie freed the ramp from sand, he found that the complete ramp was thickly covered in aromatic oil, which still gave off a scent. Beside the ramp several wooden and hand-made baskets and earthen jars were found. These were dated to the Ramesside era. Scholars now think that Semerkhet's tomb was re-opened and restored when Ramesside priests and kings saw the tomb of king Djer as the ritual burial of Osiris's head. The findings inside the main chamber included precious objects such as inlays and fragments of furniture (especially pedestals), copper-made armatures and jewelry made of ebony, amethyst and turquoise. Some vessels originating from the Levant were also found. They once contained Bescha oil, which was of great value to the Egyptians. Outside the tomb, close to the entrance, a damaged tomb stela made of black granite displaying Semerkhet's serekh name was excavated.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} dynamic {{centrifuge}} model tests {{was conducted in}} order to evaluate some factors affecting the seismic performance of hillside embankments consisting of sandy or silty soils and resting on stiff <b>base</b> <b>slope.</b> The effects of seepage water elevation in embankments, toe drain, embankment height, <b>base</b> <b>slope</b> inclination, soil compaction, and fill materials on the seismic behaviour of embankments were investigated. The test results showed that: (1) the seepage water {{was one of the}} most important factors for earthquake-induced embankment failure; (2) the seismic performance of both the smaller and higher embankments was remarkably improved by installing the toe drain; (3) larger <b>base</b> <b>slope</b> inclination produced larger earthquake-induced deformation of embankments; (4) well-compacted embankments were not vulnerable to earthquake-induced damage; and (5) the seismic performance of well-compacted embankments consisting of well-graded silty soils with large fines content was higher than that of poorly graded sands under otherwise the same condition. In some tests, as observed during past strong earthquakes, delayed flow failure occurred due possibly to the multiple effects of upward seepage associated with the redistribution of excess pore water pressures generated during main shaking, continued small vibration after main shaking, and driving static shear stresses caused by the embankment weight. A series of triaxial compression and cyclic triaxial liquefaction tests was also conducted to evaluate undrained behaviour of the fill materials. The correlation between the model and laboratory element test results was presented...|$|E

This physically unacceptable occurrence {{is due to}} a break-down in the mathematical methods used to obtain the solution. Using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, the solution valid in the near-surface region of a steady-state glacier is determined. The size of the near-surface or boundary-layer region is found to be of order S 1 /n, where S = hJL is the assumed small ratio of the characteristic thickness and length of the ice sheet and n is the exponent in Glen's power law.

This study focused on understanding the nature of flooding {{in areas that are}} outside of streams. Normally, flooding has been dealing with bursting of river banks but in Tsholotsho flooding has occurred in areas that are located far away from defined drainage networks. The study established the nature of problems associated with flooding as a preamble to flood hazard modelling. Logistic regression was applied in a spatial database that had been developed and managed within a GIS to estimate the prediction power of the environmental variables (height above channel <b>base,</b> <b>slope</b> of drainage basin, distance from the nearest stream and soil type) for flood occurrence. The results indicate that height above channel base significantly (p < 0. 05) predicted flood hazard for Hambeni and Sheleni while distance away from the nearest channel was significant (p < 0. 05) in predicting flood hazard for Ntibu.

40|$|Digital {{elevation}} model (DEM) {{data in a}} {{raster format}} {{can be used to}} automatically derive the drainage character istics of an area. A procedure has been designed that is capable of operating on matrices of elevation data having no algorithmically imposed size limit, while performing within the resolution and accuracy tolerances of the DEM data. Each cell is processed as the center of a 3 - by 3 -cell spatial window in the raster elevation data. If a cell is a local minimum in comparison with two of its non-adjacent neighbors, it is labeled as a drainage cell. The linkages of the drainage cells within user-specified distance and elevation thresholds are established in a separate pro cess. The products of these processing steps are digital masks of the drainage cells and the watershed basins, both in raster format. A drainage cell mask derived using this procedure is use ful in computing slope values for a raster data <b>base.</b> <b>Slope</b> has traditionally been calculated for each cell by fitting a plane through the eight nearest cells. However, if the terrain represented by these cells is V-shaped, such as a gully, a plane does not fit well; in fact, the desired slope value is the slope along the bottom of the gully, regardless of the steepness of the gully sides. The automated drainage process will label such a cell as a drainage cell, and its slope can then be computed from the elevation values of neighboring drainage cells...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{response}} to rainfall {{is a complex}} phenomenon that requires modeling of many sources of heterogeneity, whose variations can be relevant on various timescales and whose precise description requires {{a large amount of}} data inputs. Due to the great complexity of the problem, many simplifying assumptions are usually made in modeling landslides triggered by rainfall. As regards rainfall-induced shallow landslides, conventional approaches <b>base</b> <b>slope</b> stability analyses on the infinite slope model combined with hydrological models, which provide the time evolution of groundwater pressure head and volumetric water content. On the other hand, the response of geophysical quantities to water changes depends also on the variations in mechanical and hydrological properties. For this reason, we attempt a different approach to the problem of slope stability assessment by shifting the focus on the analysis of variations in geophysical properties. In this paper, starting from experimental resistivity data acquired in a test area, we perform a series of numerical simulations to study how changes in soil resistivity spatial distributions may affect the size of unstable areas. We use a simple cellular automaton whose states are defined by the values of a local and time-dependent geophysical factor of safety, which depends on soil electrical resistivity and slope inclination. We studied the probability of occurrence of rainfall-induced shallow landslide events by driving the system to instability through a decrease in electrical resistivity values. Numerical simulations are performed by varying number and intensity of the applied perturbations. Hazard scenarios obtained by in situ distributions of resistivity values are compared with those coming from initial random distributed resistivity values. Our results suggest possible critical rates of resistivity changes for triggering instability in the investigated area and point out the crucial role of resistivity variations in prediction of larger events...|$|E

Er zeigt aufgrund seiner Azonalitat überregional ein Vegetationsmosaik mit typischem Verteilungsmuster und bietet aufgrund seiner Isoliertheit ein Refugialpotential für Eiszeitrelikte sowie ein Evolutionspotential für Endemismen. Flechten-Gemeinschaften im zentralen, offenen Blockmeer sind im Untersuchungsgebiet nach dem Mikromosaik angeordnet: das Lecideetum lithophilae auf den horizontalen, das Lecanoretum sordidae auf den vertikalen Blockflächen, das Lecideetum lucidae auf den regenabgewandten Block-Unterseiten. Die Moos-Gemeinschaften, die üppig erst in den luftfeuchteren Blockmeer-Randbereichen gedeihen, sind v. a. nach dem Makromosaik angeordnet: Das Grimmietum ovatae im zentralen, offenen Blockmeer, das Andreaeetum petrophilae mehr randlich, das Rhacomitrietum lanuginosi am deutlich luftfeuchteren Hangfuß, das Grimmietum hartmanii und das Isothecietum myuri in den stark beschatteten Randbereichen und auf Blöcken im geschlossenen Wald.

The {{southern}} {{slope of}} the basaltic "Bauersberg" in the montane belt of the "Lange Rhön" is analysed for its flora and vegetation, especially on extensive rocky places with extreme conditions for plant life. These show a typical pattern of vegetation distribution, even in comparison with other regions. Because of the isolation in the landscape of open rocky places, they both offer a refuge for glacial relicts and pose a genetic requirement {{for the evolution of}} endemic organisms. Communities of epilithic lichens grow mostly on the rocks in the centre of the rubble {{slope of the}} "Bauersberg". Each rock shows a typical pattern of lichen communities: the Lecideetum lithophilae grows on horizontal surfaces, the Lecanoretum sordidae on vertical surfaces and the Lecideetum lucidae on the undersides, protected from rainfall. Communities of epilithic mosses grow mostly in more humid, shaded margins. Their vegetation pattern is related to the different conditions along the slope: In the centre grow only the small cushions of the Grimmietum ovatae; if it is a little more humid, it is replaced by the Andreaeetum petrophilae. Extensive blankets of the Rhacomitrietum lanuginosi grow in the clearly more humid area at the <b>base</b> <b>slope.</b> The most shaded epilithic habitats are, finally, occupied by blankets of the Grimmietum hartmanii and the Isothecietum myuri.

Twenty eyes served as controls. The average total slope angle and sector <b>based</b> <b>slope</b> angle of the cup, total contour area, effective area, neuroretinal rim area, half depth area, cup to disc ratio, contour variation, mean contour depth, average depth, volume below, half depth volume, and contour tilt were evaluated with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope.  RESULTS—The earliest changes in eyes with OHND or OHD started in the slope at the nasal inferior sector (p< 0. 05), followed by the superior and temporal superior sectors (p< 0. 05). The mean slopes in eyes with NTD and OHD were steeper than in controls (p< 0. 05).
