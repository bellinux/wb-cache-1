5000|$|PROSESS (Protein Structure Evaluation Suite & Server) is a freely {{available}} {{web server}} for protein structure validation. [...] It is {{specifically designed to}} assist with the process of evaluating and validating protein structures solved by NMR spectroscopy. Structure validation is a particularly important component of the structure determination pipeline as many protein structures have small structural errors (i.e. distorted bond lengths or angles, incompatible torsion angles, overlapping atoms) that are not easily detected by visual inspection. For protein structures solved by NMR spectroscopy, where large numbers of structures are generated and where coordinate inaccuracies are common, this problem is particularly acute. Most NMR-based structure validation protocols primarily use NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement), J-coupling or residual dipolar coupling (RDC [...] ) data to assess or validate structures. In particular, they try to assess the agreement between the experimentally observed and the calculated NOEs, RDCs and/or J-couplings. Good agreement between the calculated and observed parameters normally indicates a good structure. Other methods for structure validation (such as ProCheck, MolProbity, ResProx and VADAR) focus on measuring coordinate data, rather than experimental data, to assess the quality of the bond or torsion angle geometry. PROSESS is unique among structure validation servers in that it evaluates both coordinate quality and experimental data quality. Furthermore PROSESS is also able to use NMR chemical shifts (as well as NOEs) to assess or validate protein structures. Chemical shifts are easily and very precisely measurable NMR observables that provide {{a great deal of information}} about protein structure and dynamics (see Protein Chemical Shift Prediction). Specifically, PROSESS assesses the agreement between observed chemical shifts and ShiftX-predicted HA, CA, CB, N, C, and HN NMR chemical shifts. In addition to its ability to validate structures using chemical shifts, PROSESS also checks many other protein structure parameters including covalent <b>bond</b> <b>quality,</b> non-covalent bond and atomic packing quality, torsion angle quality and NOE quality (i.e. measuring the model agreement with NOE-based distance restraints). A total of 8 different programs (see PROSESS sub-programs below) are used in the PROSESS evaluation and validation process. PROSESS generates a richly detailed and very colorful structure validation report, including tables, color-coded images and graphs or bar charts. Many of the tables contain embedded hyperlinks to additional details or carefully written explanations. For most all of its graphs and charts, PROSESS uses a simple RAG (red, amber, green) color scheme to indicate the quality of different structure parameters for the protein (as a whole), for different members of the structure ensemble, for specific residues and for specific atoms. Different shades of red indicate serious problems, different shades of yellow or amber indicate potential problems and different shades of green indicate that the protein model or its residues/atoms are free of problems. Each color is also assigned a number (ranging from 0 to 9 -- with 0 being bad and 9 being excellent) so that the structure quality assessment is more quantifiable. PROSESS’s quality indices and quality color scales have been designed specifically to help non-structural biologists to more easily and rapidly understand protein structure validation reports. In addition to being able to validate NMR protein structures, PROSESS can be used to validate or evaluate any protein model, regardless of how it was solved (X-ray, NMR, comparative modelling, etc.).

The induced energy cost {{has opened the}} way to develop alternatives processes with low energy/ carbon materials such as Warm Mix (WMA). Their manufacturing requires specifics techniques to achieve similar performances to those of Hot Mix (HMA). However, the manufacturing temperature reduction can locally lead to imperfect bonding between bitumen and aggregates, although <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> measurement remains a challenge. This paper deals with mechanical performance of some mixes manufactured according to WMA processes in comparison to HMA. In addition, bitumen was extracted from the mixes and its rheological properties were studied. In a second step, the <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> was assessed by studying the heat fluxes exchanged between hot bitumen and warm aggregate in asphalt mix manufacturing conditions.

40|$|Purpose - This work aims to {{evaluate}} the influence of rheological properties of building materials on the <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> and ultimate tensile strength in the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, through the investigation of parts printed by semi-crystalline and amorphous resins. Little information is currently available {{about the influence of}} the crystalline nature on FDM-printed part quality. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-crystalline polyamide 12 and amorphous acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) were used to assess the influence of rheological properties on <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> and the tensile strength, by varying three important process parameters: materials, liquefier temperature and raster orientation. A fractography of both tensile and freeze-fractured samples was also investigated. Findings - The rheological properties, mainly the melt viscosity, were found to have a significant influence on the <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> of fused filaments. Better <b>bonding</b> <b>quality</b> and higher tensile strength of FDM parts printed with semi-crystalline PA 12, as compared with amorphous ABS, are suggested to be a result of higher initial sintering rates owing to the lower melt viscosity of PA 12 at low shear rates. Near-full dense PA 12 parts were obtained by FDM. Originality/value - This project provides a variety of data and insight regarding the effect of materials properties on the mechanical performance of FDM-printed parts.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{preparation}} of the surfaces to be bonded {{is critical to the}} success of composite bonds. Peel ply surface preparation is attractive from a manufacturing and quality assurance standpoint, but is a well known example of the extremely system-specific nature of composite bonds. This study examined the role of the surface energy, morphology, and chemistry left by peel ply removal in resulting <b>bond</b> <b>quality.</b> It also evaluated the use of contact angle surface energy measurement techniques for predicting the resulting <b>bond</b> <b>quality</b> of a prepared surface. The surfaces created by preparing three aerospace fiber-reinforced composite prepregs were compared when prepared with a nylon vs a polyester peel ply. The prepared surfaces were characterized with contact angle measurements with multiple fluids, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and x-ray electron spectroscopy. The laminates were bonded with aerospace grade film adhesives. <b>Bond</b> <b>quality</b> was assessed via double cantilever beam testing followed by optical and scanning electron microscopy of the fracture surfaces. The division was clear between strong bonds (GC of 600 - 1000 J/m 2 and failure in cohesion) and weak bonds (GC of 80 - 400 J/m 2 and failure in adhesion). All prepared laminates showed the imprint of the peel ply texture and evidence of peel ply remnants after fabric removal, either through SEM or XPS. Within an adhesive system, large amounts of SEM-visible peel ply material transfer correlated with poor <b>bond</b> <b>quality</b> and cleaner surfaces with higher <b>bond</b> <b>quality.</b> The both sides of failed weak bonds showed evidence of peel ply remnants under XPS, showing that at least some failure is occurring through the remnants. The choice of adhesive was found to be significant. AF 555 adhesive was more tolerant of peel ply contamination than MB 1515 - 3. Although the <b>bond</b> <b>quality</b> results varied substantially between tested combinations, the total surface energies of all prepared surfaces were very similar. Single fluid contact angle measurements/water break tests were therefore not predictive of <b>bond</b> <b>quality,</b> and are recommended against. The multiple fluids used allowed the construction of wettability envelopes, a more detailed look at the surface energy profile. The envelopes of nylon and polyester prepared systems were noticeably different, but while potentially useful for detecting changes or errors in surface {{preparation of}} known systems, they were not valid for predicting <b>bond</b> <b>quality</b> in new systems.

Thick Al wire bonding is a key technique for providing interconnections in power electronic modules. Today, wire bond lift-off and heel cracking are often considered the most lifetime limiting factors of power electronic modules {{as a result of}} cyclic thermomechanical stresses. Therefore, it is important for power electronic packaging manufacturers to address this issue at the design stage and on the manufacturing line.
