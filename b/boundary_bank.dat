5|$|Flint {{and bronze}} weapons have been {{discovered}} in the neighbourhood showing evidence of habitation during the Palaeolithic and Bronze Ages. Roman discoveries were made in 1607 and 1823. Middleton was mentioned as Mildentone and Mildetone in the Domesday Book as having three carucates of land much of which was woodland. The land was given to Ilbert de Lacy who had a castle at Pontefract. Middleton Park is a remnant of the manorial estate which existed after the Norman Conquest. In the 13th century the boundary between Middleton and Beeston {{became the focus of}} a protracted dispute over where it lay in the dense woodland which covered the area. The dispute between William Grammary and Adam de Beeston was settled in 1209 by single combat and resulted in the construction of a <b>boundary</b> <b>bank</b> and ditch, a stretch of which can still be seen in Middleton Woods.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{around the}} castle was carefully {{designed in the}} 14th century as a deer park or planned borough, and would have looked similar to those at the contemporary castles of Framlingham, Kenilworth, Leeds and Whittington; in particular, Kenilworth {{may have been a}} specific model for Dunstanburgh. The area around the castle was dominated by three shallow artificial lakes, called meres, and accessed by three gates on the north, west and south sides. The meres were fed from a fresh water spring 2,000 feet (600 m) inland, linked to the meres by an underground stone channel. The meres were originally bounded by a sod-cast <b>boundary</b> <b>bank</b> and ditch; today this is heavily eroded, and up to 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high. The main route by land into the castle would have been from the village of Embleton, through the West Gate.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the grave was clearly marked on the early editions of the O.S. maps. It was about midway along the northern boundary of the corner field facing the fortification, {{on the north side}} of the <b>boundary</b> <b>bank</b> and a few yards from it. It was formerly enclosed by a grove of trees, which can be seen in J. J. Reynold's photograph of 1903 but these were cut down about 1928. Some time later the stumps were dug out and the stone slab broken up and thrown on the adjoining bank. The metal plate had already been taken by souvenir hunters. It was Sarah Curran's desire to be buried here also but to this her father would not agree as he had come in for criticism on the previous occasion for burying his daughter in unconsecrated ground.|$|E

On the crown of Cotley Hill is a further Bronze Age tumulus surrounded by an Iron Age enclosure. Nearby to the northwest, {{on the side of}} Middle Hill, is the site of the deserted medieval village of Middleton, whose surviving earthworks consist of building platforms cut into lynchets and enclosed by a <b>boundary</b> <b>bank</b> and ditch, and a hollow-way. There are also signs of strip lynchets immediately to the north of Scratchbury Camp {{on the side of the}} hill. A Roman bronze spoon was found on or near Scratchbury Camp in 1804, and a Roman urn was found in the surrounding area before 1856 ...|$|E

Some areas were managed as wood pasture but by the early 19th century this practice had ceased, the land being converted to pasture or coppice woodland.|$|R
50|$|A {{settlement}} {{is a permanent}} or temporary community in which people live.

5000|$|Huntsham Castle, Devon, England is an Iron Age Hill fort {{enclosure}} {{near the}} village of Huntsham, it is located 260 m above sea level {{on the edge of the}} former Parish of Tiverton. The monument includes a slight univallate hillfort situated on a prominent hill overlooking the valleys of two separate tributaries to the River Lowman. The monument survives as a sub-circular enclosure, defining an area which slopes gently down to the south and measures approximately 150m in diameter. It is clearly demarcated on all sides by a rampart which varies in height from 1m up to 2.4m internally, being generally of greater height on the northern side of the enclosure. Externally this rampart is up to 2.9m high. Surrounding the rampart is an outer ditch which measures up to 5.4m wide and 0.4m deep and this is visible on all sides of the monument, although it is predominantly preserved as a buried feature. On the north eastern side, the outer edge of this ditch is defined by a field <b>boundary</b> <b>bank</b> and the infilled ditch has been used in the past as a track. There is an inturned entrance on the north eastern side which measures 7m wide, and the inturned banks are up to 2.2m wide and 0.4m high. The enclosure is crossed by a parish <b>boundary</b> <b>bank</b> which measures up to 2m wide and 1.5m high, and has been partially cut at the north eastern corner by a quarry, approximately 20m long, 15m wide and up to 2.8m deep, which lies to the north of the entrance. A further quarry lies to the south of the parish <b>boundary</b> <b>bank,</b> on the western side of the enclosure and measures 8.7m long, 5.3m wide and up to 1m deep. A third quarry lies to the north west and has partially cut into the ditch and rampart on this side; however much of this quarry lies just beyond the monument itself. A further entrance to the enclosure may lie on the western side, where the rampart is seen to kink slightly inwards. The stock proof fences around the rampart and ditch, the gates and gateposts which facilitate access, the Ordnance Survey triangulation point which is situated on the north eastern side of the enclosure just above the quarry, and the field <b>boundary</b> <b>bank</b> which defines the outer edge of the ditch in the north eastern corner are excluded from the scheduling, although the ground beneath all these features is included.|$|E
2500|$|The site is very flat, {{although}} there are several small clay or gravel pits, and an extensive network of <b>boundary</b> <b>banks</b> which {{date back to the}} Inclosure Acts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

This is a large circular enclosure with a diameter of 100 m and a stone and earth bank of 1 m high. In {{the interior of the}} enclosure there are traces of a smaller circular enclosure, with a diameter of 48 m. Ancient field <b>boundary</b> <b>banks</b> run across this site, seeming to divide it into four unequal segments, and the remains of five rectangular houses are visible in and around the site. In 1872 the remains of a souterrain in the south-west quadrant were excavated and animal bones were found.|$|R
50|$|Immediately west of Badbury Rings is {{the site}} of a Romano-Celtic temple. It is located within a polyogonal <b>boundary</b> <b>bank</b> visible on aerial photographs. It was {{excavated}} as early as 1900, and again in 1952. These excavations revealed stone roofing slabs, painted wall-plaster, and over 185 Roman coins, as well as 21 Durotrigian silver and bronze coins. Pottery, glass beads, bronze pins, a bracelet and a brooch were also recovered. Further excavations were conducted in 2000 which showed that the temple was in use from the 1st to 5th century AD.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{controversial}} debates in contemporary equity has been {{the extent to which}} equitable principles have a justified role in resolving commercial disputes involving fraud. On a much larger scale litigants are seeking equitable remedies for the recovery of their loss brought about by sophisticated commercial fraud.

Given {{the very nature of the}} property involved, and its movement across national <b>boundaries,</b> <b>banks</b> and other financial institutions which facilitate the movement of funds have found themselves to be in the centre of litigation involving the application of equitable principles. The sophisticated nature of the fraud and the elaborate means by which international banking is conducted has put increased pressure on equity lawyers to lay down comprehensive rules for the restitution of misdirected funds from third parties...|$|R

Around 1160 a [...] "plough-land", possibly the whole of the township, was granted to the recently founded Kirkstall Abbey (Leeds), and the monks made a grange here. However sometime later Richard de Elland (the son of the previous tenant) was allowed reclaim it, and Robert de Lacy (died 1193), lord of Clitheroe granted Accrington to the monks instead. Later returned to them, Kirkstall would hold Cliviger until 1287, when Henry de Lacy promised them a fixed-rent in exchange.
