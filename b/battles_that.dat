5|$|As noon {{drew near}} with no sight of either Huger or Magruder, who were {{supposed}} to be manning the Confederate right flank, Lee replaced these two forces with the smaller units of Brig.

Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north of the scene. Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill would be the first time during the Seven Days <b>Battles</b> <b>that</b> Lee managed to concentrate his force.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the Eastern Han, {{following}} the usurpation of Wang Mang and the re-establishment of the Han, the tribal elites of Nanyue remained loyal to the Han.

5|$|The {{battalion}} {{then began}} {{a program of}} battle preparation and, {{as a part of}} this process, on 20 January 1918 they were redesignated the 6th Machine Gun Battalion. The 15th and 23rd Companies were detached from the 5th Marine Regiment and assigned permanently to the 6th Machine Gun Battalion. After two months of intense training, in March the battalion was committed to the fighting against the Germans. Over the course of the nine months that remained in the war, it would take part in all of the major <b>battles</b> <b>that</b> US forces were involved in along the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August, the Luftwaffe {{began an}} all-out assault on RAF airfields. Christened Adlertag (Eagle Day), the raids saw the {{heaviest}} fighting thus far. Scrambling at 16:00 to intercept an incoming raid near Dover, 65 Squadron encountered {{large numbers of}} Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 51 led by Hannes Trautloft. Finucane claimed a Bf 109 shot down and damaged another, leaving the Messerschmitt streaming smoke. Finucane lost contact with it in cloud and he claimed as a probable. One Bf 109 was lost from JG 51 and the pilot wounded. Two more were 80 percent damaged. 65 Squadron suffered no losses. 0n 18 August Finucane {{was involved in the}} large air <b>battles</b> <b>that</b> characterised the campaign. 65 Squadron engaged Heinkel He 111 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 1 downing one of their number.|$|E
5|$|Ranked colonel at the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, Sturdee was raised to lieutenant general in 1940 and became Chief of the General Staff. He proceeded to conduct a doomed defence of the islands to the north of Australia against the advancing Japanese forces. In 1942, he successfully advised the government to divert the Second Australian Imperial Force troops returning from the Middle East to Australia. He then became head of the Australian Military Mission to Washington, D.C., where he represented Australia before the Combined Chiefs of Staff. As commander of the First Army in New Guinea in 1944–45, Sturdee directed the fighting at Aitape, and on New Britain and Bougainville. He was charged with destroying the enemy when opportunity presented itself, but had to do so with limited resources, and without committing his troops to <b>battles</b> <b>that</b> were beyond their strength.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Pioneer Battalion was an Australian {{infantry}} and light engineer unit raised for service during the First World War {{as part of}} the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Formed in Victoria in March 1916, the battalion subsequently undertook further training in the United Kingdom before arriving in France in late 1916. It later served on the Western Front in France and Belgium {{until the end of the}} war. Assigned to the 3rd Division, the 3rd Pioneer Battalion fought in most of the major <b>battles</b> <b>that</b> the AIF participated in between mid-1916 and the end of the war in November 1918. It was subsequently disbanded in early 1919.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{quickly turned}} the Tulagi anchorage, {{one of the}} finest natural harbors in the South Pacific, into a naval base and {{refueling}} station. During the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands campaigns, Tulagi served as an important base for Allied naval operations. Since the Japanese exerted control over the nearby seas at night throughout the Guadalcanal campaign, any Allied ships in the Guadalcanal area that could not depart by nightfall often took refuge in Tulagi's harbor. Allied ships damaged in the naval <b>battles</b> <b>that</b> occurred between August and December 1942 in the vicinity of Guadalcanal usually anchored in Tulagi's harbor for temporary repairs before heading to rear-area ports for permanent repairs.|$|E
5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a {{much longer}} and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites, running for over twenty years and {{incorporating}} twenty-four <b>battles</b> <b>that</b> led to massive casualties on both sides. The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course: the Samnites seized Neapolis in the Capture of Neapolis in 327 BC, which the Romans then re-captured before losing at the Battle of the Caudine Forks and the Battle of Lautulae. The Romans then proved victorious at the Battle of Bovianum and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies. This pattern of meeting aggression in force and so inadvertently gaining territory in strategic counter-attacks {{was to become a}} common feature of Roman military history.|$|E

5|$|The {{war between}} Tecumseh and Harrison {{merged with the}} War of 1812 when the {{remnants}} of the Indian Confederation allied with the British in Canada. The Siege of Fort Harrison is considered to be the United States' first land victory during the war. Other <b>battles</b> <b>that</b> occurred in the modern state of Indiana include the Siege of Fort Wayne, the Pigeon Roost Massacre and the Battle of the Mississinewa. The Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1814, ended the war and relieved American settlers from their fears of the nearby British and their Indian allies. This marked the end of hostilities with the Native Americans in Indiana. Of the 58 recorded incidents between Native Americans and the United States in Indiana during the 19thcentury, 43 were Indian victories.|$|E
5|$|Under Grant's peace policy, wars between settlers, {{the federal}} army, and the American Indians had been {{decreasing}} from 101 {{per year in}} 1869 {{to a low of}} 15 per year in 1875. However, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway, threatened to unravel Grant's peace policy, as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold. Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877. One of the highest casualty Indian <b>battles</b> <b>that</b> took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876.
