25|$|The J75 was {{somewhat}} {{larger than the}} J57 in the F-102A, and had greater mass flow. This demanded changes to the inlets to allow more airflow, and {{this led to the}} further refinement of using a variable-geometry inlet duct to allow the intakes to be tuned to best performance across a wide range of supersonic speeds. This change also led to the ducts being somewhat shorter. The fuselage grew slightly longer, and was cleaned up and simplified in many ways. The wing was slightly enlarged in area, and a redesigned vertical tail surface was used. The engine's 2-position afterburner exhaust nozzle was also used for idle thrust control. The nozzle was held open reducing idle thrust by 40% giving slower taxiing and less <b>brake</b> <b>wear.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of the race had fewer incidents, despite {{the surface of the}} circuit severely degrading {{over the course of the}} race. Nelson Piquet Jr. suffered another retirement, his fifth of the year from seven races, on the 39th lap because of abnormal <b>brake</b> <b>wear.</b> Piquet had also spun off the circuit earlier in the race while running in a points-scoring position due to brake failure, but fell to the back of the field before he reversed his car to get back onto the track. Piquet's teammate at Renault F1 and former world champion Fernando Alonso was running in a strong third place and was pushing Nick Heidfeld for second place before spinning off and damaging his front wing and suspension. Kazuki Nakajima broke his front wing after hitting the back of Jenson Button in turn ten on the 46th lap, and was forced to retire when the front wing detached itself completely and was stuck under the chassis as he was about to enter pitlane. Giancarlo Fisichella was running last after his car engine stalled during his first pit stop, and later he spun and hit the wall after the chicane at turn nine.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the weeks}} before the race, the sport's {{governing}} body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile's (FIA) race director Charlie Whiting, announced plans to introduce a ban on certain pit-to-car communications, with a particular emphasis on banning driver [...] "coaching"—such as describing a driver's sector times relative to another competitor—under Article 20.1 of the sporting regulations, which state that a driver must drive the car [...] "alone and unaided". Additionally, the FIA banned teams from sending drivers coded messages in the week running up to the Grand Prix either through radio or pit board, and at the next race {{of the season in}} Japan, they would be prohibited from sending information concerning the tyres and <b>brake</b> <b>wear.</b> After team principals raised concerns about the extent of the ban three days before the race, the FIA revised what teams could tell their drivers over the radio, including car performance and safety concerns. After persistent media speculation about his future at Caterham, the team confirmed that Kamui Kobayashi would take part in the race.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>brake</b> pad <b>wear</b> control {{algorithm}} used under uncritical braking conditions is proposed {{to reduce the}} difference in <b>brake</b> pad <b>wear</b> between {{the front and rear}} axles caused by the difference in braking force and the type of brake. The algorithm regulates the distribution of braking force within the limits of certain braking regulations according to the wear conditions of the brake pads while deceleration control still functions properly. Computer co-simulations of braking with Trucksim and Matlab/Simulink was performed in which vehicle models with equal <b>brake</b> pad <b>wear,</b> greater wear on the front axle and greater wear on the rear axle were used. The results show that the difference in <b>brake</b> pad <b>wear</b> between the front and rear axles can be reduced by distributing the braking force according to the wear conditions of the brakes when braking uncritically to reduce the time and cost needed in repair and maintenance...|$|R

2500|$|Due {{to a wider}} {{possible}} {{distance between}} the mounts and pads, cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres, such as on mountain bikes. Because the arms move only in their designed arcs, the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes. [...] Thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust. As the brake shoes of a second-class cantilever <b>brake</b> <b>wears,</b> they ride lower on the rim. Eventually, one may go underneath the rim, so that the brake does not function.|$|R
40|$|The present master thesis {{focuses on}} the study of <b>brake</b> lining <b>wear</b> calculation. This <b>brake</b> system {{regulation}} function is worldwide only provided in passenger cars of the BMW Group. It calculates continually the <b>wear</b> of <b>brake</b> linings and displays to the driver the kilometre availability, as part of the Conditioned Based Service. The task assignment consists in the analysis and improvement of the current <b>brake</b> lining <b>wear</b> monitoring function that is used by BMW. First of all, the preliminary required task would be to understand and analyse the current status of the <b>brake</b> lining <b>wear</b> calculation. For that purpose, {{it will be necessary to}} build up a simulation environment, in which the calculation algorithm could be tested. The virtual calculation results can be compared with available experimental data from brake test bench and vehicle tests. Furthermore, in order to understand wear process, a study of all possible influence variables on the <b>brake</b> lining <b>wear</b> will be required. The conclusion of this analysis will serve to design an experimental planning to test brake linings. Then, a method has to be developed to find out possible empirical equations of wear that fit the characteristic diagram obtained on the brake test bench. Finally, the models obtained must be tested and validated with real test bench wear measurements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{electric}} traction drive systems on {{basis of the}} induction motors fed by the static converters have lead to remarkable performances for the urban electric trains, concerning both the train dynamics and the environment issues. Moreover, the power converters {{on the basis of}} high techniques in the control electronics and the efficient anti-skidding systems have ensured the optimum traction characteristics and the minimum of the energy consumption. But, in case of the underground electric metro operation it is necessary to estimate the environmental impacts of the mechanical brake unrecovered energy, particularly the amount of the material developed (the <b>brake</b> blocks <b>wear)</b> in the mechanical brake process. Because this mechanical braking energy can be considered equal (as value) to the electrical energy (the active component) of the starting process, in the paper had been simulated a transient starting regime, using MATLAB software and SIMULINK-Sim Power Systems Extensions. Consequently, it had been evaluated the active <b>braking</b> material <b>wear</b> (the <b>brake</b> shoes <b>wear)</b> in the underground metro mechanical braking process, which has important environmental impacts.

25|$|When {{braking force}} is applied, {{the act of}} {{abrasive}} friction between the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust.

5000|$|Durability - Friction <b>brakes</b> have <b>wear</b> {{surfaces}} {{that must}} be renewed periodically. Wear surfaces include the brake shoes or pads, and also the brake disc or drum. There may be tradeoffs, for example a wear surface that generates high peak force may also wear quickly.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>brake</b> linings <b>wear,</b> {{the shoes}} must travel a greater {{distance}} {{to reach the}} drum. When the distance reaches a certain point, a self-adjusting mechanism automatically reacts by adjusting the rest position of the shoes {{so that they are}} closer to the drum. Here, the adjusting lever rocks enough to advance the adjuster gear by one tooth. The adjuster has threads on it, like a bolt, so that it unscrews a little bit when it turns, lengthening to fill in the gap. When the <b>brake</b> shoes <b>wear</b> a little more, the adjuster can advance again, so it always keeps the shoes close to the drum. Typically the adjusters only operate when the vehicle is going in reverse and the brakes are engaged.|$|R
