5000|$|Biodegradable {{polymers}} and biomaterials {{are also}} of significant interest for tissue engineering and regeneration. Tissue engineering {{is the ability}} to regenerate tissue with the help of artificial materials. The perfection of such systems can be used to grow tissues and cells in vitro or use a <b>biodegradable</b> <b>scaffold</b> to construct new structures and organs in vitro. For these uses, a <b>biodegradable</b> <b>scaffold</b> is obviously preferred as it reduces the risk of immunological reaction and rejection of the foreign object. While many of the more advanced systems are not ready for human therapeutics, there is significant positive research in animal studies. For example, it was possible to successfully grow rat smooth muscle tissue on a polycaprolactone/polylactide scaffold. Further research and development may allow for this technology to be used for tissue replacement, support, or enhancement in humans. One of the ultimate goals of tissue engineering is the creation of organs, such as the kidney, from basic constituents. A scaffolding is necessary to grow the entity into a functioning organ, after which the polymer scaffold would degrade and be safely eliminated from the body. There are reports of using polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid to engineer vascular tissue for heart repair. [...] The scaffold can be used to help create undamaged arteries and vessels.|$|E

The elastic modulus of the iTEV determined by an intravascular ultrasound imaging system was about 90 % of the native IVC after 1 month. Angiography of the iTEV after 2 years showed a well-formed vasculature without marked stenosis or thrombosis with a mean pressure gradient of 0. 5160. 19 mmHg.

For this, a nozzle-based rapid prototyping system was used to combine polylactic acid and a bioactive CaP glass to fabricate 3 -D <b>biodegradable</b> <b>scaffolds</b> with two patterns (orthogonal and displaced double layer). Scanning electron microscopy and micro-computer tomography showed that 3 -D scaffolds had completely interconnected porosity, uniform distribution of the glass particles, and a controlled and repetitive architecture.

This study examines the compatibility of NSCs and SCs with the poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid polymer scaffold and quantitatively assesses their potential to promote regeneration after a spinal cord transection injury in rats. NSCs were cultured as neurospheres and characterized by immunostaining for nestin (NSCs), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocytes), βIII-tubulin (immature neurons), oligodendrocyte- 4 (immature oligodendrocytes), and myelin oligodendrocyte (mature oligodendrocytes), while SCs {{were characterized by}} immunostaining for S- 100. Rats with transection injuries received scaffold implants containing NSCs (n[*]=[*] 17), SCs (n[*]=[*] 17), and no cells (control) (n[*]=[*] 8). The degree of axonal regeneration was determined by counting neurofilament-stained axons through the scaffold channels 1 month after transplantation. Serial sectioning through the scaffold channels in NSC- and SC-treated groups revealed the presence of nestin, neurofilament, S- 100, and βIII tubulin–positive cells.

New Zealand White rabbits were used to isolate osteoblasts from calvarial bone chips and bone marrow stromal cells from iliac crest bone marrow aspirates. Multilineage differentiation potential was evaluated in a 2 -D culture setting. After amplification, the cells were seeded within a fibrin matrix into a 3 -D polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold system. The constructs were cultured for up to 3 weeks in vitro and assayed for cell attachment and proliferation using phase-contrast light, confocal laser, and scanning electron microscopy and the MTS cell metabolic assay. Osteogenic differentiation was analyzed by determining the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin. The bone marrow-derived progenitor cells demonstrated the potential to be induced to the osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic pathways. In a 3 -D environment, cell-seeded PCL scaffolds evaluated by confocal laser microscopy revealed continuous cell proliferation and homogeneous cell distribution within the PCL scaffolds. On osteogenic induction mesenchymal progenitor cells (12 U/L) produce significantly higher (p < 0. 05) ALP activity than do osteoblasts (2 U/L); however, no significant differences were found in osteocalcin expression.
