5|$|The {{history of}} <b>breath-hold</b> <b>diving</b> goes {{back at least}} to {{classical}} times, and there is evidence of prehistoric hunting and gathering of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and self-contained breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|<b>Breath-hold</b> <b>diving</b> by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup of carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E
5|$|The blood shift causes an {{increased}} respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but slowed heartbeat reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly {{because of the}} diving reflex in <b>breath-hold</b> <b>diving.</b> Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and {{resistance to air flow}} in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume.

This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac arrhythmias are {{a common}} {{characteristic}} of the human diving response. As part of the diving reflex, increased activity of the cardiac parasympathetic nervous system not only regulates the bradycardia, but also is associated with ectopic beats which are characteristic of human heart function during <b>breath-hold</b> <b>dives.</b> Arrhythmias may be accentuated by neural responses to face immersion in cold water, distension of the heart due to central blood shift, and the increasing resistance to left ventricular ejection (afterload) by rising blood pressure. Arrhythmias commonly measured in the electrocardiogram during human <b>breath-hold</b> <b>dives</b> include ST depression, heightened T wave, and a positive U wave following the QRS complex, measurements associated with reduced left ventricular contractility and overall depressed cardiac function during a dive.|$|R

The difference in temporal pattern of bradycardia, in the dives and in the breath holds by the divers, may have been due to face immersion in cold water, chest compression, and/or redistribution of blood into the chest with concomitant stimulation of cardiac and other mechanoreceptors. Arrhythmias, mostly supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes, were observed coincidently with the lowest heart rates, presumably reflecting a high vagal tone.

25|$|Lungs: There {{is a risk}} pneumothorax, {{arterial}} gas embolism, and mediastinal and subcutanous emphysemas during ascent, {{which are}} commonly called burst lung or lung overpressure injury by divers. To equalise the lungs, all that is necessary is not to hold the breath during ascent. This risk does not occur when <b>breath-hold</b> <b>diving</b> from the surface, unless the diver breathes from an ambient pressure gas source underwater; breath-hold divers do suffer squeezed lungs on descent, crushing in the chest cavity, but, while uncomfortable, this rarely causes lung injury and returns to normal at the surface. Some people have pathologies of the lung which prevent rapid flow of excess air through the passages, {{which can lead to}} lung barotrauma even if the breath is not held during rapid depressurisation. These people should not dive as the risk is unacceptably high. Most commercial or military diving medical examinations will look specifically for signs of this pathology.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Scuba and breath-hold divers are {{compared}} {{to investigate whether}} endothelial response changes are similar despite different exposure(s) to hyperoxia. DESIGN: 14 divers (nine scuba and five breath-holding) performed either one scuba dive (25 m/ 25 minutes) or successive <b>breath-hold</b> <b>dives</b> {{at a depth of}} 20 meters, adding up to 25 minutes of immersion time in a diving pool. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured using echography. Peripheral post-occlusion reactive hyperemia (PORH) was assessed by digital plethysmography and plasmatic nitric oxide (NO) concentration using a nitrate/nitrite colorimetric assay kit. RESULTS: The FMD decreased in both groups. PORH was reduced in scuba divers but increased in breath-hold divers. No difference in circulating NO was observed for the scuba group. Opposingly, an increase in circulating NO was observed for the breath-hold group. CONCLUSION: Some cardiovascular effects can be explained by interaction between NO and superoxide anion during both types of diving ending to less NO availability and reducing FMD. The increased circulating NO in the breath-hold group can be caused by physical exercise. The opposite effects found between FMD and PORH in the breath-hold group can be assimilated to a greater responsiveness to circulating NO in small arteries than in large arteries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Here we use {{sound and}} {{movement}} recording tags {{to study how}} deep-diving Blainville’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) use echolocation to forage in their natural mesopelagic habitat. These whales ensonify thou-sands of organisms per dive but select only about 25 prey for capture. They negotiate their cluttered environment by radi-ating sound in a narrow 20 field of view which they sample with 1. 5 – 3 clicks per metre travelled requiring only some 60 clicks to locate, select and approach each prey. Sampling rates {{do not appear to}} be defined by the range to individual targets, but rather by the movement of the predator. Whales sample faster when they encounter patches of prey allowing them to search new water volumes while turning rapidly to stay within a patch. This implies that the Griffin search– approach–capture model of biosonar foraging must be expanded to account for sampling behaviours adapted to the overall prey distribution. Beaked whales can classify prey at more than 15 m range adopting stereotyped motor patterns when approaching some prey. This long detection range relative to swimming speed facilitates a deliberate mode of sensory-motor operation in which prey and capture tactics can be selected to optimize energy returns during long <b>breath-hold</b> <b>dives...</b>|$|R

[...] It, therefore, includes both the physiology of <b>breath-hold</b> <b>diving</b> in humans and other air-breathing animals, {{and the range}} of physiological effects generally limited to human ambient pressure divers either freediving or using underwater breathing apparatus. Several factors influence the diver, including immersion, exposure to the water, the limitations of breath-hold endurance, variations in ambient pressure, the effects of breathing gases at raised ambient pressure, effects caused by the use of breathing apparatus, and sensory impairment. All of these may affect diver performance and safety.|$|E
2500|$|Self-induced {{hypocapnia}}. [...] Hyperventilation {{leading to}} hypocapnia and subsequent loss of an appropriate urge to breathe is the mechanism behind shallow water blackout. [...] Many practitioners of deep water <b>breath-hold</b> <b>diving</b> use hyperventilation {{with the intention}} of extending their bottom time, so this mechanism is also relevant to deep water blackouts in those cases. If the diver has hyperventilated, the mechanism is essentially that for shallow water blackout but hypoxia is delayed by pressure at depth and sets in only when the pressure drops while surfacing. [...] This explains why divers who black out like this do so very close to the surface on their way up and why they may not have felt any urgency to breathe at all; fit, free-divers ascending from deep dives can black out without any warning.|$|E
2500|$|An ascent blackout, or {{deep water}} blackout, {{is a loss}} of {{consciousness}} caused by cerebral hypoxia on ascending from a deep freedive or breath-hold dive, typically of ten metres or more when the swimmer does not necessarily experience an urgent need to breathe and has no other obvious medical condition that might have caused it. [...] Victims typically black out close to the surface, usually within the top three metres, sometimes even as they break surface and have often been seen to approach the surface without apparent distress only to sink away. [...] It is quite rare for blackouts to occur while at the bottom or {{in the early stages}} of ascent; divers who drown in these stages are usually found to have inhaled water, indicating that they were conscious and succumbed to an uncontrollable urge to breathe rather than blacking out. [...] Victims are usually established practitioners of deep <b>breath-hold</b> <b>diving,</b> are fit, strong swimmers and have not experienced problems before.

40|$|Dolphins {{have adapted}} their {{anatomic}} structures {{to survive in}} the water environment and so far, the behaviour of their respiratory system during diving has not been fully understood, since they being protected species cannot be subjected to invasive analysis. Aim of this work is to model the tracheo-bronchial tree of the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus to study its behaviour during diving by coupling experimental in vitro mechanical characterisation of airways tissues to finite element computational analyses. Furthermore, a comparison was performed between the mechanical behaviour of tracheo-bronchial trees of dolphins and that of the goat, a terrestrial mammal, whose conformation of the upper airways {{is similar to that of}} the human, to determine how different structures respond to pressure in a controlled experimental set-up. The comparison between the goat and dolphin airways' mechanical behaviour highlights a lower collapsibility of the dolphin structure due to higher stiffness, lack of musculature and irregular shape of cartilaginous rings. Our data showed that the air entrapped into the airways plays a key role in avoiding the collapse. This effect is enhanced when accounting for the air flow escaping the alveoli that start to collapse during descent, even at depth as shallow as 10 m of sea water. The comparison between airways behaviour of marine and terrestrial mammals may help in shedding a light on the biomechanical behaviour of human airways during <b>breath-holding</b> <b>diving...</b>|$|R
