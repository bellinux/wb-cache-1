50|$|Sentence {{boundary}} disambiguation (SBD), {{also known}} as sentence breaking or sentence <b>boundary</b> <b>detection,</b> is the problem in natural language processing of deciding where sentences begin and end. Often natural language processing tools require their input to be divided into sentences {{for a number of}} reasons. However sentence boundary identification is challenging because punctuation marks are often ambiguous. For example, a period may denote an abbreviation, decimal point, an ellipsis, or an email addressnot the end of a sentence. About 47% of the periods in the Wall Street Journal corpus denote abbreviations. As well, question marks and exclamation marks may appear in embedded quotations, emoticons, computer code, and slang.|$|E

40|$|<b>Boundary</b> <b>detection</b> is a {{fundamental}} computer vision problem that is essential {{for a variety of}} tasks, such as contour and region segmentation, symmetry detection and object recognition and categorization. We propose a generalized formulation for <b>boundary</b> <b>detection,</b> with closed-form solution, applicable to the localization of different types of boundaries, such as object edges in natural images and occlusion boundaries from video.

Shoreline boundaries extraction from SAR data {{belongs to}} the <b>boundaries</b> <b>detection</b> problem {{in the field of}} image processing, in which image segmentation and edge detection algorithm are two conventional techniques to the <b>boundaries</b> <b>detection.</b> SAR data is generally interrupted by speckle. The presence of speckle makes edge detection algorithm in SAR data difficult and image segmentation inadequate. For the purpose of this study, the edge detection algorithm was utilized. Several edge detection algorithms (Sobel, Prewitt and Canny) were applied on Radarsat SAR imagery and compared for their ability on extraction of shoreline boundaries along the Kuala Terengganu shoreline, Malaysia. The Gamma filter was used for removing speckle on Radarsat SAR image and Gamma filter size 7 x 7 provided the best result. In this study, we proposed a combination of Canny edge detection algorithm with Thinning algorithm for the best extracting concave shoreline from Radarsat SAR imagery.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new module for heart sounds segmentation based on S-Transform. The heart sounds segmentation process segments the PhonoCardioGram (PCG) signal into four parts: S 1 (first heart sound), systole, S 2 (second heart sound) and diastole. It {{can be considered}} one of the most important phases in the auto-analysis of PCG signals. The proposed segmentation module can be divided into three main blocks: localization of heart sounds, <b>boundaries</b> <b>detection</b> of the localized heart sounds and classification block to distinguish between S 1 and S 2. An original localization method of heart sounds are proposed in this study. The method named SSE calculates the Shannon Energy of the local spectrum calculated by the S-transform for each sample of the heart sound signal. The second block contains a novel approach for the <b>boundaries</b> <b>detection</b> of S 1 and S 2. The energy concentrations of the S-transform of localized sounds are optimized by using a window width optimization algorithm. Then the SSE envelope is recalculated and a local adaptive threshold is applied to refine the estimated boundaries. To distinguish between S 1 and S 2, a feature extraction method based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the S-matrix is applied in this study.

40|$|<b>Boundary</b> <b>detection</b> {{in natural}} images {{represents}} an important but also challenging problem in computer vision. Motivated by studies in psychophysics claiming that humans use multiple cues for segmentation, several promising {{methods have been}} proposed which perform <b>boundary</b> <b>detection</b> by optimally combining local image measurements such as color, texture, and brightness. Very interesting results have been reported by applying these methods on challenging datasets such as the Berkeley segmentation benchmark. Although combining different cues for <b>boundary</b> <b>detection</b> {{has been shown to}} outperform methods using a single cue, results can be further improved by integrating perceptual organization cues with the <b>boundary</b> <b>detection</b> process. The main goal {{of this study is to}} investigate how and when perceptual organization cues improve <b>boundary</b> <b>detection</b> in natural images. In this context, we investigate the idea of integrating with segmentation the Iterative Multi-Scale Tensor Voting (IMSTV), a variant of Tensor Voting (TV) that performs perceptual grouping by analyzing information at multiple-scales and removing background clutter in an iterative fashion, preserving salient, organized structures. The key idea is to use IMSTV to post-process the boundary posterior probability (PB) map produced by segmentation algorithms. Detailed analysis of our experimental results reveals how and when perceptual organization cues are likely to improve or degrade <b>boundary</b> <b>detection.</b> In particular, we show that using perceptual grouping as a post-processing step improves <b>boundary</b> <b>detection</b> in 84 % of the grayscale test images in the Berkeley segmentation dataset. 1...|$|E

30|$|By {{analyzing}} the results, a few issues are open for future investigation. First of all, from the performed experiments for both metric parameters tuning and metric performance effectiveness assessment, {{a key factor}} for a successful comparison of NR and FR metrics {{is represented by the}} temporal realignment algorithm. In the presence of highly textured backgrounds, severe frame losses, and medium to high compression ratios, at least our implementation of the VQMNTIA algorithm does not provide reliable estimates of the variable delay between the original and decoded videos. This implies a potential bias in the estimated NR metrics induced by the wrong selection of the reference frame to be used for the comparison. Furthermore, we noticed that the adopted key-frame detection algorithm has an impact on overall distortion evaluation, since many elements, considered in the proposed metric, depend on the shot <b>boundaries</b> <b>detection.</b>|$|R
