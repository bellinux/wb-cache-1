5000|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>grinding</b> is a {{versatile}} process suitable {{for all kinds}} of different applications. There are three different applications of the <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> technology: ...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common methods is wide <b>belt</b> <b>grinding.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> {{process is}} {{variable}} by adjusting certain parameters such as belt speed, grinding pressure, feed speed, durometer of the contact drum, {{size of the}} contact drum and the abrasive belt that is used. The machines {{can be made for}} wet or dry operation. Furthermore, a wide <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> machine can be constructed with single or multiple heads. The first head is used for coarse grinding and the next heads gradually make a finer finish. Wide <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> is also used as a high stock removal method for special metals (e.g. stainless steel, titanium, and nickel alloys).|$|E
50|$|Grinding with coated {{abrasives}} {{has recently}} become {{a viable alternative}} for high stock removal through developments in machine tool and <b>grinding</b> <b>belt</b> technology.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>grinding</b> with coated {{abrasives}} can be {{an attractive}} process because the large surface area of the recirculating belt tends to carry away heat and prevent local hot spots. The productivity of this technology is, in many cases, three times that of rotary or reciprocating vertical grinders. [...] As a result, <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> is replacing traditional grinding technologies {{in the field of}} the specialty metal processing.|$|E

50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>grinding</b> is an {{abrasive}} {{machining process}} used on metals and other materials. It is typically {{used as a}} finishing process in industry. A belt, coated in abrasive material, is run over the surface to be processed in order to remove material or produce the desired finish.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{consideration to}} the approaches to designing new grinding tools on flexible backing - flap grinding wheels and <b>grinding</b> <b>belts</b> having abrasive grains with certain form and orientation in their structure.

30|$|The current complex {{spiral groove}} {{polishing}} techniques used mainly include manual or semi-manual polishing, {{the use of}} a belt, wheel polishing, and electrochemical polishing [25 – 27]. Among these, manual polishing is inefficient, and the surface processing effect is greatly influenced by the technical level of the workers, the processing consistency is poor, the production environment is harsh, and the health of the operators is impaired [25]. In addition, accessibility to the <b>belt</b> used in <b>grinding</b> wheel polishing for complex inner surfaces is not high, and cannot meet the processing requirements. Moreover, the problem of environmental pollution caused through the use of chemical solutions when applying electrochemical polishing needs to be solved [26].|$|R
40|$|The {{grinding}} process {{is important for}} treatment of the wood surface. There are many different machines for a sanding wood, whether manual or mechanical. By the correct grinding of a wooden surface it is achieved better final result. The thesis describes factors that influence the course of grinding. The main factors {{are the kind of}} wood, the moisture, the selected grinding tool and the technical condition of the machine. The main objective of the study is to determine and compare the change of surface roughness when changing the grit of the sanding <b>belt</b> and the <b>grinding</b> angle. There were chosen three angles at which the samples were grinded. The study also investigates relation between the coarse grit of the sanding belt and roughening of the surface. The research was conducted on the tree species beech (Fagus sylvatica). A second objective of the study is to prepare the background for the laboratory exercise and the lecture on the topic of grinding materials...|$|R
5000|$|Belt grinder, {{which is}} usually used as a {{machining}} method to process metals and other materials, {{with the aid of}} coated abrasives. Analogous to a belt sander (which itself is often used for wood but sometimes metal). <b>Belt</b> <b>grinding</b> is a versatile process suitable for all kind of applications, including finishing, deburring, and stock removal.|$|E
5000|$|To {{achieve the}} above objectives, it is {{essential}} to look in more detail to the variables which affect them. These include the work material properties, the grit and abrasive type of the grinding belt, belt speed, belt sequences, contact wheel hardness and diameter, serration, type of lubricant (or dry) and grinding pressure. Changing these variables will affect the performances of the <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> process.|$|E
40|$|At present, <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> {{is widely}} used in the leading {{branches}} of the national economy. The rotary <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> process has a complex stochastic nature, {{which leads to a}} dispersion of product quality parameters and does not allow to use all possibilities of this method, {{due to the lack of}} an adequate mathematical description of the process. The article is devoted to the development of the theoretical and probabilistic model of the rotary <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> process...|$|E
40|$|Issue: In {{producing}} recycled rubber, {{one has to}} {{be aware}} of the possibility of experiencing objects and materials that may cause contamination. This includes both objects that are foreign as well as materials that are included in the product being recycled that would be objectionable in the final product. In many instances, various types or grades of rubber may be incompatible when blended together. Incompatibility can lead to poor processing and performance characteristics. Best Practice: In the recycling of tires the obvious concern is over dirt, mud, and foreign matter that might be contained on or in the tire. These materials would lower the quality of a recyclate into which they are incorporated. Stones are an area of primary concern since they can do damage to processing equipment as well as contaminate the final product. Therefore, it is necessary to use general sanitary conditions that eliminate extraneous matter from the process. Within some OE and specialty tires there is a layer of tire sealant for puncture resistance. This layer (Gen-Seal, Royseal, etc.) is usually soft, composed of low molecular weight polymer, resin, and filler, and is partially cured. This layer should be avoided if possible because it can cause downstream problems when working with small particle size materials. Other contaminants of concern in tire, hose, and <b>belt</b> recycling and <b>grinding</b> are the textile and stee...|$|R
40|$|The Oort Cloud, the Kuiper Belt and the Scattered Disk are {{dynamically}} distinct {{populations of}} small bodies evolving {{in the outer}} regions of the Solar System. Whereas their collisional activity is now quiet, gravitational interactions with giant planets may have shaped these populations both dynamically and collisionally during their formation. Using a hybrid approach (Charnoz & Morbidelli 2003), the present paper tries to couple the primordial collisional and dynamical evolution of these three populations in a self-consistent way. A critical parameter is the primordial size-distribution. We show that the initial planetesimal size distribution that allows an effective mass depletion of the Kuiper <b>belt</b> by collisional <b>grinding,</b> would decimate also the population of comet-size bodies that end in the Oort Cloud and, in particular, in the Scattered Disk. As a consequence, the Scattered Disk and the Oort Cloud would be too anemic, by a factor 20 to 100, relative to the estimates achieved from the observation of the fluxes of long period and Jupiter family comets, respectively. For these two reservoirs to have {{a sufficient number of}} comets, the initial size distribution in the planetesimal disk had to be such that the mass depletion by collisional erosion of in the Kuiper belt was negligible. Consequently, the current mass deficit of the Kuiper belt, needs to be explained by dynamical mechanisms. Comment: Accepted in ICARUS with minr modifications. 47 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{feasibility}} of utilizing petroleum coke as alternative fuel in cement kilns was investigated. The study is a tempt to reduce cost of production in which the fuel represents more than 30 % {{because of the high}} price of fuel oil which ranges between 205 to 215 $ compared with the price of petroleum coke between 40 to 50 $ (FOB). The goal of the study is to optimize process control and alternative fuel consumption while maintaining clinker product quality. The analysis of cost estimation is based on kiln No (3) in Atbara Cement Factory with a design capacity of 750 ton / day. The investigations included the evaluation of petcoke characteristics and advantages through physio – chemical and thermal treatment analysis for sample – 1 (Elsiwez Refinery – Egypt) and sample – 2 (Homs Refinery – Syria). Firing by petcoke required some modifications in the burning system and addition of pulverization mill, storage bunkers, and <b>belt</b> conveyors for <b>grinding</b> petcoke in powder to facilitate flowing through nozzle. The firing can be applied single or dual system to enable operating any of the two systems according to conditions available. The results revealed that : • The metal content in petcoke particularly vanadium and nickel if high causes hard burning and this may be overcomed by fine grinding for petcoke. • The high sulfur content of petcoke may cause operational problems in cement kilns, like blockage of cyclones and also environmental pollution by emissions thus it is necessary to add small dose of raw meal (limestone) to reduce sulfur. The study approved effectiveness in cost reduction when switched over from fuel oil to petcoke...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{majority}} of aero-engine components are designed and manufactured with nickel-based superalloy GH 4169 in mind. There is little information {{available in the}} literature related to <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> processes of aero-engine components. Up to now, limited research {{has been reported in}} the use of belt for grinding aero-engine components made of nickel-based superalloy GH 4169. A case study of an abrasive <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> performance applied on nickel-based superalloy GH 4169 in manufacturing processes is presented, aiming to investigate the possibility of using <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> as a operation for components made of nickel-based superalloy GH 4169. For the ‘optimised ’ grinding conditions, the belt service life is evaluated by changing grinding parameters (grinding speed, contact force and oscillation frequency), and the following output measures are obtained: material removal, belt wear and grinding ratio. As a result, the maximum grinding ratio of G is 8. 8, it could be concluded that <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> might be considered as a viable process for grinding aero-engine components...|$|E

40|$|Results {{obtained}} from two component Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements on three different 1 : 50 generic high-speed train configurations hauled through a water towing tank over a smooth (Plexiglas) and a rough (<b>grinding</b> <b>belt)</b> ground at a specd of 4 m/s are presented. Principally, the three different generic highspeed train configurations arc {{based on the}} samc model (front car, two cars and tail car). The smooth generic high-speed train configuration (smooth GHSTC) reflects no bogies and covers the bogie cut outs and inter car gaps, the rough generic highspeed train configuration (rough GHSTC) is obtained by removing the bogies and leave the bogie cut outs and inter car gaps open and for the generic high-speed train configuration (GHSTC) the bogies are not removed but the inter car gaps are left open. A PIV set-up was chosen that the light sheet defines a vertical plane (XZ) between {{the ground and the}} train in the symmetry line of the train. Comparing the PIV results obtained for thc GHSTC with full scale measuremcnts, {{it was found that the}} same ftow structures develop in the vicinity of the head and the tail of the train. But, the measured underfloor U-velocity of the downscaled model measurements did not reach the same value as those measured for the full scale high-speed train. The reason which is ascribed to the better aerodynamic underframe of the train model in the downscaled model measurements. The flow field underneath the GHSTC was fully developed at the bcginning of the second car, in agreement to the full scale measurcments. For the three train configurations three different flow fields underneath the train were obtained. The lowest vclocities were found for the smooth GHSTC and the highest for thc rough GHSTC. Further, the ground roughness changed the flow fields underneath the different train configurations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{flexible}} {{contact and}} machining with wide strip are two prominent advantages for the robotic <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> system, {{which can be}} widely used to improve the surface quality and machining efficiency while finishing the workpieces with sculptured surfaces. There lacks research on grinding path planning with the constraint of curvature. With complicated contact between the contact wheel and the workpiece, the grinding paths for robot {{can be obtained by}} the theory of contact kinematics. The grinding process must satisfy the universal demands of the <b>belt</b> <b>grinding</b> technologies, and {{the most important thing is}} to make the contact wheel conform to the local geometrical features on the contact area. For the local surfaces with small curvature, the curve length between the neighboring cutting locations becomes longer to ensure processing efficiency. Otherwise, for the local areas with large curvature, the curve length becomes shorter to ensure machining accuracy. A series of planes are created to intersect with the target surface to be ground, and the corresponding sectional profile curves are obtained. For each curve, the curve length between the neighboring cutting points is optimized by inserting a cutter location at the local area with large curvatures. A method of generating the grinding paths including curve length spacing optimization is set up. The validity is completely approved by the off-line simulation, and during the grinding experiments with the method, the quality of surface is improved. The path planning method provides a theoretical support for the smooth and accuracy path of robotic surface grinding...|$|E
