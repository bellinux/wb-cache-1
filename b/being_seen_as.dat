5|$|However, the boar and its {{relative}} the pig started <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> polluting since the 12th century, due to Muslim influence on India. Muslims consider the pig and its meat unclean. This {{led to a}} decline in Varaha worship to a certain extent.|$|E

5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} have accepted these numbers, {{especially since the}} ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point. Other authors reject this number, with 1,207 <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> more of {{a reference to the}} combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was therefore spurred {{in part by a}} desire to form a stronger political current, rather than <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union. Trotsky believed that its formation was all the more urgent for the role he saw it playing in the impending World War.|$|E

5|$|The tor {{and other}} sites in Glastonbury {{have also been}} {{significant}} in Goddess worship, with the flow from the Chalice Well representing menstrual flow and the tor <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> either a breast or the whole figure of the Goddess. This has been celebrated with an effigy of the Goddess leading an annual procession up the Tor.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> early as the second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Sue's cheer squad loses at Regionals for {{the first}} time in seven years, and she is named Loser of the Year in a {{televised}} interview with Katie Couric. Furthering her ire, the cheerleading budget is slashed due to the cannon <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> endangering the lives of children. The money is then handed over to the glee club so they can pay to go to regionals. Karofsky dismisses Finn's suggestion that he join the glee club permanently. Finally, Quinn kisses Finn, telling him that his actions have reminded her of why she loved him.|$|E
50|$|Despite <b>being</b> {{traditionally}} <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a by-election {{that determined}} {{the fate of}} the Coalition, the election largely ignored it. All three candidates denounced its continued existence and focused on both what would replace the Coalition and local issues.|$|R

5|$|These {{numbers are}} (by ancient standards) consistent, {{and this could}} be {{interpreted}} that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis. Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number1,207 <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> more of {{a reference to the}} combined Greek fleet in the Iliadand generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> lacking in places and the latter being held back by other {{factors such as the}} limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in frame rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful computer to run the game properly, {{and the fact that the}} game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} the region's terrain and {{rainfall}} were totally inappropriate for growing groundnuts, {{as well as the}} project's ultimate cost and failure, led to the scheme <b>being</b> popularly <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a symbol of government failure in late colonial Africa.|$|R
5|$|Henry is of Antillean heritage: his father, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La Désirade island), and his mother, Maryse, is from Martinique. He {{was born}} and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, despite {{sometimes}} <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities. As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football. He joined US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-Châtillon and played there for two years. US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry's future mentor, followed him there.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Specter faced a {{challenge}} in the Republican primary election from conservative Congressman Pat Toomey, whose campaign theme was that Specter was not fiscally conservative enough. The match-up was closely watched nationally, <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a symbolic clash between the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party. However, {{most of the state}} and national Republican establishment, including the state's other senator at the time, Rick Santorum, closed ranks behind Specter. Specter was supported by President George W. Bush. Specter narrowly avoided a major upset with 51% of the primary vote. Once Specter defeated the challenge from the right, he was able to enjoy great support from independents and some Democrats in his race against Hoeffel. Hoeffel trailed Specter in name recognition, campaign funds and poll results. Although the two minor candidates were seen as more conservative than Specter, they were only able to take 4% of the vote and Specter was easily reelected.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers {{began to}} find {{objects in the}} same region of space as Pluto (now known as the Kuiper belt), and some even farther away. Many of these shared several of Pluto's key orbital characteristics, and Pluto started <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the largest member of {{a new class of}} objects, plutinos. This led some astronomers to stop {{referring}} to Pluto as a planet. Several terms, including subplanet and planetoid, started to be used for the bodies now known as dwarf planets. By 2005, three trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) had been reported. It became clear that either they would also have to be classified as planets, or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers were also confident that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly if Pluto were to remain a planet.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{has so far}} come in {{for major}} criticism, with the original title's aerial and ground-based gameplay <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> repetitive and dull, although some reviewers found it entertaining. Drakengard 2 also came in for such criticism, although minor improvements were cited. In contrast, the gameplay of Drakengard 3 was generally praised or seen as an improvement upon the previous two entries, though the dragon-riding segments came in for criticisms for difficult controls. Opinions were divided on Niers unconventional mix of gameplay styles from multiple game genres, with some praising the variety and others seeing it as poorly executed. The series {{as a whole has}} gained a cult following in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} hosted by Mumbai because the {{franchise}} {{owner of the}} Mumbai Indians placed the highest bid for acquisition, which was 111.9 million. Before the match, ESPNCricinfo assistant editor Nagraj Gollapudi identified the Royals as the most likely winner. Despite <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the underdogs, the Royals finished {{at the top of}} the league table, and won 11 matches out of 14 with 22 points. The Super Kings stood third, behind Kings XI, getting 16 points from eight wins. There were two changes in the Royals' playing eleven for the final; Graeme Smith and Mahesh Rawat were replaced by Kamran Akmal and Niraj Patel. Smith was ruled out of the match as he was suffering from a hamstring injury. The Super Kings fielded the same side as in its semi-final win over the Kings XI.|$|E
5|$|The number 1,207 appears {{very early}} in the {{historical}} record (472 BC), and the Greeks appear to have genuinely believed they faced that many ships. Because of the consistency in the ancient sources, some modern historians are inclined to accept 1,207 as the size of the initial Persian fleet; others reject this number, with 1,207 <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad, and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean. However, very few appear to accept that there were this many ships at Salamis: most favour a number in the range 600-800. This is also the range given by adding the approximate number of Persian ships after Artemisium (~550) to the reinforcements (120) quantified by Herodotus.|$|E
