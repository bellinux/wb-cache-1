500|$|Speculation {{surfaced}} that Coolio {{had actually}} given permission but later changed his mind, or that Yankovic's record label {{had lied to}} Yankovic {{in the hopes that}} the song would become popular. Yankovic later stated on VH1's Behind the Music that he had written a sincere letter of apology to Coolio which was never returned, and that Coolio never complained when he received his royalty check from proceeds of the song. A series of photos taken at the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, and a post on the [...] "Ask Al" [...] feature on Yankovic's website suggested that Yankovic and Coolio made amends. According to Yankovic, he was very surprised when Coolio came over to chat. He later joked on his site's Q feature that, [...] "I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2004, Domínguez made {{international}} headlines {{when she}} signed a two-year contract for second division men's team, Atlético Celaya, in Guanajuato, Mexico. Domínguez {{said of the}} signing, [...] "The thing is, that in Mexico we don't have even a decent amateur league for women, {{so you have to}} look for other options... I knew that the decision could go either way, but were expecting a yes. The hard thing is going to be equaling the physical force of the men, but the technique, the desire, the willpower, those are things that I already have." [...] While the Mexican Football Association did not object, they deferred to FIFA headquarters in Zurich for an official ruling. FIFA ruled against mixed-sex football teams stating, [...] "There must be a clear separation between men's and women's football." [...] Furthermore, a ban was placed on Domínguez for playing in an exhibition game outside the league but still alongside men. [...] "I just wanted to be given the chance to try," [...] Domínguez said. [...] "If I failed I would have been the first to say I can't do it, the first to admit it doesn't work. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> would have tried." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon {{was a little bit}} quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't think I could have caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. What can you do in these conditions? Okay, the car's roadholding is not bad. We must work very hard now. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> finished, that's something." ...|$|E
6000|$|The young baronet {{shook his}} head. [...] "My {{personal}} honour {{is as yet}} unstained," [...] said he. [...] "I have little else left, <b>but</b> that, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> will preserve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in any {{tangible}} {{shape to}} such as <b>I,</b> <b>but</b> this <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> know. In {{spite of the}} destruction of the mortal clay, when I can see my way no further, and lose courage in my task, fresh strength comes to me after a night spent here." ...|$|R
60|$|ANTHONY. He goes, the coward! Ay, is {{this more}} of your contrivance? Madam, you make me blush. <b>But</b> to-day <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> know where I can find him. This afternoon, on the Pantiles, he must dance {{attendance}} on the Duke of York. Already he must be there; {{and there he is}} at my mercy.|$|R
2500|$|Victoire Pisa {{returned}} to Japan {{at the end}} of the year but was unable to reproduce his early season form. He finished thirteenth behind Buena Vista in the Japan Cup and eighth behind Orfevre in the Arima Kinen. He was retired from racing {{at the end of}} December. Sumii commented on the colt's retirement by saying that [...] "I feel I should apologise to him because I couldn't get him back to his best <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> am happy that I can send him to the stud without any further accidents". Victoire Pisa was named Japanese Champion Older Male for 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the show was not {{revealed}} in the Indian media until the show officially went on air on 6 May 2012. There were also no get-togethers, parties or press conferences organized to discuss the content, {{leading up to the}} premiere of the show. However, various sources reported the show to be based on [...] "the common man" [...] rather than being fictional. Also, based on its content, it was mostly referred as a talk show discussing social issues like child labour, health problems and other issues affecting the country. Khan, who is known for keeping secrecy for his movies, was quoted saying, [...] "I don`t want to talk much about how the show will be, and about its format. I want everyone to see it directly on TV." [...] However, commenting on the theme of the show, he said, [...] "The show is about meeting the common man of India, connecting with India and its people." [...] He also added, [...] "Through this show we understand the problem of the people, we are not here to make a change. I am no one to change anything. I don`t think I am in the position to change anything else. I feel understanding a problem and feeling it or holding one's hand or hugging is also important. I may not have the solution, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> can hear and understand." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, Björn, not so," [...] Eric answered: [...] "but, as thou sayest, I am but a farmer, {{and since}} my father, Thorgrimur Iron-Toe, died things {{have not gone}} too well on Ran River. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> am a free man, and I will take no gifts that I cannot repay worth for worth. Therefore I {{will not have the}} ring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{therefore}} I {{venture to}} make the request. The subject is not one on which I can speak openly, without regret, at the present moment. <b>But</b> to you, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> promise that I will explain it all before I leave Courcy." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ah!' {{said the}} Queen, 'I {{know very well}} what that means--you have nothing good to say; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> beg {{that you will not}} hide {{anything}} from me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I hate you, Hokosa, and yet {{can strike}} you only through my tongue and your mad love for me. I am fast in your power, <b>but</b> thus <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> {{can make you}} feel {{something}} of my own pain. Hark! I hear that woman at the gate. Will you give her back the basket, or will you not? Whatever you may choose to do, do not say in after days that I urged you to the deed." ...|$|R
6000|$|In the wind's eye I have sailed, and sail; but for [...] The stars, I own my {{telescope}} is dim; [...] <b>But</b> <b>at</b> the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> have shunned the common shore, [...] And leaving land {{far out of}} sight, would skim [...] The Ocean of Eternity:[527] the roar [...] Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim, [...] But still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float [...] Where ships have foundered, as doth many a boat.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am not a}} fish at all,' {{said the}} new-comer, {{swallowing}} {{a great deal of}} salt water as she spoke; for you cannot learn how to be a proper fish all in a moment. 'I am not a fish <b>at</b> all, <b>but</b> a girl; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> was a girl a few minutes ago, only--' And she ducked her head under the waves so that they should not see her crying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Swift!" [...] he said, as he tore his gown from him, [...] "there is no escape, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> can die {{fighting}} for you. Give me my mail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'"Irene is my wife," [...] I answered. [...] "I {{offer no}} excuse {{to you for}} my conduct, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> {{have the right to}} try and win her forgiveness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{promise to}} be of much use, Major," [...] he said quietly. [...] "I know myself too well; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> can run my chance of being killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|CASHEL. To me, perfection. Oh, they condescend [...] With a rare grace. Your duke, who condescends [...] Almost to {{the whole}} world, might for a Man [...] Pass {{in the eyes of}} those who never saw [...] The duke capped with a prince.

[...] Oh, at such moments I could wish the Court [...] Had but one breadbasket, that with my fist [...] I could make all its windy vanity [...] Gasp itself out on the gravel. Fare you well. [...] I did not choose my calling; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> [...] <b>I</b> can refrain from being a gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish I could lighten it,' said Captain Cadurcis. 'I fear I am {{somewhat}} selfish in wishing you {{to marry}} my cousin, for {{then you know}} I should have a permanent and authentic claim to your regard. <b>But</b> no one, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> think so, can feel more deeply interested in your welfare than I do. I never knew any one like you, and I always tell Cadurcis so, and that I think makes him worse, but I cannot help it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps I {{should never}} have been able to answer it <b>at</b> all <b>but</b> for one of the {{photographs}} which, as I thought, though lying loose by itself, formed part of the same series. It represented the end of a hundred-yard race, with the winners coming in at the tape by a pavilion with a flag-staff. On the staff a big flag was flying loosely in the wind. The folds hid half of the words on its centre from sight. <b>But</b> this much <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> could read: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How goes it, laddie?' he asked. 'They told me grim Death had {{clutched}} you and borne {{you off to}} his charnel-house; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> see {{an angel}} has charge of you.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have come}} to know so much of love that I know now what love might be. We loved, scarred and stained; we parted--basely and inevitably, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> met love.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In {{that case}} I can draw only one conclusion. There {{appears to be}} no means of {{bringing}} you to justice, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> can tell you what an indescribable blackguard I think you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing--as <b>I</b> perceive. <b>But,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> study generosity. <b>I</b> {{tell you}} frankly, ma'am, that in Blood's place I {{should never have}} been so nice. Sink me! When you {{consider}} what he has suffered at the hands of his fellow-countrymen, you may marvel with me that he should trouble to discriminate between Spanish and English. To be sold into slavery! Ugh!" [...] His lordship shuddered. [...] "And to a damned colonial planter!" [...] He checked abruptly. [...] "I beg your pardon, Miss Bishop. For the moment...." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, now {{the thought}} {{came back to}} me with a bitter repentance, that if I had only {{converted}} all the islanders, they would never have dreamed of sacrificing me in honour of a mere idol! Why had I been so lukewarm, why had I backslidden, why had I endeavoured to make myself agreeable by joining in promiscuous dances, when I should have been thundering against Pagan idolatry, holy water, idols, sacrifices and the whole abominable system of life on the island? True, I might have goaded them into slaying me; I might have suffered as a martyr; <b>but,</b> <b>at</b> the <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> would have deserved the martyr's crown. And now I was to perish at the stake, without even the precious consolation of being a real martyr, and was to be flogged into the bargain.|$|R
5000|$|On September 16, 2015, Matt Damon {{made what}} Salon termed a [...] "non-apology" [...] apology when he stated, [...] "I am sorry that they {{comments}} offended some people, <b>but,</b> <b>at</b> the very <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> am happy that they started {{a conversation about}} diversity in Hollywood." [...] This was {{in reference to the}} backlash against Damon after he made comments about diversity to African American film producer Effie Brown on the September 13, 2015 debut of the HBO show Project Greenlight that were criticized as condescending.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> {{might have}} kissed my mother before I came away, left her some message, {{reassured}} her {{at least for}} a little while. All night she would listen and wait for me. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|He {{took the}} old man's {{hand and said}} in a broken voice, [...] "Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> shall go with you and wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I merely want, Mr. Jaggers," [...] said I, [...] "to assure {{myself that}} what I {{have been told}} is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> may verify it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven!" [...] she thought, [...] "how {{careless}} have I been--how weak! It is he, not I, {{that stands}} in this eternal peril; it was he, not I, that took the curse upon his soul. It is for my sake, and {{for the love of}} a creature of so little worth and such poor help, that he now beholds so close to him the flames of hell--ay, and smells the smoke of it, lying without there in the wind and moonlight. Am I so dull of spirit that never till now I have surmised my duty, or have I seen it before and turned aside? <b>But</b> now, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> take up my soul in both the hands of my affection; now I say farewell to the white steps of heaven and the waiting faces of my friends. A love for a love, and let mine be equalled with Keawe's! A soul for a soul, and be it mine to perish!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, beloved," [...] said Leo. [...] "The {{life of the}} humblest {{of those}} men is of as much value to him as mine is to me, and thou hast no more right to kill him than thou hast to kill me. It is evil that because thou carest for me thou shouldst suffer thy love to draw thee into cruelty and crime. If thou art afraid for me, then clothe me with that {{immortality}} of thine, which, although I dread it somewhat, holding it a thing unholy, and, on this earth, not permitted by my Faith, I should still rejoice to inherit for thy dear sake, knowing that then we could never more be parted. Or, if as thou sayest, this as yet thou canst not do, then let us be wed and take what fortune gives us. All men must die; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> before <b>I</b> die I shall have been happy with thee for a while--yes, {{if only for a}} single hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] said Roderick, {{throwing}} {{himself back}} with a yawn. [...] "But I must let it pass. I have seen enough for the present; I have {{reached the top of}} the hill. I have an indigestion of impressions; I must work them off before I go in for any more. I don't want to look at any more of other people's works, for a month--not even at Nature's own. I want to look at Roderick Hudson's. The result of it all is that I 'm not afraid. I can but try, as well as the rest of them! The fellow who did that gazing goddess yonder only made an experiment. The other day, when I was looking at Michael Angelo's Moses, I was seized with a kind of defiance--a reaction against all this mere passive enjoyment of grandeur. It was a rousing great success, certainly, that rose there before me, but somehow it was not an inscrutable mystery, and it seemed to me, not perhaps that I should some day do as well, <b>but</b> that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> might!" ...|$|R
