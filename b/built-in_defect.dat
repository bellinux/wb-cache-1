40|$|In this paper, the new p-version of {{the finite}} element method {{has been used for}} the {{numerical}} modelling of ultrasonic wave propagation in solid media. The p-method involves increasing the polynomial order of the interpolation functions to achieve convergence. This is unlike the conventional h-version in which the number of elements is increased to achieve the same goal. Illustrative examples of wave propagation through an isotropic aluminium block, including a case with a <b>built-in</b> <b>defect</b> {{in the form of a}} crack, have been discussed. Also, a convergence criterion has been developed for dynamic problems. The potential to extend this model to other applications such as medical ultrasonics or to a more complex anisotropic medium is significant. PublishedN/...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel NAND {{flash memory}} {{controller}} was designed. A t-EC w-bit parallel Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquengham (BCH) error-correction code (ECC) was designed for correcting the random bit errors of the flash memory chip, which is suitable for the ran-domly bit errors property and parallel I/O interface of the NAND-type flash memory. A code-banking mechanism was designed for the tradeoffs between the controller cost and the in-system programmability (ISP) support. With the ISP functionality and the Flash parameters programmed in the reserved area of the flash memory chip during the card production stage, the function for supporting various kinds of NAND flash memory {{could be provided by}} a single controller. In addition, <b>built-in</b> <b>defect</b> management and wear-leveling algorithm enhanced the product life cycle and reliability. Dual channel accessing of the Flash memory provided the good performance in data transfer rate. With respect to the proposed controller architecture, a real secure digital card (SD) /multimedia card (MMC) flash memory card controller chip was designed and implemented with UMC 0. 18 m CMOS process. Experimental results show the designed circuit can fully comply with the system specifications and shows the good performances.

40|$|Software for {{automated}} test equipment can be tedious and monotonous making {{it just as}} error-prone as other software. Active defect prevention and detection are also important for test applications. Incomplete or unclear requirements, a cryptic syntax used for some test applications—especially script-based test sets, variability in syntax or structure, and changing requirements are among the problems encountered in one tester. Such problems are common to all software but can be particularly problematic in test equipment software intended to test another product. Each of these issues increases the probability of error injection during test application development. This report describes a test application development tool designed {{to address these issues}} and others for a particular piece of test equipment. By addressing these problems in the development environment, the tool has powerful <b>built-in</b> <b>defect</b> prevention and detection capabilities. Regular expressions are widely used in the development tool as a means of formally defining test equipment requirements for the test application and verifying conformance to those requirements. A novel means of using regular expressions to perform range checking was developed. A reduction in rework and increased productivity are the results. These capabilities are described along with lessons learned and their applicability to other test equipment software. The test application development tool, or “application builder”, is known as the PT 3800 AM Creation, Revision and Archiving Tool (PACRAT) ...|$|E

The first study {{constitutes}} {{an assessment of}} the effectiveness of IDDQ (quiescent power supply current) in detecting transistor-level defects for three CMOS logic design styles. This study was carded out by designing, simulating, fabricating, and testing CMOS devices with <b>built-in</b> <b>defects.</b> The second study involves an assessment of IDDQ in a production-type environment and the effect of bum-in on IDDQ levels.

40|$|The {{problem of}} weak {{magnetism}} has hindered {{the application of}} magnetic semiconductors since their invention, {{and on the other}} hand, the magnetic mechanism of GaN-based magnetic semiconductors {{has been the focus of}} long-standing debate. In this work, nanoscale GaN:Mn wires were grown on the top of GaN ridges by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), and the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer shows that its ferromagnetism is greatly enhanced. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) reveal an obvious increase of Mn composition in the nanowire part, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and EDS mapping results further indicate the correlation between the abundant stacking faults (SFs) and high Mn doping. When further combined with the micro-Raman results, the magnetism in GaN:Mn might be related not only to Mn concentration, but also to some kinds of <b>built-in</b> <b>defects</b> introduced together with the Mn doping or the SFs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Corrosion {{of steel}} cables and {{reinforcing}} steel in concrete structures {{is a major}} cause of structural deterioration. The current methods for corrosion detection suffer from several significant drawbacks. In this paper, a nondestructive evaluation technique is developed that is capable of determining the location and severity of corrosion of embedded or encased steel rebar and cables. This technique utilizes time domain reflectometry (TDR), which has been traditionally used to detect electrical discontinuities in transmission lines. By installing a sensor wire along side steel reinforcement, the reinforcement can be modeled as an asymmetric, twin-conductor transmission line. Physical defects of the reinforcement, such as abrupt pitting corrosion, general surface corrosion, and grouting voids, will change the electromagnetic properties of the line. They can be modeled analytically, and identified using TDR. TDR measurement results from several fabricated bridge cable sections with <b>built-in</b> <b>defects</b> are reported. Based on the initial results, the TDR corrosion detection method has proven to be more robust than the existing methods because it allows one to detect, locate and identify the extent of corrosion damage...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} sustain the {{historic}} progress in information processing, transmission, and storage, concurrent integration of heterogeneous functionality and materials with fine granularity is clearly imperative for the best connectivity, system performance, and density metrics. In this paper, we review recent developments in heterogeneous integration of epitaxial nanostructures for their applications toward our envisioned device-level heterogeneity using computing nanofabrics. We first identify the unmet need for heterogeneous integration in modern nanoelectronics and review state-of-the-art assembly approaches for nanoscale computing fabrics. We also discuss the novel circuit application driver, known as Nanoscale Application Specific Integrated Circuits (NASICs), which promises an overall performance-power-density advantage over CMOS and embeds <b>built-in</b> <b>defect</b> and parameter variation resilience. At the device-level, we propose an innovative cross-nanowire field-effect transistor (xnwFET) structure that simultaneously offers high performance, low parasitics, good electrostatic control, ease-of-manufacturability, and resilience to process variation. In addition, we specify technology requirements for heterogeneous integration and present two wafer-scale strategies. The first strategy is based on ex situ assembly and stamping transfer of pre-synthesized epitaxial nanostructures that allows tight control over key nanofabric parameters. The second strategy is based on lithographic definition of epitaxial nanostructures on native substrates followed by their stamping transfer using VLSI foundry processes. Finally, we demonstrate the successful concurrent heterogeneous co-integration of silicon and III-V compound semiconductor epitaxial nanowire arrays onto the same hosting substrate over large area, at multiple locations, with fine granularity, close proximity and high yield...|$|E
40|$|Silicon {{nanostructures}} such {{as small}} clusters, superclusters, and elongated chains, {{with an average}} diameter of a few nanometers, have been synthesized by magnetron sputtering on cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveals that flat, defect-poor areas of the HOPG surface are covered with almost uniformly sized silicon clusters of 0. 6 ± 0. 2 nm, 5. 1 ± 1. 2 nm, and 15. 4 ± 3 nm diameter. Surface regions with defects such as pits and craters, descending a few layers into the graphite surface, are sparsely covered with silicon. Most of the deposited material, with an average diameter of 2 nm, {{is found to be}} attached to the monatomic step edges forming the crater rims. A simulation of the growth process, i. e. deposition of silicon atoms onto a surface with <b>built-in</b> <b>defects,</b> and subsequent surface diVusion and aggregation of the adatoms, convincingly reproduces most of the Si nanostructures observed in the STM topographs. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Continuous {{improvements}} in microelectronics performance and signal processing techniques have positively impacted development in NDE techniques specifically also {{with regard to}} aeronautical applications. Composite materials such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) have gained increasing application in aerospace {{over the past years}} and decades. Their primary advantage is their strength to-weight ratio. It is of parallel importance to ensure the quality of structures made from CFRP in production as well as in service. Ultrasonic non-destructive testing of CFRP is not always easy due to the anisotropic properties it exhibits. This can result in faulty defect sizing and image artefacts while ultrasonic testing. This paper intends to describe and discuss some of the applications and results using the Sampling Phased Array (SPA) technique with Reverse Phase Matching for the purpose of inspecting CFRP components without compromising the testing speed in real time quantitative imaging. The Principle of SPA is briefly described followed by a comparison of results with the state-of-the-art techniques, e. g. phased array method. CFRP samples with <b>built-in</b> <b>defects</b> have been used for measurements and the results prove the potential advantages of the SPA technique with Reverse Phase Matching...|$|R

As-deposited thin films, with their <b>built-in</b> structural <b>defects</b> show a lower temperature dependence of their TECs and higher values. Furthermore, our data clearly show that the TECs of cubic Ti 1 −xAlxN and Cr 1 −xAlxN increase with increasing Al content, and that the TEC of wurtzite type B 4 structured AlN is {{only about half of}} that of B 1 AlN...|$|R
40|$|Appendices; Figures; References; TablesThis study {{examined}} the roughness and roughness progression of 21 test sections on the LTPP SPS- 2 site in Arizona over the first 16 years of the experiment. The site included 12 test sections from the standard experiment and 9 supplemental test sections selected by the Arizona Department of Transportation. Traditional profile analyses revealed roughness caused by transverse and longitudinal cracking on some test sections and some localized roughness caused by <b>built-in</b> <b>defects.</b> However, the analyses showed that curl and warp contributed to, {{and in some cases}} dominated, the roughness on many of the test sections. In addition, roughness did not increase steadily with time because of diurnal and seasonal changes in slab curl and warp. This study applied objective profile analyses to quantify the level of curl and warp on each section. These automated algorithms estimated the gross strain gradient needed to deform each slab into the shape present in the measured profile and produced a pseudo strain gradient (PSG) value. The levels of curl and warp within each profile are summarized by the average PSG value. For the jointed concrete test sections, variations in average PSG over time explained many of the changes in roughness over time. This included diurnal variations in slab curl, which often caused the overall progression in roughness to appear disorderly throughout the experiment. PSG analysis also revealed that the overall level of curl and warp increased throughout the life of the experiment, with commensurate increases in the roughness. This limited study demonstrated the potential value of applying the methods herein to other jointed portland cement concrete pavements, including other SPS- 2 sites...|$|R

40|$|Methods for {{monitoring}} seepage and detecting internal erosion {{are essential for}} the safety evaluation of embankment dams. Internal erosion {{is one of the}} major reasons for embankment dam failures, and there are several tenths of thousands of large embankment dams in the world. Internal erosion is progressing inside the dam, and is sometimes difficult to detect by conventional methods. Therefore, there is a strong need of new or improved detection methods. The resistivity method is an established method with a variety of engineering and environmental applications, but it is only occasionally tested on embankment dams. When applied for dam safety examination, the method can principally be used in two ways. Firstly, resistivity investigations at single occasions may detect spatially anomalous zones along the dam, and can be used to investigate suspected structural weaknesses. Secondly, long-term resistivity monitoring make use of the seepage-induced seasonal variation inside the embankment to detect anomalies not only in space, but also more importantly anomalies in time, by studying deviations from the time-variation pattern. Within this thesis the resistivity method has been used in practice on four Scandinavian locations, both in the form of investigation and monitoring. At Enemossen tailings dam a single investigation was carried out. At Hällby and Sädva dams an ongoing program with permanently installed monitoring systems has acquired daily data since 1996 and 2001 respectively. In addition, the method was tested under short-term monitoring conditions on a test embankment with <b>built-in</b> structural <b>defects</b> at Røssvatn. Apart from the field measurements, numerical modelling has been done in order to optimise measurements and support interpretation of the results. The experience from the field measurements demonstrates that monitoring is a more powerful approach than single investigations. The seasonal resistivity variation is evident and under favourable circumstances it may be used to evaluate the seepage. A systematic methodology has been developed for efficient monitoring and evaluation of long-term resistivity data. The monitoring instrumentation has largely proved reliable. Proper electrode installations are essential. Installing the electrodes along the top of the dam core is efficient on existing dams as it creates a current channelling effect inside the conductive dam core, which is the part of the dam with highest interest. Further development and refinement is needed to make the method more easily adaptable to the large variety of embankment dams and thereby more attractive for industrial use. Some ideas of future work are proposed. However, the efficiency of the method has been developing rapidly recently, and significant progress has been done within this thesis concerning the use of the method for dam monitoring. It is concluded that the application of the resistivity method for detection of anomalous seepage and internal erosion in embankment dams is obvious...|$|R
