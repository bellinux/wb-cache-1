25|$|Psalm 126, Shir Hama'alot (Song of Ascents), which {{expresses the}} Jewish hope of return to Zion {{following}} their final redemption, is widely recited by Ashkenazi Jews before birkat hamazon on Shabbat, Jewish holidays and other days {{on which the}} penitential Tachanun prayer is not recited. This is frequently followed by reciting four further lines of four other Psalms, (145:21; 115:18; 118:1; 106:2), known as Tehillat Hashem (Praise of God). Less common is the recitation on weekdays of Psalm 137, Al Naharot <b>Bavel</b> (By the rivers of Babylon), which describes the reactions of the Jews in exile as would have been expressed during the Babylonian captivity (See Mishna Berura quoting the Shelah). Some Spanish and Portuguese Jews precede Birkat HaMazon with Ein Keloheinu on Shabbat and holidays.|$|E

2500|$|For a long time, NAC’s {{financial}} position seemed stable {{and the club}} finished third in season 2007–2008. In 2009, NAC qualified for the UEFA Europa League. In the 4th round, NAC was defeated by Villarreal CF with 1–3 (home) and 6–1 (away). Despite earlier denials towards fans and stakeholders by management and the Board of Chairmen, it appeared {{at the end of}} season 2009-2010 that NAC’s {{financial position}} wasn’t stable. The club lost 3.2 million Euro’s that season, due to rebuilding the stadium and buying [...] too expensive players. Board members Willem van der Hoeven, Jacques Visschers and Bas Koomans resigned and Bas van <b>Bavel</b> became new chairman. Managing director Theo Mommers reported ill in April 2010. Bernard Ouwerkerk was appointed in June 2010 as interim managing director of NAC Breda, while Technical Manager Earnest Stewart signed a contract at AZ and was replaced by Jeffrey van As.|$|E
