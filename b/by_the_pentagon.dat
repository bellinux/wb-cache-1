5|$|Compounding {{these issues}} was the one-year {{rotation}} policy adopted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> in Southeast Asia. Although the first aircrews arriving in-theater were highly experienced, {{the rapidly growing}} tempo and ever-expanding length of the operation demanded more personnel. This exacerbated a growing lack of experienced aircrews. This dilemma was further compounded by an Air Force policy which dictated universal pilot training while proscribing involuntary second combat tours, which combined, {{had the effect of}} rotating personnel to different aircraft. Conversely, the Navy tended to maintain its aircrews within the same community for the duration of their careers, thereby retaining their expertise, but also incurring greater losses among experienced crews undergoing multiple combat tours.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July, the U.S. Army {{ordered the}} {{deactivation}} {{of all of}} its Ranger companies. The Army noted that the Ranger companies were only an exercise directed <b>by</b> <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> which was complete. The 3rd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 in Korea. Like {{many of the other}} Ranger units, most of the Ranger veterans were folded into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, where their airborne skills could be used. Still, Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war.|$|E
5|$|Early {{estimates}} on {{rebuilding the}} damaged {{section of the}} Pentagon were {{that it would take}} three years to complete. However, the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the one-year anniversary of the attack. The rebuilt section of the Pentagon includes a small indoor memorial and chapel at the point of impact. An outdoor memorial, commissioned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> and designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman, was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11, 2008. Since September 11, American Airlines continues to fly from Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. As of August 2016, flight number 77 has been renumbered to 2636, now using a Boeing 737-800, departing at 7:40 in the morning.|$|E
50|$|The {{full-scale}} renovation became {{necessary because}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mid-1990s, <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> had never undergone a major renovation, and building systems had deteriorated beyond repair, requiring complete replacement. Additionally, {{the presence of}} asbestos-containing materials throughout the building made any repairs or other work to the building highly disruptive.|$|R

30|$|Upon relaxation, the {{nanotube}} {{segment is}} bent around the defect site {{in order to}} release the strain energy induced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>pentagons</b> and heptagons. <b>The</b> <b>pentagon</b> (heptagon) pair locates in the convex (concave) part of the segment (see Fig. 1 b), passing through a bisector after we adjust the number of carbon atoms on the two ends to make the segment symmetric. Depending on how these basic structural segments are connected, either a nanocoil or a nanotori [9, 29, 30] is formed. As shown in Fig. 1 c, two segments are connected with a certain rotating angle to make the combined structure spiral and to form a seamless hexagonal carbon network.|$|R

The LAS contract was developed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> to supply Afghanistan’s military with 20 planes, which should ensure air superiority in the country after the majority of US forces leave. Because the contract is a foreign military sale, Nevada-based SNC and Brazil-based Embraer deliver the planes to the Air Force, which then passes them on to the Afghan military. The first of 20 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft arrived at Moody Air Force Base on September 26, 2014 {{in preparation for the}} Afghanistan pilot and maintenance training mission.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, a Pakistani firm {{invented a}} new formula to make {{fertilizers}} that cannot {{be converted into}} bomb-making materials. The firm, Fatima Fertilizer, had succeeded in making non-lethal alternatives to ammonium nitrate, a key ingredient in the fertilizers it makes. Fertilizers with ammonium nitrate, however, can easily be converted into bomb-making ingredients. This invention was praised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon.</b> “Such a long-term solution would be a true scientific breakthrough,” US Army Lieutenant General Michael Barbero, {{the head of the}} Pentagon’s Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, said in a statement. After this invention, CNN reported that the United States and Pakistan reached an agreement to jointly make fertilizers with non-explosive materials. But diplomatic sources told Dawn that an agreement could only be reached after the new material is tested. The sources said that US experts would soon visit Pakistan for testing the new material with experts from the Fatima Group, Pakistan’s major fertilizer manufacturer.|$|E

25|$|The {{industrial}} economy began {{a decline in}} the early 20th century with the exodus of many manufacturing companies. By the 1920s competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led to the collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and mechanized transportation. This decline would continue into {{the latter half of the}} century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Bay Staters involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000. The Springfield Armory, the United States' Military's munitions producer since 1777, was controversially shutdown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pentagon</b> in 1968. This spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century. In Eastern Massachusetts, following World War II, the economy was transformed from one based on heavy industry into a service and high-tech based economy. Government contracts, private investment, and research facilities led to a new and improved industrial climate, with reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. Suburbanization flourished, and by the 1970s, the Route 128 corridor was dotted with high-technology companies who recruited graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education.|$|E

500|$|US {{policy makers}} {{tried to find}} {{alternative}} routes through Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan (termed as the [...] "Northern Distribution Network") but these are longer and less effective than routes through Pakistan. Huge costs {{are associated with the}} Central Asian supply lines, and NATO's supply line through Russia is already under a looming danger of closure due to friction over missile defence plans. Being a landlocked country, Afghanistan is highly dependent on Pakistan for its imports. According to figures released <b>by</b> <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon</b> in January 2012, the United States was paying six times more to send supplies to troops in Afghanistan via alternative supply routes following the closure of Pakistani routes. The figures placed the new US costs at $104 million per month, roughly $87 million costlier per month than when the cargo was transported via Pakistan. The high costs were associated with the routes being lengthier.|$|E
