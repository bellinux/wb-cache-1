Because of the potential implication of the work conducted at biological warfare laboratories, the conferences were restricted to top level security clearances.

It was not until 1964, however, that conferences were held in a government installation not associated with a biological warfare program.|$|E

40|$|Background: An {{increasing}} number of patients are treated with <b>biological</b> agents. <b>Safety</b> issues in regard to children exposed antenatally to biological drugs are of concern for female and male patients. A survey of published human experience on biological agents during pregnancy is given. Results: Most biological agents are complete monoclonal antibodies containing an Fc fragment of IgG which facilitates active transport through the placenta. All monoclonal antibodies expose the child to the full adult dose when administered in late pregnancy with a risk for adverse effects, particularly infection, perinatally. Among TNFa inhibitors, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and golimumab must be stopped at least before gestational week 30. Data for certolizumab, the pegylated Fab’fragment without an Fc fragment are insufficient to support safety during pregnancy.

This should be established with an extensive comparability exercise. One aspect that is subject to particular scrutiny is the immunogenicity of the biosimilar and the reference medicinal product. For three cases, one etanercept and two infliximab biosimilars, we describe how data are assessed and an opinion is reached by authorities. Not in all cases unanimity exists whether all remaining uncertainties on biosimilarity have been resolved satisfactorily before marketing authorisation.
