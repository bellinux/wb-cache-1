50|$|Crime in Qatar is {{relatively}} {{low compared to}} industrialized nations. Petty crime such as pickpocketing and <b>bag</b> <b>snatching</b> does occur, but is extremely uncommon. Although incidents of violence are {{generally considered to be}} rare, violence has occurred more frequently due to increase in the population of Doha, the capital and largest city of Qatar, and economic pressures on expatriate workers during the last few years.|$|E

'Express kidnappings', where {{individuals}} are abducted {{and forced to}} withdraw funds from automated teller machines to secure their release, are common in major cities including Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasília, Salvador and Recife. People have been robbed and assaulted when using unregistered taxis. Petty crime such as pickpocketing and <b>bag</b> <b>snatching</b> are common. Thieves operate in outdoor markets, in hotels and on public transport. Piracy occurs in the coastal areas of Brazil.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{low rate}} of crime in Bahrain. Incidents of petty crime such as pickpocketing and <b>bag</b> <b>snatching</b> are {{reported}} especially in the old market areas (souks). Incidents of violent crime is uncommon, but increasing. Much of the crime in the nation is committed by the large South Asian population of guest workers. Though small in size, {{there is a growing}} underground drug market in the country. According to Emile Nakhleh, approximately 65% of violent crime and theft are committed by foreign citizens residing in Bahrain.|$|E
40|$|Every £ 100 {{invested}} in drug treatment services prevents a crime being committed, {{according to a}} study released today. A report published by the UK- basd NTA estimates that current drug treatment provision prevents 4. 9 million crimes in England a year, with an estimated saving to society of £ 960 million in costs to the public, business, the criminal justice system and the NHS. The findings in 'Estimating the Crime Reduction Benefits of Drug Treatment and Recovery' are based on statistics from the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS), conviction records from the Police National Computer, and self-reported offences data from the Drug Treatment Outcomes Research Study. The empirical analysis has been endorsed by the Home Office. The report estimates that the average cost of crime for a dependent drug user would be £ 26, 074 every year if they were not in treatment, and that treatment prevents 26 offences for every offender in effective treatment. The overall reduction in crime by 4. 9 million a year translates into an estimated: • 100, 000 fewer burglaries and robberies, saving homes and businesses £ 605 million • 75, 000 fewer car thefts and break-ins, saving motorists and businesses £ 155 million • 350, 000 fewer acts of prostitution • 1. 1 million fewer shoplifting thefts, saving retailers and businesses £ 137 million • 25, 000 fewer <b>bags</b> <b>snatched.</b> The report estimates that these benefits will accrue each year if funding for drug treatment continues at current levels. In addition, it estimates that the accumulated effect of more people sustaining recovery would prevent a further 4. 1 million offences over the next nine years. Central support for drug treatment in England is being maintained at £ 466. 7 m for 2012 - 13, although a recent report from the UK Drug Policy Commission warned that local authorities who supply additional local resources are under pressure. Paul Hayes, NTA Chief Executive, said: "It is well-established that getting drug-dependent offenders into and through treatment cuts crime. Now we can confidently estimate how much that is worth to the taxpayer, to individuals and to society, {{in terms of the number}} of crimes reduced and money saved. "When recovery from addiction is sustained, the benefits to society multiply, and with more users than ever completing treatment successfully and not returning, it makes sense to continue investing in evidence-based drug treatment locally. " Reducing drug-related crime is one of the objectives of the Government's Drug Strategy, as the Home Office estimates that between a third and a half of all acquisitive crimes are committed by heroin or crack cocaine addicts. The NTA report estimates that when not in treatment, every drug user commits an average of two crimes a week...|$|R
50|$|Pick-pocketing and {{stealing}} bags often {{take place in}} crowded areas, near exchange shops and hotels, on public transportation, in railway stations and inside airport terminals; and such acts are {{a very serious problem}} in Romania. A group of people (often including children - see section below) surround a person that appears wealthy, distract their attention, while one or more members of the group attempt to snatch money, watches or jewellery from pockets or from around the neck and wrist. Some thieves take advantage of the lack of attention of the victims and <b>snatch</b> <b>bags</b> and quickly run away. Tourists can also fall victims to thieves who present themselves as plain-clothes policemen, flash a badge and ask to see passports and wallets, after which they steal money from the wallet.|$|R
3000|$|Previous {{approaches}} on {{the task}} of acoustic monitoring focus on different aspects of the classifier, the feature extraction process, the training data and the number of classes. In [3] the authors used an emotion recognition system for detecting fear-type emotional manifestations which take place during abnormal situations. The extracted features described prosody and audio quality in combination with spectral and cepstral parameters to train Gaussian mixture models separately for voiced and unvoiced audio parts. Their database was based on fiction movies and consisted of seven hours of recordings organized into 400 audiovisual sequences (SAFE corpus). The classification task concerned fear and neutral speech while they achieve 30 % error rate. Valenzise et al. [4] presented a surveillance system for gunshot and scream detection and localization in a public square. Forty-nine features were computed in total and given as an input to a hybrid filter/wrapper selection method. Its output was used to build two parallel GMMs for identifying screams from noise and gunshots from noise. Data were drawn out from movie sound tracks, internet repositories and people shouting at a microphone while the noise samples were captured in a public square of Milan. The resulted precision was 93 % at a false rejection rate of 5 % when the SNR condition is 10 dB. An interesting application, crime detection inside elevators was described in [5]. Their approach relied on time-series analysis and signal segmentation. By automatic clustering of audio data, consistent patterns were discovered and data were collected for training a GMM for each one of the eight classes using low-level features. The data set contained recordings of suspicious activities in elevators and some event free clips while they reported detection of all the suspicious activities without any misses. A gunshot detection method under noisy environments was explained in [6]. Their corpus consisted of data which were artificially created from a set of multiple public places and gunshot sound events extracted from the national French public radio. Widely used features were employed, including MFCC for constructing two GMMs with respect to gunshot and normal class using data of various SNR levels. The benefits of supervised and unsupervised clustering for acoustic surveillance in a typical office environment were described in [7]. Their system was based on a continuously updated background noise spectrum profile which served interesting event detection. Both k-means and manual selection of cluster centers methods were used for clustering audio files that were captured in a standard office room for a period of 48 days. The detection relied on two alternative criteria each of which put a threshold onto two quantities which were designed to detect loud onset and transients in the environment. In [8] the issue of detection of audio events in public transport vehicles was addressed by utilizing both a generative and a discriminative method. The audio data were recorded using 4 microphones during four different scenarios which included fight scenes, a violent robbery scene and scenes of <b>bag</b> or mobile <b>snatching.</b> They utilized GMM and SVM while their feature set was formed from the first 12 MFCC, energy, derivatives and accelerations. Vacher et al. [9] presented a framework for sound detection and classification for medical telesurvey. Their corpus consisted of recordings made in the CLIPS laboratory, files of the [...] "Sound Scene Database in Real Acoustical Environment" [...] (RCWP, Japan). They used wavelet based cepstral coefficients to train GMMs for eight sound classes while their system was evaluated under different SNR conditions. Last but not least, a hierarchical classification scheme which identified normal from excited sound events was described in [10]. The authors used four audio features for training GMMs, each one associated with one node of the classification tree. The audio was recorded for around two hours in the real environment (office corridor) and included talk, shout, knock, and footsteps.|$|R

40|$|The urban {{informal}} sector is a sub-set {{of the total}} {{informal sector}} {{as well as of}} the total urban sector. In the context of Papua New Guinea (PNG), the urban informal sector is described as livelihood activities which include microenterprises or tiny livelihood activities selling, distributing, producing or manufacturing goods and providing services, either regularly or occasionally or on a needs-basis and being carried out in prescribed or un-prescribed markets or areas, such as streets, roadsides, in front of supermarkets or offices, at bus stops, and in yards of houses (Eugenio, 2001). These activities can be owned by one or two persons, a family or by a group of people. The informal sector in PNG has expanded rapidly in the post-independence period, particularly in rural areas. This is because of rapid population growth and slow economic growth. PNG is still in the early stages of its population transition with a relatively high total fertility rate, compared to most of the other six countries compared here. Its urban sector is, also, relatively small as compared to those countries. But it grew rapidly from a small base in the 1970 s and at above the rate of total population growth rate in the 1990 s. This is mainly because of the pull factors of rapid localisation and a sharp increase in urban minimum wages in the early seventies, increasing the urban wage-rural income gap, in line with the Harris-Todaro model. There was also an expansion in the urban informal sector. The urban sector’s growth as a whole slowed down between 1990 and 2010, as urban minimum wages were cut, while jobs had been substantially localised and the economy went into a prolonged recession until the second half of the first decade of this century, but the urban informal sector as a whole continued to grow more rapidly than the overall population. Factors that influence the growth of the urban informal sector are: rural-urban migration; increase in urban unemployment; shortage of jobs in the formal sector; urban population growth; increased number of school leavers; and underpaid employees. As the economy moved into recession, the informal sector became the employer of the bulk of the population in both the rural and urban areas in PNG. Unlike Brazil, the Philippines and Fiji (in the latter case, land inequality and/or landlessness made the push factor more significant), in PNG the availability of traditional landownership rights in general reduce this pressure. For a number of reasons discussed in this thesis, there were no direct policies favouring the urban informal sector for the first 30 years of the post-independence period. But the recession of the 1990 s and dwindling opportunities in the urban formal sector led to a determination among the politicians to make changes to laws, which made it easier for the informal sector to conduct businesses. It led to the Informal Sector Development and Control Act, hereon referred to as “the ISA. ” This research had two aims. First, it aimed to examine the factors that increase the informal activities, the major activities and the effects of the informal sector in Port Moresby and Lae, PNG. Second, the research aimed to explore the effects of the ISA on both the formal and the informal business activities in these two cities. It used both qualitative and quantitative methods of research including participant observation, semi-structured interviews, focus group interviews, unstructured interviews and questionnaire surveys. Results of the research revealed that the factors that increase the informal sector activities were rural-urban migration and unemployment; the major activities in the informal sector were selling betel nuts, lime, mustard, cigarettes and store goods. The uneducated had lower participation rates in the informal sector than school leavers. The main reason for vendors to migrate to Port Moresby and Lae was to have more chances to earn money or to obtain a job. The businesses in the formal sector viewed the ISA as a threat to their profits and survival, while the informal sector street vendors saw it as a way of expanding the range of goods to sell and places to sell. Lastly, urban informal activities had an impact in terms of crime, health and ethnic conflict. This brought fear to women and children, who felt unsafe walking on the streets. Street vendors <b>snatched</b> <b>bags</b> and harassed the general public, especially women. Rubbish created by informal sector activities made the city look filthy and led to the spread of diseases and contributed to law and order problems in terms of ethnic clashes. The ISA has been poorly implemented, with no proper controls and regulation in place and hence has caused a lot of social problems. It has had significant effects on both the formal sector and urban informal sector; hence, the recommendation that the PNG Government reviews the ISA to address the concerns of the street vendors, formal businesses and the residents of Port Moresby and Lae. In general there were negative perceptions about the informal sector activities among the general public; harassment of vendors by police and city authorities was common. Policy makers must address each of these issues and as well as make regulations that will control and protect the interests of the urban street vendors. This research has some limitations. Firstly, the data collection was limited to two major cities, Port Moresby and Lae. Future research can be extended to other main centres. Secondly there were limitations to the kind of data collected. There was no data on the size of the urban informal sector. The PNG 2000 Census National Report did not cover it and the report itself is now out of date. Future research can use data from the 2010 census report where possible. Thirdly, future research could also cover activities regarded as socially undesirable and/or illegal such as prostitution, drug dealing and street begging, which have been omitted here...|$|R
