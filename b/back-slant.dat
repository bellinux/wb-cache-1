40|$|The {{plain text}} was task-oriented in a {{roundabout}} way, providing detailed instructions for how NOT {{to build an}} elaborate sequence of bridges, each one bound to produce, according to chapters one through twenty-three, disastrous results. Graphic novels disguised as illuminated letters twisted the tent-dwelling decipherer into painful self-recognition. The flashlight followed the phases of the moon. Meanwhile one strand of marginalia, written in anxious <b>back-slant,</b> pleaded {{for some kind of}} adjustable form for managing the confluence, especially during flood season. I like what we came up with. 'We' is a little big word. In fact the tent turns {{out to be one of}} those Borgesian core-tech structures allowing for astonishing internal expansion. There's not much we didn't get in there and not much in there that didn't get us. So I suppose that's it. This tent. This confluence. These children who found me here, turned text into life and made life home...|$|E

50|$|Significantly, many ACL {{injuries}} {{occur in}} athletes landing flat on their heels. This movement directs the forces directly up the tibia into the knee, while the straight-knee position places the anterior femoral condyle on the <b>back-slanted</b> {{portion of the}} tibia. The resultant forward slide of the tibia relative to the femur is restrained primarily by the now-vulnerable ACL.|$|R
50|$|In {{her first}} year on the job, Marcia {{developed}} a book classification system for medical books, based on the index medicus, and called it the Classification for Medical Literature. The system uses the alphabet with capital letters for the major divisions of medicine and lower-case ones for the sub-sections. The system was used for many years, but it's now updated and the Faculty's original shelving scheme was never changed. The card catalogues still reflect her classification {{and many of the}} cards are written in Marcia's <b>back-slanting</b> handwriting.|$|R
5000|$|The 1966 Furys {{kept the}} same profile as the 1965s, with a split front and rear grill motif. For 1967, the body was restyled with a sharp, angular profile. The stacked quad {{headlight}} bezels were curvier and set more deeply into the body, giving the car a more muscular look. The rooflines had sharper angles and gave the car a longer, more luxurious appearance. A new, formal two-door hardtop body style appeared which featured smaller rear quarter windows and a wider, <b>back-slanted</b> [...] "C" [...] pillar. Called the [...] "fast top," [...] it was offered alongside the restyled thin [...] "C" [...] pillar hardtop in both VIP and Sport Fury series (as well as on corresponding big Dodge models). The 1967 model year introduced new safety regulations, which meant {{that for the first}} time, all Plymouths included dual-circuit brake master cylinder, energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, recessed instrument panel controls, and shoulder belt mounting points for outboard front seat occupants.|$|R
