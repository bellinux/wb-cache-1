Tom Breihan commented that Knowles [...] " [...] with force and purpose on the verses". As the song opens, she tells her lover, [...] "I can't let you go", and that she will not allow another woman to take everything she owns, including the chinchilla coats and {{the house on the}} coast. Knowles screams the refrain—"Ring the alarm, I've been doin this too long / But I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> see another chick on your arm"—"through a thick fog of distortion", as noted by Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that she chants the lines with grit and urgency, while Breihan wrote that she sings them [...] "with a frantic intensity". Knowles later declares that her relationship is [...] "not the picture perfect movie everyone would assume".|$|E

[...] An attempt by the British to board Bonhomme Richard was thwarted, and a grenade caused the explosion of a large quantity of gunpowder on Serapis lower gun-deck.|$|E

2500|$|The {{absence of}} any other combatants had bought Serapis a {{considerable}} amount of time. Bonhomme Richard’s gun decks were now so badly damaged that most of the British shots were passing straight through without touching anything, and the great guns were almost completely silenced. There were almost as many fires to be extinguished as there were aboard Serapis, but on the other hand, the hold was filling with water because one of the pumps was in ruins. Commodore Jones was exhausted, and apparently slumped on the chicken coop for a brief rest. Somehow (according to his later memoirs), a rumour went around that he was dead or dying, and his gunner and carpenter, both wounded, hastily consulted with the master-at-arms. Together they decided, a little before 10pm, to surrender by striking the ship’s colours, but the flag had already been shot away, so their only option was to shout. Captain Pearson shouted back, asking whether the Americans had really struck their colours. Possibly his Lieutenant of Marines relayed this message. Certainly, Jones’s reply was firmly negative. Jones himself recalled shouting {{something along the lines of}} [...] "I have not yet thought of it, but I am determined to make you strike," [...] at which point, presumably, the surrendering officers realised he was still very much alive and returned to their duties. A much more dramatic version appeared in newspapers within days of the event, allegedly based on the testimony of an ex-crewman who thought he heard something like [...] "I may sink, but I’ll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> strike", and witnessed the captain using his pistols to shoot the three officers who were attempting to surrender ...|$|E

5000|$|Butler {{proved to}} be one of the most radical {{reforming}} ministers on the home front. The main problem standing in the way of education reform was the question of integrating church schools into the state system, which had bedevilled Balfour's Act in 1902. H. A. L. Fisher had failed to integrate the church schools in his 1918 Act. Butler wrote to Churchill (12 September 1941) to suggest a Joint Select Committee. Churchill did not want a new bill and replied (13 September) that [...] "we cannot have party politics in wartime". Churchill warned him not to [...] "raise the 1902 controversy during the war". Butler later wrote that having seen the Promised Land, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to die in the Land of Moab. Basing myself on long experience of Churchill over the India Bill, I decided to disregard what he said and go straight ahead." ...|$|R

When he was told by David Clark, the tour manager, that he might have to play, Blofeld replied [...] "I would certainly play if needed, but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> scored 50 or upwards in either innings <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would stand down for the Calcutta Test". On the day of the Test Stewart discharged himself from hospital and played despite his illness. After tea on the first day, Stewart was rushed back to hospital and played no further part in the tour.

Eighteen {{years later in}} 1881, as the company {{advanced}} into areas more difficult to log, Dolbeer invented the Steam Donkey Engine which revolutionized log removal, especially in hard to reach areas. At about the same time, Carson {{was involved in the}} founding of the Eel River and Eureka Railroad with John Vance. Before commencing the building of his mansion, Carson said, [...] "If I build it poorly, they would say that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a <b>damned</b> miser; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> build it expensively, they will say I'm a show off; guess I'll just build it to suit myself." [...] In 1884, on the eve of construction of the great home, the company was producing [...] of lumber annually. The milling operations, combined with additional investments as far away as Southern California and at least partial ownerships in schooners used to move the lumber to booming markets on the west coast and all over the globe, {{set the stage for the}} unlimited budget and access to resources the builders would have. Pacific Lumber Company purchased the company in 1950 and maintained milling operations at the original Humboldt Bay site, located bay-side below the house, well into the 1970s. Following the Carson family divestiture of remaining family holdings (including the home) in 1950, the family left the area. The building was purchased for $35,000 in 1950 by local community business leaders, and currently houses the Ingomar Club, a private club, which was named after Carson's Ingomar Theater, itself named for Carson's favorite play Ingomar the Barbarian.|$|R
