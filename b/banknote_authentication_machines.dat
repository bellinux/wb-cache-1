40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{analysis}} of an energy-efficient 163 -b elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) processor suitable for passive ultrahigh frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) tags that are usable for <b>banknote</b> <b>authentication</b> and anti-counterfeiting. Even partial public key cryptographic functionality has long been thought to consume too much power and to be too slow to be usable in passive UHF RFID systems. Utilizing a low-power design strategy with optimized register file management and an architecture based on the López-Dahab Algorithm, we designed a low-power ECC processor that is used with a modified ECC-DH authentication protocol. The ECC-DH authentication protocol {{is compatible with the}} ISO/IEC 18000 - 63 (“Gen 2 ”) passive UHF RFID protocol. The ECC processor requires 12 145 gate equivalents. The ECC processor consumes 5. 04 nJ/b at a frequency of 960 kHz when implemented in a 0. 13 -μm standard CMOS process. The tag identity authentication function requires 30 600 cycles to complete all scalar multiplication operations. This size, speed, and power of the ECC processor makes it practical to use within a passive UHF RFID tag and achieve up to 1500 <b>banknote</b> <b>authentications</b> per minute, which is sufficient for use in the fastest banknote counting machines...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} stricter security, {{availability}} of sophisticated algorithms and improved hardware at cheaper price, are the driving forces for increasing popularity of biometric <b>authentication.</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>authentication</b> from face images or fingerprints {{at the entrance}} of a building or at bank-teller is getting more and more common. The popularity of using face image features for authentication is due to its ease of use. But its success depends on proper orientation and illumination. Facial features change with the angle of orientation, and even a genuine person would be rejected by the machine due to improper orientation of the face towards the camera. In this work, we proposed a multi-layer perceptron based face identification technique which is robust to orientation of the face image under similar illumination condition. Training data of facial features against orientation angle features is used to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). It is then used for interpolation of facial features at different angles. Experiments were conducted with two types of face image identifying features, using PCA and ICA. A good interpolation property could be obtained by the trained MLP, and a zero equal error rate (EER) could be achieved...|$|R

5000|$|In Authentication, risk-based {{authentication}} is a non-static {{authentication system}} which {{takes into account}} the profile of the agent requesting access to the system to determine the risk profile associated with that transaction. The risk profile is then used to determine the complexity of the challenge. Higher risk profiles leads to stronger challenges, whereas a static username/password may suffice for lower-risk profiles. Risk-based implementation allows the application to challenge the user for additional credentials only when the risk level is appropriate. <b>Machine</b> <b>authentication</b> is often used in a risk based authentication set up. The <b>machine</b> <b>authentication</b> will run in the background and only ask the customer for additional authentication if the computer is not recognized. In a risk based authentication system, the institution decides if additional authentication is necessary. If the risk is deemed appropriate, enhanced authentication will be triggered, such as a one time password delivered via an out of band communication. Risk based authentication can also be used during the session to prompt for additional authentication when the customer performs a certain high risk transaction, such as a money transfer or an address change. Risk based authentication is very beneficial to the customer because additional steps are only required if something is out of the ordinary, such as the login attempt is from a new machine.|$|R

A face recognition system uses a database of images and compares another image against those to find a match, if one exists. We implemented an original face recognizer in Java and tested it for recall and accuracy with three image sets. For each facial image, we created a fingerprint of 18 features, such as the RGB values for the eye color, the width and height of the face, various ratios etc. We utilized WEKA machine learning to determine which features are most important and give appropriate weights. We found that the distances between the eyes, nose, and mouth were not useful as they vary little between people. Overall, our method achieved very good results. For scenarios like surveillance which require low false negatives, our accuracy rate was 75 % (and 2. 3 % false negatives). For vending <b>machine</b> <b>authentication</b> where low false positives are needed, we had 49. 3 % accuracy (and 1. 5 % false positives).

INTRODUCTION The authentication requirements of computing systems and network protocols vary greatly with their intended use, accessibility, and their network connectivity. This document describes a spectrum of authentication technologies and provides suggestions to protocol developers on what kinds of authentication might be suitable for some kinds of protocols and applications used in the Internet. It is hoped that this document will provide useful information to interested members of the Internet community. Passwords, which are vulnerable to passive attack, are {{not strong enough to}} be appropriate in the current Internet [CERT 94]. Further, there is ample evidence that both passive and active attacks are not uncommon in the current Internet [Bellovin 89, Bellovin 92, Bellovin 93, CB 94, Stoll 90]. The authors of this paper believe that many protocols used in the Internet should have stronger authentication mechanisms so that they are at least protected from passive attacks. Support for authentication mechanisms secure against active attack is clearly desirable in internetworking protocols. There are a number of dimensions to the internetwork authentication problem and, in the interest of brevity and readability, this document only describes some of them. However, factors that a protocol designer should consider include whether <b>authentication</b> is between <b>machines</b> or between a human and a <b>machine,</b> whether the <b>authentication</b> is local only or distributed across a network, strength of the authentication mechanism, and how keys are managed.

40|$|Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{networking}} {{is based}} on a distributed application architecture that covers a diverse set of network types. In pure P 2 P overlays, every node in the network acts as a "servent", they act as a server and a client simultaneously. Highlighting {{the fact that there is}} a lack of any centralised control, acting all nodes as equals. This networks have become very popular in the form of file-sharing networks. It {{is based on}} the idea of sharing any type of resources between all nodes. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources. As nodes arrive, the total capacity of the system also increases. In contrast, in a traditional client-server architecture, clients share only their demands with the system, but not their resources. In this case, as more clients join the system, fewer resources are available to serve each client. The decentralized nature of P 2 P networks also increases robustness because if a part of the system fails, it will not stop the entire system from working. As mentioned in there is a need to provide robust access control, data integrity, confidentiality and accountability services. In order to prevent other nodes from impersonating or creating an arbitrary amount of bogus nodes, all distributed systems must have a unique, undeniable and verifiable identifier for each node. The foundation of stable and verifiable identities is required to build nodes with secure parameters. The use of unsecure nodes may allow remote access to files on a victim's computer or even compromise the entire network, this is explained in. Finding suitable measures against the increasing variety of software-based attacks is a di cult task. In particular, pseudospoo ng attacks, in which malicious parties claim multiple identities and disrupt the operation of P 2 P networks. The Trusted Computing paradigm offers a very useful and powerful set of security features to improve on computer systems. The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specifies the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), wich allows to provide cryptographically qualified and tamper-resilient statements on the software configuration of a machine. As described in, the use of protected cryptographic mechanisms alone is not suffi cient to convince remote machines or human users that a complex software service can actually be trusted. To enable a decision based on the statements made by a TPM and the associated trust levels, keys need to be vouched for. This requires a Public Key Infrastucture (PKI). Allowing a remote and indipendant party to decide on the trustworthiness of a host or a particular service. The TPM provides authenticity and allows unique identification of a platform, therefore creating a privacy problem. To circumvent this problem the TCG proposed a trusted third party, the Privacy Certification Authority (PrivacyCa). A particular incarnation of the PKI concept is the PrivacyCa, a trusted service capable of reporting its state to clients. It confirms that keys are protected by a specification-compliant TPM implementation and thus may be trusted under certain conditions, but without revealing the specific identity of the TPM and the user. In this work we provide a solution for creating unique, undeniable and verifiable identifiers for P 2 P networks by using the security features that the TPM o ers. We implement a protocol called Trusted Authentication protocol (TAP) o ering two possible solutions for authentication. One based on machines with TPM hardware enabled and a PrivacyCa that dictates if a machine can be trusted. The other solution is based on the <b>authentication</b> of <b>machines</b> using their own TPM without a PrivacyCa. The main goals of a secure P 2 P would be to identify and avoid malicious nodes, this is achieved by secure <b>authentication</b> of <b>machines</b> via TPM.

En este proyecto se demuestra como algunas propiedades de la especificación TCG (Trusted Computing Group) pueden ser utilizadas para mejorar la seguridad en redes P 2 P.

Un protocolo utiliza el concepto de PrivacyCA para autenticación y protección de la privacidad mientras que el otro protocolo se basa únicamente en la utilización del módulo TPM (Trusted Platform Module).
