500|$|The Sword of Shannara {{has drawn}} {{extensive}} criticism from critics {{who believe that}} Brooks derived too much of his novel from Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. In 1978, American fantasy editor Lin Carter denounced The Sword of Shannara as [...] "the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have ever read". Elaborating on his disapproval of the book, Carter wrote that [...] "Terry Brooks wasn't trying to imitate Tolkien's prose, just steal his story line and complete cast of characters, and [...] did it with such clumsiness and so heavy-handedly, that he virtually rubbed your nose in it." [...] Roger C. Schlobin was kinder in his assessment, though he still thought that The Sword of Shannara was a disappointment because of its similarities to The Lord of the Rings. Brian Attebery accused The Sword of Shannara of being [...] "undigested Tolkien" [...] which was [...] "especially blatant in its point-for-point correspondence" [...] with The Lord of the Rings. In an educational article on writing, author Orson Scott Card cited The Sword of Shannara as a cautionary example of overly derivative writing, finding the work [...] "artistically displeasing" [...] for this reason.|$|E

Largely thanks to The Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s, and enjoys popularity to the present day. The opus has spawned many imitators, such as The Sword of Shannara, which Lin Carter called [...] "the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have ever read".|$|E

2500|$|Smith's {{work in the}} Osprey series, Men at War, {{already had}} {{received}} considerable interest from Napoleonic war enthusiasts, hobbyists and re-enactors when Greenhill published Napoleonic Wars Data Book. It was a 20-year project, about which Smith commented, [...] "This is {{the largest and most}} complex <b>book</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have produced to date and without having committed the last few years to full time, solid research and presentation this work would never have been written." [...] In this massive volume (582 pages, large format, 264 x 204mm–nearly A4 size), [...] Smith compiled the available statistics of nearly every exchange of gunfire of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, close to 2000 engagements, including those in Europe, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. The result was a highly specialised reference book that listed, in chronological order, the battles, skirmishes and actions of nearly 25 years of worldwide warfare, making it a standard starting place for Napoleonic War battle research. [...] It also includes the forces involved, the commanders, ranks, names and types of units, and the occasional comment on the battle.|$|E
