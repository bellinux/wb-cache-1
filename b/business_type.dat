I must have fixed upon Long Branch because I must have heard of it as then the most fashionable; and one afternoon I took the boat for that place. By this means I not only saw sea-bathing for the first time, but I saw a storm at sea: a squall struck us so suddenly that it blew away all the camp-stools of the forward promenade; it was very exciting, and I long meant to use in literature the black wall of cloud that settled on the water before us like a sort of portable midnight; I now throw it away upon the reader, as it were; it never would come in anywhere. I stayed all night at Long Branch, and I had a bath the next morning before breakfast: an extremely cold one, with a life-line to keep me against the undertow. In this rite I had {{the company of a}} young New- Yorker, whom I had met on the boat coming down, and who was of the light, hopeful, adventurous <b>business</b> <b>type</b> which seems peculiar to the city, and which has always attracted me. He told me much about his life, and how he lived, and what it cost him to live. He had a large room at a fashionable boardinghouse, and he paid fourteen dollars a week. In Columbus I had such a room at such a house, and paid three and a half, and I thought it a good deal. But those were the days before the war, when America was the cheapest country in the world, and the West was incredibly inexpensive.|$|E

40|$|It is in {{the present}} decade {{that the study of}} some general laws {{concerning}} the spatial regularities of various phenomena on the earth begins to achieve a remarkable development based on a new view-point in geography. As we are interested in such one, we have studied on the central place system in Nara Basin in 1969 to make clear the central place hierarchy and to find out some regularities in it. The total number of retail and service establishments, <b>business</b> <b>types</b> and population in the central places are totalled by "Daizi", using "The Establishment Census of Japan in 1969 " as principal data. Then we assume two things that are based on Christaller's theory {{for the sake of the}} classification of central places. They are as follows. (1) AH attributes of the central places, such as population, the number of <b>business</b> <b>types</b> and retail and service establishments, increase exponentially according to the level of the central places. (2) The higher level central places provide not only the higher order functions, but also the retail and service functions of the lower level. On the first assumption, the relationship between the population and the number of <b>business</b> <b>types,</b> in addition to between the number of <b>business</b> <b>types</b> and retail and service establishments in the central places, is examined, then the central functions are analyzed on the second assumption. It follows as the consequence that central places in Nara Basin are classified in four classes, they operate according to their size, and that the progression of central places by size class runs 1 - 2 - 5 - 16 (Fig. 3) and the settlement pattern (central places pattern) of Nara Basin forms a rectangular net...|$|R

In this study an attempt is made to determine freeway impact upon land use, retail sales, land values, and travel patterns, in Santa Maria, California. A statistical analysis of land use and retail sales for fourteen <b>business</b> <b>types</b> produced uncertain results. Qualitative information from interviews unraveled some of the uncertainty by showing considerable impact on land use and retail sales for service stations and motels, and to a, lesser extent on eating and drinking places. The remaining <b>business</b> <b>types</b> showed minor freeway impact. Locational advantages from the new freeway location are nonethleless realized by several of the less affected <b>business</b> <b>types,</b> {{and at least two}} companies are currently relocating near access ramps. Land values are quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed with results indicating modest impact on residential property adjacent to the freeway. Commercial land values are also affected, particularly on important streets with freeway proximity. In addition, changing traffic volume and modified travel patterns clearly indicate freeway induced changes in accessibility. The essential difficulty presenting more precise freeway impact conclusions center around an inability to specifically isolate the simultaneous impact of Vandenberg Air Force Base.
