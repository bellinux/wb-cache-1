One day after spinal nerve ligation (SNL), minocycline attenuates after-discharge and responses to brush and pressure.

40|$|International audienceNeuropathic {{pain can}} be caused by a variety of nerve lesions and it is {{unsettled}} whether it should be categorised into distinct clinical subtypes depending on aetiology or type of nerve lesion or individualised as a specific group, based on common symptomatology across aetiologies. In this study, we used a multivariate statistical method (multiple correspondence analyses) to investigate associations between neuropathic positive symptoms (assessed with a specific questionnaire, the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory [NPSI]) and aetiologies, types of nerve lesion and pain localisations. We also examined the internal structure of the NPSI and its relevance to evaluation of symptoms of evoked pains by exploring their relationships with clinician-based quantified measures of allodynia and hyperalgesia. This study included 482 consecutive patients (53 % men; mean age: 58 +/- 15 years) with pain associated with peripheral or central lesions. Factor analysis showed that neuropathic symptoms of the NPSI can be categorised into five dimensions. Spearman correlation coefficients indicated that self-reported pain evoked by <b>brush,</b> <b>pressure</b> and cold stimuli strongly correlated to allodynia/hyperalgesia to brush, von Frey hairs and cold stimuli (p< 0. 0001, n= 90). Multiple correspondence analyses indicated few associations between symptoms (or dimensions) and aetiologies, types of lesions, or pain localisations. Exceptions included idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia and postherpetic neuralgia. We found that there are more similarities than differences in the neuropathic positive symptoms associated with a large variety of peripheral and central lesions, providing rationale for subgrouping aetiologically diverse neuropathic patients into a specific multidimensional category for therapeutic management...|$|E

40|$|A {{double-blind}} placebo-controlled crossover {{trial was}} used {{to determine the effects of}} topical ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, on the sensory disturbances in 20 patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). On two occasions separated by at least one week, sensory tests to light touch, pressure, punctate stimulation, light brushing and thermal stimuli were performed in the symptomatic and contralateral limb and on each side of the forehead before and 30 min after 10 % ketamine cream was applied to the symptomatic or healthy limb. Venous blood for the plasma estimations of ketamine and norketamine was obtained 1 h after application of the creams. Ketamine applied to the symptomatic limb inhibited allodynia to light brushing and hyperalgesia to punctate stimulation. Systemic effects of the ketamine are unlikely to account for this as the plasma levels were below detectable limits. As touch thresholds were unchanged, NMDA receptors may contribute to the sensory disturbances in CRPS via actions at cutaneous nociceptors. Allodynia and hyperalgesia were detected in the ipsilateral forehead to a range of stimuli (<b>brushing,</b> <b>pressure,</b> punctate stimulation, cold, heat, and warmth). In several patients, ketamine treatment of the symptomatic limb inhibited allodynia to brushing the ipsilateral forehead, suggesting that the mechanism that mediates allodynia in the symptomatic limb contributed to allodynia at more remote sites.

40|$|Allodynia {{has been}} {{described}} in migraine but has not been fully investigated for the different sensory modalities. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the prevalence of dynamic (<b>brush)</b> and static (<b>pressure)</b> mechanical allodynia in migraine patients and to suggest a practical method of testing them in a clinical setting. Patients with International Headache Society-defined episodic migraine (EM) or with transformed migraine (TM) as defined by Silberstein and Lipton were prospectively recruited from the Jefferson Headache Center out-patient clinic. A questionnaire of migraine features and symptoms of allodynia was administered. Brush allodynia (BA) was tested by cutaneous stimulation with a gauze pad and pressure allodynia (PA) was tested using von Frey hairs (VFH). The prevalence of BA and PA in all patients and in the different subgroups was calculated and correlated with migraine features. We recruited 55 migraine patients. Twenty-five had EM and 30 had TM. BA was present in 18 (32. 7 %) patients and PA in 18 – 24 (32. 7 – 43. 6 %). Allodynia to both <b>brush</b> and <b>pressure</b> was found in 13 – 17 (23. 6 – 30. 9 %) patients. If a patient had allodynia to one modality only, it was more likely to be PA than BA. Both BA and PA were more common in patients with TM compared with those with EM [BA 46. 7 % vs. 16. 0 %; PA (differences significant for the medium and thick VFHs) 50 % vs. 20 % and 50 % vs. 12 %, respectively]. Both types of allodynia were also more common in patients with migraine with aura compared with those with migraine without aura (BA 57. 1 % vs. 17. 6 %; PA 57. 1 – 61. 9 % vs. 17. 6 – 32. 7 %). There was a positive correlation between allodynia score (as obtained by examination) and allodynia index (as obtained by history) for both BA and PA. The incomplete, although considerable, overlap between BA and PA suggests that allodynia to different sensory modalities is associated with sensitization of different neuronal populations. Because PA was more common than BA, it may be a more sensitive indicator of allodynia in migraine. PA can be tested clinically in a practical and systematic manner...|$|R

Developments in brush seal design have led to geometric modifications to control flow field and consequent brush seal issues including blow-down, hang-up, and pressure stiffening. Some of the geometric enhancements {{have been found to}} have common use as backing plate modifications. Over the two decades of brush seal evolution, many backing plate configurations have been suggested in numerous patent disclosures.

The CFD analysis presented employs a bulk porous medium approach for the bristle pack. The effectiveness of various backing plate configurations outlining important flow features is discussed. Results indicate that backing plate configurations have a decisive role in shaping seal pressure fields. In general, it has been found that all cases having bypass configuration leak more.

Over {{the past two decades}} of brush seal evolution, manufacturers and researchers have applied many geometric configurations to the front and backing plates of a standard brush seal in order to control the flow field and consequent seal performance. The number of studies evaluating the effect of geometric configurations on the brush seal flow field remains limited in spite of the high number of filed patent disclosures.

Results disclose unique effects of geometry on pressure and flow fields such that a longer front plate drives outward radial flow while playing a protective role against upstream cavity disturbances. Findings also indicate that variations in front plate geometry do not directly affect leakage performance.

Cold pain and cooling reduced itch intensity, but neither affected histamine-induced skin blood flow. Sub-noxious warming the skin did not affect the skin blood flow or itch intensity.

Simple models using the soft quadratic potential from a dissipative particle dynamics study {{have been used to}} model polyzwitterionic <b>brushes</b> at physiological <b>pressures</b> (up to 7. 5 MPa). Three models of decreasing rigidity have been used to model the friction between the brushes by calculating the tangential component of the pressure induced by a mismatch in the registry of the two grafting surfaces. The static friction coefficient can be calculated for three model systems and the slip between the layers occurs at a much lower values of shear force for the more flexible polymer layer. A moderate increase in the flexibility of the chains reduces the friction coefficient by a factor of ca. 20. Tilting the layer directors of the brushes also increases the static friction between the layer when the top, tilted layer is displaced in the direction away from the tilt. Non-equilibrium dynamics techniques for the same model were performed using dissipative particle dynamics and the limiting extremes of the Stribeck curve corresponding to the boundary lubrication regime and the hydrodynamic lubrication regime were observed for these flat surfaces. As expected, μk is significantly lower than μs for the same system. The dynamical friction coefficients in the model are in good agreement with those observed in the experiment and the ratio of μk/μs of between 0. 11 and 0. 5 observed in the simulations is in reasonable agreement with the value of 0. 5 normally observed for these seen for these systems...|$|R
5000|$|After the presoak {{application}}, a {{car wash}} tunnel's layout can vary greatly. In some car washes, presoak application {{is followed by}} an empty space, or idle zone. This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car. In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill <b>brushes</b> or high <b>pressure</b> wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone. A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels {{in order to achieve}} complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt conveyor prevents the wheels of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel cleaning. Tracking high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch. High pressure arches direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. This may be done [...] "V-jet" [...] nozzles, rotating [...] "turbo" [...] nozzles, spinning manifolds, and oscillating and/or pivoting manifolds. Some high pressure systems maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to provide more consistent results. Separate high pressure top, wheel, and/or side blasters may be present in place of or supplementary to a high pressure arch.|$|R
40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} {{emission requirements}} and dwindling petroleum reserves have generated interest in expanding {{the role of}} synthesis gas (syngas) fuels in power generation applications. Syngas fuels {{are the product of}} gasifying organic-based feedstock such as coal and biomass and are composed of mainly H₂ and CO. However, the use of syngas fuels in lean premixed gas turbine systems has been limited in part because the behavior of turbulent flames in these mixtures at practical gas turbine operating conditions are not well understood. This thesis presents an investigation of the influence of fuel composition and pressure on the turbulent consumption speed, ST,GC, and the turbulent flame brush thickness, FBT, for these mixtures. ST,GC and FBT are global parameters which represent the average rate of conversion of reactants to products and the average heat release distribution of the turbulent flame respectively. A comprehensive database of turbulent consumption speed measurements obtained at pressures up to 20 atm and H₂/CO ratios of 30 / 70 to 90 / 10 by volume is presented. There are two key findings from this database. First, mixtures of different H₂/CO ratios but with the same un-stretched laminar flame speeds, SL, 0, exposed to the same turbulence intensities, u'rms, have different turbulent consumption speeds. Second, higher pressures augment the turbulent consumption speed when SL, 0 is held constant across pressures and H₂/CO ratios. These observations are attributed to the mixture stretch sensitivities, which are incorporated into a physics-based model for the turbulent consumption speed using quasi-steady leading points concepts. The derived scaling law closely resembles Damkhler's classical turbulent flame speed scaling, except that the maximum stretched laminar flame speed, SL,max, arises as the normalizing parameter. Scaling the ST,GC data by SL,max shows good collapse of the data at fixed pressures, but systematic differences between data taken at different pressures are observed. These differences are attributed to non-quasi-steady chemistry effects, which are quantified with a Damkhler number defined as the ratio of the chemical time scale associated with SL,max and a fluid mechanic time scale. The observed scatter in the normalized turbulent consumption speed data correlates very well with this Damkhler number, suggesting that ST,GC can be parameterized by u'rms/SL,max and the leading point Damkhler number. Finally, a systematic investigation of the influence of pressure and fuel composition on the flame brush thickness is presented. The flame brush thickness is shown to be independent of the H₂/CO ratio if SL, 0 is held constant across the mixtures. However, increasing the equivalence ratio for lean mixtures at a constant H₂/CO ratio, results in a thicker flame <b>brush.</b> Increasing the <b>pressure</b> is shown to augment the flame brush thickness, a result which has not been previously reported in the literature. Classical correlations based on turbulent diffusion concepts collapse the flame brush thickness data obtained at fixed u'rms/U₀ and pressure reasonably well, but systematic differences exist between the data at different u'rms/U₀ and pressures.

40|$|In {{patients}} with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), sensory disturbances commonly spread outside the affected limb, in particular hemilaterally. Hyperalgesia to pressure-pain was, for instance, {{documented in the}} forehead ipsilateral to the affected limb [7]. The aim of this thesis was to investigate potential mechanisms involved in this spread. Firstly, the effect of experimental limb pain (the cold pressor test) on sensory changes to pressure-pain and sharpness outside the immersed limb was investigated {{on each side of}} the forehead in samples of 45 and 32 healthy volunteers. Prior to pain induction, differences in pressure-pain or sharpness sensitivity between the left and right side of the forehead were generally small or non-existent. The induction of severe limb pain in healthy volunteers produced a bilateral reduction in forehead sensations to pressure-pain and sharpness with greater analgesia to pressure in the ipsilateral forehead. Central inhibitory pain control mechanisms may have mediated this effect. The second study attempted to disrupt inhibitory pain control prior to cold-induced limb pain (cold pressor test) in 85 healthy volunteers and investigated the effect of these procedures on sensitivity to pressure-pain and sharpness {{on each side of the}} forehead. Optokinetic stimulation was employed to disrupt inhibitory pain control as increased forehead sensitivity was reported following this form of motion sickness-producing stimulation [4; 6]. Sensitivity to pressure-pain and sharpness increased in the forehead after optokinetic stimulation. However, during the subsequent cold pressor test, forehead sensitivity to these stimuli decreased in the most pain sensitive participants, suggesting that inhibitory pain control mechanisms remained intact. The finding of a previous study that unilateral carageenan-induced hindpaw inflammation in the rat produces thermal hyperalgesia both in the inflamed hindpaw and the non-inflamed forepaw, but not in the contralateral paws [16] prompted us to investigate a link between limbinflammation and hemilateral hyperalgesia. Pressure-pain and sharpness sensations were assessed on each side of the forehead in 17 healthy volunteers during 48 hours of topical treatment of the forearm with the inflammatory agent, capsaicin. Capsaicin-treatment evoked a bilateral reduction in forehead sensitivity to sharpness and an ipsilateral reduction in forehead sensitivity to pressure-pain. Differences in the tissue affected (muscle in the rat study and skin in the human study) may explain the differing results from the rat study. The issue of inflammation-induced hemilateral sensory disturbances was explored further in {{patients with}} CRPS. NMDA-receptors are p-regulated in inflamed human skin [15] and appear to be involved in sensitizing primary afferent nociceptors during inflammation and tissue injury [2; 8; 10]. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, the NMDA antagonist, topical ketamine, was applied to the affected or unaffected limb of 20 patients with CRPS and the effect on sensitivity to a range of sensory stimuli (touch, pinprick, thermal, <b>pressure,</b> <b>brushing)</b> was investigated in the affected and unaffected limb and on each side of the forehead. Hyperalgesia to sharpness, pressure, cold and heat, and allodynia to brushing, were detected in the ipsilateral forehead before treatment. This was generally associated with heightened sensitivity in the affected limb. The topical application of ketamine reduced allodynia and sharpness hyperalgesia in the affected limb. As allodynia to brushing the skin and sharpness hyperalgesia are mediated by sensitized spinal nociceptive and wide dynamic range neurons that receive input from nociceptive Adelta fibers and non-nociceptive A-beta fibers [12; 13], peripheral NMDA-receptors may play a role in the sensitization of central neurons in CRPS. In some patients with allodynia in the forehead, forehead allodynia was reduced following treatment of the affected limb with ketamine, suggesting that a similar mechanism may contribute to the heightened sensitivity in the forehead. Prior to this thesis, a small number of studies suggested that central inhibitory pain control is disrupted in patients with CRPS [3; 5; 14]. The laterality of such mechanisms, and their potential contribution to hemilateral hyperalgesia, was explored. CRPS pain increases during startle with a loud tone [3; 5]. Whether this increase in pain to acoustic startle differs between startle in the ipsilateral and contralateral ear was investigated in 28 CRPS patients. Acoustic startle in the ear ipsilateral to the affected limb induced greater limb pain than startle in the contralateral ear. In addition, auditory discomfort was greater to ipsilateral than contralateral ear stimulation and in patients with increased pain to startle than in a small group of non-responders, suggesting not only that inhibitory pain control is disrupted in CRPS but that central neurons both in the somatosensory and auditory systems are facilitated, in particular to stimulation on the ipsilateral side of the body. The laterality of a dysfunction in inhibitory pain control was explored further by investigating pressure-pain and sharpness sensations on each side of the forehead in 22 CRPS patients during noxious cold stimulation of the affected limb versus noxious cold stimulation of the contralateral unaffected limb. Cold water immersion of the healthy limb decreased forehead sensitivity to pressure-pain bilaterally and decreased clinical pain in the affected limb. In contrast, immersion of the symptomatic limb increased pressure-pain sensitivity on both sides of the forehead. Sharpness ratings in the forehead remained unchanged to immersion of either limb. Nociceptive afferent input from the CRPS affected limb may thus either fail to evoke inhibitory processes or simultaneously evoke a pain facilitatory mechanism that masks inhibitory influences. Finally, pressure-pain and sharpness sensations were investigated on each side of the forehead in 35 chronic pain patients without CRPS (neuropathic or nociceptive limb pain, back pain or acute herpes zoster/postherpetic neuralgia) and were compared to similar measurements obtained in 34 patients with CRPS. Ipsilateral forehead hyperalgesia to pressure-pain was more common in CRPS patients (59...|$|R
