50|$|Trade coins are coins minted by a government, but not {{necessarily}} legal tender within {{the territory of the}} issuing country.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new cryptographic primitive called broadcast encryption with dealership. This notion, which has never been discussed in the cryptography literature, is applicable to many realistic broadcast services, for example subscription-based television service. Specifically, the new primitive enables a dealer to <b>bulk</b> <b>buy</b> the access to some products (e. g., TV channels) from the broadcaster, and hence, it will enable the dealer to resell the contents to the subscribers with a cheaper rate. Therefore, this creates business opportunity model for the dealer. We highlight the security consideration in such a scenario and capture the security requirements in the security model. Subsequently, we present a concrete scheme, which is proven secure under the decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent and the Diffie–Hellman exponent assumption...|$|R

50|$|In August 2000 it was {{announced}} that the Warrington and Doncaster stores were to close. With supermarkets getting even cheaper and increased competition from online stores, the chain started to flounder. When major competitors, such as HMV or Virgin, were present, their campaigns were better than Andys, and recent chart albums were available at much lower prices, due to their <b>bulk</b> <b>buying</b> power. Andys' marketing was not up to the standard of the bigger chains.|$|E
5000|$|Established in 1903, Cold Storage {{started as}} a small depot storing and selling mainly frozen meat from Australia.

Later, Cold Storage shifted from counter-service to self-service, introducing the supermarket to Singapore. Then, the company pioneered the concept of multiple retailing, capitalising on <b>bulk</b> <b>buying</b> and economies of scale.|$|E

40|$|The {{real-time}} bidding (RTB), aka programmatic buying, {{has recently}} become {{the fastest growing}} area in online ad-vertising. Instead of <b>bulking</b> <b>buying</b> and inventory-centric buying, RTB mimics stock exchanges and utilises computer algorithms to automatically buy and sell ads in real-time; It uses per impression context and targets the ads to spe-cific people based on data about them, and hence dramat-ically increases the effectiveness of display advertising. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis and measure-ment of a production ad exchange. Using the data sam-pled from both demand and supply side, we aim to provide first-hand insights into the emerging new impression selling infrastructure and its bidding behaviours, and help identi-fying research and design issues in such systems. From our study, we observed that periodic patterns occur in various statistics including impressions, clicks, bids, and conversion rates (both post-view and post-click), which suggest time-dependent models would be appropriate for capturing the repeated patterns in RTB. We also found that despite the claimed second price auction, the first price payment in fact is accounted for 55. 4 % of total cost due to {{the arrangement of the}} soft floor price. As such, we argue that the setting of soft floor price in the current RTB systems puts advertisers in a less favourable position. Furthermore, our analysis on the conversation rates shows that the current bidding strat-egy is far less optimal, indicating the significant needs for optimisation algorithms incorporating the facts such as the temporal behaviours, the frequency and recency of the ad displays, which have not been well considered in the past. 1...|$|R
25|$|A key {{assumption}} of Aickin's report was that {{traffic on the}} NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive {{was in fact a}} travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of <b>buying</b> <b>bulk</b> electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.|$|R

50|$|A Poverty Bay branch {{was set up}} in 1905. For {{the first}} ten years all the {{business}} was in merchandising. There were some meat exports, but little wool was handled. With the advent of the First World War the quantity of wool handled rose abruptly, {{in part because of the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>buying</b> contracts. The branch also won a fat stock agency with meat export company Thos Borthwick & Sons. They were provided with an Overland car and a Humber motorcycle. A horse and buggy was retained. A postwar slump in 1920 reduced activity and business did not recover during the 1920s or in the following Great Depression. Recovery did begin in 1937 and the early 1950s was a period of prosperity.|$|E
50|$|The {{period of}} the First World War gave a time of {{stability}} to New Zealand's agriculture and pastoral sector through <b>bulk</b> <b>buying</b> contracts between the New Zealand and British governments at good prices (set by the British government with the local government). The contracts for frozen meat ended on 30 June 1920 and the wool contract expired the same June. The British government was anxious {{to have it all}} shipped to England by November 1920 and growers were faced by free markets. The end of this comfortable co-relationship was followed immediately by a postwar slump and many in the industry suffered major financial difficulties. Though this slump proved brief, it was followed very soon after by other similar short sharp events.|$|E
