2500|$|For Tillich, {{the existential}} {{questions}} {{of human existence}} {{are associated with the}} field of philosophy and, more specifically, ontology (the study of being). This is because, according to Tillich, a lifelong pursuit of philosophy reveals that the central question of every philosophical inquiry always comes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of being, or what it means to be, to exist, to be a finite human being. [...] To be correlated with these questions are the theological answers, themselves derived from Christian revelation. [...] The task of the philosopher primarily involves developing the questions, whereas the task of the theologian primarily involves developing the answers to these questions. [...] However, it should be remembered that the two tasks overlap and include one another: the theologian must be somewhat of a philosopher and vice versa, for Tillich’s notion of faith as “ultimate concern” necessitates that the theological answer be correlated with, compatible with, and in response to the general ontological question which must be developed independently from the answers. [...] Thus, {{on one side of the}} correlation lies an ontological analysis of the human situation, whereas on the other is a presentation of the Christian message as a response to this existential dilemma. For Tillich, no formulation of the question can contradict the theological answer. [...] This is because the Christian message claims, a priori, that the logos “who became flesh” is also the universal logos of the Greeks.|$|E

60|$|There {{is plenty}} of other testimonies in the magazine, but these quoted samples will answer. They show the kind of trade the Science is driving. Now we come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> Does the Science kill a patient {{here and there and}} now and then? We must concede it. Does it {{compensate}} for this? I am persuaded that it can make a plausible showing in that direction. For instance: when it lays its hand upon a soldier who has suffered thirty years of helpless torture and makes him whole in body and mind, what is the actual sum of that achievement? This, I think: that it has restored to life a subject who had essentially died ten deaths a year for thirty years, and each of them a long and painful one. But for its interference that man in the three years which have since elapsed, would have essentially died thirty times more. There are thousands of young people in the land who are now ready to enter upon a life-long death similar to that man's. Every time the Science captures one of these and secures to him life-long immunity from imagination-manufactured disease, it may plausibly claim that in his person it has saved three hundred lives. Meantime, it will kill a man every now and then. But no matter, it will still be ahead on the credit side.|$|E

He wanted to show her something, he wanted to show her everything; but she was not sure now--after an hour's talk--that she particularly wanted to see anything more that he could show her.

They so told to our imagination her terrible little story that we were quite prepared--or thought we were--for her going out like a snuffed candle. She resisted, on her return to her original conditions, less than a year; the taste of the tree, as I had called it, had been fatal to her; what she had contentedly enough lived without before for half a century she couldn't now live without for a day. I know nothing of her original conditions--some minor American city--save that for her to have gone back to them was clearly to have stepped out of her frame. We performed, Mrs. Munden and I, a small funeral service for her by talking it all over and making it all out. It wasn't--the minor American city--a market for Holbeins, and what had occurred was that the poor old picture, banished from its museum and refreshed by the rise of no new movement to hang it, was capable of the miracle of a silent revolution; of itself turning, in its dire dishonour, its face to the wall. So it stood, without the intervention of the ghost of a critic, till they happened to pull it round again and find it mere dead paint.

6000|$|Daisy evidently had {{a natural}} talent for {{performing}} introductions; she mentioned {{the name of}} each of her companions to the other. She strolled alone {{with one of them}} on each side of her; Mr. Giovanelli, who spoke English very cleverly--Winterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses--addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense; he was extremely urbane, and the young American, who said nothing, reflected upon that profundity of Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed. Giovanelli, of course, had counted upon something more intimate; he had not bargained for a party of three. But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested far-stretching intentions. Winterbourne flattered himself that he had taken his measure. [...] "He is not a gentleman," [...] said the young American; [...] "he is only a clever imitation of one. He is a music master, or a penny-a-liner, or a third-rate artist. Dn his good looks!" [...] Mr. Giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face; but Winterbourne felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman's not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one. Giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable. It was true that, if he was an imitation, the imitation was brilliant. [...] "Nevertheless," [...] Winterbourne said to himself, [...] "a nice girl ought to know!" [...] And then he came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> whether this was, in fact, a nice girl. Would a nice girl, even allowing for her being a little American flirt, make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner? The rendezvous in this case, indeed, had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of Rome, but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism? Singular though it may seem, Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl, in joining her amoroso, should not appear more impatient of his own company, and he was vexed because of his inclination. It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady; she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy. It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers [...] "lawless passions." [...] That she should seem to wish {{to get rid of him}} would help him to think more lightly of her, and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing.
