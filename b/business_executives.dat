5|$|Shoup {{joined the}} <b>Business</b> <b>Executives</b> Move for Vietnam Peace. By 1971, Shoup {{publicly}} endorsed the anti-war veteran group Vietnam Veterans Against the War. As Vietnamization had reduced {{the visibility of}} the anti-war movement, and Shoup's criticism was not as prominent in the public arena. Fulbright and other senators urged the White House {{to listen to his}} criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique of American society and militarism was seen as more extreme than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{advancement}} in 2049 {{is not based}} on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied of cars and usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to Mad Max, a source cited as inspiration by the author in the acknowledgements of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much older and more seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head-hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, <b>business</b> <b>executives</b> have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris' wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive's car is the difference between promotion and death. She is not a fan of the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship.|$|E

5|$|The Public Relations Society of America and the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication {{commissioned}} {{studies in}} 1975 and 1987 {{on the state}} of public relations in education. They found that too many classes were taught by educators with little or no experience in the field and that most didn't have a post-graduate degree. Several standards in education were established by the studies, including that 75 percent of coursework for PR professionals be outside the major. In 1991, PRSA hosted a Task Force on the Structure and Role on Public Relations, which found that public relations teachers still lacked practical experience. In 1993 PRSA published a Professional Career Guide, which classified skills and knowledge that were needed at five different levels of someone's career. PRSA also advocates that MBA programs include communications programs, so <b>business</b> <b>executives</b> will be more prepared for a crisis.|$|E
5|$|Wax was {{particularly}} involved with Memphis Committee on Community Relations (MCCR). The MCCR {{was formed in}} 1958 {{by a group of}} Memphis city leaders, with a goal of ending segregation in a non-violent way. Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis. The MCCR also worked to get blacks representation in government (both elected and appointed officials), and created programs to improve economic conditions and job opportunities for blacks. Wax served as the MCCR's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s. Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MCCR, and, as owners of large Memphis companies, were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces. Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement: senior <b>business</b> <b>executives</b> convinced stores to hire black salespeople, Herschel Feibelman chaired the Memphis War on Poverty Committee, and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form, along with two white and two black lawyers, Memphis's first integrated law firm.|$|E
