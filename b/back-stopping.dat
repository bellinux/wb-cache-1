As shown in Figure  3, by assuming three points, namely, the trench axis at the deepest location (O), {{the intersection of the}} surface slope and the <b>back-stop</b> interface (A), and the intersection of the décollement and the <b>back-stop</b> interface (B) (Figure  3), we could define the slope angle α [= atan (Height A/Distance A)] and the décollement dip angle β [= atan (Height B/Distance B)]. The <b>back-stop</b> interface was referred from the figures by Tsuru et al. ([2002]) and Tsuji et al. ([2011]). Since the <b>back-stop</b> interface was not observed at BS 102 and BS 103, we tentatively set A and B at the horizontal distance of 20  km from the trench axis to obtain α and β from these profiles.|$|R

50|$|The Horticultural Collaborative Support Programme (HortCRSP)is a USAID funded {{project through}} the University of California Davis that is {{currently}} going on at RASD. It kicked off in October 2010 and will end in September 2013, and its objective is to promote production and marketing of Indigenous leafy greens among small holder farmers in Buikwe and Mukono districts-Central Uganda. This project involves multiple partners that include;University of California Davis, Makerere University, Mukono Zonal Agricultural and Development Institute (MUZARDI) and Uganda Christian University Mukono. The project is using two participatory agricultural development models that are increasingly gaining popularity worldwide in agricultural research and development work. These are the Farmer Field Schools and Participatory Market Chain Approaches that help farmers in addressing production and marketing constraints respectively. RASD's role in the project has been to mobilize farmers {{to participate in the}} project activities as well as providing technical <b>back-stopping</b> to farmers. RASD has also helped in coordinating the research activities of the different partners in this project. These include providing research assistance to the graduate students (PhD and Masters) attached to the project, through mobilizing farmers for surveys and interviews as well as providing internship placements for Undergraduate students in fields of Social work, Agriculture and Community Development.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Farmer-to-farmer {{extension}} {{offers a}} potentially low-cost and wide-reach alternative in supporting agricultural innovation. Various approaches are being promoted but {{information on their}} impact and sustainability is sparse. This study examines experiences of Self Help Africa and partners in Ghana, Uganda and Malawi. It asks: What is good practice in community extension for agriculture? What has been the impact of community extension on food security for smallholder farmers? What {{is the potential for}} scale-up and policy influence? Design/methodology/approach: Findings are based on a three-country mixed methods study of 240 households, farmer groups and community, government and NGO extensionists. Findings: Models of good practice include: community selection of extensionists, a twin technical and community development focus, and mutual learning. Impact of community based extension approaches on uptake of technologies, food security and livelihoods of poor groups was found to be broadly positive. Practical implications: Community based approaches appear sustainable where: communities provide support for their extensionists; community extensionists have marketable skills; communities and extensionists are developing Community Based Organisations (CBOs); and linkages are maintained with research and extension bodies. Community based extension approaches are being scaled-up in Malawi and elsewhere. To achieve sustainable pro-poor impacts, support will be needed for continued technical and community development training and <b>back-stopping</b> for community extensionists, and evaluation of different approaches. Originality/value: The study provides important evidence that community extensionists can help facilitate innovation in sustainable agriculture and reach the poor in a cost-effective way. They should be seen by policy-makers as part of pluralistic demand-driven extension, complementing over-stretched extension services...|$|E
40|$|On September 4, 2010, an {{earthquake}} struck rural Canterbury {{and the most}} deadly of over 2, 000 aftershocks devastated the Christchurch Central Business District on February 22, 2011 (Ardagh et al. 2012). Questions have arisen regarding population dynamics (Love 2011), marginalized groups, health and social care, and overall recovery efforts. Addressing some of these concerns are various non-profit, non-governmental, and faith based groups, collectively referred to as Third Sector Organizations (TSOs). By providing an alternative to and <b>back-stopping</b> government and private health and social services, TSOs are able to build resiliency following a natural disaster, and are especially able to identify and address unmet needs within their target audiences and maintain {{a sense of community}} within their operating areas. The nature of community recovery, also changes the role of TSOs in formal and grassroots efforts over time. In New Zealand, TSOs have shared community health burdens with government and private practices since the 1990 s (Larner and Craig 2005) and have championed healthcare policy measures for ethnic minorities (Came 2014). Nevertheless, the earthquakes have presented challenges to TSOs. An inventory of 92 TSOs four months after the earthquakes, 106 one year after, and 454 two years after by Carlton and Vallance (2013) shows that although many TSOs have emerged to address earthquake related issues, other TSOs may have been unable to re-establish themselves outside areas with earthquake damage found to be too severe to inhabit by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA). Others reported “burn-out” and 52 were inactive or closed because of shifting needs during recovery. This research identifies shared experiences across the third sector in Canterbury to illuminate shifting roles in mid to long-term earthquake recovery...|$|E

40|$|The business-as-usual {{scenario}} is as standard in DICE- 2009, and assumes largely unabated emissions {{for the next}} 250 years, after which a zero-emissions <b>back-stop</b> technology is assumed to become the competitive energy supply technology, driving energyrelated anthropogenic emissions to zero. The mitigation scenario is taken from forthcoming work by Dietz and Matei (2013), and limits the median atmospheric concentration of CO 2 to 500 ppm at least cost in a stochastic implementation of DICE with uncertainty about the climate sensitivity and effective heat capacity. 1 As in the {{business-as-usual scenario}}, a clean <b>back-stop</b> technology is assumed to operate from 2255. The two scenarios hence implement different emissions controls over the next 250 years, although {{the dynamics of the}} climate system mean that these differences will have effects beyond 2255.
