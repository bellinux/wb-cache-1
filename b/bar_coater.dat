30|$|Cleaning was {{achieved}} by attaching the cloth to a K control <b>bar</b> <b>coater</b> (RK Print, UK) which was used to draw the cloth once across the surface with a velocity of approximately 2.7  ×  10 − 2 ms− 1 and a lateral force of 2.7  ×  10 − 3  N. The bar was supported at either end by grips and fixed at a height of 2  mm above the surface to limit the downward force exerted on the surface. As the bar was free to move upwards in the vertical direction, the maximum possible downward force over the entire surface due to {{the mass of the}} bar was equal to 1  N. This is a rather high pressure and equivalent to rubbing with the thumb. However, given that the thickness of the cloth ranged between approximately 2.5  mm and 0.8  mm when fully compressed, it is unlikely that this maximum force was exerted on the surface during cleaning.|$|E

In this study, {{with the aim of}} the production of environmentally friendly antibacterial paper, nanoclay was selected as a productive agent of antibacterial effect. Since the effectiveness of nanoclay depends on the amount of its negative charge, nanoclay was homogenized using a homogenizer until be processed a homogeneous structure with more negative charge. Due to the negativity of charge of fibers and clay nanoparticles, Nanoclays was combined with starch at levels of 1, 3 and 4 %, and the suspension was applied to on surface of the paper as an overlay using Auto <b>Bar</b> <b>Coater.</b> Antibacterial and physical properties of papers were evaluated. The results showed that nanoclays had a significantly effect on inhibiting the growth of bacteria and were able to reduce the growth of bacteria even at low levels of consumption. Water absorption of papers decreased and their resistance to air increased. Hence {{it can be said that}} homogenized nanoclay can be a desirable factor in the production of packaging papers with low water absorption, high resistance to air and resistant to bacterial microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the property of Para rubber latex applied as the binder in printing ink for biodegradable plastic film. The mixture of ink using natural or modified Para rubber latex was compared to the water-based ink using acrylic binder. Natural Para rubber latex in this study had solid content of 35. 9 %, 41. 2 %, 59. 0 % and 61. 4 %. The Para rubber latex was also modified by the addition of functional group called CNR at solid content of 16. 5 %, 19. 2 %, 26. 8 % and 28. 2 % respectively. Viscosity of samples was measured by Zahn cup # 3 and drying time on plastic film was evaluated. The organic reactive dyes were used as colorant in printing ink. Two additive substances including dispersing agent and wax were added to help disperse the particles and to increase gloss, respectively. The printability of ink on biodegradable plastic film was tested using the <b>bar</b> <b>coater.</b> The optimal binder was natural Para rubber latex with solid content of 35. 9 % and 41. 2 %, which had the viscosity of 9. 52 seconds and drying time of around 5 minutes. The viscosity of Para rubber latex with solid content of 59. 0 % and 61. 4 % was very high; thus, resulted in coagulation. Then modified rubber latex CNR with solid content of 16. 5 %, 19. 2 %, 26. 8 % and 28. 2 %, which had the viscosity around 8. 30 seconds and drying time of around 5 minutes. Dye solution was prepared by adding 1 part of dye to 1 part of water (w/w). The formulation of ink that yielded th...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{in this thesis}} was to study the {{suitability}} of flexographic printing and new electrode materials {{in the manufacture of}} flexible piezoelectric pressure sensors. There are numerous application where flexible and economical pressure sensors can be used. Such are process controll in industry and measurement of vital functions and pressure stress in health care. Flexography would enable economical and efficient mass-production of such sensors. Function of the pressure sensors fabricated in this work is based on piezoelectricity of the uniaxially stretched and poled polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) that is used as substrate in sensors. When piezoelectric PVDF is exposed to mechanical stress, electric charges of opposite signs (voltage difference) form {{on opposite sides of the}} substrate. If conducting electrodes are fabricated on surface of the substrate, formed charges can be conducted to measuring unit that analyses the magnitude of the charge. Because formed charge is proportional to the force applied on PVDF, force or pressure applied on sensor can be solved. Because piezoelectric PVDF cannot resist high temperatures, no inks that require high sintering temperatures can be used as electrode materials. Manufacture of metal electrodes by sputtering or evaporation is slow and expensive. In this work carbon nanotubes and conducting poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) polymer are studied as alternative electrode materials. Electrodes are fabricated by using RK Flexiproof 100 flexo-printer or CX 202 Motorized <b>bar</b> <b>coater.</b> For lower price and better availability also non-piezoelectric substrates were used to evaluate printing process and electrode materials. Fabricated samples were electrically characterized. Main focus was in sheet resistance of the electrodes and sensitivity of the sensor elements. Obtained sheet resistance values varied a lot. Highest values were up to over four orders of magnitude larger than those of metal electrodes. Despite the high sheet resistance, fabricated samples showed sensitivities comparable to reference samples. According to the results of this work, studied new electrode materials are most likely suitable to be used in flexible pressure sensors...|$|E
40|$|Rechargeable {{lithium-ion}} batteries show great advantages over traditional batteries and are extensively used for consumer electronic devices {{due to their}} high energy density and long cycle life. However, the improvement of performance of current {{lithium-ion batteries}} requires the optimization of the materials used (electrolyte and electrodes). Therefore, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to exploring new materials with high capacity, excellent cycling performance, low cost and high safety features [1 - 4]. As an example, carbon xerogels are promising candidates {{in the development of}} new high performance C-based anode materials for Li-ion batteries, since such carbonaceous materials show very small changes of volume during the charge/discharge process, providing an improved cycle life. Nevertheless, hard carbons also exhibit quite high irreversible capacity losses due to their intrinsic high microporosity and, compared to graphite, a poor rate performance related to slow diffusion of Li in the internal structure [5 - 6]. To reduce these disadvantages, the structural and textural characteristics need to be carefully controlled. Also, due to the different morphology of these materials compared to graphite, the deposition of carbon xerogels on current collectors needs to be studied in detail. 	In this work, porous carbon xerogels were synthetized from Resorcinol-Formaldehyde mixtures by adjusting the pH of the solution in order to obtain different mesopore sizes. Monoliths of carbon xerogels were obtained after drying of the polymer gel and pyrolysis [7]. Mercury intrusion porosimetry and nitrogen adsorption techniques (BET) was used to characterize the pore texture of the carbon xerogels. These monoliths were ground to particles around 10 µm for all the samples. The resulting powders were then mixed with a binder and a solvent to form slurries and then cast on copper foil using a <b>bar</b> <b>coater.</b> After evaporation of the solvent, the resulting coatings were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the morphology and their thickness was monitored by profilometry. 	The resulting electrodes were subjected to electrochemical characterization. Since the particle sizes and the method of coating was the same for all the samples, it was possible to evaluate selectively the influence of the textural and structural parameters of the different carbon materials on their performances. Electrochemical characterizations were performed using charge-discharge galvanostatic curves and cyclic voltammetry in Li/C half cells between 0. 005 and 1. 5 V vs. Li+/Li.
