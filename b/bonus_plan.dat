40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} risk management incentives resulting from managerial <b>bonus</b> <b>plans</b> on firms' derivatives usage. Partitioning the sample into firms whose managers {{are more likely to}} face convexity or concavity in the bonus payoff function, we find a negative relation between <b>bonus</b> <b>plans</b> and derivatives usage for firms in the convex region and a positive relation for firms in the concave region. These results provide evidence that the incentives inherent in managerial <b>bonus</b> <b>plans</b> cause managers to increase or decrease firm risk in order to maximize their expected bonus payments. ...|$|R

40|$|Economic Value Added (EVA) is a {{performance}} measure {{that is being}} used by an increasing number of companies, but academic research on EVA is limited. In addition, all prior empirical academic studies on EVA have used the firm as the unit of analysis. In this study, we examine the effect of EVA on the performance of individual managers. Specifically, we examine whether managers on EVA-based <b>bonus</b> <b>plans</b> outperform managers on traditional accounting-based <b>bonus</b> <b>plans.</b> We are able to test this because we have access to an EVA-focused company that has managers on both EVA and traditional <b>bonus</b> <b>plans.</b> Our results suggest that managers on EVA <b>bonus</b> <b>plans</b> who understand the EVA concept perform better than managers on traditional <b>bonus</b> <b>plans.</b> However, we find some evidence that the increase in performance results from increased consistency or congruence in the manager's evaluation-reward process rather than from superiority of EVA as {{a performance}} measure. Also, we find that the effect of EVA bonuses and EVA understanding differs depending on the area of the firm in which the manager is employed. This suggests that EVA may not be a universally appropriate base for reward systems. *Mohan Lal passed away 24 July 2002. This paper is dedicated to him. ...|$|R

50|$|Bonus {{plans are}} {{variable}} pay plans. They have three classic objectives:1. Adjust labor cost to financial results - {{the basic idea}} {{is to create a}} <b>bonus</b> <b>plan</b> where the company is paying more bonuses in ‘good times’ and less (or no) bonuses in ‘bad times’. By having <b>bonus</b> <b>plan</b> budget adjusted according to financial results, the company’s labor cost is automatically reduced when the company isn’t doing so well, while good company performance drives higher bonuses to employees.2. Drive employee performance - the basic idea is that if an employee knows that his/her bonus depend on the occurrence of a specific event (or paid according to performance, or if a certain goal is achieved), then the employee will do whatever he/she can to secure this event (or improve their performance, or achieve the desired goal). In other words, the bonus is creating an incentive to improve business performance (as defined through the bonus plan).3. Employee retention - retention is not a primary objective of bonus plans, yet bonuses are thought to bring value with employee retention as well, for three reasons: a) a well designed <b>bonus</b> <b>plan</b> is paying more money to better performers; a competitor offering a competing job-offer to these top performers is likely to face a higher hurdle, given that these employees are already paid higher due to the <b>bonus</b> <b>plan.</b> b) if the bonus is paid annually, employee is less inclined to leave the company before bonus payout; often the reason for leaving (e.g. dispute with the manager, competing job offer) 'goes away' by the time the bonus is paid. the <b>bonus</b> <b>plan</b> 'buy' more time for the company to retain the employee. c) employees paid more are more satisfied with their job (all other things being equal) thus less inclined to leave their employer.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to obtain}} {{empirical}} {{evidence about the}} influence of corporate governance practices, <b>bonus</b> <b>plans,</b> debt-covenant and firm size on earnings management practices. Corporate governance practices were measured using three variables (the structure of independent commissioners, the audit committee and auditor reputation with size of Public Accountant Office), <b>bonus</b> <b>plans</b> are measured from the bonus by using a dummy, debt-covenant with measured by debt to equity ratio, and firm size measured value of the number of shares outstanding year-end. Earnings management measured by discretionary accruals using the Modified Jones Model. The population in this study is 135 manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2008 - 2010. The research data obtained from financial statements and annual reports of manufacturing companies in the period 2008 - 2010. Based on purposive sampling method, samples obtained as many as 18 companies by the number of observation data as much as 54 data derived from the company's total sample multiplied by the period 2008 to 2010. The hypothesis in this study were tested using multiple regression analysis. The analysis showed that the variable that have a significant influence on earnings management is firm size. Furthermore, the structure of independent commissioners, the audit committees, auditor reputation, <b>bonus</b> <b>plans,</b> and debtcovenants does not significantly influence earnings management...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} extent to which {{employment}} horizon concerns affect the relative emphasis on financial versus nonfinancial performance measures in annual <b>bonus</b> <b>plans.</b> We argue that managers of loss-making firms are likely to voluntarily or forcibly depart in the near future and, consequently, have a shorter employment horizon. Loss-making firms then need to increase the emphasis on forward-looking nonfinancial performance measures to motivate long-term effort of their managers. Thus, we hypothesize that the emphasis on nonfinancial performance measures is greater in loss making than in profitable firms even after controlling for the informativeness of earnings. We find consistent support for our hypothesis using different (archival, survey, and field) data sources and various proxies for short employment horizon and the emphasis on nonfinancial performance measures. employment horizon problem, performance measurement, losses, <b>bonus</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

5000|$|This concept {{captured}} {{the hearts of}} many, and indeed most bonus plans nowadays are designed based on it, yet since the late 1940s {{a growing body of}} empirical evidence has suggested that these if-then rewards do not work {{in a variety of settings}} common to the modern workplace. The failings of the <b>bonus</b> <b>plan</b> often relate to rewarding the wrong behaviour. For example, managers who keep to the status quo, fire valuable (expensive) employees, and engage in immoral business practices can achieve better short-term financial outcomes (and therefore a bonus) than a manager who is attempting to innovate his or her way to higher profits. When bonus plans are poorly thought out, they have the potential to damage employee performance and cause regulatory headaches.
