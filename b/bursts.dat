5|$|In 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin {{detected}} <b>bursts</b> {{of radio}} signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2MHz. The period of these <b>bursts</b> matched {{the rotation of}} the planet, and they were also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio <b>bursts</b> from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long <b>bursts</b> (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short <b>bursts</b> (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.|$|E
5|$|Heat <b>bursts</b> {{are rare}} {{atmospheric}} phenomenon characterized by gusty winds and a {{rapid increase in}} temperature and decrease in dew point (moisture). Heat <b>bursts</b> typically occur during night-time and are associated with decaying thunderstorms. In association with wake lows, heat <b>bursts</b> are caused when rain evaporates (virga) into a parcel of cold dry air high in the atmosphere making the air denser than its surroundings. The parcel descends rapidly, warming due to compression, overshoots its equilibrium level and reaches the surface, similar to a downburst.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the issue of {{providing}} differentiated services to IP packets over an optical <b>burst</b> switched core network, and we introduce a new approach for assembling packets into a <b>burst.</b> In this technique, a composite <b>burst</b> is created by combining packets of different classes into the same <b>burst.</b> The packets are placed from the head of the <b>burst</b> to the tail of the <b>burst</b> in order of decreasing class. The performance of this approach is enhanced by using a <b>burst</b> segmentation technique in which, during <b>burst</b> contention, only the packets in the tail of a <b>burst</b> are dropped. We describe a generalized model for <b>burst</b> assembly and <b>burst</b> scheduling, and we propose several composite <b>burst</b> assembly methods. We observe that having multiple class of packets in a <b>burst</b> performs better than having a single class of packets in a <b>burst...</b>|$|R
40|$|Twitter {{has become}} one of largest social {{networks}} for users to broadcast <b>burst</b> topics. There have been many studies on how to detect <b>burst</b> topics. However, mining <b>burst</b> patterns in <b>burst</b> topics has not been solved by the existing works. In this paper, we investigate the problem of mining <b>burst</b> patterns of <b>burst</b> topic in Twitter. A <b>burst</b> topic user graph model is proposed, which can represent the topology structure of <b>burst</b> topic propagation across a large number of Twitter users. Based on the model, hierarchical clustering is applied to cluster <b>burst</b> topics and reveal <b>burst</b> patterns from the macro perspective. Frequent sub-graph mining is used to discover the information flow patterns of <b>burst</b> topic from the micro perspective. Experimental results show that several interesting <b>burst</b> patterns are discovered, which can reveal different <b>burst</b> topic clusters and frequent information flows of <b>burst</b> topic...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{representative}} <b>burst</b> buffer architectures in the {{high-performance computing}} environments: node-local <b>burst</b> buffer and remote shared <b>burst</b> buffer. In the node-local <b>burst</b> buffer architecture, <b>burst</b> buffer storage {{is located on}} the individual compute node, so the aggregate <b>burst</b> buffer bandwidth grows linearly with the compute node count. This scalability benefit has been well-documented in recent literature.It also comes with the demand for a scalable metadata management strategy to maintain a global namespace for data distributed across all the <b>burst</b> buffers. In the remote shared <b>burst</b> buffer architecture, <b>burst</b> buffer storage resides on a fewer number of I/O nodes positioned between the compute nodes and the back-end storage systems. Data movement between the compute nodes and <b>burst</b> buffer needs to go through the network. Placing <b>burst</b> buffer on the I/O nodes facilitates the independent development, deployment and maintenance of the <b>burst</b> buffer service. Hence, several well-known commercialized software products have been developed to manage this type of <b>burst</b> buffer, such as DataWarp and Infinite Memory Engine.|$|R

5|$|Gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> {{were first}} {{observed}} in the late 1960s by the U.S. Vela satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The United States suspected that the Soviet Union might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 UTC, the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature. Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, led by Ray Klebesadel, filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the <b>bursts</b> as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen <b>bursts</b> and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin. The discovery was declassified and published in 1973.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a <b>burst</b> retransmission method for an optical <b>burst</b> switched network with intermediate-node-initiation (INI) signaling technique. The proposed method tries to reduce the <b>burst</b> contention probability at the intermediate core nodes. We develop an analytical model to get the <b>burst</b> contention probability and <b>burst</b> loss probability for an optical <b>burst</b> switched network with intermediate-node-initiation signaling technique. The proposed method uses the optical <b>burst</b> retransmission method. We simulate the performance of the optical <b>burst</b> retransmission. Simulation results show that at low traffic loads the loss probability is low compared to the conventional <b>burst</b> retransmission in the OBS network. Result also show that the retransmission method for OBS network with intermediate-node-initiation signaling technique significantly reduces the <b>burst</b> loss probability...|$|R

5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray <b>bursts.</b> These account for about 30% of gamma-ray <b>bursts,</b> but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.|$|E

50|$|<b>Burst</b> {{synchronization}} {{refers to}} the alignment of <b>bursting</b> and quiescent periods in interconnected neurons. In general, if a network of <b>bursting</b> neurons is linked it will eventually synchronize for most types of <b>bursting.</b> Synchronization can also appear in circuits containing no intrinsically <b>bursting</b> neurons, however its appearance and stability can often be improved by including intrinsically <b>bursting</b> cells in the network. Since synchronization is related to plasticity and memory via Hebbian plasticity and long-term potentiation the interplay with plasticity and intrinsic <b>bursting</b> is very important.|$|R
5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, {{and in a few}} cases particularly well-localized <b>bursts</b> (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> would require both new satellites and faster communication.|$|E
5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, {{which had been}} designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these <b>bursts,</b> such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the <b>bursts,</b> clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E

In OBS control packet called control <b>burst</b> is separated from data packet called data <b>burst.</b> A control <b>burst</b> is sent in advance, which configures the switches in the path for data <b>burst.</b> Due to lack of adequate contention resolution technique data <b>burst</b> loss is high in OBS.

40|$|Optical <b>Burst</b> Switching (OBS) is a {{switching}} paradigm {{that offers}} very high throughput with reasonable delay. In OBS, data is transported {{in the form}} of the optical <b>burst</b> of unknown length. Till date, the size of the <b>burst</b> can’t be estimated in advance. Hence, in OBS deflection routing, contending <b>burst</b> is deflected to some other node and after some more slot, it will re-appear on the same node. This mechanism is known as deflection of <b>burst.</b> In our previous work, an estimation of <b>burst</b> is done and optical node architecture is used to store optical <b>burst.</b> The buffering of <b>burst</b> will reduce average latency as well as improve <b>Burst</b> Error Probability (BER). In this paper, the performance evaluation of the node architecture is presented under various conditions and it is shown that deflection routing along with buffering of contending <b>burst</b> provide very effective solution...|$|R
5|$|Most early {{theories}} of gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> posited nearby sources within the Milky Way Galaxy. From 1991, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data {{that showed the}} distribution of GRBs is isotropic—not biased towards any particular direction in space. If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated {{in or near the}} galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> must come from beyond the Milky Way.

The {{purpose of the}} study was to compare the <b>burst</b> properties of hydrogen-exposed stainless steel vessels <b>burst</b> with different media: water, helium gas, or deuterium gas. A second purpose of the tests was to provide data for the development of a predictive finite-element model. The <b>burst</b> tests were conducted on hydrogen-exposed and unexposed axially-flawed cylindrical vessels. The results indicate that samples <b>burst</b> pneumatically had lower volume ductility than those tested hydraulically. Deuterium gas tests had slightly lower ductility than helium gas tests. <b>Burst</b> pressures were not affected by <b>burst</b> media. Hydrogen-charged samples had lower volume ductility and slightly higher <b>burst</b> pressures than uncharged samples. Samples <b>burst</b> with deuterium gas fractured by quasi-cleavage near the inside wall. The results of the tests were used to improve a previously developed predictive finite-element model. The results show that predicting <b>burst</b> behavior requires as a material input the effect of hydrogen on the plastic strain to fracture from tensile tests. The <b>burst</b> test model shows that a reduction in the plastic strain to fracture of the material will result in lower volume ductility without a reduction in <b>burst</b> pressure which is in agreement with the <b>burst</b> results...|$|R
