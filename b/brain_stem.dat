5|$|In around 1 {{percent of}} infections, {{poliovirus}} spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying motor neurons within the spinal cord, <b>brain</b> <b>stem,</b> or motor cortex. This {{leads to the}} development of paralytic poliomyelitis, the various forms of which (spinal, bulbar, and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the <b>brain</b> <b>stem.</b> An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E

50|$|Low Level Laser (light) Therapy {{decreases}} {{pain and}} inflammation, accelerates {{the healing of}} muscle and joint tissues by 25%-35%, and reconnects the <b>brain</b> <b>stem’s</b> neurological pathways, effectively inhibiting pain. Low-level laser therapy combined with electrical stimulation improves mouth opening in patients diagnosed with TMJ/D. The musculoskeletal system's natural healing ability decreases pain and promotes TMJ stability.|$|R
5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the <b>brain</b> <b>stem.</b> The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the <b>brain</b> <b>stem.</b> The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the <b>brain</b> <b>stem.</b> The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the <b>brain</b> <b>stem</b> {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E

40|$|Human <b>brain</b> tumor <b>stem</b> {{cells have}} been enriched using {{antibodies}} against the surface protein CD 133. An antibody recognizing CD 133 also served to isolate normal neural {{stem cells from}} fetal human brain, suggesting a possible lineage relationship between normal neural and <b>brain</b> tumor <b>stem</b> cells. Whether CD 133 -positive <b>brain</b> tumor <b>stem</b> cells {{can be derived from}} CD 133 -positive neural stem or progenitor cells still requires direct experimental evidence, and an important step toward such investigations is the identification and characterization of normal CD 133 -presenting cells in neuro-genic regions of the embryonic and adult brain. Here, we present evidence that CD 133 is a marker for embryonic neural stem cells, an intermediate radial glial/ependymal cell type in the early postnatal stage, and for ependymal cells in the adult brain, but not for neurogenic astrocytes in the adult subven-tricular zone. Our findings suggest two principal possibilities for the origin of <b>brain</b> tumor <b>stem</b> cells: a derivation from CD 133 -expressing cells, which are normally not present in the adult <b>brain</b> (embryonic neural <b>stem</b> cells and an early postnatal intermediate radial glial/ependymal cell type), or from CD 133 -positive ependymal cells in the adult brain, which are, however, generally regarded as postmitotic. Alternatively, <b>brain</b> tumor <b>stem</b> cells could be derived from proliferative but CD 133 -negative neurogenic astrocytes in the adult brain. In the latter case, brain tumor development would involve the production of CD 133. [Cancer Res 2007; 67 (12) : 5727 – 36...|$|R
5000|$|The game {{begins with}} a Furon, Cryptosporidium-136, {{hovering}} over a launch site with military personnel testing a rocket. The rocket is launched and destroys the ship carrying Cryptospiridium-136, and leaves him fatally wounded. Crypto-136 is later captured, by the U.S. Army. Some time later, Cryptosporidium-137 travels to Earth with another Furon, Orthopox-13. Cryptosporidium (nicknamed 'Crypto') comes {{with the intention of}} rescuing 136, while Orthopox (nicknamed 'Pox') desires to extract human <b>brain</b> <b>stems</b> for study. Crypto arrives at Turnipseed Farm in the Midwest, where Pox mistakes Cows for Earth's dominant life-form. The Majestic agency is alerted to the Furon presence when Crypto decimates an army brigade passing through the area. Pox, communicating with Crypto through a hologram-like device, then reveals to Crypto that the reason he requires human <b>brain</b> <b>stems</b> is because they contain pure Furon D.N.A. handed down to them by Furon scouts eons ago when the Furons stopped on Earth for [...] "shore leave" [...] following a war with Mars (which was rendered uninhabitable by the Furon Empire).|$|R
5|$|The medial {{zone of the}} {{anterior}} and posterior lobes constitutes the spinocerebellum, also known as paleocerebellum. This sector of the cerebellum functions mainly to fine-tune body and limb movements. It receives proprioceptive input from the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (including the spinocerebellar tract) and from the cranial trigeminal nerve, {{as well as from}} visual and auditory systems. It sends fibers to deep cerebellar nuclei that, in turn, project to both the cerebral cortex and the <b>brain</b> <b>stem,</b> thus providing modulation of descending motor systems.|$|E
5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, <b>brain</b> <b>stem,</b> basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, {{and the rest of}} the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the <b>brain</b> <b>stem</b> and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E

5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her <b>brain</b> <b>stem.</b> Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident.

25|$|An {{area near}} the <b>brain</b> <b>stem,</b> known as the reticular {{activating}} system, goes to work, causing a state of keen alertness as well as sharpening of hearing and vision.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Magoun {{recorded}} potentials {{within the}} medial {{portion of the}} <b>brain</b> <b>stem</b> and discovered that auditory stimuli directly fired portions of the reticular activating system. Furthermore, single-shock stimulation of the sciatic nerve also activated the medial reticular formation, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Excitation of the ARAS did not depend on further signal propagation through the cerebellar circuits, as the same results were obtained following decerebellation and decortication. The researchers proposed that a column of cells surrounding the midbrain reticular formation received input from all the ascending tracts of the <b>brain</b> <b>stem</b> and relayed these afferents to the cortex and therefore regulated wakefulness.|$|E
