5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>function</b> of {{equipment}} in Final Fantasy games {{is to increase}} character attributes; arming Zidane with a Mythril Vest, for example, increases his base defense statistic. In Final Fantasy IX, weapons and armor include special character abilities, which the character may use when the item is equipped (permitting the ability matches their class). Once the character accumulates enough ability points in battle, the ability becomes usable without having to keep the item equipped. In addition to granting abilities the equipment in Final Fantasy IX determines the statistical growth of the characters {{at the time of}} level up. Armor not only raises base defense or evasion statistics but raises defense and/or other statistics at level up.|$|E
5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>function</b> of {{equipment}} in SaGa games {{is to increase}} character attributes. Arming a character with a gold helmet increases his or her base defense statistic, for example. The amount {{of equipment}} that can be placed on any one character at any time depends on the character's class. Humans can hold eight, mutants four, and monsters none. There are five types of armor: shields, helmets, breastplates, gauntlets, and shoes. Only one of each at a time may be added to one character and cannot be added to monsters. Weapons, consisting of swords, hammers, whips, spell books, and guns, utilize either the strength, agility or mana attribute of a character, {{and can be used}} only a certain number of times before breaking and being removed from the player's inventory. Shields can be used as items in combat, most with a limited number of uses, and allow the user to evade enemy attacks.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the fingertip in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the <b>basic</b> <b>function</b> of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E

25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Its <b>basic</b> <b>function</b> is to detect a fault condition and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday, the circuit breaker was invented by an American, Charles Grafton Page.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current, typically resulting from an overload or short circuit. Its <b>basic</b> <b>function</b> is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. The generic function of a circuit breaker, RCD or a fuse, as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as ADS (Automatic Disconnection of Supply).|$|E
25|$|MC firms sell {{products}} that have real or perceived non-price differences. However, {{the differences are}} not so great as to eliminate other goods as substitutes. Technically, the cross price elasticity of demand between goods in such a market is positive. In fact, the XED would be high. MC goods are best described as close but imperfect substitutes. The goods perform the same basic functions but have differences in qualities such as type, style, quality, reputation, appearance, and location that tend to distinguish them from each other. For example, the <b>basic</b> <b>function</b> of motor vehicles is the same—to move people and objects from point to point in reasonable comfort and safety. Yet {{there are many different}} types of motor vehicles such as motor scooters, motor cycles, trucks and cars, and many variations even within these categories.|$|E

25|$|Line markers are {{generally}} used on permanent guidelines to provide critical information to divers following the line. The slots and notches provided {{are used to}} wrap the line to secure the marker in place. A simple passage of the line through the enlarged area {{at the base of}} the two slots will allow the marker to slide along the line, or even fall off if brushed by a diver. To more securely fasten the marker, an extra wrap may be added at each slot. The <b>basic</b> <b>function</b> of these markers is fairly consistent internationally, but procedures may differ by region, and between teams. The protocol for placement and removal should be well understood by the members of a specific team. Temporary line markers are only for the use of the team who placed them and are removed during exit to avoid littering a cave system with irrelevant and potentially confusing information.|$|E
25|$|The rites {{concerning}} Janus were numerous. Owing to the {{versatile and}} far reaching character of his <b>basic</b> <b>function</b> marking all beginnings and transitions, his presence was ubiquitous and fragmented. Apart from the rites solemnizing {{the beginning of}} the new year and of every month, there were the special times of the year which marked the beginning and closing of the military season, in March and October respectively. These included the rite of the arma movēre on 1 March and that of the arma condĕre {{at the end of the}} month performed by the Salii, and the Tigillum Sororium on 1 October. Janus Quirinus was closely associated with the anniversaries of the dedications of the temples of Mars on 1 June (a date that corresponded with the festival of Carna, a deity associated with Janus: see below) and of that of Quirinus on 29 June (which was the last day of the month in the pre-Julian calendar). These important rites are discussed in detail below.|$|E
25|$|The singing process {{functions}} best when certain physical {{conditions of the}} body are put in place. The ability to move air {{in and out of}} the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its <b>basic</b> <b>function</b> efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.|$|E

In an August 2007 op-ed piece in Financial Times, Frank wrote, [...] "In the debate between those who believe in essentially unregulated markets and others who hold that reasonable regulation diminishes market excesses without inhibiting their <b>basic</b> <b>function,</b> the subprime situation unfortunately provides ammunition for the latter view." [...] Frank was also instrumental in the passage of , the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2008, a measure that drew praise from editorial boards and consumer advocates. In 2007. Frank co-sponsored legislation to reform the Section 202 refinancing program, which is for affordable housing for the elderly, and Section 811 disabled programs. Frank has been a chief advocate of the National Housing Trust Fund, which was created as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and was the first affordable housing program to be enacted by the Congress since 1990.|$|E
