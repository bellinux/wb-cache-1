5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, <b>buspirone,</b> L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on the central nervous system (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> {{has a low}} oral {{bioavailability}} of 3.9% {{relative to}} intravenous injection due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The time to peak plasma levels following ingestion is 0.9 to 1.5hours. It {{is reported to have}} an elimination half-life of 2.8hours, although a review of 14 studies found that the mean terminal half-life ranged between 2 and 11hours, and one study even reported a terminal half-life of 33hours. <b>Buspirone</b> is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, and prominent drug interactions with inhibitors and inducers of this enzyme have been observed. Major metabolites of <b>buspirone</b> include 5-hydroxybuspirone, 6-hydroxybuspirone, 8-hydroxybuspirone, and 1-PP. 6-Hydroxybuspirone has been identified as the predominant hepatic metabolite of <b>buspirone,</b> with plasma levels that are 40-fold greater than those of <b>buspirone</b> after oral administration of <b>buspirone</b> to humans. The metabolite is a high-affinity partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 25nM) similarly to <b>buspirone,</b> and has demonstrated occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor in vivo. As such, it is likely {{to play an important role}} in the therapeutic effects of <b>buspirone.</b> 1-PP has also been found to circulate at higher levels than those of <b>buspirone</b> itself and may similarly play a significant role in the clinical effects of <b>buspirone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> {{appears to}} be {{relatively}} benign in cases of single-drug overdose, although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available. In one clinical trial, <b>buspirone</b> was administered to healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375mg/day, and produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. In early clinical trials, <b>buspirone</b> was given at dosages even as high as 2,400mg/day, with akathisia, tremor, and muscle rigidity observed. Deliberate overdoses with 250mg and up to 300mg <b>buspirone</b> have resulted in drowsiness in about 50% of individuals. One death {{has been reported in}} association with 450mg <b>buspirone</b> together with alprazolam, diltiazem, alcohol, cocaine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> is {{approved}} in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the short- or long-term treatment of anxiety disorders or {{can also be}} used for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Likewise in Australia, <b>buspirone</b> is licensed for the treatment of anxiety disorders. In the United Kingdom, <b>buspirone</b> is indicated only for the short-term treatment of anxiety.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> {{acts as an}} agonist of the {{serotonin}} 5-HT1A receptor {{with high}} affinity. It is a preferential full agonist of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which are inhibitory autoreceptors, and a partial agonist of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. In accordance, an animal study found that <b>buspirone</b> dose-dependently decreases serotonin levels in specific brain areas while increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels. It is thought that the main effects of <b>buspirone</b> are mediated via its interaction with the 5-HT1A receptor. Some of its effects may be mediated via oxytocin release secondary to 5-HT1A receptor agonism. <b>Buspirone</b> also has lower affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Buspar, is an {{anxiolytic}} drug that is primarily used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is also commonly used to augment antidepressants {{in the treatment of}} major depressive disorder. Unlike most anxiolytics, the pharmacology of <b>buspirone</b> is not related to that of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or carbamates (it is not a GABA receptor agonist), and so <b>buspirone</b> does not carry the risk of physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms for which those drug classes are known. <b>Buspirone</b> is not considered to be a drug-of-abuse, is safer in overdose than traditional anxiolytics, and is significantly less impairing at therapeutic doses.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> {{was first}} synthesized, {{by a team}} at Mead Johnson, in 1968, but was not {{patented}} until 1975. It was initially developed as an antipsychotic drug acting on the D2 receptor, but {{was found to be}} ineffective in the treatment of psychosis and was repurposed as an anxiolytic. In 1986, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained FDA approval for <b>buspirone</b> in the treatment of GAD. The patent placed on <b>buspirone</b> expired in 2001 and it is now available as a generic drug.|$|E
25|$|Several {{clinical}} trials, most randomized double-blind trials (and in one <b>buspirone</b> {{was used}} as an adjunct to atomoxetine) and one open-label, have been conducted to evaluate the utility of <b>buspirone</b> in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with mostly positive results.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> is {{primarily}} sold under {{the brand name}} Buspar.|$|E
25|$|Unlike benzodiazepines, <b>buspirone</b> {{does not}} {{interact}} with the GABAA receptor complex.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> {{augmentation}} was {{not found}} to increase the discontinuation success rate.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to binding to serotonin receptors, <b>buspirone</b> is an antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor with weak affinity. It preferentially blocks inhibitory presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, and antagonizes postsynaptic D2 receptors only at higher doses. In accordance, <b>buspirone</b> {{has been found}} to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway at low doses, whereas at higher doses, postsynaptic D2 receptors are blocked and antidopaminergic effects such as hypoactivity and reduced stereotypy, though notably not catalepsy, are observed in animals. <b>Buspirone</b> has also been found to bind with much higher affinity to the dopamine D3 and D4 receptors, where it is similarly an antagonist.|$|E
25|$|Grapefruit: Significantly {{increases}} the plasma levels of <b>buspirone.</b> See grapefruit–drug interactions.|$|E
25|$|Structural analogues of <b>buspirone</b> {{include other}} azapirones like gepirone, ipsapirone, perospirone, and tandospirone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> is not {{effective}} {{as a treatment for}} benzodiazepine withdrawal, barbiturate withdrawal, or alcohol withdrawal/delirium tremens.|$|E
25|$|Elevated blood {{pressure}} {{has been reported}} when <b>buspirone</b> has been administered to patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> is {{a member}} of the azapirone {{chemical}} class, and consists of azaspirodecanedione and pyrimidinylpiperazine components linked together by a butyl chain.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that <b>buspirone</b> on its own may be useful in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> has no {{immediate}} anxiolytic effects, and hence has a delayed onset of action; its full clinical effectiveness may require 2 to 4 weeks to manifest. The drug {{has been shown}} to be similarly effective in the treatment of GAD to benzodiazepines including diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, and clorazepate. <b>Buspirone</b> is not known to be effective in the treatment of other anxiety disorders besides GAD, although there is some limited evidence that it may be useful in the treatment of social phobia as an adjunct to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Buspirone</b> may {{be useful}} in the {{management}} of irritability, agitation, and aggression in older patients with dementia and in pediatrics, although further research is necessary to more clearly establish its effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Its use {{should also}} be avoided in those {{receiving}} other serotonergic drugs such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, methamphetamine, MDMA, triptans, <b>buspirone,</b> serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and other SSRIs due to the potential for serotonin syndrome to develop as a result.|$|E
25|$|Alkylation of 1-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazine (1) with 3-chloro-1-cyanopropane (2, 4-chlorobutyronitrile) gives 3, {{which is}} reduced either by {{hydrogenation}} over Raney nickel catalyst, or with LAH. The resulting 1° amine (4) {{from the previous}} step is then reacted with 3,3-tetramethyleneglutaric anhydride (5, 8-Oxaspirodecane-7,9-dione) in order to yield <b>buspirone</b> (6).|$|E
25|$|Because of dysthymia's chronic nature, {{treatment}} {{resistance is}} somewhat common. In such a case, augmentation is often recommended. Such treatment augmentations can include lithium pharmacology, thyroid hormone augmentation, amisulpride, <b>buspirone,</b> bupropion, stimulants, and mirtazapine. Additionally, {{if the person}} also suffers from seasonal affective disorder, light therapy {{can be useful in}} helping augment therapeutic effects.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{approved}} for this indication, studies such as STAR*D have shown <b>buspirone</b> {{to be an}} effective augmentation agent alongside treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for clinical depression and is also used to counter the sexual dysfunction (anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction) associated with SSRIs. The drug has also been found to be effective in the treatment of depression as a standalone drug.|$|E
25|$|Cabergoline, an agonist of {{dopamine}} D₂ receptors which inhibits prolactin production, {{was found}} in a small study to fully restore orgasm in one third of anorgasmic subjects, and partially restore orgasm in another third. Limited data has shown that the drug amantadine may help to relieve SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Cyproheptadine, <b>buspirone,</b> stimulants such as amphetamines (including the antidepressant bupropion), nefazodone and yohimbine have been used to treat SSRI-induced anorgasmia. Reducing the SSRI dosage may also resolve anorgasmia problems.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{interaction}} Impact on {{effects of}} alcohol and other drugs: According to several studies in animals, oxytocin inhibits the development of tolerance to various addictive drugs (opiates, cocaine, alcohol), and reduces withdrawal symptoms. MDMA (ecstasy) may increase feelings of love, empathy, and connection to others by stimulating oxytocin activity primarily via activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, if initial studies in animals apply to humans. The anxiolytic Buspar (<b>buspirone)</b> may produce some of its effects via 5-HT1A receptor-induced oxytocin stimulation as well.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine is {{prescribed}} {{when the}} onset of an organic disease state manifests through anxiety, as generalized anxiety disorder, or in other more serious cases as psychoneurosis, and is therefore prescribed {{as a means of}} regulating normal function. Hydroxyzine has shown to be as effective as the benzodiazepine drug bromazepam in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. However, a systematic review concluded that compared with other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and <b>buspirone),</b> hydroxyzine was equivalent in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability, however there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment for generalised anxiety disorder due to the high risk of bias in the reviewed studies.|$|E
25|$|Overdoses, drug interactions, and {{dangerous}} reactions from psychiatric medications, especially antipsychotics, are considered psychiatric emergencies. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially lethal complication of {{first or second}} generation antipsychotics. If untreated, neuroleptic malignant syndrome can result in fever, muscle rigidity, confusion, unstable vital signs, or even death. Serotonin syndrome can result when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors mix with <b>buspirone.</b> Severe symptoms of serotonin syndrome include hyperthermia, delirium, and tachycardia {{that may lead to}} shock. Often patients with severe general medical symptoms, such as unstable vital signs, will be transferred to a general medical emergency room or medicine service for increased monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Trazodone is {{generally}} described as {{acting as a}} potent serotonin 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), and a weak antihistamine or histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. Its 5-HT2A receptor antagonism and weak serotonin reuptake inhibition {{form the basis of}} its common label as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI). Trazodone, both itself and via its major active metabolite meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), also binds to a variety of other receptors. It is an antagonist at most or all of the receptors it binds to except the 5-HT1A receptor, where it acts as a partial agonist similarly to <b>buspirone</b> and tandospirone but with comparatively greater intrinsic activity. Conversely, mCPP is a non-selective agonist of most of the serotonin receptors it binds to. A range of weak affinities (Ki) have been reported for trazodone at the human histamine H1 receptor including 220nM, 350nM, 500nM, and 1,100nM.|$|E

2500|$|A major {{metabolite}} of <b>buspirone,</b> 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP), {{occurs at}} higher circulating levels than <b>buspirone</b> itself, {{and is known}} {{to act as a}} potent α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist. It may be responsible for the increased noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity observed with <b>buspirone</b> in animals. In addition, 1-PP may {{play an important role in}} the antidepressant effects of <b>buspirone.</b> <b>Buspirone</b> also has very weak and probably clinically unimportant affinity for the α1-adrenergic receptor. Notably, <b>buspirone</b> has been reported to have shown [...] "significant and selective intrinsic efficacy" [...] at the α1-adrenergic receptor expressed in a [...] "tissue- and species-dependent".|$|E
