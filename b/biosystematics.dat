The holotype and paratype specimens, numbered CAS 330 and CAS 205 respectively, are currently preserved in the <b>Biosystematics</b> Research Institute in Ottawa, Canada. Its body is similar to S. freyi, but it has a narrower head than S. canadensis (the head of S. freyi is [...] wide). The mesosoma is more robust and the third funicular segment is extremely short {{and as long as the}} second segment, while it is twice as long in S. freyi.

500|$|Taxon is the {{bi-monthly}} {{journal of}} the IAPT. The journal, which was initiated in 1951, publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in the broadest sense. Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification. Taxon also contains matters related to botanical nomenclature, and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names and proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). Publication of such matters in Taxon satisfies the required submission to the General Committee. The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant <b>Biosystematics,</b> reviews and notices of books and other publications, and news {{in the world of}} plant systematics. [...] Although the journal is [...] "devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany", {{it has been in the}} past criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics.|$|E

He published work on the distribution and classification of Moroccan flora, in particular, halfah grass (Stipa tenacissima). His Moroccan work also included studies on the altitudinal zonation of the mountain regions there and the phytogeography of the desert climate, in particular the argan tree (Argania spinosa). Other work included studies of association in equatorial forests, which led to a biogeographical classification of climate, in which he drew comparisons between Australia and homologous zones of the Mediterranean. In <b>biosystematics</b> he developed a classification scheme for vascular plants.|$|E
