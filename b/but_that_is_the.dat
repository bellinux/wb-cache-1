Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele ("Ellie") (1889–1944), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942) and Ottilie ("Ottla") (1892–1943).

[...] In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect, Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities.

I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand it takes away from the horror. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> horror {{in the sense that it}} is so vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies?

500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

Bart said of the album, [...] "We recorded a demo which was released as an EP on cassette last year. The reaction was very positive.

Realistically, government officials can't know either—and this is Hillary Clinton's problem.

2500|$|Deleuze's unusual metaphysics entails {{an equally}} {{atypical}} epistemology, {{or what he}} calls a transformation of [...] "the image of thought". According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as Aristotle, René Descartes, and Edmund Husserl, misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover—it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt—but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, neutral point of view, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes what we think; it alters what we think is possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, we attain a [...] "thought without image", a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. [...] "All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It's just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational—not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edwards {{argued that}} the {{adolescents}} of Mansfield Park are in many ways still children, and the danger of Lover's Vows is that the amateur actors cannot distinguish between acting and life, a point grasped by Mary who says [...] "What gentleman among you am I to have the pleasure of making love to?". In this regard, {{the danger of the}} Crawfords is that they are always acting, and for them, Lover's Vows is a way to win Edmund and Maria, as both the Betrams come to understand. Edwards argues that Mansfield Park is considered difficult today because [...] "There is little charm to these children, whose dominant emotion seems to be malice...only Fanny has full consciousness in the better sense, sympathetic understanding of what others feel." [...] For example, when Edmund agrees to act in Lover's Vows, Tom and Maria only feel [...] "glee" [...] at the thought of the would be clergyman acting in an improper play, Maria enjoys seeing the discomfort on Julia's face when she acts with Henry, and Mary tells Fanny to marry Henry to [...] "pay off the debts of one's sex" [...] and to have a [...] "triumph" [...] at the expense of her brother. Through Price is the most likeable character in the novel, even she has been made flawed by Austen as her morality is [...] "limited". Edwards called Price the [...] "most human" [...] of all the Austen heroines as she sometimes has negative emotions as when she tells Edmund that Mary wanted to marry him because she knew Tom was dying, and feels [...] "gaiety" [...] at his pain. Likewise, Edwards argued that Edmund was the [...] "most believable" [...] of Austen's heroes precisely he has [...] "limitations", and there is [...] "much here to respect" [...] about Edmund, a prodding, if honest and good hearted man. Edwards noted that even when Edmund saw Mary for the last time, it is implied he was still sad to [...] "close the door" [...] on her forever. Edwards argued that both Edmund and Fanny are flawed characters who are perfect for each other for that very reason. Edwards concluded [...] "Fanny and Edmund learn less, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> point; for once we are to consider people, who like most people, have no superabundance of wit and charm and wisdom are to get along in the world. They get along, quite simply, by avoiding what they cannot understand." ...|$|E
