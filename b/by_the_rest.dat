5|$|On 22 August {{a patrol}} from the 13th Parachute Battalion succeeded in {{crossing}} the eastern {{branch of the}} river, and was quickly reinforced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the battalion. They fought for three hours to gain a proper foothold and were then forced to withdraw again. The next day, patrols from the 7th Parachute Battalion discovered that the Germans had withdrawn during the night, and they therefore crossed the river and secured the high ground to the north, closely followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the brigade. On 25August the 1st Special Service Brigade took over as the lead formation, and headed towards Beuzeville, but once again German defences held up the advance. The 3rd Parachute Brigade and the 4th Special Service Brigade carried out a left flanking attack to capture the village, suffering heavy losses from German mortar fire.|$|E
5|$|Philoctetes retells {{the story}} of Philoctetes, an archer who had been {{abandoned}} on Lemnos <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Greek fleet while {{on the way to}} Troy.

It is only Heracles' deus ex machina appearance that persuades Philoctetes to go to Troy.|$|E
40|$|Resting {{cells of}} Pseudomonas oleovorans PO- 1 R {{that had been}} grown on octane {{oxidized}} 1 -alkenes containing 6 to 12 carbon atoms and 1, 7 -octadiene to their corresponding 1, 2 -epoxides. The microorganism was capable of growing on 1 -octene but not on 1, 7 -octadiene as a sole carbon source. The optimal temperature, pH, and 1 -octene concentration for 1, 2 -epoxyoctane production <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> cells were 34 to 40 C, pH 7 to 8, and 1. 5 mg of 1 -octene per ml, respectively. Epoxide concentration reached a maximum after 150 min of incubation and subsequently declined. In the absence of 1 -octene, the epoxide was metabolized readily <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> cells. <b>The</b> amount of 1, 2 -epoxyoctane produced was dependent on the initial cell concentration. With larger cell populations, the amount of epoxide present after 60 min of incubation was less than the amount observed at lower population densities after the same time period. This relationship was attributed to the rapid depletion of 1 -octene at high biomass concentrations and the resultant early initiation of epoxide degradation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> cells...|$|R

5|$|Although {{there was}} some fear of Rome and concern with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all agreed to join the alliance against Macedon.

5|$|Both rivals {{together}} with their adherents defended the legality of their elections. In October 1159 cardinals of both obediences produced the manifests to the Emperor Frederick in favour of their elects.

Supporters of Victor IV, admitting {{that they were in}} minority, justified their action {{by the fact that the}} opposite faction broke the rule of unanimity and – in consequence – the election of Rolando was invalid. The opposite party claimed that the principle of unanimity had been breached by the obstructive conduct of merely three cardinals of the Imperial faction, who stubbornly refused to recognize the candidate desired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Sacred College.|$|E

5|$|Hiyō spent November in Truk, {{during which}} time she was twice {{slightly}} damaged by American air raids, before returning to Japan in early December where she was rejoined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of her air group. Aside from a brief refit at Kure from 26 February to 4 March 1943, the ship was training in the Inland Sea until she sailed for Truk on 22 March. Her air group consisted of 27 Zeros and 12 D3As at this time. They were detached from Hiyō in early April to participate in Operation I-Go, a land-based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The carrier was again lightly damaged from bomb splinters on 12 April from an American air attack. After her air group returned, the ship arrived back in Japan on 21 May in case she was needed to relieve Japanese forces fighting on the Attu Island.|$|E
5|$|I {{found they}} begin the festivities of Christmas by a curious procession: {{a party of}} young people procure {{the head of a}} dead horse, which is affixed to a pole about four feet in length; a string is affixed to the lower jaw; a horse-cloth is also {{attached}} to the whole, under which one of the parts gets, and by frequently pulling the string, keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accompanied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the party, grotesquely habited, with hand-bells; they thus proceed from house to house, ringing their bells, and singing carols and songs; they are commonly gratified with beer and cake, or perhaps with money.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, {{composed}} of 16 dreadnoughts, 6 pre-dreadnoughts, 6 light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

Kurt is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with another boy in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's suggestion that he come out then and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on the dance floor.

In the opening exchange of fire, Success was badly damaged but Perrée was mortally wounded. The delay caused by the engagement allowed {{the main body of}} the British squadron to catch up the French ship and, badly outnumbered, Généreux surrendered. Perrée died shortly after receiving his wound, and none of the supplies reached Malta, which held out for another seven months against increasing odds before surrendering on 4 September 1800.|$|E

The municipality and banks would pay for the club's debt of NOK5.4 million, and take over the stadium's operating costs of roughly NOK1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay rent on the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994, and included a clause granting Ham-Kam the right to buy back the stadium at a later date. The municipality issued a loan of NOK4 million to Ham-Kam in 2003 to allow them to install floodlighting at Briskeby.|$|E
