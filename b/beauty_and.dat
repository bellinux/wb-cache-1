5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> the Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> the Beast composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E

5|$|Decades later, {{during the}} {{production}} of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> the Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London, England to work on Roger Rabbit. Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit, was approached to direct but declined in favor of continuing work on his long-gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler. In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> the Beast set in 19th century France. At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production move for an animated film, which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form. Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film.|$|E
