5|$|In July 2011, Rowling parted {{company with}} her agent, Christopher Little, {{moving to a}} new agency founded {{by one of his}} staff, Neil Blair. On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, {{announced}} on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her new book would <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012. Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre, the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Charlie Rose and the Lennoxlove Book Festival. In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers free rein to {{speculate}} on conditions at its surface; {{all the more so}} when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different,</b> and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E
5|$|The Act of February 16 {{proclaimed the}} {{re-establishment}} (atstatyti) of the Lithuanian state, {{making it the}} successor to the Lithuanian historical state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In this respect the Council deviated from the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment (sudaryti) of a Lithuanian state. However, it was {{made clear that the}} new state would <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from the old Duchy: it was to be organized only in ethnic Lithuanian lands (except for the Vilnius region which was majority Polish) and was to be governed by democratic principles, as opposed to the multi-ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy. The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany, Russia, and Poland, all of which had their own plans for the country. Even though not addressed directly, the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former Polish-Lithuanian union.|$|E

Furthermore, while consumption activity of tourists from <b>different</b> homelands <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> {{depending on their}} destinations (Tsukui and Kagatsume 2016), there are no statistical data in Japan which surveyed consumption activity of tourists both by different homelands and by tourists destination simultaneously.|$|R

25|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} in complex analysis, a Riemann surface, first studied by and named after Bernhard Riemann, is a one-dimensional complex manifold. Riemann surfaces {{can be thought}} of as deformed versions of the complex plane: locally near every point they look like patches of the complex plane, but the global topology can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different.</b> For example, they can look like a sphere or a torus or several sheets glued together.|$|E

Animal and {{vegetation}} associations from each type combine to create considerable diversity of habitat which is typical of either spruce or aspen stands. The mixture of the transition soils provides an attractive environment with either pure spruce or pure aspen woodlands. An example of a bird which prefers a mixed wood habitat is the yellow-rumped warbler.|$|E

25|$|The {{translation}} of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, {{especially given the}} damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, {{our knowledge of the}} underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> than one done in AD 1900. The result of all this is that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.|$|E

Although there are many excellent minds in the sector their primary job function is rarely to develop software. As a result, the driving forces behind these individuals may <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from those in for-profit organisations. Even where individuals are employed as software developers, in administration and support teams for example, the sector usually sees itself as being unique and therefore with little to share.|$|E
25|$|In most imaging devices, {{the degree}} of {{exposure}} to light applied to the active element (be it film or CCD) can be altered {{in one of two}} ways: by either increasing/decreasing the size of the aperture or by increasing/decreasing the time of each exposure. Exposure variation in an HDR set is only done by altering the exposure time and not the aperture size; this is because altering the aperture size also affects the depth of field and so the resultant multiple images would <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different,</b> preventing their final combination into a single HDR image.|$|E

25|$|Studying colours and spectra {{provides}} {{insight into}} the objects' origin and a potential correlation with other classes of objects, namely centaurs and some satellites of giant planets (Triton, Phoebe), suspected to originate in the Kuiper belt. However, the interpretations are typically ambiguous as the spectra can fit more than one model of the surface composition and depend on the unknown particle size. More significantly, the optical surfaces of small bodies are subject to modification by intense radiation, solar wind and micrometeorites. Consequently, the thin optical surface layer could <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from the regolith underneath, and not representative of the bulk composition of the body.|$|E
25|$|Conservation efforts need to {{be based}} on {{protecting}} species over their entire host range and habitat, not just at particular sites or with particular species. Studies have shown that even in many different soil types and locations EcM fungal richness is relatively conserved, but that the community makeup of sites can still <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different.</b> Trees are often dominated by a few fungal strains, but these fungi are not the same on all trees in nearby areas, and show considerable spatial variation. This leads to the conclusion that conservation efforts should be aimed even at atypical sites, such as abiotically stressful locales, in order to conserve the full gamut of EcM fungal partners and plant host species.|$|E
25|$|Lyme Disease {{was first}} {{described}} in Europe in 1883, the 1970s in North America and 1982 in Australia. It is an illness {{caused by a}} spiral bacterium called a spirochaete. The most common name for this spirochaete is Borrelia burgdorferi, but many different Borrelia species cause Lyme Disease worldwide. An Australian spirochaete has not been found in humans yet, and may <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from Borrelia burgdorferi. Despite clinical case reports, it is still controversial as to whether Lyme disease can be contracted in Australia. Some doctors and health authorities believe it does, while others are adamant that it does not. Until the controversy is resolved patients with suspected Lyme-like Disease should be treated with an appropriate course of antibiotics because early treatment of Lyme Disease invariably results in a complete cure.|$|E

25|$|For {{calculating the}} power of a reactor (in which the {{reaction}} rate is determined by the D-D step), we count the - fusion energy per D-D reaction as Efus = (4.03MeV + 17.6MeV)×50% + (3.27MeV)×50% = 12.5MeV and the energy in charged particles as Ech = (4.03MeV + 3.5MeV)×50% + (0.82MeV)×50% = 4.2MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from 3.5 MeV, (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium can be anything from 2/25 to 2/25. For ET=1.01MeV this gives a range from 1.44MeV to 6.73MeV. so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0MeV (a specific energy of about 225 million MJ per kilogram of deuterium).|$|E
25|$|The protein or {{membrane}} environment {{could respond}} to an external field {{in a number of}} different ways. Field induced dipoles, reorientation of permanent dipoles, protonation and deprotonation of protein residues, larger scale reorganization of ionized side-chains and water molecules, both within the interior and on the surface of the protein, are all examples of how complicated the assignment of permittivity is. In MD simulations, where all the charges, dipoles, and field induced atomic dipoles are treated explicitly then it is suggested that a dielectric value of 1 is appropriate. However, in reduced-particle ion simulation programs, such as ours, where the protein, membrane, and water are continuum backgrounds and treated implicitly, and on top of that, the ion motion takes place on the same time-scale as the protein’s response to its presence, it is very difficult to assign the dielectric coefficients. In fact, changing the dielectric coefficients could easily alter the channel characteristics, such as ion permeation and selectivity The assignment of dielectric coefficient for water is another key issue. The water molecules inside ion channels could be very ordered due to tapered size of the pore, which is often lined with highly charged residues, or hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and protein. As a result, the dielectric constant of water inside an ion channel could <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from the value under bulk conditions. To make the matter even more complicated, the dielectric coefficients of water inside nanopores is not necessarily an isotropic scalar value, but an anisotropic tensor having different values in different directions.|$|E
500|$|Schlumbergera {{is a small}} genus of cacti {{with six}} species found in the coastal {{mountains}} of south-eastern Brazil.

Most species of Schlumbergera have stems which resemble leaf-like pads joined {{one to the other}} and flowers which appear from areoles at the joints and tips of the stems. Two species have cylindrical stems more similar to other cacti. In Brazil, the genus is referred to as [...] (May flower), reflecting the period in which they flower in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
