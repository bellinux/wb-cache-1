5000|$|The latest {{advancement}} in bullet shape was the <b>boat</b> <b>tail,</b> a streamlined base for spitzer bullets. The vacuum created as air moving {{at high speed}} passes over {{the end of a}} bullet slows the projectile. The streamlined <b>boat</b> <b>tail</b> design reduces this form drag by allowing the air to flow along the surface of the tapering end. The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as the optimum shape for rifle technology.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the results of}} a numerical and experimental investigation aimed at assessing the performance of a control method to delay boundary layer separation consisting in the introduction in the surface of contoured transverse grooves, i. e. of small cavities with an appropriate shape orientated transverse to the incoming flow. The shape of the grooves and their depth - which must be significantly smaller than the thickness of the incoming boundary layer - Are chosen so that the flow recirculations present within the grooves are steady and stable. This passive control strategy is applied to an axisymmetric bluff body with various rear <b>boat</b> <b>tails,</b> which are characterized by different degrees of flow separation. Variational multiscale large eddy simulations and wind tunnel tests are carried out. The Reynolds number, for both experiments and simulations, is Re = uâ 8 ̆ 89 ̆eD/Î½ = 9. 6 Ã 9 ̆ 7 104; due to the different incoming flow turbulence level, the boundary layer conditions before the <b>boat</b> <b>tails</b> are fully developed turbulent in the experiments and transitional in the simulations. In all cases, the introduction of one single axisymmetric groove in the lateral surface of the <b>boat</b> <b>tails</b> produces significant delay of the boundary layer separation, with consequent reduction of the pressure drag. Nonetheless, the wake dynamical structure remains qualitatively similar to the one typical of a blunt-based axisymmetric body, with quantitative variations that are consistent with the reduction in wake width caused by <b>boat</b> <b>tailing</b> and by the grooves. A few supplementary simulations show that the effect of the grooves is also robust to the variation of the geometrical parameters defining their shape. All the obtained data support the interpretation that the relaxation of the no-slip boundary condition for the flow surrounding the recirculation regions, with an appreciable velocity along their borders, is the physical mechanism responsible for the effectiveness of the present separation control method...|$|R

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) analysis has been performed {{to study the}} plume effects on sonic boom signature for isolated nozzle configurations. The objectives of these analyses were to provide comparison to past work using modern CFD analysis tools, to investigate the differences of high aspect ratio nozzles to circular (axisymmetric) nozzles, and to report the effects of under expanded nozzle operation on boom signature. CFD {{analysis was used to}} address the plume effects on sonic boom signature from a baseline exhaust nozzle. Nearfield pressure signatures were collected for nozzle pressure ratios (NPRs) between 6 and 10. A computer code was used to extrapolate these signatures to a ground-observed sonic boom N-wave. Trends show that there is a reduction in sonic boom N-wave signature as NPR is increased from 6 to 10. As low boom designs are developed and improved, there will be a need for understanding the interaction between the aircraft <b>boat</b> <b>tail</b> shocks and the exhaust nozzle plume. These CFD analyses will provide a baseline study for future analysis efforts. For further study, a design of experiments has been conducted to develop a hybrid method where both CFD and small scale wind tunnel testing will validate the observed trends.

5000|$|After more {{detailed}} testing results became available, starting in 1944 the cartridge was tweaked {{in order to}} improve its accuracy and penetration. Initially, the <b>boat</b> <b>tail</b> had been omitted because the Soviet designers had assumed (incorrectly) that it would only make a difference at long ranges, when the bullet became subsonic, and the accuracy of the intermediate cartridge at these ranges was considered inconsequential. However, further testing showed that the <b>boat</b> <b>tail</b> improved accuracy even at shorter ranges, where the bullet was still supersonic. In order to maintain the overall mass of the bullet, after adding the <b>boat</b> <b>tail,</b> the ogival head section of the bullet was lengthened as well, making the bullet more streamlined overall. The maximum radius was now attained at some 15.95 mm from the tip and the overall length of the bullet increased to 26.8 mm. In order to preserve the total length of the cartridge, the case sleeve was shortened to 38.7 mm (and by rounding it is customarily referred to as 7.62×39.) Additionally, the new bullet had a core made of low-carbon steel wrapped in lead. The use of low-carbon (mild) steel was guided mostly by the desire to reuse some industrial equipment that was manufacturing the 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge rather than by bullet fragmentation considerations. This bullet was given the acronym [...] "7.62 PS" [...] (76.2 ПС). The [...] "S" [...] initially stood for [...] "surrogate" [...] ( [...] , [...] ), but later the letter was taken to refer to the steel component ( [...] , [...] ) of the core, which accounted for about 50% of the core volume. The 7.62×39 cartridge equipped with the PS bullet finally overcame all objections of the GAU in mid-1947, when it was ordered into series production, and given the index 57-N-231S.|$|R
