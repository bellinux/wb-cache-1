40|$|This article {{investigates the}} level of {{delegation}} in franchise chains, distinguishing the two most relevant franchising models: <b>Business</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Franchising</b> and Learning Network Franchising. The two models basically differ on {{the level of}} real authority (effective control over decisions) exercised by the franchisors. Differences in business features, such as the required standardization, monitoring costs and consumer sensitivity to variations in product attributes (consumer measurement costs), explain the adoption of the different models of franchising. These variables affect the trade-off between the risk of brand name loss and the gains in knowledge sharing and learning within the network. The higher the need for standardization, the higher is the risk of brand name loss, and, consequently, the more likely the franchisor will adopt an organizational design that confers more control over franchisees’ decisions, such as <b>business</b> <b>format</b> <b>franchising.</b> This paper presents two case studies with Brazilian food franchise chains that illustrate the main argument and suggest additional propositions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature and}} scope of the cultural and legal barriers faced by American franchisers when they seek international expansion. A framework, where international franchising opportunities are classified in terms of the cultural distance and the extent of legal barriers, is proposed. Appropriate strategies for U. S. franchisers under varying conditions of cultural and legal challenges are identified. IN'TRODUCTION In a franchising arrangement, a supplier (the franchisor) grants a dealer (the franchisee) the right to market its products in exchange for some type of consideration, such as a financial commitment and an agreement to conduct business in accordance with the standards specified by the franchisor (Pride and Ferrell 2000). Franchise arrangements enable the franchiser to gain fast and selective product distribution, and enable the franchisee to start a business with limited resources and gain from the experience and brand recognition of the franchisor. Two forms of franchising are generally identified: product/tradename franchising and <b>business</b> <b>format</b> <b>franchising</b> (Arthur Andersen 1992). Product/tradename franchising involves the use of franchisees to distribute a product under a franchisor's trademark and is used in the retailing of automobiles, gasoline, and soft drinks.

Drawing insights from case studies that indicate both the development and the maintenance of company-wide brand names and unit-specific sales activities are crucial to a franchise company, we construct a multitask model to account for such contract mixing in franchising. Intuitively, low-powered contracts are offered to some managers to induce effort for brand-name development and maintenance, while high-powered contracts are offered to the remaining managers to elicit sales activity and capture the beneficial effect of the company brand name. Franchising can thus be viewed as an organizational agreement for production involving brand-name products and services. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a tension}} in <b>business</b> <b>format</b> <b>franchising</b> between, {{on the one}} hand, {{standardisation}} and uniformity and, on the other hand, geographical variations in market conditions and resource availability. Previous research has demonstrated {{in the case of}} independent small firms that local geographical conditions influence business strategy. This paper examines whether variations in the local geographical environment, notably in terms of demand and supply side conditions, affect format implementation and whether franchisors permit franchisees to make local adaptations of the format in response to local environmental conditions. The study is based on interviews with 40 UK-based franchisors, all of whom were at the later stages of roll-out or in the consolidation stage of network development. Local variations in the business environment do create a conflict with the need to maintain the uniformity of the franchise format. Adaptation was restricted to peripheral format components. No changes were made to the core format components. Most franchisors recognise that their franchisees are an important source of innovation. However, implementation of franchisee ideas across the system is found in only a minority of cases. These findings link to the franchisee control–autonomy debate, confirming other studies which suggest that franchisees enjoy considerable operational autonomy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Both {{small and}} large {{businesses}} are of critical importance {{to the performance of}} the economy. It is useful however to draw a distinction between entrepreneurial ventures and individual and corporate entrepreneurship since they serve different economic functions and their potentials for innovation and growth are different. In this paper, drawing upon entrepreneurial strategy formation perspective, entrepreneurial marketing, and value innovation logic for high growth, a model of a transitional entrepreneurial mode for the behaviour and the strategic approach of the entrepreneurial venture is introduced. It is proposed that a shift into the entrepreneurial mode is instrumental in planning and initiating new ventures, and, in achieving a forward leap in the growth trend at any point in the life of ongoing ventures. The study of the franchised business, the business format franchisor and their partnership as examples of individual, corporate and collective entrepreneurship contributes to the domain of entrepreneurship research. The growing appreciation of franchising as an entrepreneurial endeavour presents us with a multiple disciplinary perspective is attracting the attention of marketing, management, entrepreneurship and small business researchers.

40|$|As {{franchising}} {{has increased}} its visibility and impact on the business landscape, it has at-tracted {{the attention of a}} wide variety of researchers from different academic backgrounds. We draw together much of this research by juxtaposing the two key theories used to explain franchising, resource scarcity and agency theory, with the empirical findings regarding three key franchising constructs—franchise initiation, subsequent propensity to franchise, and fran-chise performance. We suggest that research emphasis needs to shift toward understanding why firms initiate franchising and how franchising impacts different types of organizational performance. We also find that extant research can benefit from additional theoretical diver-sity and thus we offer new propositions grounded in three theories not yet widely applied to franchising. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This article examines the use of strategic actions to attract partners and increase system size in the context of franchising. We build on research in entrepreneurship, marketing, organization theory, strategic management, and finance to develop specific hypotheses about the influences of franchisor pricing policy and strategic control decisions on system size. We test these hypotheses empirically, using panel data on a sample of 1, 292 <b>business</b> <b>format</b> <b>franchise</b> systems from 152 industries that were established in the United States between 1979 and 1996 and followed from their inception forward in time. Our model accounts for the endogeneity of strategic decisions, controls for unobserved firm and industry factors, and accounts for selection effects due to system failure. The results show that franchisors that grow larger (1) lower royalty rates as the systems age, (2) have low up-front franchise fees that rise over time, (3) own a small proportion of outlets and lower that percentage over time, (4) keep franchisees' initial investment low, and (5) finance their franchisees. firm size, franchising, pricing, ownership, econometric model...|$|R
40|$|Franchising, {{especially}} <b>business</b> <b>format</b> <b>franchising</b> {{also known}} as the McDonalds approach has been seen by practitioners and also by some academics simply as a straightforward approach for the creation (and replication) of one’s own business – i. e. as one of the ways for entrepreneurship (and growth). Several trade associations were created for the promotion of this kind of business using a combination of “recipes for success ” and entrepreneurial “bias for action”. The prevailing explanations for the franchising phenomena, especially the initiative of franchising, the propensity to franchise, and franchise performance, are mostly based on two orders of reasons or a combination of them: franchising as a means to deal with resource scarcity and / or mechanism for franchisor and franchisee to align incentives between both. However, empirical studies have shown limited support for such claims, especially in face of the so called plural form. The mixed nature of the plural form, where proprietary units coexist with franchised units, seems to contradict predictions of a clear deterministic path in one or the other direction.

40|$|Abstract__ <b>Business</b> <b>format</b> <b>franchising</b> {{is a form}} of interorganizational {{cooperation}} that originates {{from the}} business sector. It is increasingly used in a variety of healthcare services to reach positive results. In a franchise system contractual arrangements are made between two firms: the franchisor and the franchisee. In exchange for a payment, the franchisor offers a business format that consists of a brand name, support systems, and a specification of the healthcare services that must be delivered in local units. Franchisees provide healthcare services in local units using the business format, the own local market knowledge, and the own resources (Blair & Lafontaine, 2005; Falbe & Welsh, 1998; Komoto, 2005). Thus, franchising combines central management of a business format and local entrepreneurship (Cox & Mason, 2007; Sorenson & Sørensen, 2001). Some franchise systems also include units owned by the franchisor. These units are operated by managers that are employed by the franchisor and that use the same business format as the franchisees. So, a franchise system consists of a franchisor, the franchisees, the business format, the franchise contract and, in some systems, unit managers with the company-owned units they operate (Croonen, 2005). In this thesis the concept ‘unit actors’ is used to commonly refer to franchisees and unit managers (including their units), while the terms ‘franchisees’, ‘unit managers’ and ‘professionals’ are used to refer to actor groups separately. Franchising is stated to be a promising model for the healthcare sector...|$|E
40|$|Franchising is an {{increasingly}} popular business expansion strategy. In its contemporary <b>business</b> <b>format</b> mode it {{is a method}} of business operation which has revolutionised the distribution {{of goods and services}} in virtually all industry sectors in most countries. The late development of franchising in Vietnam has been the result of the late development of the economic and legal system necessary to support it. The Doi Moi reforms in 1986 introduced a market economy which is a necessary prerequisite for the development of franchising - but the development of the franchise sector was constrained by the lack of a clear legal framework. Franchising was not recognised as a discrete business relationship and there were both legal and commercial challenges to its implementation. As part of its extensive law modernisation process preparatory to WTO accession in January 2007 Vietnam introduced a dedicated franchise law which provided the legal infrastructure for the orderly development of its franchise sector. The Franchise Law introduced in 2006 was the turning point in the development of franchising in Vietnam. It has been the Governments response to the demand for a definitive legal framework for franchising through the introduction of the Franchise Law which has led to the adoption of the franchising strategy by local and international entrepreneurs. This thesis investigates the role of the Franchise Law in the development of franchising in Vietnam. It reports the result of a qualitative multiple case study which suggests that although the Franchise Law is a necessary prerequisite for the healthy development of franchising in Vietnam it is not an exclusive factor. Social, cultural, commercial and economic factors, and legal enforcement issues, also {{play an important role in}} the adoption of franchising.

40|$|This {{treatise}} {{investigates the}} restaurant industry, entrepreneurship, franchising and restaurant franchising {{in order to}} develop a model that will enable a full service restaurant concept to be converted into a successful franchise system. Restaurants {{play a significant role in}} our lifestyle, and dining out is a favoured social activity. The industry plays an important role in the transfer of skills as many people start working in the restaurant industry before moving onto more formal careers. The restaurant industry offers many opportunities for entrepreneurial activity as a result of the relatively low barriers to entry. Entrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity regardless of the resources at hand and it requires a willingness to take calculated risks in order to build something of value from virtually nothing. The success of emerging economies such as China and India has proven that the only growth sectors in these economies are small and medium enterprises, which are driven by entrepreneurs. Franchising is considered to be a viable growth strategy for small business as it provides a means of raising capital and a method of expanding the business in a relatively low risk manner. There are many well established restaurant franchise brands that originated in South Africa, starting out as successful single outlets and then by means of the <b>business</b> <b>format</b> <b>franchise</b> model, developed into multi unit franchise systems. There are certain basic generic steps that must be followed when developing a franchise system.

Data were triangulated from a range of sources to develop an organisational perspective. Relevant extant literature is identified, providing a framework for analysis. The study reveals the processes to create and develop internal co-brands within the RFG brand portfolio. These incentives include the lower-order categories of measuring internal co-brand equity; brand attribute bi-lateral leveraging; and locating the co-brand concept (brand migration). This study is limited to a single case study. Future studies should broaden data collection to include further inclusions into the RFG brand portfolio and similar external co-brand structures. Through this case study, traditional franchise and branding theory is challenged, highlighting a new trajectory for researchers in these related areas. Retail co-branding is a difficult and costly strategy, with many risks. Franchisors need to be well resourced, and patient in order to trial and implement this approach. This case study provides an organisational (managerial) perspective of franchised retail co-branding, extending existing literature away from consumer focused product specific co-branding. The concepts of brand migration and brand attribute bi-lateral leveraging are introduced to explain co-brand strategy in a retail franchise environment.

At the forefront of this growth, is the fast food franchising industry, which {{is made up of}} a mix of global brands and a significant few, highly successful, locally founded, franchised operations based on Portuguese or American cultures. The fast food industry in South Africa also consists of a number of successful "non franchised" Indian fast food operations, founded by South Africans of Indian descent. None of these entrepreneurs have taken the next logical step and developed their businesses into national franchises. This study sought to uncover the factors inhibiting the franchising of Indian fast food stores in South Africa and to determine whether there was a market for Indian fast foods amongst a sample of consumers. The findings were that the independent entrepreneurs lacked the skills and knowledge to enter franchising as the franchisor. In addition, there was a general mistrust of the franchising system and doubts as to whether there was sufficient broad appeal of Indian fast foods. The results of the consumer survey however suggested that Indian fast foods were popular across a cross section of the population. Consequently, the report recommended that existing Indian fast food entrepreneurs develop strategies to exploit the market opportunities presented and suggested that it is the entrepreneur who franchises first, that will gain first more advantage through pre-empting real estate and shaping customer preferences and tastes...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} {{in the field of}} international retailing and in particular, the value and challenges associated with employing franchising as a vehicle for international retail expansion. Its focus is on The Boots Group (TBG) and specifically its loss-making subsidiary BRI (Boots Retail International). Despite its loss- making label, BRI is currently enjoying a significant upturn in fortune,on the back of very positive profitable growth figures, which have generated an increased enthusiasm for expanding the number of markets BRI is currently actively trading in. This has lead to the challenge of investigating whether BRI should develop a retail <b>business</b> <b>format</b> <b>franchise</b> for application as a relatively risk free method of market entry and if so what market offers the best option for testing this franchise system. The methodology for the research used to answering this challenge utilises, a literature review and contemporary practitioner interviews, to establish and refine a series of hypotheses for the factors critical to successful franchising. These factors are tested against the Boots retail model to provide an insight into the feasibility, benefits and risks of its use as the basis for a franchise system. Having established the potential value of developing a franchise system the study looks at the factors which characterise successful franchise markets and, using quantitative data, partially validates an internal belief that the Middle East markets, specifically the GCC present the best opportunity for testing the system. Further data is then gathered utilising inputs from potential franchisees to complete a full strategic market analysis and operating model for a Boots franchise system in the region. This study concludes that Boots should, through BRI, develop a retail franchise system and that this system should be tested in the GCC markets as a prelude to a full roll out in this market and its application as a model of market entry which compliments the existing implant strategy being used to great effect within BRI...|$|R

The social <b>business</b> <b>format</b> used by this study is based on the business model of Hamel (2002). This model (shown in Table  2) includes all aspects of social business elements in developing countries and has been used in previous research by Mair and Schoen (2007). So, the social <b>business</b> <b>format</b> is characterized by four components of the business model: core strategy, strategic resources, customer interface, and value network. Every component consists of sub-components and variables found in the academic literature and applicable to our study. In Bangladesh, there is a live debate on the concept of social <b>business</b> <b>formats.</b> To identify a social <b>business</b> <b>format,</b> Professor Yunus focuses on specific social, ethical or environmental goal and payback of initial investment but not returns, while Professor Sobhan emphasizes ownership of enterprises for poor people. On the other hand, BRAC likes to operate a hybrid model that includes conventional development, health and education programs with social enterprises and more commercial activities like banks. So, a common social <b>business</b> <b>format</b> is indeed for entrepreneurs to develop the water sectors in Bangladesh.|$|R
