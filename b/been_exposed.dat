5|$|In the 21st century, {{the remains}} of the site are {{protected}} under UK law as a scheduled monument. The site was surveyed in 1982 and excavations were carried out between 2002 and 2003, analysing surviving timber structures that had <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> by coastal erosion.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was again}} ordered into active duty {{to play a}} {{supporting}} role in the Gulf War in 1990. It officially switched to active service on 6 December 1990 at Brooklyn, New York. It participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm and earned two campaign streamers {{for participation in the}} conflict. On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought to have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to chemical agents released during the Khamisiyah Pit demolition. Much of the NATO invasion force in the country at the time is suspected to have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to these agents.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from stable}} lutetium, its {{radioactive}} isotopes have several specific uses. The suitable half-life and decay mode made lutetium-176 {{used as a}} pure beta emitter, using lutetium which has <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to neutron activation, and in lutetium–hafnium dating to date meteorites. The synthetic isotope lutetium-177 bound to octreotate (a somatostatin analogue), is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Indeed, lutetium-177 is seeing increasing use as a radionuclide, in neuroendrocine tumor therapy and bone pain palliation.|$|E
5|$|During Pointman I, {{commission}} researchers devised ways {{to determine}} small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels {{could only be}} found in the adipose (fat) tissue. The project studied dioxin (TCDD) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.|$|E
2500|$|With medical attention, {{radiation}} exposure is survivable to a 200 rems acute dose exposure. If {{a group of}} people <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to a 50 to 59 rems acute (within 24 hours) radiation dose, none will get radiation sickness. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to 60 to 180 rems, 50% will become sick with radiation poisoning. If medically treated, all of the 60–180 rems group will survive. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to 200 to 450 rems, most if not all of the group will become sick. 50% of the 200–450 rems group will die within two to four weeks, even with medical attention. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to 460 to 600 rems, 100% of the group will get radiation poisoning. 50% of the 460–600 rems group will die within one to three weeks. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to 600 to 1000 rems, 50% will die in one to three weeks. If the group <b>is</b> <b>exposed</b> to 1,000 to 5,000 rems, 100% of the group will die within 2 weeks.

5|$|No Gun Ri villagers {{said that}} in later decades, two mass graves holding some victims' remains were disturbed, and bones were removed during a {{reforestation}} project, and by farming activity. In 2007, excavations at several places near the bridge turned up little.

40|$|Iron-based {{amorphous}} alloys can be {{more resistant}} to corrosion than polycrystalline materials of similar compositions. However, when the amorphous alloys <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> to high temperatures they may recrystallize (or devitrify) thus losing their resistance to corrosion. Four different types of amorphous alloys melt spun ribbon specimens <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> to several temperatures for short periods of time. The resulting corrosion resistance was evaluated in seawater at 90 C and compared with the as-prepared ribbons. Results show that the amorphous alloys can <b>be</b> <b>exposed</b> to 600 C for 1 -hr. without losing the corrosion resistance; however, when the ribbons <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> at 800 C for 1 -hr. their localized corrosion resistance decreased significantly...|$|R

5|$|The site {{is at the}} top of a Carboniferous Limestone ridge on the {{northern}} edge of the Mendip Hills. It forms part of the Black Down Pericline where the limestone has <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> because of erosion of the overlying Triassic Dolomitic Conglomerate.

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} the US, Rihanna signed a {{contract}} with Def Jam Recordings, and released her debut album Music of the Sun (2005). The album was inspired by caribbean music, including soca, dancehall, and reggae, and incorporates dance-pop and R. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna said that when she had arrived in the US, she had <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to different types of music that she had never heard before, including rock music, which she incorporated into her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006).|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{higher levels of}} {{androgen}} exposure, the female hyenas are significantly more muscular and aggressive than their male counterparts; social-wise, they are of higher rank than the males, being dominant or dominant and alpha, and the females who have <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> {{to higher levels of}} androgen than average become higher-ranking than their female peers. Subordinate females lick the clitorises of higher-ranked females as a sign of submission and obedience, but females also lick each other's clitorises as a greeting or to strengthen social bonds; in contrast, while all males lick the clitorises of dominant females, the females will not lick the penises of males because males are considered to be of lowest rank.|$|E

5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|Film badges used {{to measure}} {{exposure}} to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 had <b>been</b> <b>exposed</b> to more than 0.1 roentgens, but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due {{to the formation of}} trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.|$|E
