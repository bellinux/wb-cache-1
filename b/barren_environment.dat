50|$|Increasing {{foraging}} opportunities can markedly reduce feather-plucking. This {{has many}} similarities with the redirected foraging behaviour hypothesis proposed for feather pecking in commercial poultry. Birds in captivity are usually given energy-dense, readily available food that is consumed rapidly, {{whereas in the}} wild {{they would have to}} spend many hours foraging to find this. It is considered that a combination of a <b>barren</b> <b>environment</b> and the 'excess' foraging time available is then spent redirecting foraging to feathers of other individuals. When 18 feather-plucking African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus) were provided with food in pipe feeders rather than bowls, their foraging time significantly increased by 73 minutes each day and their plumage improved noticeably within one month.|$|E
50|$|The mimic octopus of {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific are reputed to mimic up to 15 species of other local marine organisms. Mimicry of a local, abundant flounder was observed; nearly 500 episodes were analyzed. Both octopus species mimicked the shape, swimming actions, speed, duration, {{and sometimes the}} coloration of swimming flounders. During flounder mimicry, octopuses were actively moving and conspicuous, whereas immediately before and afterwards they were camouflaged and motionless (sitting or very slowly crawling). Furthermore, when motionless, the octopuses assumed body patterns and postures that resembled small sponges, tube-worm tubes, or colonial tunicates, which were among the few objects in the open sand habitat. The key finding was that octopuses used flounder mimicry only when their movement would give away camouflage in this open habitat. In all cases, octopuses used mimicry as a primary defense. The mimic's behaviour remained undiscovered for years because its dull homelands are poorly studied. But it is precisely in this <b>barren</b> <b>environment</b> that this behaviour is advantageous.|$|E

40|$|The {{physiological}} and behavioural responses of slaughter pigs reared {{in either a}} <b>barren</b> <b>environment</b> or in an enriched environment (larger pens with straw bedding) to preslaughter handling and mixing at transport were studied. Enriched-reared pigs had higher salivary cortisol concentrations in the home pen before and after transport than barren housed pigs, {{but at the end}} of the lairage period salivary cortisol concentrations did not differ between enriched- and barren-housed pigs. In pigs reared in a <b>barren</b> <b>environment,</b> salivary cortisol concentrations increased significantly after transport and being in lairage, as compared to home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In pigs reared in an enriched environment, salivary cortisol concentrations did not significantly change after any stage of preslaughter handling and transport as compared with home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In the truck, pigs reared in a <b>barren</b> <b>environment</b> tended to spend more time walking, standing and manipulating other pigs than enriched-reared pigs. Moreover, pigs reared in a <b>barren</b> <b>environment</b> tended to spend more time walking and fighting in lairage than enriched-reared pigs.

The tendency for increased manipulation of pen mates and fighting, and the significant increases in salivary cortisol in response to mixing at transport and being in lairage in pigs reared in a <b>barren</b> <b>environment</b> indicate that pigs reared in a <b>barren</b> <b>environment</b> are likely to experience more stress during common preslaughter procedures than pigs reared in an enriched environment...|$|E

To improve such conditions {{a small amount}} of straw or hay (100 g per animal per day laid daily in a rack) was used in our study as an environmental enrichment (EE). Two replications, each including 96 fattening pigs of both sexes (3 pens of 16 females and 3 pens of 16 male castrates) from 60 kg to slaughter at average 96 kg live weight, were used to test the effect of EE and sex on behaviour, growth rate, and carcass composition. EE significantly increased the proportion of total activity during the illumination period (between 6 a. m. and 2 p. m.) on account of increased occupation with substrate (P< 0. 01). EE also significantly reduced time spent biting pen bars and frequency of aggressive encounters (P< 0. 01). The EE increased total activity in female animals during the observation period, but not in male castrates. None of the EE significantly influenced pigs‘ growth rate and lean meat percentage; however females in enriched environment grew slower and had greater lean meat percentage than the castrated males.

Many species bristle with ferocious-looking spines, while other varieties are perfectly smooth.

In Cactus, Dan Torre explores these unique plants as they appear all around the world and throughout art, literature, and popular culture.

Some species were revered by ancient civilizations, playing a part in their religious ceremonies; other varieties have been cultivated for their medicinal properties and even as a source of dye, {{as in the case of}} the prickly pear cactus and the cochineal insect, the source of red carmine used in everything from food to lipstick. Torre examines how cacti have figured in low-footprint gardens, as iconic features of the landscapes of Westerns, and as a delicious culinary ingredient, from nutritious Nopal pads to alluring Pitaya or Dragon fruits.

However, to our knowledge no previous studies have tested the effect of early exposure to varying degrees of environmental complexity on specific components of spatial cognition in chickens.

For this purpose, 24 white Dekalb laying hens, half of which had been reared in an aviary system and the other half in a conventional cage system, were tested in a holeboard task.

40|$|Slatted {{floors and}} liquid manure–handling systems in {{intensive}} housing systems preclude {{the use of}} large straw quantities as enrichment material for pigs. Consequently, {{there is a need}} for alternative enrichment strategies, for example, by using suitable applications providing pigs with small straw quantities, which are associated with low straw waste. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a straw dispenser filled with fully chopped straw on the behavior and lesions in weanling pigs. A total of 365 weanling pigs, housed in single-sex groups (gilts and intact boars), were randomly divided in 2 groups. Half of the pigs had access to a straw dispenser (straw; n = 187), and the other half had no access to straw (control; n = 178). They were housed in the weanling unit for a period of 7 weeks (7 - 20 kg) and received liquid feed. One straw dispenser was provided per pen, accessible to 3 pigs at a time of 10 to 15 pigs in the pen, and positioned above the feed trough. To receive straw, pigs had to manipulate the dispensing unit on the bottom of the dispenser. Behavioral observations were carried out twice a week, and present lesions were also scored on these days by the same observer. Data were analyzed using a logistic mixed model and a Fisher exact test. No differences were found for biting behavior toward different body parts between control and straw pigs. There was also no effect of gender. In boars, aggressive behavior occurred more in straw groups compared to control groups, which might be related to competition. This finding is also reflected in more lesions on the middle part of the body in straw groups. A lack of difference in lesion scores for tail and ears between the 2 groups suggests that the dispenser provided insufficient distraction for weanling pigs compared to a <b>barren</b> <b>environment.</b> However, the position of the straw dispenser must be kept in mind, as this caused pigs to perform straw-directed behavior mainly in the feed trough. In this study, based on behavioral observations and lesion scores, it seems that the straw dispenser did not provide pigs with more advantages compared to pigs in a <b>barren</b> <b>environment.</b> Moreover, competition was observed in pens with boars, which might be related to the fact that only one dispenser was provided per pen. It should, however, be taken into account that the position of the dispenser might not have been the most suitable as it possibly caused mixing of feed and straw. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Title of the paper: Evaluating {{welfare in}} {{practical}} farm animal husbandry – discussion of criteria selection using {{the example of}} fattening pig husbandry In the evaluation of animal welfare under practical husbandry conditions – beside a clear definition of welfare – selection of indicators plays an important role. Using the example of fattening pig husbandry, the usefulness of physiological, immunological and pathological, ethological, and technical criteria of husbandry conditions is discussed. While physiological and immunological parameters can lead to findings about stress reactions under controlled circumstances their direct transfer to practical conditions is hardly possible. On the contrary, ethological indicators as outer signs of inner states can be recorded most reliable. Beside stereotypies and aberrant behaviour as clear signs of reduced welfare, especially in <b>barren</b> <b>environments,</b> the performance of species-specific behaviour can point to {{a positive influence on}} welfare. Behavioural observations {{over a longer period of}} time considering plenty of (ethological) indicators build a solid base for selection of methods.

40|$|The {{provision}} of straw in animal production systems is widely {{presumed to be}} beneficial {{for the welfare of}} the animals. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the scientific basis of this assumption for pigs and cattle. As there are important disadvantages (cost, labour, hygiene and incompatibility with manure drainage systems) associated with the use of straw, studies investigating whether there are suitable alternatives to straw that fulfil the same welfare functions are also reviewed. It is concluded that straw has many positive effects on the welfare of pigs. Bedding improves the physical comfort of the floor, and—unless temperatures are high—straw enables pigs to somewhat control their microclimate thereby increasing thermal comfort. Straw also functions as an important stimulus and outlet for exploration, foraging, rooting and chewing behaviours. Pigs that are feed restricted or housed in <b>barren</b> <b>environments,</b> in particular, can be strongly motivated to express these behaviours and the inability to do so may result in behavioural problems or anomalies. In addition, it has been demonstrated that preparturient sows are highly motivated to obtain nesting material and that straw can have a beneficial effect on maternal behaviour after farrowing. Although there may be superior alternatives for each of these functions of straw separately, it remains unlikely that thes...|$|R

They {{develop in}} animals kept in <b>barren</b> <b>environments</b> and are highly prevalent in laboratory mice (Mus musculus), yet their underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. In humans, stereotypies {{are associated with}} several psychiatric disorders and are thought to reflect dysfunction of inhibition of motor programs mediated by the corticostriatal circuitry, resulting in recurrent perseveration (=inappropriate repetition of behavioural responses). Several studies in captive {{animals of different species}} have reported a correlation between stereotypy performance and perseverative behaviour, indicating a similar dysfunction. To examine whether stereotypies in mice correlate with recurrent perseveration and whether they are causally related, we raised 40 female ICR CD- 1 mice in either barren or enriched cages from three to either six or 16 weeks of age (2 x 2 factorial design) and assessed stereotypic behaviour in the home cage and recurrent perseveration on a two-choice guessing task. Enrichment significantly reduced stereotypic behaviour both at six and 16 weeks of age and recurrent perseveration increased with age. Although enriched housing reduced the number of repetitions in the guessing task significantly, there was no clear evidence for an effect on recurrent perseveration, and recurrent perseveration did not correlate positively with stereotypy level. These findings indicate either that this test did not measure recurrent perseveration or that cage stereotypies in these mice do not reflect behavioural disinhibition as measured by recurrent perseveration...|$|R

Enrichment results showed that genes associated with N metabolism, processing and regulation of RNA, and transport predominated among those showing alterations in expression. Genes encoding transporter families underwent major changes in expression in both roots and leaves; in particular, those with roles in ammonia, amino acid and peptide transport were generally up-regulated after long-term starvation, while AQUAPORIN genes, whose products function in osmoregulation, were down-regulated. We also found that ASPARA-GINASE B 1 and SARCOSINE OXIDASE genes were up-regulated in roots and leaves after 2 and 16 d N starvation. Genes associated with ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation were significantly up-regulated. In addition, genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway were strongly activated while expression of those in GA signaling was inhibited in leaves. We showed that four major classes of genes, those with roles in N uptake, N reutilization, C/N ratio balance, and cell structure and synthesis, were particularly influenced by long-term N limitation. Our discoveries may offer clues to the molecular mechanisms that regulate N reallocation and reutilization so as to maintain or increase plant performance even under adverse environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Pigs {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} {{for use as}} models {{in many areas of}} biomedical research. However, little research has been done on the welfare of pigs within a laboratory setting. Housing conditions are generally designed for optimal control over the environment and there is possible need for environmental standardization necessary for accurate and valid results. Within research and laboratory settings, pigs are often housed in isolation and in <b>barren</b> <b>environments.</b> A common buffer for many of the stressors caused by isolation and barren housing is the implementation of environmental enrichment. Environmental enrichment involves the enhancement of an animal 2 ̆ 7 s physical or social environment and may be defined as an improvement in the biological functioning of captive animals resulting from modifications to their environment. For laboratory pigs, constraints mean that the enrichments should positively enhance the pig 2 ̆ 7 s biological functioning, yet be practical to employ within a laboratory setting. ^ For these reasons, our experimental enrichments focused on two items that we expected to be important for a pig housed individually in a laboratory type environment; namely companionship and comfort. In our first experiment (Chapter 2), knowing that pigs are highly social and that isolation is stressful, we offered the pigs access to sight and relative proximity to another pig. We also investigated whether provision of a mirror could mimic this. Secondly, also knowing that pigs in indoor housing systems spend the vast majority (75...|$|R

Accordingly, the {{development}} of reliable prospectivity indicators to guide exploration towards mineralised komatiite units has been a long-standing goal. Specifically, the development of effective resistate indicator minerals, analogous for example {{to the use of}} garnet in diamond exploration, would be pivotal in the exploration for mineralised komatiites. We utilised laser ablation ICP-MS to measure the ruthenium (Ru) concentrations of more than 390 chromite grains from barren and mineralised komatiites from the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia and the Finnish part of the Fennoscandian Shield. The results show that chromites from barren komatiite systems yield Ru concentrations mostly between 150 and 600 ppb. Conversely, chromites from mineralised units have distinctly lower Ru contents (< 150 ppb). These results can be interpreted in terms of the much higher partition coefficient for Ru into sulphide liquid compared with that into chromite, resulting in much lower Ru concentrations in chromite where both chromite and sulphide liquid are present and competing for Ru. Since chromites from mineralised komatiites have distinctly lower Ru contents than chromites from <b>barren</b> <b>environments,</b> we suggest that Ru content in chromite can be used as an effective prospectivity indicator. Due to the high immobility of Ru during postmagmatic processes and the relatively strong resistance of chromite grains to destructive metamorphism, alteration and lateritic weathering, detrital chromite from heavy mineral separates can potentially be used to evaluate terranes for nickel-sulphide mineralisation. 1 page(s...|$|R
