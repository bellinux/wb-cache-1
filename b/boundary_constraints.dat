50|$|Surface Evolver is an {{interactive}} {{program for the}} study of surfaces shaped by surface tension and other energies, and subject to various constraints. A surface is implemented as a simplicial complex. The user defines an initial surface in a datafile. The Evolver evolves the surface toward minimal energy by a gradient descent method. The aim can be to find a minimal energy surface, or to model the process of evolution by mean curvature. The energy in the Evolver can be a combination of surface tension, gravitational energy, squared mean curvature, user-defined surface integrals, or knot energies. The Evolver can handle arbitrary topology, volume constraints, <b>boundary</b> <b>constraints,</b> boundary contact angles, prescribed mean curvature, crystalline integrands, gravity, and constraints expressed as surface integrals. The surface can be in an ambient space of arbitrary dimension, which can have a Riemannian metric, and the ambient space can be a quotient space under a group action.|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of SOC designs, modern floorplanning typically needs to provide extra options to meet the different emerging requirements in the hierarchical designs, such as <b>boundary</b> <b>constraint</b> for I/O connection, clustering constraint for performance and reliability, etc. This paper addresses modern floorplanning with <b>boundary</b> clustering <b>constraint.</b> It has been empirically shown that the modern constraints extremely restrict the solution space; that is, {{a large number of}} randomly generated floorplans might be infeasible. In order to effectively search the feasible solutions, the feasible conditions based on B*-tree representation with <b>boundary</b> clustering <b>constraint</b> are investigated. The properties, coupled with an efficient simulated annealing algorithm, provide the way to produce feasible floorplans by dynamic repairing, which can transform an infeasible solution into a feasible one if the constraint is violated.

40|$|Vector Field Based Shape Deformations (VFSD) {{have been}} {{introduced}} as an efficient method to deform shapes in a volume-preserving foldover-free manner. However, mainly simple implicitly defined shapes like spheres or cylinders have been explored as deformation tools by now. In contrast, <b>boundary</b> <b>constraint</b> modeling approaches enable the user to exactly define {{the support of the}} deformation on the surface. We present an approach to explicitly control VFSD: a scalar function together with two thresholds is placed directly on the shape to mark regions of full, zero, and blended deformation. The resulting deformation is volumepreserving and free of local self-intersections. In addition, the full deformation is steered by a 3 D parametric curve and a parametric twisting function. This way our deformations appear to be a generalization of the <b>boundary</b> <b>constraint</b> modeling metaphor. We apply our approach in different scenarios. A parallelization of the computation on the GPU allows for editing high-resolution meshes at interactive speed. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} contextual hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. A novel conditional random fields (CRFs) model, known as higher order support vector random fields (HSVRFs), is proposed for HSI classification. By incorporating higher order potentials into a support vector random fields with a Mahalanobis distance <b>boundary</b> <b>constraint</b> (SVRFMC) model, the HSVRFs model not only {{takes advantage of the}} support vector machine (SVM) classifier and the Mahalanobis distance <b>boundary</b> <b>constraint,</b> but can also capture higher level contextual information to depict complicated details in HSI. The higher order potentials are defined on image segments, which are created by a fast unsupervised over-segmentation algorithm. The higher order potentials consider the spectral vectors of each of the segment’s constituting pixels coherently, and weight these pixels with the output probability of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier in our framework. Therefore, the higher order potentials can model higher-level contextual information, which is useful for the description of challenging complex structures and boundaries in HSI. Experimental results on two publicly available HSI datasets show that the HSVRFs model outperforms traditional and state-of-the art methods in HSI classification, especially for datasets containing complicated details...|$|R
