40|$|Abstract. Flexural-torsional {{buckling}} of the <b>beam</b> {{in steel}} frame with reduced <b>beam</b> section (RBS) connections is analyzed. Base on {{the analysis of}} flexural-torsional buckling of the RBS <b>beam</b> under different loads using energy method, the critical moment calculation formula of ordinary <b>beam</b> is modified, and the critical moment calculation formula of RBS <b>beam</b> is presented. Moreover law of the RBS <b>beam</b> critical moment varying with cut sizes and location is discussed {{when compared to the}} critical moment of the uniform <b>beam.</b> The results show that: reduction has great effect on flexural-torsional buckling of RBS <b>beam,</b> critical moment of the RBS <b>beam</b> obviously decreases as compared with ordinary uniform <b>beam,</b> but single cut parameter has small effect on changes in critical moment; the effect of reduction on <b>beam</b> stiffness decreases as <b>beam</b> span increases...|$|R

5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered <b>beams.</b> When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these <b>beams</b> make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these <b>beams</b> are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E
