However, when his persistent dreams disturb his sleep, his wife distracts him with sex while his children inject him with a sleep-inducing drug, indicating not all is as it seems with Carl's [...] "normal" [...] life.|$|R

[...] Byers disagreed and placed the revelation as one of the film's [...] "most shocking scenes", where Ash's difference from the other crew members is [...] "shown to be a difference not simply of degree," [...] as the audience might have theretofore supposed, [...] "but one of kind." [...] (It is Ash who points out, {{at the start of the}} film, that their contracts with the Corporation require, under penalty of total forfeiture of shares, the crew to investigate any signs of intelligent life. [...] It is Ash, not yet revealed to be an android, who follows the secret Order #937 stating [...] "crew expendable", apparently, at that point, loyal to the Company even to the extent of sacrificing his own life.) Ash's unmasking shows him to be a traitor, who has been working in the Company's interests all along, because he has been programmed to do so. Worse still, the theretofore <b>benevolent</b> <b>Corporation,</b> that supposedly mandates its crews to rescue spaceships broadcasting distress signals, is revealed as a profiteering entity that cares not at all for human lives, and considers them to be commodities of no more inherent worth than the android machine that they programmed to capture and return a specimen of the alien.|$|E
