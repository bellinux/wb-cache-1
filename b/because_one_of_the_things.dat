50|$|<b>The</b> Cajun stage <b>of</b> this rocket {{was named}} for <b>the</b> Cajun people <b>of</b> south Louisiana <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket's designers, J. G. Thibodaux, was a Cajun.|$|R
50|$|In {{art history}} {{it has a}} special {{significance}} <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important rococo woodcarvers in southern Germany, Matthias Faller, lived and worked here for a while.|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} {{group is the}} fixed capacitors. Many got their names from the dielectric. For a systematic classification these characteristics can't be used, <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest, the electrolytic capacitor, is named instead by its cathode construction. So the most-used names are simply historical.|$|R
25|$|This can {{be derived}} using the {{exponential}} family formula for the moment generating function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sufficient statistic, <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sufficient statistics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gamma distribution is ln(x).|$|R
2500|$|... {{where the}} product is over all {{possible}} choices. <b>The</b> product vanishes <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choices is just σ(i) = 1 for all i, for which the term vanishes according to our assumption above.|$|R
50|$|Business acumen: {{this course}} gives {{students}} {{an insight into}} business practise, financial transactions and commercial ventures. This is valuable <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most skills most commonly sought by graduate recruiters is commercial awareness.|$|R
50|$|Any {{number that}} has two {{identical}} numbers {{on opposite sides}} of itself cannot be black, <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two identical numbers must be black, and it cannot be adjacent to another black cell.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Special Forces soldier's {{primary mission}} is <b>the</b> {{instruction}} <b>of</b> other forces, they participate extensively in special operations training courses offered by other services and allied nations throughout their careers.|$|R

2500|$|The Model T was a {{rear-wheel drive}} vehicle. Its {{transmission}} was a planetary gear type billed as [...] "three speed". In today's terms {{it would be}} considered a two-speed, <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three speeds was reverse.|$|R
50|$|A musical {{highlight}} {{through the}} film is <b>the</b> Piano Concerto <b>of</b> Edvard Grieg. This ties in with <b>the</b> narrative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voyage <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea-cadets is a piano-student who is preparing to play the concerto in Boston.|$|R
50|$|The November 29, 1963, {{episode was}} pulled from {{syndication}} <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters fantasized about saving <b>the</b> President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States' life—one week after John F.

50|$|A little {{downstream}} from Ecton, this is <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> only tunnel {{on the former}} railway. This was built <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway lived there {{and did not want}} to be disturbed by passing trains.|$|R
50|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to group <b>the</b> superfamilies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lepidoptera into natural groups, most <b>of</b> which fail <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two groups is not monophyletic: Microlepidoptera and Macrolepidoptera, Heterocera and Rhopalocera, Jugatae and Frenatae, Monotrysia and Ditrysia.|$|R
50|$|Bhatt {{was among}} those who refused to accept an award offered by the Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar Academy in 2011. This was <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> co-awardees, Jagdish Tytler, is alleged to have been {{involved}} in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.|$|R
50|$|The caravan was {{significantly}} slowed {{as they had}} to find grazing areas, a rarity in the desert, for <b>the</b> camels <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team members had skimped on buying fodder for the animals. Stromer could do nothing but fume.|$|R
50|$|The act drew {{considerable}} media attention, {{not least}} <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key votes resulted in <b>the</b> first defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> Tony Blair on <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Commons, and <b>the</b> worst such defeat for any government since 1978.|$|R
30|$|<b>Because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key {{goals is}} fast feedback, {{interfaces}} and components for in situ visualization of {{results will be}} key.

25|$|Knowledge {{representation}} {{goes hand in}} {{hand with}} automated reasoning <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main purposes <b>of</b> explicitly representing knowledge is to be able to reason about that knowledge, to make inferences, assert new knowledge, etc. Virtually all knowledge representation languages have a reasoning or inference engine as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system.|$|R
30|$|The challenge, from a {{clinical}} point of view, {{it is to}} have these paired modalities used with their full potentials. Still after several years from <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technology, we often see duplication <b>of</b> procedures just <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hybrid components <b>of</b> imaging is under used or under evaluated.|$|R
30|$|There was a {{possibility}} that cancer cell seeding by FNA was <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> gastric metastases. However, we think it unlikely <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metastases was located in the antrum, far from the aspiration site, and we also found a gallbladder metastasis which {{could not have been}} related to FNA.|$|R
50|$|In June 2006, Bilgievi had {{to change}} its name as Sakarya Bilgi Kültür Merkezi <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading {{political}} party in Turkey started to establish local organizations under the same name all around Turkey.

50|$|Although Parish had a {{successful}} college career at Centenary College of Louisiana from 1972 - 1976, he received virtually no notice <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most severe penalties ever levied by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> {{combination}} <b>of</b> these reactions {{results in}} a synergistic effect for relieving the unfavorable thermodynamics for methanol synthesis, <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products at each step is a reactant for another.

For simplicity, we refer {{the first part}} in (16) or (17) as [...] "one-max" [...] interval, <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nodes uses its maximum {{transmit}} power. We refer the second part in (16) or (17) as [...] "non-max" [...] interval, since neither <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nodes uses its maximum transmit power.|$|R
50|$|During this period, {{the statue}} was widely {{interpreted}} as representing a defeated gladiator, {{rather than a}} Galatian warrior.
