5|$|Assisted by tug boats, Washington Irving reached shore at {{the then}} under {{construction}} Pier 12, Jersey City and sank five minutes later. Three passengers {{died as a}} result of the accident. Wylma Wood Hoag, (wife of Lynne Arthur Hoag and mother to Arthur Allen Hoag), their three-year-old daughter Mary, and B. Woods, a steward, who was trapped in a cabin far <b>below</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|All-weather {{lifeboats}} (ALBs) {{are large}} boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces <b>below</b> <b>deck,</b> which are self-righting and {{can go out}} in all weather conditions. Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class lifeboat or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by mechanical arm. There are six classes of ALB motor life boats, with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. The RNLI's aim {{is to provide a}} 25-knot lifeboat to every all-weather crew, and has begun construction of an All-weather Lifeboat Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3million a year. The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a year will be built.|$|E
5|$|At once an {{explosion}} was heard from above: the gun had malfunctioned. Tyler was unhurt, having remained safely <b>below</b> <b>deck,</b> {{but a number}} of others were killed instantly, including his crucial cabinet members, Gilmer and Upshur. Also killed or mortally wounded were Virgil Maxcy of Maryland, Rep. David Gardiner of New York, Commodore Beverley Kennon, Chief of Construction of the United States Navy, and Armistead, Tyler's black slave and body servant. The death of David Gardiner had a devastating effect on his daughter, Julia, who fainted and was carried to safety by the president himself. Julia later recovered from her grief and married Tyler.|$|E

5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at {{the head}} of a party of 20men. They met little {{resistance}} from Chesapeakes crew, most of whom had run <b>below</b> <b>deck.</b> The only resistance from Chesapeake came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck in the head with a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E
5|$|On April 9, 1768, two customs {{employees}} (called tidesmen) boarded Hancock's brig Lydia in Boston Harbor. Hancock was summoned, {{and finding}} that the agents lacked a writ of assistance (a general search warrant), he did {{not allow them to}} go <b>below</b> <b>deck.</b> When one of them later managed to get into the hold, Hancock's men forced the tidesman back on deck. Customs officials wanted to file charges, but the case was dropped when Massachusetts Attorney General Jonathan Sewall ruled that Hancock had broken no laws. Later, some of Hancock's most ardent admirers would call this incident the first act of physical resistance to British authority in the colonies and credit Hancock with initiating the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The ships' main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} four smoothbore, muzzle-loading 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets. The fore turret in each ship, except , {{was designed by}} Eads while the aft turret was the standard Ericsson design used in most Union monitors. Unlike the latter, which rested its entire weight on a central spindle {{that had to be}} elevated in order for the turret to rotate, Eads' design better distributed its weight because it rested on a number of ball bearings underneath {{the outer edge of the}} turret. The structure of the Eads turret extended down to be bottom of the ship and the entire structure rotated. The guns in the Eads turret were mounted on a steam-powered platform that moved up and down, so that the guns could be reloaded <b>below</b> <b>deck,</b> safe from enemy interference.|$|E

5|$|For {{those who}} were not injured or killed {{outright}} by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from <b>below</b> <b>deck</b> were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.|$|E
5|$|While sailing in the West Indies in 1676, the Unicorn, {{commanded}} by Sir Francis Haddock, is seized and captured {{by a group}} of pirates led by Red Rackham. The pirates hoist a red pennant—no life would be spared. During the battle, Sir Francis is hit and loses consciousness. Later, the members of the Unicorn crew still alive are killed or thrown overboard. Sir Francis regains consciousness, finding himself tied to the mainmast. The pirate ship is damaged and sinking, so Red Rackham moves his treasure on board the Unicorn. The ship then sails to an uninhabited island. When anchored near the shore of the island, Sir Francis manages to free himself and goes <b>below</b> <b>deck</b> to the Unicorn gunpowder stores. Whilst there, he encounters Rackham for the final time, killing him in a sword fight. Before escaping in the ship's jolly boat, he is able to set fire to the gunpowder by means of a slow-burning fuse, causing the Unicorn (with Rackham's drunken crew and presumably Red Rackham's treasure still aboard) to explode and sink.|$|E
5|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined {{that the majority of the}} crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively barricading themselves <b>below</b> <b>deck.</b> Having done so, they refused orders to open them again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could.|$|E

25|$|On 2 December, {{at about}} 4a.m., Achilles {{was in the}} {{latitude}} of San Domingo when lookouts saw a large vessel sailing towards them. The British feared {{that this was a}} 44-gun French frigate. Achilles cleared for action and at 8a.m. saw that the French vessel had altered her course and that people aboard her were throwing things overboard. Hogg set off to intercept and by about 9:30a.m. got close enough for an engagement to commence. de Menard had his small arms men fire on the French vessel but kept most of his men out of harm's way <b>below</b> <b>deck.</b> The French vessel thought that it was dealing with a lightly-manned merchant vessel and attempted to put boarders on Achilles. After about three-quarters of an hour Achilles was in a position for the Dutch soldiers hidden <b>below</b> <b>deck</b> to come out and board the French vessel. The Anglo-German boarding party quickly cleared the French deck and took command of the vessel.|$|E

Osborne disarmed the man, but then other crewmen came up, captured Osborne, and secured {{him and the}} other loyal crew <b>below</b> <b>deck.</b> The mutineers then sailed Dominica overnight to Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch finally {{surrendered}} {{after having}} lost their captain {{and three other}} men killed, and twelve officers and men wounded. All the British casualties were Scorpions; she had five wounded, including Williams and Lieutenant Buckland Bluett.
