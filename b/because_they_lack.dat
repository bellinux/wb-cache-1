5|$|The Pro-Line {{series was}} durable and fault-tolerant, with many models lasting for years. However, because they used {{solid-state}} amplifiers, {{they are not}} as highly regarded as the older tube-based Leslies, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> the characteristic sound when the amp is overdriven.|$|E
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} letter, the pope demands Olov to dismiss two bishops that Olov's {{predecessor}} Petrus had appointed <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> proper heredity.|$|R
50|$|Individuals may be stymied {{in their}} careers not only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> career {{development}} and job hunting skills but also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were driven by unconscious factors outside of their awareness.|$|R
50|$|In the past, Hindus went to Sikh gurdwaras <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> {{their own}} Hindu temples. Historically there were {{ten times the}} number of Punjabi Sikhs {{compared}} to Punjabi Hindus.|$|R
5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{pterosaur}} researcher Alexander Kellner revisited H.W. Miller's classification. Kellner followed Miller's {{opinion that}} {{the differences between the}} Pteranodon species were great enough to place them into different genera. He placed P. sternbergi into the genus named by Miller, Geosternbergia, along with the Pierre Shale skull specimen which Bennett had previously considered to be a large male P. longiceps. Kellner argued that this specimen's crest, though incompletely preserved, was most similar to Geosternbergia. Because the specimen was millions of years younger than any known Geosternbergia, he assigned it to the new species Geosternbergia maysei. Numerous other pteranodont specimens are known from the same formation and time period, and Kellner suggested they may belong to the same species as G. maysei, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> skulls, he could not confidently identify them.|$|E
5|$|Today {{there are}} over 600 addax in Europe, Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve (Israel), Sabratha (Libya), Giza Zoo (Egypt), North America, Japan and Australia under captive {{breeding}} programmes. There are 1000 more in private collections and ranches in United States and the Middle East. Addax is legally protected in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria; hunting of all gazelles is forbidden in Libya and Egypt. Although enormous reserves, such as the Hoggar Mountains and Tasilli in Algeria, the Ténéré in Niger, the Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve in Chad, and the newly established Wadi Howar National Park in Sudan, cover areas where addax previously occurred, some do not keep addax at present <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> the resources. The addax has been reintroduced in Bou-Hedma National Park (Tunisia) and Souss-Massa National Park (Morocco). Reintroductions in the wild are ongoing in Jebil National Park (Tunisia) and Grand Erg Oriental (Sahara), and another is planned in Morocco.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{their initial}} victories, the Yuan did not pursue the samurai further inland to the {{defenses}} at Dazaifu. [...] Nihon Ōdai Ichiran {{explains that the}} invaders were defeated <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> arrows.|$|R
40|$|Financial {{regulators}} and politicians unsuccessfully maintained {{the safety and}} soundness of the U. S. financial system not only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the proper tools but also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the proper incentives. While filling regulatory gaps and improving supervisory tools are worthwhile reforms, they do not address the core governance failure – the unwillingness of the policy apparatus {{to adapt to a}} dynamic, innovating financial system and act {{in the best interests of}} the public. I propose an auxiliary institution to act as a sentinel on behalf of the public to improve the design, interpretation, and implementation of financial regulations...|$|R
5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E

25|$|Polyclonal equine {{intravenous}} antivenom {{is produced}} in Brazil, and no commercial product is available in North America. Results have been discouraging. Retrospective data are limited <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> a definition of time to antivenom administration {{and its relation to}} outcome.|$|E
50|$|Musonius {{disapproved of}} {{same-sex}} relations <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> a procreative purpose. Seneca and Epictetus also thought that procreation privileged male-female sexual pairing within marriage, and Seneca strongly opposed adultery, finding it particularly offensive by women.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s a {{group led}} by Isomi Izeki began {{communal}} living in Koryama City. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> {{a model for the}} practical organization they studied Kibbutzim in Israel, but later they found out about the Hutterites.|$|R
50|$|Together, {{the gods}} {{attempted}} to create living beings {{so that they}} may be praised and venerated by their creation. Their first attempts (animals, mud man, and wooden man) proved unsuccessful <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> speech, souls, and intellect.|$|R
25|$|Young {{children}} learn {{from experience that}} stating an untruth can avoid punishment for misdeeds, before they develop the theory of mind necessary to understand why it works. In this stage of development, children will sometimes tell outrageous and unbelievable lies, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> the conceptual framework to judge whether a statement is believable, or even to {{understand the concept of}} believability.|$|E
25|$|Paul Farmer {{also argues}} that the more {{expensive}} a treatment is, {{the harder it is}} for poor countries to get this treatment. The issue of human rights is mentioned here. It was mentioned in this article that Africa {{is at the end of}} the receiving line of treatments <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> the 'concept of time' which he described as the schedule of administration and this concept hinders their reception of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, class IB reductases are not {{inhibited}} by dATP <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> approximately 50 N-terminal {{amino acids}} {{required for the}} allosteric activity site. Eukaryotic cells with class IA reductases have a mechanism of negative control to turn off synthesis of dNTPs as they accumulate. This mechanism protects the cell from toxic and mutagenic effects that can arise from the overproduction of dNTPs because changes in balanced dNTP pools lead to DNA damage and cell death.|$|E
5000|$|Greater Boston {{educational}} institutions, {{especially the}} so-called [...] "subway" [...] or [...] "commuter" [...] colleges and universities, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{were the first}} to welcome young Armenian-Americans and others with limited resources and social standing and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the vast endowments of schools such as Harvard.|$|R
50|$|Many {{computational}} linguists were {{disenchanted with}} the print dictionaries {{as a resource}} for computational linguistics <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> sufficient syntactic and semantic information for computer programs. The work on computational lexicology quickly led to efforts in two additional directions.|$|R

25|$|Until {{the nineteenth}} century, many Western proto-democracies had {{property}} qualifications in their electoral laws; e.g. only landowners could vote (because the only tax for such countries was the property tax), or {{the voting rights}} were weighted according {{to the amount of}} taxes paid (as in the Prussian three-class franchise). Most countries abolished the property qualification for national elections in the late nineteenth century, but retained it for local government elections for several decades. Today these laws have largely been abolished, although the homeless {{may not be able to}} register <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> regular addresses.|$|E
25|$|When asleep, {{a person}} is unable to make {{judgments}} as they do when they are awake Due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep, {{they are unable to}} help a person judge what is happening in their dream. This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real. Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not. So, the dreamer is left to accept the dream <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> the choice to judge it.|$|E
25|$|In all the studied cases, carnivory allows {{plants to}} grow and {{reproduce}} using animals {{as a source of}} nitrogen, phosphorus and possibly potassium. However, there is a spectrum of dependency on animal prey. Pygmy sundews are unable to use nitrate from soil <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> the necessary enzymes (nitrate reductase in particular). Common butterworts (Pinguicula vulgaris) can use inorganic sources of nitrogen better than organic sources, but a mixture of both is preferred. European bladderworts seem to use both sources equally well. Animal prey makes up for differing deficiencies in soil nutrients.|$|E
50|$|The former {{authors of}} Der Ruf met in September 1947 {{in order to}} start a new magazine, Der Skorpion. This was not {{successful}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> a sound financial basis. Inspired by the Spanish Group 98 they founded the Gruppe 47.|$|R
50|$|CONMEBOL {{asked the}} Paraguayan Football Association to {{organize}} it, but it refused <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> the infrastructure {{for such an}} event.

25|$|The {{selective}} {{culture medium}} is called HAT medium {{because it contains}} hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine. This medium is selective for fused (hybridoma) cells. Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells, referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the media because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{also explains}} why quasars were {{more common in}} the early universe, as this energy production ends when the supermassive black hole consumes all of the gas and dust near it. This means that it is possible that most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have gone through an active stage, appearing as a quasar or some other class of active galaxy that depended on the black hole mass and the accretion rate, and are now quiescent <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> a supply of matter to feed into their central black holes to generate radiation.|$|E
25|$|Ethnicity, age, education, employment, marital status, and {{location}} are reported factors of delayed breastfeeding and infant under nutrition. Low- income mothers are specifically {{at risk for}} under nutrition and high mortality rates amongst their infants because they replace breast milk with formula. They do so <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lack</b> a supportive environment, embarrassment of nursing, or the need {{to return to school}} or work. About 16.5% of low-income mothers breastfed for the recommended time. Studies suggest that scarce financial and social resources are consistent with the high mortality rates amongst the infants of low-income mothers.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Stennes {{continued}} to complain; {{he noted that}} the SA in Breslau were not able to turn out for inspection in February 1931 <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> footwear. He also complained about Röhm's return to run the SA, objecting to the Chief of Staff's alleged homosexuality.|$|R
50|$|Murphy deemed {{his current}} living {{quarters}} {{in the cathedral}} rectory as unsatisfactory <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>lacked</b> privacy, and that a separate donated house was not large enough to entertain visiting prelates.
