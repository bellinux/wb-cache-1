5000|$|At {{the front}} of the barrel, the [...] plastic leaves the screw and travels through a screen pack to remove any {{contaminants}} in the melt. The screens are reinforced by a <b>breaker</b> <b>plate</b> (a thick metal puck with many holes drilled through it) since the pressure at this point can exceed 5,000 psi (34 MPa). The screen pack/breaker plate assembly also serves to create back pressure in the barrel. Back pressure is required for uniform melting and proper mixing of the polymer, and how much pressure is generated can be [...] "tweaked" [...] by varying screen pack composition (the number of screens, their wire weave size, and other parameters). This <b>breaker</b> <b>plate</b> and screen pack combination also does the function of converting [...] "rotational memory" [...] of the molten plastic into [...] "longitudinal memory".|$|E
50|$|After {{passing through}} the <b>breaker</b> <b>plate</b> molten plastic enters the die. The die is what gives the final product its profile and must be {{designed}} so that the molten plastic evenly flows from a cylindrical profile, to the product's profile shape. Uneven flow at this stage can produce a product with unwanted residual stresses at certain points in the profile which can cause warping upon cooling. Almost any shape imaginable can be created {{so long as it}} is a continuous profile.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For the {{analysis}} of various extruder models are used not only testing, but also diverse simulation techniques. Of them, the three-dimensional technique is widely used recently. In this study, the <b>breaker</b> <b>plate</b> in a polymer resin extruder was analyzed. The <b>breaker</b> <b>plate</b> changes the rotational motion of the polymer resin extruded from the screw barrel into a straight line motion before it passes through the die. Also, the size and number of circular holes in a <b>breaker</b> <b>plate</b> directly affect polymer resin extrusion molding. In this study, a 3 -D modeling was used to conduct the structural improvement of breaker plates, and the thermal/flow analysis program CFdesign was used to conduct a dynamic property analysis {{in a bid to}} achieve the production stability of extruders. 1. ITRODUCTIO Not only testing but also diverse simulation techniques are recently used to analyze various extrusion models. Of them, the 3 -D technique is the most widely used recently. The 3 -D technique can accurately analyze the complicated molding structures that the simple analysis 2 -D technique cannot cover. Thus, the 3 -D technique is used to measure the shapes of extruders with complicated structures, and the friction force and density of polymer resin, and to research into application mechanisms. The <b>breaker</b> <b>plate</b> is installed in a polymer resin extruder. It changes the rotational motion of polymer resin extruded from the screw barrel into a straight lin...|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, the coalescence and {{breakup of}} particles were {{considered in the}} present study. The simulation {{results showed that the}} droplet coalescence happened at a very low rate of less than 0.5 % in Cases 3, 6 and 7. However, the droplet breakup was more common. For Cases 3, 6 and 7, the droplet breakup occurred at a significant rate of 15.10, 17.94 and 18.37 %, respectively. As a result, it can be concluded that the installation of the vane-type momentum <b>breaker</b> and perforated <b>plates</b> increased the number of breakups.|$|R
50|$|The {{distributor}} also {{houses the}} centrifugal advance unit: {{a set of}} hinged weights attached to the distributor shaft, that cause the <b>breaker</b> points mounting <b>plate</b> to slightly rotate and advance the spark timing with higher engine revolutions per minute (rpm). In addition, the distributor has a vacuum advance unit that advances the timing even further {{as a function of}} the vacuum in the inlet manifold. Usually there is also a capacitor attached to the distributor. The capacitor is connected parallel to the breaker points, to suppress sparking to prevent excessive wear of the points.|$|R

Who {{was sure to}} upset his coffee cup at breakfast, or to knock over his tumbler at dinner, or to {{prostrate}} saltcellar, pepper box, and mustard pot, if he only happened to move his arm? Why, Henry. Who was <b>plate</b> <b>breaker</b> general for the family? It was Henry. Who tangled mamma's silks and cottons, and tore up the last newspaper for papa, or threw down old Ph[oe]be's clothes horse, with all her clean ironing thereupon? Why, Henry.|$|R
40|$|In {{high-temperature}} short- time extrusion {{cooking with}} a twin screw extruder, effects of oil addition to defatted soybean flour and microstructural transformation of full - fat soybean flour during cooking, were investigated {{by use of}} a light microscope. At levels up to 15 %, soybean oil was distributed in the protein and carbohydrate matrix as small, spherical drops under the experimental conditions used in this study. However, oil contents above 15 % significantly prevented formation of well-aligned fibrous structures in the extrudates. During extrusion cooking, the starting materials began to break down by shearing and kneading forces in the feed section but gross cellular structures remained up to the cooking zone. After being introduced into the cooking zone, protein and carbohydrate were plasticized {{and appeared to be}} stream-like. Passage through the <b>breaker</b> <b>plate</b> and long cooling die induced formation of a fiber-like extrudate...|$|E
40|$|POM/PP blends of {{different}} compositions were extruded through a round die of 2 mm diameter using a single screw extruder. The morphology of the extrudates was studied using a {{polarized light microscope}} (PLM), a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the solvent extraction technique A cable-like structure was observed in the extrudates, consisting of circular cords surrounded by a skin layer. The number and distribution of the cords matched with the holes on the <b>breaker</b> <b>plate</b> just before the die. The compositon and morphology of the cords were found to vary with the POM/PP composition ratio. For composition ratios between 10 / 90 and 40 / 60, the outer cords were rich in PP and {{only a small amount}} of POM fibres, particles or thin films were found. In contrast, the inner cords contained more POM fibres and they were distributed more evenly within the PP matrix In the 50 / 50 blend, both POM and PP fibres were present. In blends with more than 50 % POM, the cords were made up of PP fibres in a continuous POM matrix. Cryogenically-fractured sections of the extrudates showed clean fibre/matrix interfaces under the SEM, this being a sign of poor adhesion between the polymers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
