5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but <b>beyond</b> <b>that</b> point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E

5|$|Although the Potsdam Conference {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} with European affairs, {{the war against}} Japan was also discussed in detail. Truman learned of the successful Trinity test early in the conference and shared this information with the British delegation. The successful test caused the American delegation to reconsider the necessity and wisdom of Soviet participation, for which the U.S. had lobbied hard at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. High on the United States' list of priorities was shortening the war and reducing American casualties—Soviet intervention seemed likely to do both, but {{at the cost of}} possibly allowing the Soviets to capture territory <b>beyond</b> <b>that</b> which had been promised to them at Tehran and Yalta, and causing a postwar division of Japan similar to that which had occurred in Germany.|$|E

It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go <b>beyond</b> <b>that</b> the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
