50|$|When {{liquid coolant}} {{undergoes}} {{a change in}} phase due to the absorption of heat from a heated solid surface, a higher transfer rate occurs. The more efficient heat transfer from the heated surface (in the form of heat of vaporization plus sensible heat) and the motions of the bubbles (bubble-driven turbulence and convection) leads to rapid mixing of the fluid. Therefore, <b>boiling</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> has {{played an important role}} in industrial heat transfer processes such as macroscopic heat transfer exchangers in nuclear and fossil power plants, and in microscopic heat transfer devices such as heat pipes and microchannels for cooling electronic chips.|$|E
50|$|Sabersky was {{interested}} in research that focused on heat transfer. At Aerojet, he dealt {{with the challenge of}} how to cool rocket thrust chambers. When he returned to Caltech in 1946, he still had a keen interest in these problems. He decided to tackle the problem of <b>boiling</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer.</b> His first Ph.D. student, Max Edmund Ellion was given the task as a dissertation project. Sabersky worked on liquids near the critical point. He teamed with Karl Knapp and Ed Hauptmann for this research effort. The problem of free convection in Bénard cells was investigated by Sabersky with Richard Carl Nielsen. Duane Floyd Dipprey worked {{on the issue of the}} effect of heat transfer to fluids flowing in rough surfaced tubes. Dipprey was able to build tubes with controlled roughness. Paul Maurice Debrule built upon the rough tubes research and continued with the application to polymer solutions. Eric Francois Matthys pursued an interest in non-Newtonian fluids and investigated the flow of a natural fluid, tomato juice. Sabersky explored the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the granular material. This project was funded in part by the National Science Foundation. Wiliam Noel Sullivan was tasked with this endeavor. Christopher E. Burns joined in the efforts to solve some of the mysteries of material granular flow. Another later project that Sabersky was involved with was the study of indoor air quality that involved smog and ozone. Frederick H. Shair assisted with these efforts. Gordon Peterson was the student that drove his automobile over the Los Angeles freeways to measure the ozone levels and record the data inside his vehicle.|$|E

However, the improvement of all <b>boiling</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> characteristics including the critical heat flux, heat transfer coefficient and onset of nucleate boiling, usually has conflicting requirements on surface wettability and morphology. In this work, we develop a two-level hierarchical surface with patterned copper nanowire arrays for <b>boiling</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> enhancement. By surrounding long nanowire arrays with short nanowires where microcavities are formed between short nanowire clusters, a novel strategy is reported to improve all the <b>boiling</b> <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> characteristics through increasing bubble nucleation site density, capillary-induced liquid rewetting, and the separation of liquid-vapor pathways.
