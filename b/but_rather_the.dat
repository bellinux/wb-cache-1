5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early {{relatives}} or possible ancestors of the elk) first appear in the fossil record 25 million years ago, during the Oligocene in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American fossil record until the early Miocene.

5|$|Djajakusuma became {{employed}} at the Cultural Centre {{as a translator}} and actor under Armijn Pane. Among the works he translated were several pieces by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg and Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, {{as well as a}} history of Japan and several kabuki stage plays. While with the Centre, Djajakusuma wrote several of his own stage plays. In his free time, Djajakusuma helped establish the amateur theatre company Maya, together with artists such as HB Jassin, Rosihan Anwar, and Usmar Ismail. The troupe, formed in response to a desire for greater artistic freedom, performed translations of European works and original works by Ismail and El Hakim. To promote a sense of Indonesian nationalism while still conforming with the Japanese censorship bureau's rules, several of Maya's plays did not explicitly promote Japan, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Themes supporting the Indonesian nationalist movement, meanwhile, remained implicit in the works. With Maya, Djajakusuma travelled from village to village, putting on performances.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the large}} number of Latter Day Saint churches and their differing backgrounds, categorizing them can be difficult. A common {{approach}} in some histories and studies is to use Rocky Mountain Saints for those denominations headquartered in the American West and Prairie Saints for those denominations that formed in and around Nauvoo, Illinois; Voree, Wisconsin; Independence, Missouri; and other locations in the Midwest and East. These terms do not necessarily relate the current geographical locations of all denominations within those two groupings, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> original location of their respective parent organizations, which may be seen in the table below.|$|E
5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} with being {{the first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods.

Indeed {{there is not a single}} mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Enrico Tortonese {{examined}} the Nice and Cayenne specimens of S. tudes (the Coromandel specimen having {{been lost in}} the interim) and concluded that they were not great hammerheads, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> same species as S. bigelowi. Carter Gilbert concurred in his 1967 revision of the hammerhead sharks, noting that while the lost Coromandel specimen was probably a great hammerhead, none of the existing material belonged to that species. Thus, Sphyrna tudes became the accepted name for the smalleye hammerhead, taking precedence over S. bigelowi because it was published earlier, and the great hammerhead received the next available name Sphyrna mokarran. Gilbert designated the Nice specimen as the lectotype that would define S. tudes, having priority over the Cayenne specimen (the paralectotype). This was meant to stabilize the name, but had the opposite effect.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex. Malek doubts {{the existence of a}} popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas' complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years as shown by the numerous scarabs bearing Unas' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550c.1077 BC) until the Late Period (664332 BC). The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> statues of the king in the valley temple.|$|E
5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into someone.

He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes.

5|$|The eldest living {{brother of}} the late King Robert, Stannis Baratheon, announces himself as {{rightful}} heir to the Iron Throne.

Stannis refuses to seek an alliance with Robb Stark or Renly Baratheon, despite the advice of his advisor Ser Davos Seaworth, because he sees them as usurpers; Stannis insists that all will bend the knee to him or be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The roadway opened between Plymouth Meeting and the Lehigh Valley {{interchange}} near Allentown on November 23, 1955. The highway {{was extended}} north to Emerald on December 28, 1955. The Northeast Extension was opened between Emerald and Wyoming Valley on April1, 1957. The {{entire length of}} the Northeast Extension was finished on November7, 1957 with the completion of the northernmost part between Wyoming Valley and Scranton. The part of the Northeast Extension between Scranton and the New York border would not be built as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> Interstate Highway System as I-81. At the northern terminus, the Northeast Extension narrowed to two lanes along the northbound off-ramp at Scranton to come to its northern terminus, with an abandoned short spur of the mainline heading north. A pair of trumpet interchanges were built to connect the Northeast Extension and I-81. In 1980, the roadway would be designated PA9.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|E

5|$|Jeremy Waldron {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} The New York Review of Books, and was critical of Lewis' broad stance towards freedom of speech with respect to hate speech. Waldron later elaborated this position in his 2012 book The Harm in Hate Speech, in which he devoted an entire chapter to Lewis' book. Waldron emphasized that the problem with an expansive view of free speech is not the harm of hateful thoughts, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>the</b> negative impact resulting from widespread publication of the thoughts. He questioned whether children of racial groups criticized by widely published hate speech {{would be able to}} succeed in such an environment. Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens analyzed The Harm in Hate Speech and discussed Freedom for the Thought That We Hate, in a review for The New York Review of Books. Justice Stevens recounted Lewis' argument that an acceptance of hate speech is necessary, because attempts to regulate it would cause encroachment upon expression of controversial viewpoints. He pointed out that Lewis and Waldron agreed that Americans have more freedom of speech than citizens of any other country. In his review, Stevens cited the 2011 decision in Snyder v. Phelps as evidence {{that the majority of the}} U.S. Supreme Court supported the right of the people to express hateful views on matters of public importance. Stevens concluded that, although Waldron was unsuccessful in convincing him that legislators should ban all hate speech, The Harm in Hate Speech persuaded him that government leaders should refrain from using such language themselves.|$|E
