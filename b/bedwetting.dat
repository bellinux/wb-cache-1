25|$|<b>Bedwetting</b> can be {{connected}} to emotional or physical trauma. Trauma can trigger a return to <b>bedwetting</b> (secondary enuresis) in both children and adults. In addition, caregivers cause some level of emotional trauma when they punish or shame a <b>bedwetting</b> child.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{management}} options for <b>bedwetting.</b> The following options apply when the <b>bedwetting</b> is not caused by a specifically identifiable medical condition such as a bladder abnormality or diabetes. Treatment is recommended when there is a specific medical condition such as bladder abnormalities, infection, or diabetes. It is also considered when <b>bedwetting</b> may harm the child's self-esteem or relationships with family/friends. Only a small percentage of <b>bedwetting</b> is caused by a specific medical condition, so most treatment is prompted by concern for the child's emotional welfare. Behavioral treatment of <b>bedwetting</b> overall tends to show increased self-esteem for children.|$|E
25|$|As can be {{seen from}} the numbers above, a portion of <b>bedwetting</b> {{children}} will not outgrow the problem. Adult rates of <b>bedwetting</b> show little change due to spontaneous cure. Persons who are still enuretic at age 18 are likely to deal with <b>bedwetting</b> throughout their lives.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{show that}} <b>bedwetting</b> {{children}} {{are more likely to have}} behavioral problems. For children who have developmental problems, the behavioral problems and the <b>bedwetting</b> are frequently part of/caused by the developmental issues. For <b>bedwetting</b> children without other developmental issues, these behavioral issues can result from self-esteem issues and stress caused by the wetting.|$|E
25|$|Neurological-developmental delay This is {{the most}} common cause of <b>bedwetting.</b> Most <b>bedwetting</b> {{children}} are simply delayed in developing the ability to stay dry and have no other developmental issues. Studies suggest that <b>bedwetting</b> may be due to a nervous system that is slow to process the feeling of a full bladder.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{literature}} states, {{and studies}} show, that punishing or shaming {{a child for}} <b>bedwetting</b> will frequently make the situation worse. Doctors describe a downward cycle where a child punished for <b>bedwetting</b> feels shame {{and a loss of}} self-confidence. This can cause increased <b>bedwetting</b> incidents, leading to more punishment and shaming.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Andrew <b>Bedwetter</b> (voiced by Jeff Bennett) - A Broadway {{director}} that The Mask made enemies {{with when}} Andrew made a play adaption of Super Monkey.

While Andrew was preparing his next play against The Mask, his two employees were secretly robbing banks to obtain money to fund it. While in a giant robotic gorilla, he did a musical battle against The Mask and was defeated. After learning what his employees did, Andrew <b>Bedwetter</b> is then arrested by Lt. Kellaway.

25|$|Genetics <b>Bedwetting</b> has {{a strong}} genetic component. Children whose parents were not enuretic have only a 15% {{incidence}} of <b>bedwetting.</b> When one or both parents were bedwetters, the rates jump to 44% and 77% respectively. Genetic research shows that <b>bedwetting</b> {{is associated with the}} genes on chromosomes 13q and 12q (possibly 5 and 22 also).|$|E

50|$|The band {{formed as}} a solo side-project for Dallas {{musician}} John Dufilho, who sent in a demo tape to the 1999 SXSW performance; he recruited friends from other local Dallas bands in order to perform. Originally from San Antonio, John Dufilho and Jason Garner played together in a band called Thirteen (with Chris Smart and Chris Brinkley) and together as a 3 piece fuzz pop outfit called <b>Bedwetter</b> (with Colin Jones from Big Drag).

25|$|Most <b>bedwetting</b> is a {{developmental}} delayâ€”not an emotional problem or physical illness. Only {{a small percentage}} (5% to 10%) of <b>bedwetting</b> cases are caused by specific medical situations. <b>Bedwetting</b> is frequently associated with {{a family history of}} the condition. Nocturnal enuresis is considered primary (PNE) when a child has not yet had a prolonged period of being dry. Secondary nocturnal enuresis (SNE) is when a child or adult begins wetting again after having stayed dry.|$|E
25|$|These {{first two}} items {{are the most}} common factors in <b>bedwetting,</b> but current medical {{technology}} offers no easy testing for either cause. There is no test to prove that <b>bedwetting</b> is only a developmental delay, and genetic testing offers little or no benefit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bedwetting</b> is {{the most}} common {{childhood}} complaint. Most girls stay dry by age six and most boys stay dry by age seven. By ten years old, 95% of children are dry at night. Studies place adult <b>bedwetting</b> rates at between 0.5% and 2.3%.|$|E

5000|$|The Boys {{released}} a second album on NEMS, titled Alternative Chartbusters, and toured {{in support of}} it with the Ramones. The Boys then signed with Safari in 1979, and two albums and five singles followed before the band broke up {{in the summer of}} 1981. Each Christmas, the group rearranged the [...] "B" [...] and the [...] "Y" [...] in their name and became The Yobs, releasing four singles and one album; 1980s Christmas Album. In this incarnation, the band members used the pseudonyms Noddy Oldfield, Ebenezer Polak, Kid Vicious and H. J. <b>Bedwetter.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some researchers, however, {{recommend}} a different starting age range. This guidance says that <b>bedwetting</b> {{can be considered}} a clinical problem if the child regularly wets the bed after turning seven years old. D'Alessandro refines this to <b>bedwetting</b> more than twice a month after six years old for girls and seven years old for boys.|$|E
25|$|Studies of <b>bedwetting</b> {{in adults}} have found varying rates. The most quoted study {{in this area}} {{was done in the}} Netherlands. It found a 0.5% rate for 18- to 64-year-olds. A Hong Kong study, however, found a much higher rate. The Hong Kong {{researchers}} found a <b>bedwetting</b> rate of 2.3% in 16- to 40-year-olds.|$|E
25|$|Primary nocturnal {{enuresis}} (PNE) is {{the most}} common form of <b>bedwetting.</b> <b>Bedwetting</b> counts as a disorder once a child is old enough to stay dry, but continues either to average at least two wet nights a week with no long periods of dryness or to not sleep dry without being taken to the toilet by another person.|$|E
5000|$|Abbott {{was born}} at Camp Skeel in Oscoda, Michigan, to an Irish-American soldier and a Chinese prostitute. According to his book, In the Belly of the Beast (1981), {{he claimed to have}} {{been in and out of}} foster care from the moment of his birth until the age of nine, at which point he started [...] "serving long stints in {{juvenile}} detention quarters". As a child, Abbott was in trouble with teachers and later with the law, and by the age of 16 was sent to a long-term reform institution, the Utah State Industrial School. According to Abbott, his mistreatment by the school guards left him scarred for life. He also became a chronic <b>bedwetter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bilancia {{was born}} in Potenza, Basilicata, in 1951. When he was about five years old, {{his family moved to}} {{northern}} Italy, first to Piedmont and then to Genoa in the Liguria region. [...] He was a chronic <b>bedwetter</b> until age 10 or 12, and his mother shamed him by placing his wet mattress on the balcony where it could be seen by the neighbors. When undressing him for bed, his aunt would shame him by pulling down his underwear in front of his cousins to show his underdeveloped penis. [...] At age 14, he decided to start calling himself Walter. He {{dropped out of high school}} and worked at jobs such as mechanic, bartender, baker and delivery boy.|$|R
50|$|Eight-year-old Marco Marinelli is a <b>bedwetter,</b> scolded by {{his mother}} (Ottavia Piccolo) and teased by his classmates. On his {{birthday}} he finds out that his father (Alessandro Haber), who is facing economic difficulties, hasn't brought him the Lego he was promised. He runs in tears {{to his room and}} puts all his heart into wishing he were big and not subject to these indignities. As a result, he bursts through his clothes {{in the guise of a}} forty-year-old man (Renato Pozzetto) and seeks refuge in the house of his schoolteacher (Giulia Boschi), who he's secretly in love with. Mentally, he is still eight years old, and it's a puzzle what to do with him, until someone discovers that he has an uncanny rapport with children. Then he becomes a full-time and highly requested babysitter, but shortly after he is suspected of abducting the by-now long-missing child Marco. He then runs out of money, and fakes the kidnapping of himself, but while chased by the police he eventually turns back into the eight-year-old boy.|$|R
25|$|Treatments {{range from}} behavioral-based options such as <b>bedwetting</b> alarms, to {{medication}} such as hormone replacement, and even surgery such as urethral enlargement. Since most <b>bedwetting</b> {{is simply a}} developmental delay, most treatment plans aim to protect or improve self-esteem. Treatment guidelines recommend that the physician counsel the parents, warning about psychological damage caused by pressure, shaming, or punishment for a condition children cannot control.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bedwetting</b> alarms: Physicians also {{frequently}} suggest <b>bedwetting</b> alarms which sound a loud tone when they sense moisture. This can help condition {{the child to}} wake at the sensation of a full bladder. These alarms are considered effective, with study participants being 13 {{times more likely to}} become dry at night. There is a 29% to 69% relapse rate, however, so the treatment may need to be repeated.|$|E
25|$|Thorough history {{regarding}} {{frequency of}} <b>bedwetting,</b> any period of dryness in between, associated daytime symptoms, constipation, and encopresis should be sought.|$|E
5000|$|Channel Surfer (voiced by Gary Owens) - A madman who glides {{using his}} {{surfboard}} and travels by teleporting through televisions {{as well as}} manipulation of electricity and whatever is in the television. He was once a man named Raymond Neilsen who went insane after his favorite TV show Pointy Peaks (a parody of Twin Peaks) was canceled due to complaints from viewers. Upon getting into a fit, his TVs fell on him and he emerged from the TV pile as Channel Surfer. He had all of Edge City watch the TV shows he liked {{and he was able}} to trap Stanley (wearing the mask) inside the television. He held a challenge for The Mask by mind-controlling the people of Edge City and ended up trapping The Mask in the TV World. Peggy managed to place The Mask in a live broadcast of Channel Surfer's show. The Mask then sucks Channel Surfer into a satellite and shoots him into outer space, although Channel Surfer vows [...] "I will return - same time, same channel!". He makes a cameo appearance in the episode [...] "Broadway Malady" [...] auditioning for a musical with villain Sir Andrew <b>Bedwetter</b> and then joins him in prison which indicates he may have returned. He is obviously a spoof of Silver Surfer, and may have been inspired by the Couch Potato, a villain with television-based powers that The Mask encountered in the Dark Horse Comics series.|$|R
5000|$|Kablamus (voiced by Jim Cummings in a {{homage to}} Sterling Holloway) - Joe Blow is a green-haired {{man who was}} experimenting on a balloon {{that would be the}} {{greatest}} balloon ever that won't break. Unfortunately, the balloon overinflated and caused him to fall into the chemicals in his factory. As a result, he gained the power to blow himself up like a balloon and explode without dying (the chemicals he fell into made him unbreakable) and then returning to normal size. His costume consists of a blue leotard, orange pants, black gloves, boots, and a belt with grenades.When he inflates, he sounds exactly like a balloon inflating. He has a special pouch in his costume where he puts different grenades that explode with him. Every time he inflates, he's getting bigger, so when he used the Plutonium primer, he could inflate himself {{to the size of a}} skyscraper. Kablamus also can use his power to inflate only parts of his body, like his feet, in order to jump very high. Stanley as The Mask had a hard time in his first encounter with him due to following a reverse psychology written by Dr. Neumann disrupting his powers. Also, Kablamus was successful at reading Dr. Neumann's book and even invaded his office. The Mask managed to defeat him by replacing his Plutonium Primer grenade with a Popcorn Primer grenade. He, then inflates, giving the Mask the opportunity to install a valve, which deflates him. Kablamus returned, angry at the city for not making him Grand Marshal. He makes deadly balloons and hypnotizes the Mask to help him, but the effects wore off and the Mask ignited him and his deadly balloons resulting in him exploding. Kablamus makes a cameo appearance in the episode [...] "Broadway Malady" [...] auditioning for a musical with villain Sir Andrew <b>Bedwetter</b> and then joins him in prison.|$|R
25|$|The medical {{name for}} <b>bedwetting</b> is nocturnal enuresis. The {{condition}} {{is divided into}} 2 types: primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) and secondary nocturnal enuresis.|$|E
