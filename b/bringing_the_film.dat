500|$|Fincher and Savides {{used the}} {{photographs}} of William Eggleston, Stephen Shore's work from the early Seventies, and actual photos from the Zodiac police files. The two men worked hard to capture {{the look and feel}} of the period as Fincher admitted, [...] "I suppose there could have been more VW bugs but I think what we show is a pretty good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle was built in the old post office in the Terminal Annex Building in downtown Los Angeles. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. Production began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> in under budget, wrapping in February 2006.

500|$|Robert Florey and Slavko Vorkapić, who met after Florey {{attended}} one of Vorkapić's American Society of Cinematographers lectures, {{are credited}} as co-writers and co-directors of The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra. Accounts differ {{as to the}} level of involvement the two men had {{in the creation of the}} film, but most identify Florey as primarily responsible. Film historian Brian Taves has claimed Vorkapić was not involved in the writing or direction of the film, and that his contribution was limited to set design and miniature lighting, but that Florey nevertheless insisted on sharing equal credit with him for his role in <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> to fruition. Some early journalistic stories about the film uphold this viewpoint, including a 1928 article about Florey in Hollywood Magazine. Taves further claims that while Vorkapić did nothing to promote the film when it was first released, he later exaggerated his role in the production of the film when it became so esteemed. Paul Ivano, who did camerawork on the film, echoed these sentiments, saying: [...] "Vorkapić tries to get credit, but he didn't do much." [...] For his part, Vorkapić himself has said the initial idea was Florey's, and that they discussed it and drafted a rough one-page synopsis together. But Vorkapić said [...] "all the effects were devised, designed, photographed, and added by me", and that [...] "at least 90 percent of the editing and montage" [...] was his work. He claims to have directed most of the opening and ending sequences himself, while he credits Florey with filming the casting scene and shots of laughing extras, and said the rise of Voya George's character to stardom was filmed jointly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{same year}} the fledgling film writer and {{director}} Mel Brooks pitched his project, Springtime for Hitler to Glazier, having previously made numerous unsuccessful attempts to interest movie producers. [...] Over lunch in Glazier's office, Brooks acted out all the parts and began singing Springtime for Hitler. Glazier {{reported that he had}} never laughed so hard in his life. [...] "He spit out his coffee and tuna sandwich and couldn't stop laughing," [...] recalled Brooks. [...] "He said [...] "I vow to get this movie made. The world must see this picture."" [...] Glazier struggled at first to interest movie studios in the show business satire, but with perseverance Joseph E. Levine at Avco Embassy accepted the project and agreed to let Brooks direct the movie. [...] Filming was not without its challenges. Brooks was an anxious, perfectionist and difficult novice director, who had problems communicating with the actors. [...] Zero Mostel was also often angry and demanding, and Glazier had to mediate between the director, Mostel and others.

5000|$|Upperstall's {{reviewer}} Karan Bali wrote, [...] "As with Bahar {{and many}} of her early films, it is Vyjayanthimala's dances that are the film's saving graces although it is unintentionally funny now to see how deliberate and obviously tacky the sequences are which lead into her dances ... Ladki too makes no real demands on 'feminist' tomboy Vyjayanthimala histrionically ... Kishore Kumar are strictly supportive appendages at best ... Kishore Kumar does what he can, <b>bringing</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> to life with his lively antics whenever he is on screen. One sees his potential for zany comedy that {{would go on to}} flower fully in films like Aasha (1957), Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958) and Half Ticket (1962)".|$|E

The distributor encountered problems finding theaters willing to show the X rated version of the film. The film ended up making a profit in San Francisco, but was largely unsuccessful in other towns. Much of its success was credited to International Harmony's ad campaign created by writer Edwin Heaven who used the film's disadvantage (rated X) to its marketing advantage; radio ads and giant posters plastered all over San Francisco proclaimed: [...] "YOU'RE GOING TO LAUGH YOUR X OFF!" ...|$|E

In 2016 Ebersole/Hughes became artists in residence at Leeds Beckett University.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{decision}} to <b>film</b> on location <b>brings</b> <b>the</b> <b>film</b> {{a life and}} immediacy all too absent from most <b>films</b> of <b>the</b> period. <b>The</b> <b>film</b> provides us with a snapshot {{of life in a}} seaside resort in the 1930s.
