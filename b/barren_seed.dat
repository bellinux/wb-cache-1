60|$|Amongst {{the many}} young men in England who are seeking along with me to {{continue}} and to perfect the English Renaissance--jeunes guerriers du drapeau romantique, as Gautier would have called us--there is none whose love of art is more flawless and fervent, whose artistic sense of beauty is more subtle and more delicate--none, indeed, who is dearer to myself--than the young poet whose verses I have brought with me to America; verses full of sweet sadness, and yet full of joy; for the most joyous poet is not he who sows the desolate highways of this world with the <b>barren</b> <b>seed</b> of laughter, but he who makes his sorrow most musical, this indeed being the meaning of joy in art--that incommunicable element of artistic delight which, in poetry, for instance, comes from what Keats called the 'sensuous life of verse,' the element of song in the singing, made so pleasurable to us by that wonder of motion which often has its origin in mere musical impulse, and in painting is to be sought for, from the subject never, but from the pictorial charm only--the scheme and symphony of the colour, the satisfying beauty of the design: so that the ultimate expression of our artistic movement in painting has been, not in the spiritual visions of the Pre-Raphaelites, for all their marvel of Greek legend and their mystery of Italian song, but {{in the work of}} such men as Whistler and Albert Moore, who have raised design and colour to the ideal level of poetry and music. For the quality of their exquisite painting comes from the mere inventive and creative handling of line and colour, from a certain form and choice of beautiful workmanship, which, rejecting all literary reminiscence and all metaphysical idea, is in itself entirely satisfying to the aesthetic sense--is, as the Greeks would say, an end in itself; the effect of their work being like the effect given to us by music; for music is the art in which form and matter are always one--the art whose subject cannot be separated from the method of its expression; the art which most completely realises for us the artistic ideal, and is the condition to which all the other arts are constantly aspiring.|$|E

60|$|And {{then he went}} away. She saw him and Nina for {{the last}} time on that morning when Babalatchi, while visiting his fish baskets, had his suspicions of the white man's daughter's love affair with Dain {{confirmed}} beyond the shadow of doubt. Dain disappeared, and Taminah's heart, where lay useless and <b>barren</b> the <b>seeds</b> of all love and of all hate, the possibilities of all passions and of all sacrifices, forgot its joys and its sufferings when deprived of the help of the senses. Her half-formed, savage mind, the slave of her body--as her body was the slave of another's will--forgot the faint and vague image of the ideal that had found its beginning in the physical promptings of her savage nature. She dropped back into the torpor of her former life and found consolation--even a certain kind of happiness--in the thought that now Nina and Dain were separated, probably for ever. He would forget. This thought soothed the last pangs of dying jealousy that had nothing now to feed upon, and Taminah found peace. It was like the dreary tranquillity of a desert, where there is peace only because there is no life.|$|R
40|$|Bromus sterilis L. (barren brome) spreads {{rapidly in}} many European regions. In the Czech Republic, its {{importance}} {{has increased dramatically}} over the past 10 years. Barren brome is reported as a problem weed in winter crops such as winter wheat, winter barley and oil seed rape, in vineyards and in other cultivated places. Barren brome has been becoming troublesome weed of winter cereals mainly in reduced soil tillage systems. The factors, that are important for its spreading and adaptability under different environmental conditions, are dormancy and germination. Optimal timing for seed germination varies with respect to natural conditions and it is determining for plant development. These traits are adapted to different conditions and habitats; therefore the dormancy and germination response patterns to those conditions vary significantly. Recently {{there are not many}} information available on germination behaviour, therefore this study was focused on <b>seeds</b> of <b>barren</b> brome and its characteristics, which were collected in different regions of the Czech Republic. Seeds were investigated under different temperatures, light regimes and water stress {{in a wide range of}} conditions. The following characteristics of seeds were studied the dormancy, the dynamics of germination, the temperature optimum, the age of seeds and dynamics of emergence from different depths and persistence in the soil profile under field conditions. Dormancy and germination are influenced by external conditions. The dormancy of <b>seeds</b> <b>barren</b> brome is very short or missing. The germination is influenced by light; the seeds germinated better under darkness than under light regime. The primary dormancy of B. sterilis was short and the seeds needed only three weeks for after-ripening. The seeds of B. sterilis showed broad ecological valence to hydrothermal factors germinating in the wide range of 3 to 35 째C. The temperature optimum is 5 - 23 째C. The germination was only slightly influenced in an environment with low water potential. Germination was limited under water stress only at lower temperatures under 10 째C. The response to light at various temperatures showed that seeds germinated better in darkness in all temperatures regimes, than in alternating light regime, especially at lower temperatures. The emergence declined significantly with burial depth (under 40 mm). The seeds were not able to survive in the soil seed bank for a longer time and fall seeds lost viability after 1 year burial in soil profile. These results may be of value for development of predictive models and understanding period when weed control may be most feasible...|$|R
