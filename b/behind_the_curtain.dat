5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> {{at the end}} of the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{identifiable}} periods of medieval activity at Buckton Castle: the initial construction phase, {{which resulted in}} the creation of the ditch and the building of the curtain wall and gatehouse; the re-cutting of the ditch and further building work <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> wall; and finally deliberate demolition (slighting). The castle is first mentioned in 1360, and little datable material has been recovered from the site four sherds of Pennine Gritty Ware broadly dated to the late 12th century.|$|E
25|$|However, Dr. Coppelius did not expel all the girls: Swanhilda {{is still}} there, {{hidden behind a}} curtain. She dresses up in Coppélia's clothes and pretends that the doll has come to life.

Dr. Coppelius becomes confused and then saddened when he finds a lifeless Coppélia <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain.</b>|$|E

25|$|The play {{proceeded}} {{without incident}} until the intermission between {{the fourth and}} fifth act, which occurred shortly after 11pm. During this time, the drop curtain was down, hiding the stage, and the orchestra was playing for the intermission. Some attendees in the parquet circle heard what sounded like a brawl <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain,</b> shouting by men, and the working of machinery; they could easily hear it above the playing of the orchestra.|$|E
25|$|<b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain,</b> {{the actors}} were taking their {{positions}} {{in a box}} set representing an old boathouse {{on the bank of}} the Seine. This was constructed of painted canvas on a flimsy wooden frame and mainly blocked the backstage and flies from view. Kate Claxton, playing Louise, the blind orphan girl, along with actors J. B. Studley and H. S. Murdoch, had taken their places on stage within the box set and were waiting for the curtain to rise. Claxton was lying on a pallet of straw, looking up. Actors Mary Ann Farren and Claude Burroughs were waiting in the wings for their entry cues.|$|E
25|$|Juvenal's {{account of}} her nights spent in the brothel is {{commonly}} portrayed. Gustave Moreau paints her leading another man onto the bed while an exhausted prostitute sleeps in the background, while in Paul Rouffio's painting of 1875 she reclines bare-breasted as a slave offers grapes. The Dane Peder Severin Krøyer depicts her standing, her full body apparent under the thin material of her dress. The ranks of her customers are just visible <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> against which she stands (see above). Two drawings by Aubrey Beardsley were produced for a private printing of Juvenal's satires (1897). The one titled Messalina and her companion shows her {{on the way to}} the brothel, while a rejected drawing is usually titled Messalina returning from the bath.|$|E

25|$|However WWF owner Vince McMahon {{seemed to}} lose {{interest}} {{in the idea of}} pushing the team. This may have been due, in part, to the fact that Powers and Roma did not get along with each other <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain.</b> In later interviews, Roma called Powers difficult to work with. The Stallions lost house show matches to The Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond) in May, then dropped multiple encounters to The Bolsheviks the following month. Roma & Powers even lost to The Conquistadors on a house show in Warwick, Rhode Island on July 3, {{and by the end of}} the summer had lost all momentum, losing multiple encounters to The Killer Bees. The team that had shocked the world less than a year earlier was now devoid of a push, and was fodder for the Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard) in the fall. A year after winning the inaugural Survivor Series, The Young Stallions found themselves the second team eliminated in the 1988 event.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1998, Braathens had a one-class service; {{the service}} {{included}} a complimentary in-flight meal and discounted tickets were available with restrictions. Starting 23 March 1998, the airline changed its corporate identify to 'Braathens' and introduced a two-class system onboard its planes. Passengers paying full price were {{seated in the}} 'Best' category {{at the front of}} the plane, making up about 70 percent of the capacity. Best customers received complimentary coffee and meals with non-disposable cutlery, free newspapers and a better seat pitch. <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> was the 'Back' category, which had no in-flight meals or newspapers and a smaller pitch. However, a meal with coffee and soft drink could be purchased for NOK45. Back tickets were sold with a discount, but had to be bought at least seven days before travel, and the traveller had to be away over a weekend. There were also some discounted Best tickets, but these never cost as little as the Back tickets.|$|E
25|$|The second {{portion of}} the show, called the olio, was {{historically}} the last to evolve, as its real purpose was {{to allow for the}} setting of the stage for act three <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain.</b> It had more of a variety show structure. Performers danced, played instruments, did acrobatics, and demonstrated other amusing talents. Troupes offered parodies of European-style entertainments, and European troupes themselves sometimes performed. The highlight was when one actor, typically one of the endmen, delivered a faux-black-dialect stump speech, a long oration about anything from nonsense to science, society, or politics, during which the dim-witted character tried to speak eloquently, only to deliver countless malapropisms, jokes, and unintentional puns. All the while, the speaker moved about like a clown, standing on his head and almost always falling off his stump at some point. With blackface makeup serving as fool's mask, these stump speakers could deliver biting social criticism without offending the audience, although the focus was usually on sending up unpopular issues and making fun of blacks' ability to make sense of them. Many troupes employed a stump specialist with a trademark style and material.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production {{opened at}} the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. [...] The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. [...] One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. [...] The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. [...] Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain.</b> [...] Sedated with morphine, he could see {{only part of the}} stage. [...] As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. [...] It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause. [...] Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow. [...] Rodgers' daughter Mary caught sight of her friend, Stephen Sondheim, both teenagers then, across several rows; both had eyes wet with tears.|$|E

Instead, a more worldly Madge struggles {{to become a}} less sound-bite-reliant, more sincere person." [...] Darryl Sterdan from Jam! gave it three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it still sucks to sit through all that video and see almost as much of her limo as her show... For a start, how about giving us a [...] that isn't derivative and self-indulgent?" [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website opined that I'm Going to Tell You a Secret would find a divided audience and how one reacted to the documentary was a reflection of how one viewed Madonna. [...] "Fans like me {{will be able to}} essentially ignore the self-serving moments and enjoy the tour elements. We'll also like the glimpse <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> at Madonna on the road," [...] he added. This view was shared by a reviewer from Lexington Herald-Leader who confessed that he did not enjoy the documentary except the live performances, since he saw Madonna only as an [...] "entertainer" [...] and not as a [...] "preacher".|$|E
500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>curtain</b> ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E
