5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers,</b> who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

500|$|The ancient Egyptian model {{letters and}} epistles are grouped {{into a single}} {{literary}} genre. Papyrus rolls sealed with mud stamps were used for long-distance letters, while ostraca were frequently used to write shorter, non-confidential letters sent to recipients located nearby. Letters of royal or official correspondence, originally written in hieratic, were sometimes given the exalted status of being inscribed on stone in hieroglyphs. The various texts written by schoolboys on wooden writing boards include model letters. Private letters {{could be used as}} epistolary model letters for schoolboys to copy, including letters written <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> or their families.

2500|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} {{has been described}} as [...] "the worst substantial human rights violation in Benin". About 13 percent of women and girls have been subjected to it (over 70 percent in some regions and tribes), but the law against it is rarely enforced. Prostitution, especially child prostitution, is also common, with the clients often being sex tourists. Sexual harassment is also common, with many female students being abused <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers.</b> [...] Although it is a criminal offense punishable by up to two years in prison, enforcement is slack. Local customs which are unfavorable to women no longer have the force of law in Benin, where women enjoy equal rights under the constitution, including in matters related to marriage and inheritance. Still, they experience a great deal of social and employment discrimination owing to traditional attitudes about sex roles, and have a much harder time obtaining credit and when widowed do {{not have the right to}} manage their own property. Women in rural areas play subordinate roles and do a great deal of hard labor.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} hostings of Serbian children recorded in the media dates to late 1995 when 50 Bosnian Serb children from Zvornik spent Christmas and New Year's with Greek families. [...] Another 50 Bosnian Serb children from the same town arrived in Thessaloniki on 10 January 1996 for a two-week vacation with families in Kavala and Imathia. In July 1998, a total of 540 orphans and children of refugees from Republika Srpska and Serbia left for Greece and were hosted over the summer by various municipalities and communities in the country. It was the fourth hosting mission that had been organized by the Central Union of Municipalities and Communities of Greece {{in cooperation with the}} Red Cross that year. In total, the Central Union of Municipalities and Communities of Greece had been responsible for hosting more than 2,000 Serbian children by that point. [...] Greek Ambassador to Belgrade Panayiotis Vlassopoulos stated that hospitality for these children in Greece constituted only a portion of the humanitarian aid which Greek local governments and organizations have been providing for Yugoslavia since war erupted. He added that these initiatives contribute to the strengthening of Greek–Serbian relations. In 1999, the Yugoslav Red Cross and a Greek-Serb friendship society organized the hosting of {{children between the ages of}} 8 and 12 by families in Kavala for a nine-month period. The children were accompanied <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers</b> so that they'd be able to keep up with their studies.

2500|$|Bassoon reeds, made of Arundo donax cane, {{are often}} {{made by the}} players themselves, {{although}} beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers.</b> Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and gouged to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or profiled, by removing material from the bark side. This {{can be done by}} hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel mandrel (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the [...] "throat," [...] and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.|$|E
2500|$|Queen Alexandra, the king's widow, {{agreed that}} the {{building}} should be renamed [...] "The King Edward VII Memorial Hall". The previous 1904 opening had been a comparatively small affair because no VIP guest could be permitted to overshadow the donor, Mr Dence. However, because the 1913 phase was built on a government loan {{and there was no}} donor to thank, this Opening Day could a big event, involving the late king's sister and the whole town. It took five sizeable committees to organise everything: the General Committee which included the Funds Committee, the Luncheon and Reception Committee, the Decorations Committee (including the builder and architect of the Hall), the Publicity Committee and the Children's Committee (including local priests and teachers). The Hall was opened on 10 July 1913 by Princess Beatrice, sister of the late king, then titled Princess Henry of Battenburg. All public premises, private business and private houses along the route were decorated:There was a series of triumphal arches at various points along the route, and a series of Venetian masts, entwined with various coloured cloth with evergreen at the base. From the tops of these, streamers of flags crossed the streets, and the effect altogether was very pleasing. The most notable arches were those outside the Town Hall and on the East Cliff {{at the north end of}} Beacon Road; while those at the corner of Station Road and High Street, at the corner of William Street and Mortimer Street attracted a great deal of attention. These were Venetian masts, and on the red bunting forming the cross pieces were appropriate mottoes in white lettering. [...] The Fire Brigade arch on the sea front formed of the two escapes, with the steam and manual engines at the base, and ornamented with the hose, jets and flags and canvas buckets was much admired. When the Princess passed the members of the Fire Brigade stood on the escapes.The Princess had made a special request for local children to be involved in the ceremony. The schoolchildren of Herne Bay, Herne and Reculver, aged five to fourteen years, were assembled at their Council schools at two o'clock where they were each presented with a flag and a souvenir bronze medallion. The front of the medallion bore a representation of the medallion plaque of Edward VII in the Hall. The obverse said, [...] "King Edward VII Memorial Hall, Herne Bay. Formally opened by Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Battenburg, Thursday July 10th AD 1913." [...] The medal had a red, white and blue ribbon designed to be worn around the neck. Carrying flags and accompanied <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>teachers,</b> the Girl Guides and the 1st Herne Bay Troop of Boy Scouts with their bugle band, they marched to the Downs where in due course they were presented to the Princess.|$|E
