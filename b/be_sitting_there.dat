500|$|Additionally, Paul Bettany was {{the first}} actor to portray two main {{characters}} within the universe, voicing Tony Stark's artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. in the Iron Man and Avengers films, and portraying Vision in Avengers films and Captain America: Civil War. Stan Lee, creator or co-creator {{of many of the}} characters seen in the MCU, has cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series. In Iron Fist, it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush. His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers, discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in Captain America: Civil War. This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos, with writer and director James Gunn noting that [...] "people thought Stan Lee is [...] and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU." [...] Feige added that Lee [...] "clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians...really says, so wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?" ...|$|E

Chief Joseph Flynn of the Long Island Rail Road police said, [...] "This was the work of a deranged, maniacal person who {{for a variety of reasons}} decided to explode." [...] None of Ferguson's victims were black, although it was unclear whether any other black passengers were aboard the train. Ferguson showed no emotion as he sat in the back of a police car, which some passengers said was as shocking and disturbing as the violence of the shooting itself. Upon seeing Ferguson, one of the victims became hysterical and shouted, [...] "How can he <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> so calm after everything he did?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Forty years later, Holloway's son was {{responsible}} for interviewing the eminent lawyers, businessmen, and government officials who applied {{for membership in the}} exclusive Metropolitan Club of the City of Washington between 1988 and 1992. [...] "I was truly amazed at the number of these prospective members who asked if I were any relation to the admiral who founded the Holloway Plan," [...] recalled the younger Holloway, by then a famous admiral in his own right. [...] "When I answered yes, they would tell me that they wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> today if it weren't for the Holloway Plan....It had put them through collegeschools like Princeton, Duke University, Caltech, and Stanford. After the Korean War and Vietnam, the opportunities were so great on the outside that many of them left the service and became quite successful in their civilian careers." ...|$|E

[...] Lee filmed several different versions of the scene, including an alternative where he references his role in Deadpool, which would have been the first acknowledgment of the X-Men film series by an MCU film. Gunn later admitted that the Civil War reference is a continuity error, given Vol. 2 is set before the events of Civil War, saying, [...] "I screwed up; I wasn't thinking. But I'm going to say that probably Stan Lee used the guise of a Fed Ex guy more than one time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I had a sort {{of theory}} one could. Our life was so {{pleasant}} that it seemed a shame to break the spell, and if no one had moved I am sure we might <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank the Lord, it's all right!" [...] thought Dick, as, peeping in at {{the window}} ten minutes later, be saw Dolly enthroned upon Mr. Bopp's knee, both her hands in his, and an {{expression}} in her April countenance which proved that she found it natural and pleasant to <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> with {{her head on the}} kind heart that loved her; to hear herself called [...] "meine leibchen;" [...] to know that she alone could comfort him for little Ulla's loss, and fill her empty place.|$|E

6000|$|Now {{when he came}} to the dun, he saw {{children}} playing by the gate where the King had met him in the old days; and this stayed his pleasure, for he thought in his heart, [...] "It is here my children should be playing". And when he came into the hall, there was his brother on the high seat and the maid beside him; and at that his anger rose, for he thought in his heart, [...] "It is I that should <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> and the maid beside me".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] and {{the soldier}} watched him curiously. [...] "Any way, {{they were sure}} of his horse, and it was Winston's rifle.

6000|$|... "I {{sat there}} looking {{out toward the}} {{mountains}} {{and down on the}} camp. The blasts were booming from all hills--the men were going home with their dinner-pails flashing red in the setting sun's light. It was terrible to think of them going home to supper. It seemed impossible that I should <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> starving, and the grass so green, the sunset so beautiful. I can see it all now as it looked then, the old Sangre de Christo range! It was like a wall of glistening marble that night.|$|E

6000|$|Often in {{the mornings}} {{he would go to}} the Mirabell Garden to smoke his cigar; there, in stolid contemplation of the statues--rows of half-heroic men {{carrying}} off half-distressful females--he would spend an hour pleasantly, his hat tilted to keep the sun off his nose. The day after Rozsi had fled from him on the stairs, he came there as usual. It was a morning of blue sky and sunlight glowing on the old prim garden, on its yew-trees, and serio-comic statues, and walls covered with apricots and plums. When Swithin approached his usual seat, who should <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> but Rozsi--"Good-morning," [...] he stammered; [...] "you knew this was my seat then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} do {{for you to be}} always dressed as an apprentice. Osgod will procure for you such clothes as you may require for disguises.

You {{understand}} that you will have to follow him, to mark where he goes in, and especially, should he be joined by anybody when out, to endeavour to overhear something of what they say to each other. Even a few words might suffice to show me whether my suspicions are true or not. Do you think you can do that? Osgod tells me that you are good at playing a part." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went down}} to supper. After sitting a long time {{listening}} to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig, confined {{to the north of}} the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head.|$|E

60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. Lady Olive {{was half}} {{inclined}} to wonder why, having possessed himself of her hand, he made {{none of the other}} overtures which she had always understood were usual. Deane, however, was in no humor for love-making. She had represented to him, only a few days ago, a part of his future life which was altogether inevitable, and which he could easily come to find pleasant enough, but just now {{there seemed to be a}} barrier between them. Notwithstanding Lord Nunneley's kindness, and his wife's approval, he knew very well that it was not only Stirling Deane who had been accepted as a suitor. It was the millionaire, the man of great affairs, the man of untarnished reputation. Dick Sinclair's threats were still ringing in his ears. He somehow felt that he was not even playing the game to <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> holding the hand of this most exclusive young lady.|$|E
60|$|There {{was real}} passion in his voice, {{and in spite}} of myself I was impressed. I seemed to feel in him some vehement power that was {{struggling}} within him; it gave me the sensation of something very strong, overmastering, that held him, as it were, against his will. I could not understand. He seemed really to be possessed of a devil, and I felt that it might suddenly turn and rend him. Yet he looked ordinary enough. My eyes, resting on him curiously, caused him no embarrassment. I wondered what a stranger would have taken him to <b>be,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in his old Norfolk jacket and his unbrushed bowler; his trousers were baggy, his hands were not clean; and his face, with the red stubble of the unshaved chin, the little eyes, and the large, aggressive nose, was uncouth and coarse. His mouth was large, his lips were heavy and sensual. No; I could not have placed him.|$|E
60|$|The mother {{leaned back}} in her chair when Janet was gone, and sank into a painful reverie. When our life is a {{continuous}} trial, the moments of respite seem only to substitute the heaviness of dread for the heaviness of actual suffering: the curtain of cloud seems parted an instant only that we may measure all its horror as it hangs low, black, and imminent, in contrast with the transient brightness; the water drops that visit the parched lips in the desert bear with them only the keen imagination of thirst. Janet looked glad and tender now--but what scene of misery was coming next? She was too like the cistus flowers in the little garden before the window, that, with the shades of evening, might lie with the delicate white and glossy dark of their petals trampled in the roadside dust. When the sun had sunk, and the twilight was deepening, Janet might <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> heated, maddened, sobbing out her griefs with selfish passion, and wildly wishing herself dead.|$|E
60|$|He had not <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> for half-an-hour {{revolving}} {{the painful}} complexities of national life before {{the voice of}} Mrs. Petty recalled him from that sad reverie.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{could do}} nothing of the kind, Captain Clayton," [...] said Edith, who <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there.</b> [...] "It <b>is</b> absurd to hear you talk in such a way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may be as}} {{satisfied}} as {{that you}} <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> that that's 34," [...] said he; [...] "and I hardly know anywhere else that you'll get it." ...|$|R
