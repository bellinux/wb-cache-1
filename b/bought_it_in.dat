5|$|The painting's known {{provenance}} {{begins in}} the 1830s when {{it was in the}} possession of the Radziwiłł family. According to art historian Sulpiz Boisserée, who saw the painting in 1832, Antoni Radziwiłł found the painting in an estate his father owned. Waagen speculated that may have belonged to Mikolai Radziwill (1549–1616) who might have inherited it from his brother Jerzy Radziwill, (1556–1600), who was a cardinal. The family kept it until 1920 when Princess Radziwill sold it to the Duveen Brothers in Paris. Philip Lehman <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> October 1920; it is now held in the Robert Lehman collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.|$|E
5|$|While Union Station {{was busy}} from its opening and through World War II, {{passenger}} rail service began to dwindle {{after the war}} when air and highway travel became more popular. By the 1960s, the New York Central drastically cut service, while the Pennsylvania abandoned service to Erie altogether. Both railroads were merged in 1968 to form Penn Central, and passenger rail was transferred from Penn Central to Amtrak in 1971. At one point, from 1972 to 1975, even Amtrak service in Erie was suspended. With reduced demand for train travel, Union Station was neglected and allowed to decay until Logistics Plus <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 2003. Since then it has been restored, with portions re-purposed as commercial and retail space.|$|E

5|$|Former Idaho Territory Governor {{and former}} U.S. House of Representative Thomas W. Bennett made an {{application}} to the U.S. Army’s Signal Service to establish stations at Boise on February 9, 1876. On May 21, 1877, the application was granted and Sergeant Barnet E. Light was order per S. O. No. 62 to establish a station by July 1877. On June 22, 1877, the station was established {{on the second floor}} of the Overland Hotel on the northwest corner of 8th and Main Street. Weather observations began at the station on July 1st, 1977. The station was moved to a third story addition to the Hotel shortly after Hosea Eastman <b>bought</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1878. The station was moved twice, next door to the Davis building in September 1880 and the Perrault Building on the southeast corner of Capital and Main Streets in January 1888. The weather instruments were on the roof except for the thermometers which were in a window shelter from 1877 to 1885. The thermometers placed in a Cotton region shelter on December 1, 1885. A lack of funding and Chief Signal Officer Adolphus Greely opening of a new station in Baker City, Oregon lead to the closure of the Boise station on June 30, 1890. Greenly felt the Baker City Station would be more valuable than the Boise station which was not supported by his forecasters in Washington. Barnet Light, James Kenealy, Henry Boynton and William Korts were the only four observers during the stations 13 years in Boise.|$|E
