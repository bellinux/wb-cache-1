Especially, male black spotted pond frogs(Rana nigromaculata) seemed to prefer larger insect than expected from their environment food resources, foraged well and gained their body weight during mating periods.

40|$|African clawed frogs of the {{widespread}} polytypic species Xenopus laevis Daudin, 1802 (ranging {{large parts of}} sub-Saharan Africa) have been spreading since the 1940 s, and have established reproductive populations in Europe, Asia and the Americas, where they can have negative impact as competitors of native amphibians and as disease vectors for chytridomycosis or ranaviruses. Here we use two mitochondrial (cytochrome b, 16 S rDNA) and one nuclear (RAG 1 : Recombination Associated Gene 1) DNA markers to infer the potential origin of invasive clawed frogs from Sicily that represent the largest invasive population in Europe. Identical mtDNA haplotypes match with those of Xenopus laevis, and Sicilian clawed frogs very probably belong to a lineage from the Cape Region of South Africa, most likely originating from a laboratory stock. Nuclear data support this conclusion. Identical mtDNA sequences (cyt b, 16 <b>S)</b> of <b>frogs</b> sampled across their range in Sicily suggest the occurrence of a single source population and a potential bottleneck at their release, but faster evolving multilocus nuclear data (microsatellites, SNPs) on the population genetics would be important {{in the future to}} better support this hypothesi...|$|R

The trustees were: Alexander and James Brogden, and Samuel Budgett. For five years from his death the partners were empowered to use the trust money in the business but after {{that they had to}} provide evidence of good assets that were independent of it. They failed to do this so that, from December 1874, all the trustees were in breach of trust and therefore all individually liable to replace all the assets of the trust. No doubt they hoped that the firm would pull through. In fact, Brogdens failed in 1880 and Mary Billing sued the trustees for the money. The action [...] "Billing vs. Brogden" [...] was tried in 1887 and appealed in 1888 with the result that Samuel Budgett, the only solvent trustee, had to replace all the trust's missing money himself.The partnership of James, William and Samuel Budgett, trading as H.H. & <b>S.</b> <b>Budgett,</b> broke up.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of Ca 4 <b>s</b> in <b>frog</b> (Rana pipiens) sartorius muscle, after 4 hours' exposure to Ringer's solution containing radiocalcium, has been analyzed by observing the kinetics of escape of the radioisotope into a non-radioactive Ringer's solution with caldum present or absent and by {{assuming that the}} tendon of Achilles is a satisfactory model {{of the extent of}} the uptake and rdease of Ca 46 by the interstitial connective tissue (c. t.). In a Ringer's solution containing 1 m~/liter calcium, the exchangeable calcium distribution in micromoles per gram wet weight is as follows: (a) Aqueous phase of c. t. space: 0. 16; (b) bound to c. t. : 0. 16; (c) bound to surface of fibers: 0. 13, of which 0. 03 is displaced only by self-exchange, whereas the rest, as in c. t., can be displaced by other ions; and (d) in myoplasm: 0. 33. The kinetics of Ca 45 exit suggests that in infinite time of exposure to Ca 45 the myoplasmic component would rise to 0. 85. In the muscles, the half-time of the quickly emerging Ca 41 averages about 3 minutes, whereas the time constant of the slowly released component is about 500 minutes.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different divalent cations on the phospholipase-independent inhibition of transmitter release caused by beta-bungarotoxin (beta-BuTx), {{has been investigated}} by measuring the frequency of spontaneous miniature end-plate potentials (m. e. p. p. <b>s)</b> at <b>frog</b> neuromuscular junctions. After adding the toxin to normal calcium Ringer solution the m. e. p. p. frequency fell quickly to very low values. This was followed {{by an increase in}} frequency characterized by bursts of m. e. p. p. s. The temperature had a negligible effect on the speed of the first inhibition. In Ringer solutions where calcium had been substituted by other divalent cations (5 mM) in the presence of ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethylether) N, N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA, 1 mM), this beta-BuTx-induced decrease in m. e. p. p. frequency was markedly slower. The potency of cations in promoting the initial phase of toxin action was in the sequence: calcium greater than magnesium greater than strontium congruent to cobalt greater than manganese. This phospholipase-independent inhibition of transmitter release followed approximately first-order kinetics, suggesting that it depends mainly on toxin concentration. In the absence of any divalent cations in the Ringer solution beta-BuTx had practically no effect on m. e. p. p. frequency. It appears that beta-BuTx requires divalent cations in order to bind to motor nerve terminals and exert its initial inhibitory action on spontaneous release of transmitter quanta...|$|R

D-APV (0. 5 - 10 microM) produced a slight hyperpolarization of the motoneuronal membrane without {{significant changes in}} input conductance. In control and tetrodotoxin-containing solutions the depolarizations induced by NMDA were strongly reduced by D-APV while quisqualate depolarizations were unaffected. Responses to glutamate and aspartate were antagonized to an intermediate level. The relatively small conductance increases evoked by excitatory amino acids were unaltered in solutions containing D-APV. The amplitude of monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (e. p. s. ps) was strongly depressed by D-APV. The amplitude of polysynaptic e. p. s. ps was little changed but their decay time was reduced. It is suggested that D-APV is a powerful and selective NMDA receptor antagonist and that an endogenous amino acid acting via NMDA receptors may be the transmitter of monosynaptic e. p. <b>s.</b> ps on <b>frog</b> motoneurones...|$|R
40|$|Hybridization between {{closely related}} species often leads to reduced {{viability}} or fertility of offspring. Complete failure of hybrid offspring (post-zygotic hybrid incompatibilities) may {{have an important role}} in maintaining the integrity of reproductive barriers between {{closely related species}}. We show elsewhere that in Peron 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> tree <b>frog,</b> Litoria peronii, males more closely related to a female sire more offspring in sperm competition with a less related rival male. Observations of rare 2 ̆ 7 phenotypic intermediate 2 ̆ 7 males between L. peronii and the closely related L. tyleri made us suggest that these relatedness effects on siring success may be because of selection arising from risks of costly hybridization between the two species. Here, we test this hypothesis in an extensive sperm competition experiment, which shows that there is no effect of species identity on probability of fertilization in sperm competition trials controlling for sperm concentration and sperm viability. Instead, there was a close agreement between a male 2 ̆ 7 s siring success in isolation with a female and his siring success with the same female in competition with a rival male regardless of species identity. Offspring viability and survival, however, were strongly influenced by species identity. Over a 14 -day period, hybrid offspring suffered increasing mortality and developed more malformations and an obvious inability to swim and right themselves, leading to compromised probability of survival. Thus, hybridization in these sympatric tree frogs does not compromise fertilization but has a strong impact on offspring viability and opportunity for reinforcement selection on mate choice for conspecific partners. <br /...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{theoretical and empirical}} evidence that genetic compatibility among partners is an important determinant of fertilization success and offspring viability. In amphibians, females often actively choose partners from among a variety of males and polyandry is common. Genetic compatibility among partners may therefore be an important determinant of fertilization success and offspring viability in some amphibians. Amphibians also show {{some of the highest}} levels of genetic differentiation among neighbouring populations known in vertebrates, and as such, populations may have evolved different co-adapted gene complexes. This means that offspring from among-population crosses may have reduced fitness. It is therefore essential to understand to what extent crossings between and within populations may interfere with successful fertilization and offspring viability. Here, we test whether crossing individuals within and between two different populations of the Australian Peron 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> tree <b>frog</b> (Litoria peronii) using artificial fertilizations affect fertilization success and offspring viability. Fertilization success per se is strongly influenced by male identity, which is likely to depend at least to some extent on the experimental procedure (e. g. resulting in variation in sperm number per ejaculate), whereas there was no fertilization effect of female identity. More importantly, male and female identity, independently of each other, explained significant variation in offspring viability, whereas no such effect could be linked to population of origin. Thus, our experiments suggest that crossing populations may not always be the most significant factor affecting fertilization success or offspring viability, but may be more influenced by the genetic quality or the genetic compatibility of partners. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) -based vectors pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) have extensive ability to transduce nonmammalian cells. However, we have identified multiple cell lines from fish (FHM), mosquitoes (Mos- 55), moths (Sf 9 and High- 5), flies (<b>S</b> 2), and <b>frogs</b> (XPK 2) that are not efficiently transduced by MoMLV-based vectors pseudotyped with many different viral envelope proteins, including VSV-G, while the same vectors are functional in these cells following transfection. A comparison of MoMLV-based vector transduction in mammalian and nonmammalian cells shows that the nonmammalian cells exhibit blocks at either entry, reverse transcription, or integration. Additionally, VSV-G-pseudotyped MoMLV-based vector transduction is attenuated in the zebrafish cell line ZF 4 at entry and/or reverse transcription, whereas other transduction processes are unaffected. We show that the variation of transduction by MoMLV-based vectors in mammalian and nonmammalian cells is not due to differences in culture conditions or cell division rate but is likely the result of divergence in cellular factors required for retroviral transduction...|$|R

40|$|Mycobacterium lifl andii {{causes a}} fatal frog disease in captive anurans. Here we report, to our knowledge, the fi rst {{epizootic}} of mycobacteriosis in a European colony of clawed frogs (Silurana tropicalis), previously imported from a United States biologic supply company. Our fi ndings suggest the emerging potential of this infection through international trade. Many species of nontuberculous mycobacteria inhabit the environment. Mycobacterium fortuitum, M. chelonae, M. marinum, and M. xenopi {{are some of}} the mycobacteria that infect amphibians, causing subcutaneous nodules, edema, and chronic wasting (1). The aquatic, pipid frog, Silurana tropicalis, is an emerging laboratory model for genetic and embryologic/ ontogenetic research. Although smaller than the related Xenopus laevis, S. tropicalis has research advantages: diploidy and brief maturation time make this species ideal for genetic analyses over multiple generations (2). In 2004, Trott et al. characterized a new mycobacterial pathogen in pipid frog colonies (3), now named M. liflandii (4). On Middlebrook 7 H 11 agar supplemented with oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and catalase, M. lifl andii form rough, nonpigmented, slightly buff-colored colonies. Visible colonies develop after 30 to 35 days at 28 °C on Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium (3). This M. ulcerans–like mycobacterium produces a plasmid-encoded toxin, mycolactone E, which is less cytopathogenic than mycolactone A/B, produced by African M. ulcerans (4). M. lifl andii infection in frogs manifests as cutaneous lesions, coelomitis, and bloating, with a high death rate (3).

40|$|The {{development}} and specificity of monosynaptic sensory-motor synapses were {{studied in the}} brachial spinal cord of bullfrog tadpoles. Intracellular and extracellular recordings were made from motoneurones innervating several different muscles of the forelimb. Excitatory synaptic potentials (e. p. s. p. s) were elicited by stimulation of various peripheral muscle nerves. Sensory and motor axons in the triceps brachii muscle nerves were electrically excitable at stage XIII, the earliest stage studied. Their conduction velocities were 0. 2 - 0. 4 m/s. These velocities increased during subsequent development so that by stage XXII they were approximately 5 m/s. Before stage XVII, synaptic potentials evoked in motoneurones by stimulation of the triceps sensory fibres had a long central latency and fatigued easily. These potentials were probably mediated polysynaptically. At stage XVII, the first short-latency triceps synaptic potentials appeared. They had central latencies of less than 3 ms and represented the direct, monosynaptic input from muscle sensory cells on to motoneurones. During subsequent development the percentage of triceps motoneurones innervated by triceps sensory fibres increased, {{while the number of}} long-latency polysynaptic inputs decreased. Both the electrical and chemical components, characteristic of these monosynaptic e. p. s. p. <b>s</b> in adult <b>frogs,</b> were prominent from the time the e. p. s. p. s first appeared.

At no time were there appreciable numbers of 'aberrant' connexions. The developmental time course of several different classes of sensory-motor connexions was similar.

40|$|Enigmatic {{amphibian}} declines {{are strongly}} associated with infectious diseases, including chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus 'Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis' (Bd), and ranaviral disease induced by ranaviruses. A series of data analyses, field sampling, laboratory experimentation and molecular techniques were utilized {{to test the hypothesis}} that the international live animal trade is contributing to the spread of these amphibian pathogens. Regions sampled included specific locations in North America, South America and Asia. The magnitude of the live importation of amphibians into the United States (U. S.) was calculated in the millions of animals per year. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and ranavirus infections were identified in live food animals in: (a) U. S. wet markets (in 'Lithobates catesbeianus', the North American bullfrog); (b) frog farms in Taiwan (in 'L. catesbeianus'); and (c) wet markets in Taiwan (in 'Rana tigrina', the Chinese bullfrog). 'Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis' infections were also identified in 'L. catesbeianus' farmed in Brazil and in 8 species of amphibians in the U. S. pet trade (in captive bred and directly imported animals). Detection of Bd in individuals upon initial entry into the U. S. demonstrated definitively the trans-continental movement of this potentially lethal amphibian pathogen. Laboratory experimentation illustrated transmission of Bd from a highly traded carrier host ('L. catesbeianus') to frogs of the same species, and to a known susceptible frog species ('Litoria caerulea', White's tree-frog). Molecular data linked U. <b>S.</b> market <b>frogs</b> and their associated ranaviral infections to origins in Asia and South America. Genotyping of pure, cultured isolates of Bd from farmed 'L. catesbeianus' in Brazil showed that they were most similar to isolates from native amphibians in Latin America when compared to a global dataset, providing evidence for transmission between wild and farmed amphibians. Analysis of isolates from market 'L. catesbeianus' led to the discovery of a novel genotype of Bd in Ypsilanti, Michigan that appeared to have a disparate lineage compared with the previously identified panzootic genotypes. DNA sequence analysis from the Ypsilanti frog indicated its origin in Brazil, where the novel genotype was also discovered in native Brazilian frog populations. The demonstration of amphibian pathogens on frog farms, in live wet markets and at border crossings, the evidence of inter- and intra-species transmission, and the existence of a novel genotype in traded anurans, all indicate that international transport of amphibians and their pathogens could produce not only mixing of pathogen genotypes, but the inadvertent spread of strains of unknown virulence that could negatively impact amphibian health. In 2008, data from research contained in this thesis were instrumental in the decision to list both Bd and ranaviral disease in the World Organization for Animal Health Aquatic Animal Health Code, providing guidelines (such as quarantine procedures) to limit the spread of these pathogens through the trade. The evidence provided in this work re-enforces the need for urgent action to minimize the potential spread of amphibian diseases through international trade routes, for the benefit of amphibian populations throughout the world...|$|R

I 2 ̆ 7 m not against the body or the head either: only the neck, which creates the illusion that they are separate. The language is wrong, it shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t have different words for them. If the head extended into the shoulders like a worm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> or a <b>frog</b> 2 ̆ 7 s without that extension, that lie, they wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t be able to look down at their bodies and move them around as if they were robots or puppets; they would have to realize that if the head is detached from the body both of them will die. ” - Margaret Atwood, Surfacing Except I like a separate head. Language is abstract but the body can ache and wither and rot and die. In terror, language goes and I am keenly aware that I am a mortal thing. With the illusion of separation I can say “send my body to the wolves” only let me – this voice – float free. Really, it would make things so much easier, to not have fear touch my muscles which can writhe. That would leave only the existential dilemmas. But because the head is not separate, language and reason do not leave the body. They lose their form. Words tangle, run in circles, and prove that a once sentient being has been reduced to something speechless. When words dissolve you howl. Except perhaps I envy the things that aren 2 ̆ 7 t reduced to howling, the creatures who have no words to start. Sincerely, Jana. [URL]...|$|R
