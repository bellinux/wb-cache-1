In the meantime, pressure from the British public and media had forced the British Parliament to step up ship building. Kaiser Wilhelm II requested that the <b>build</b> <b>time</b> for the new battlecruisers be reduced to two years each, as opposed to three years. This proved unfeasible, because neither the armor or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule.|$|E

Doing so substantially reduces the cost of program synthesis, product-family <b>build</b> <b>times,</b> and executable sizes.

5|$|In June 2007, {{they shot}} the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The {{location}} {{was chosen for}} its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this <b>build</b> <b>time</b> to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to another {{side of the river}} for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{seen as an}} inferior, but {{cheaper and}} more {{politically}} acceptable alternative to the CRL tunnel, the duplicate eastern approach also gained favour as a stop gap implementation due to the comparatively short <b>build</b> <b>time.</b> Even if planning had commenced immediately, the CRL might not have become operational until several years after the maximum capacity of the existing corridor was reached. Moreover, while seen {{as an alternative to}} the CRL through connection tunnel, the duplicate eastern tunnel would not have precluded it from being built.|$|E
25|$|The N type {{carriages}} {{were the}} first cars to be built at Newport Workshops in over 20 years. Each carriage took over 20 weeks to construct, with a rolling production line to give one new carriage {{off the assembly line}} every fortnight. Weeks 1 to 7 involved the general structure - welding the shell and the underframe together and attaching the ends. Following that, the electrical fitout took four weeks, and the bogies were fitted after Week 11. A mineral fibre insulation was sprayed on internal surfaces between weeks 12-14, and then the final six weeks the internal fibreglass ceiling and wall sheets were fitted, along with carpet, seats, lighting, doors and other components, with a one-week trial at the end. The cost was roughly $500,000 per carriage. The total <b>build</b> <b>time</b> added to 16,500 man-hours per carriage, against 32,000 for the earlier Z type carriages. Additionally, the carriages are between five and eight tonnes heavier than comparable designs overseas, partially due to their being a compromise between regional and commuter type vehicles. On the other hand, they cost a mere $13,000 per seat, against $47,000 per seat for the XPT carriages being built for New South Wales Railways around the same time.|$|E

500|$|A new [...] drydock and two [...] slipways {{were built}} at Ferrol to {{accommodate}} {{the construction of the}} three battleships. All material, save the armor plate, heavy guns, and fire control equipment, was manufactured in Spain. The contract specified a <b>build</b> <b>time</b> of four years for the first ship, five years for the second, and seven years for the third. Despite the allowance for longer construction times for the later units, their completion, and particularly the third unit, Jaime I, was held up by a lack of materials from Britain {{as a result of the}} outbreak of World War I. Most importantly, the main guns for Jaime I were not delivered until 1919.|$|E

2500|$|The initial rate of {{construction}} was slow, {{due to a}} variety of factors: delays in equipment delivery from overseas, industrial problems, a lack of qualified labour, and the difficulty of naval overseers in supporting all eight shipyards at once primary among them. The initial prediction was that two vessels per month would enter service through 1941, but by June 1940, only five of the seventeen ordered so far had been laid down, and the RAN was advised at the end of 1940 that only seven would be completed December 1940. The prioritisation of Admiralty orders by the Australian government meant that RAN-ordered ships were further delayed, although the Admiralty later allowed the first four of their ships to remain in local waters until replacements entered service. Rate {{of construction}} increased by late 1941, although the increasing need of shipbuilding resources for repairs as the war progressed slowed the rate of construction back down.

2500|$|Due {{to various}} oversights by the government, BC Ferries, design bureaus, and the shipyards, {{the cost of}} the program more than doubled from $210 million ($70 million/vessel) to almost $460 million ($150 million/vessel) and final {{delivery}} was almost 3 years behind schedule. [...] As with all prototype construction this cost and <b>build</b> <b>time</b> was gradually being reduced with each successive completion. [...] A large part of the delay was because the shipyards commissioned to construct the vessels had very little experience working with aluminum. Also design changes during construction caused delays and more costs. [...] Previously, construction of aluminum vessels in British Columbia had been limited to fishing boats and special-purpose vessels. [...] The construction of three dual-hulled 122.5 m catamarans represented a very large leap of faith by the Government in British Columbia shipyards.|$|E
