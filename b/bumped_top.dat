40|$|The NSLS II beam {{injection}} {{works with}} a DC septum, a pulsed septum and four fast kicker magnets. The kicker power supplies each produce a two revolution period pulsed field, 5. 2 {micro}s half sine waveform, using {approx} 5 kA drive voltage. The corresponding close orbit bump amplitude is {approx} 15 mm. It is desired that the bump is transparent to the users for top-off injection. However, high voltage and short pulse power supplies have challenges to maintain pulse-to-pulse stability and magnet-to-magnet reproducibility. To minimize these issues, we propose implementing a DC local <b>bump</b> on <b>top</b> of the fast bump to reduce the fast kicker strength {{by a factor of}} 2 / 3. This bump uses two storage ring corrector magnets plus one additional magnet at the septum to create a local bump. Additionally, these magnets could provide a DC bump to simulate the septum position effects on the store beam lifetime.

40|$|The extragalactic {{background}} (EGB) of diffuse {{gamma rays}} {{can be determined}} by subtracting the Galactic contribution from the data. This requires a Galactic model (GM) and we include {{for the first time}} the contribution of dark matter annihilation (DMA), which was previously proposed as an explanation for the EGRET excess of diffuse Galactic gamma rays above 1 GeV. In this paper it is shown that the newly determined EGB shows a characteristic high energy <b>bump</b> on <b>top</b> of a steeply falling soft contribution. The bump is shown to be compatible with a contribution from an extragalactic DMA signal from weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with a mass between 50 and 100 GeV in agreement with the EGRET excess of the Galactic diffuse gamma rays and in disagreement with earlier analysis. The remaining soft contribution of the EGB is shown to resemble the spectra of the observed point sources in our Galaxy. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is a {{state of}} the art 3 GeV third {{generation}} light source currently under construction at Brookhaven National Laboratory and starts to commission in 2014. The beam injection works with two septa and four fast kicker magnets in an injection section. To improve the injection stability and reproducibility, we plan to implement a slow local <b>bump</b> on <b>top</b> of the fast bump so that the fast kicker strength is reduced. This bump works as a pseudo movable septum. We can also use this 'movable' septum to measure the storage ring beam partial lifetime resulting from the septum edge and possibly increasing the lifetime by moving the stored beam orbit away from the edge. We demonstrate the feasibility of this idea, by implementing DC bump in NSLS X-ray ring. We report the results of beam lifetime measurements {{as a function of the}} amplitude of this bumped orbit relative to the septum and the idea of a slow bump that could reduce the fast bump magnet strengths...|$|R

30|$|Multifractal {{spectrum}} of RV has two dominant <b>bumps</b> in the <b>top</b> of the spectrum, {{as a consequence}} of the two processes present in the data - P and B frame types in the signal that are formed using LV frames as a reference. Similar, but a less distinctive process, is present in the case of CV spectrum. Additive processes could not be observed in multifractal spectra by the method of moments, because that method has a higher level of approximation. An advantage of the histogram method for multifractal spectra is the ability to show these processes. The method is used for the reason that it is interesting for examining influences of the system on data, such as the network parameters influence on the data traffic.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{techniques that}} allow users to collaborate on tablet computers that employ distributed sensing techniques {{to establish a}} privileged connection between devices. Each tablet is augmented with a two-axis linear accelerometer (tilt sensor), touch sensor, proximity sensor, and light sensor. The system recognizes when users bump two tablets together by looking for spikes in each tablet’s accelerometer data that are synchronized in time. Bumping establishes a privileged connection between the devices; the tilt sensing axis (left-right or forward-back) {{and direction of the}} spikes determines which sides of the tablets have collided. In previous work, tablets were dynamically tiled together to make a temporary larger display. In this work, users can face one another and <b>bump</b> the <b>tops</b> of two tablets together to establish a collaborative face-to-face workspace. The system then uses the sensors to enhance transitions between personal work and shared work. For example, a user can hold his or her hand {{near the top of the}} workspace to “shield ” the display from the other user. This gesture is sensed using the proximity sensor together with the light sensor, allowing for quick “asides ” into private information or to sketch an idea in a personal workspace. Picking up, putting down, or walking away with a tablet are also sensed, as is angling the tablet towards the other user...|$|R

The shootout lasted from 4:30 pm to 6:00 pm allowing the drivers to make as many qualification attempts as they wanted in the time available. Unlike the main portion of qualifying, during the shootout segment drivers did not have to withdraw previous qualification times to make another attempt; the fastest time for each driver during the shootout segment was used to order the drivers. Hélio Castroneves not only won the first session of qualifying, but also the shootout and the 2010 Indianapolis 500 pole position.|$|R
5|$|Tarbosaurus bataar was {{originally}} {{described as a}} species of Tyrannosaurus, an arrangement that has been supported by some more recent studies. Others prefer to keep the genera separate, while still recognizing them as sister taxa. A 2003 cladistic analysis based on skull features instead identified Alioramus as the closest known relative of Tarbosaurus, as the two genera share skull characteristics {{that are related to}} stress distribution and that are not found in other tyrannosaurines. If proven, this relationship would argue against Tarbosaurus becoming a synonym for Tyrannosaurus and would suggest that separate tyrannosaurine lineages evolved in Asia and North America. The two known specimens of Alioramus, which show juvenile characteristics, are not likely juvenile individuals of Tarbosaurus because of their much higher tooth count (76 to 78 teeth) and their unique row of bony <b>bumps</b> along the <b>top</b> of their snouts.|$|R

This setup was a prototype of a typical wall-mounted sensor on aircrafts, therefore it has practical importance. Analysis of the experimental data shows that thickness of the turbulent boundary layer controls the location of separation over the bump. Spherical ending of the bump delays the separation, especially from half height of the <b>bump</b> to the <b>top</b> of the <b>bump.</b> It also affects the strength of trailing vortices created at the free end of the bump, and hence size of the separated region.
