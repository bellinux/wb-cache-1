40|$|We {{present a}} {{communication}} scheme aimed to improve robustness of impulse-UWB energy-detector receivers {{in the presence}} of narrowband interference. We first show that for this receivers, the matched filter waveform depends on interferer phase and amplitude, and it can become null for jammers with carrier frequency close to that of the desired channel. We then show that by multiplying the transmitted signal with an appropriately chosen, non-pseudo-random, unit-norm sequence, the <b>baseband</b> <b>energy</b> is maintained within 6 dB of the ideal (no interference) regardless of blockers. The proposed spreading technique enables energy-detection receivers to achieve high-interference robustness by using only simple baseband signal processing, and is hence well suited to low-power UWB systems. © 2011 IEEE...|$|E

Without involving the sampling theorems and the accompanying approximation, we derive closed-form expressions for the probability of detection and false alarm over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels for the proposed method.

30|$|In this section, {{we focus}} on the <b>baseband</b> <b>energy</b> {{consumption}} evaluation for specific FPGA targets. In such devices, the power consumed by the baseband circuitry originates from two sources. The first is the dynamic power that is generated when the circuit is active and denoted PDYN,BB in the following. It corresponds to the power that is dissipated by the switching activity of the components. The second source is related to the static power consumption of the circuit and denoted PST,BB in the following. The latter is generated by leakage currents of transistors. The static power highly depends on the FPGA device whereas the dynamic power depends on several parameters such as the baseband processing architecture, the number of generated bits in a packet, the encoder, the adopted MCS, the (I)FFT size, etc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an energy-efficient highthroughput and high-precision signal component separator (SCS) chip {{design for the}} asymmetric-multilevel-outphasing (AMO) power amplifier. It uses a fixed-point piece-wise linearfunctional approximation developed to improve the hardware efficiency of the outphasing signal processing functions. The chip is fabricated in 45 nm SOI CMOS process and the SCS consumes an active area of 1. 5 mm. The new algorithm enables the SCS to run at a throughput of 3. 4 GSamples/s producing the phases with 12 -bit accuracy. Compared to traditional low-throughput AMO SCS implementations, at 0. 8 GSamples/s this design improves the area efficiency by 25 and the energy-efficiency by 2. Thisfastest high-precision SCS to date enables {{a new class of}} high-throughput mm-wave and base station transmitters that can operate at high area, energy and spectral efficiency.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel cross layer scheme to lower power {{consumption}} of ADCs in OFDM systems, {{which is based}} on resolution adaptive ADCs and Fountain codes. The key part in the new proposed system is that the dynamic range of ADCs can be reduced by discarding the packets which are transmitted over ''bad'' sub carriers. Correspondingly, the power consumption in ADCs can be reduced. Also, the new system does not process all the packets but only processes surviving packets. This new error correction layer does not require perfect channel knowledge, so it {{can be used in a}} realistic system where the channel is estimated. With this new approach, more than 70 % of the energy consumption in the ADC can be saved compared with the conventional IEEE 802. 11 a WLAN system under the same channel conditions and throughput. The ADC in a receiver can consume up to 50 % of the total <b>baseband</b> <b>energy.</b> Moreover, to reduce the overhead of Fountain codes, we apply message passing and Gaussian elimination in the decoder. In this way, the overhead is 3 % for a small block size (i. e. 500 packets). Using both methods results in an efficient system with low delay...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} fourth-moment {{measure of the}} “bandwidth ” of a {{strictly}} time-limited signal and obtain a minimum-bandwidth basis for L 2 a�b. Such a basis consists of orthonormal waveforms with the smallest obtainable bandwidths. The primary advantage of the fourth-moment bandwidth relative to the Root Mean Square (RMS) and Fractional Out-of-Band Energy (FOBE) measures is that its basis functions have a O 1 � f 3 frequency roll-off compared to the O 1 � f 2 and O 1 � f decay of the RMS and FOBE basis functions, respectively. I. MAIN RESULT Every strictly time-limited pulse has a spectrum which is nonzero for an infinite range of frequencies. Hence, non-strict measures of bandwidth are used to quantify the spectral concentration of such signals. Two such measures, namely the RMS and the FOBE bandwidths, have been studied in the past. In particular, it was shown that the minimum RMS and FOBE bandwidth orthonormal basis functions for L 2 0 �T are sinusoids sin kπt�T for integer k [1] and the set of time-truncated prolate-spheroidal wave functions [2], respectively. In this paper we consider the fourth-moment bandwidth and obtain the corresponding minimum bandwidth orthonormal basis.

The ADCs in a receiver can consume up to 50 % of the total <b>baseband</b> <b>energy.</b> Our scheme is based on resolution-adaptive ADCs and Fountain codes.

With our approach, more than 70 % of the energy consumption in the ADCs can be saved compared with the conventional IEEE 802.11 a WLAN system under the same channel conditions and throughput. In addition, it requires 7.5 [*]dB less SNR than the 802.11 a system. To reduce the overhead of Fountain codes, we apply message passing and Gaussian elimination in the decoder.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{hardware}} power consumption {{has been proven}} {{to have a significant}} impact on EE [27]. Circuits such as field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices have been considered as a viable solution to support advanced signal processing algorithms that are implemented in wireless embedded communication systems. These devices can support complex applications due to the large amount of available hardware resources. Moreover, their cost and development time are relatively low compared to their application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) counterparts. In literature, power consumption related to baseband processing is generally omitted or neglected, and only the power required to transmit data is considered. One of the main reasons is that power information is not necessarily available because it highly depends on a particular hardware device or architecture. Another classic assumption is that the power consumed by the power amplifier is usually higher than the power consumed by the baseband circuit and hence the latter is often neglected. However, this assumption depends on the considered cell size: the smaller the cell size, the more important the power consumed by baseband processing [27]. In [27] and [28], general power consumption values are considered in order to provide guidelines. However, these values are not specific to FPGA-based designs and consist of global estimations. Thus, such models are not well-suited to perform an efficient comparison of FPGA-based designs because they have not been obtained for such devices. Moreover, FPGAs have a specific architecture and properties such as heterogeneous resources, a large programmable interconnect, etc. In our work, we focus on the <b>baseband</b> <b>energy</b> consumption related to a single user in a small cell.|$|E
