40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{number of}} recent {{therapeutic}} advances have resulted from <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> research. With the change in medical education and practice towards evidence-based medicine, we wished to determine the role of <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> research in Australian intensive care practice. We {{believe this is the}} first survey of Australian intensivists and trainees to assess the influence of <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> research on their clinical duties. We discuss the importance and influence of <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> in intensive care practice and the development of postgraduate appreciation of <b>basic</b> <b>science,</b> highlight the impact of some of the changes in medical education on <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> undergraduate teaching, and discuss the clinical applicability and current participation in <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> research. METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed in November 2006 to all registered Fellows and trainees of the Joint Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine who were resident in Australia. RESULTS: 267 of 801 surveys were returned (33 % response rate) : 74 % of respondents believed <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> is an important or very important influence on clinical decision making, which is consistent with previous studies, and 8 % believed it is crucial. The most familiar areas of <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> research are those with established clinical applications, such as drug metabolism, regional perfusion and the complement cascade. Most current intensive care practitioners were taught <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> as undergraduates. Involvement in <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> research increases during intensive care training, from 10 % before a medical degree to over 30 % at the end of training, with over a quarter of practicing intensivists having a <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> degree. Despite this increase in interest during training, only 9 % of journal club attendees reported that they discuss <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> articles. CONCLUSION: Critical care practitioners consider <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> research to be relevant and important to their practice. There is interest in clinically applicable <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> research, but few people regularly review <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> articles at journal clubs. Reassuringly, participation in <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> research increases throughout intensive care training, despite changes in medical education and lack of protected time for research...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the topical coverage and chapter summaries of 12 (twelve) approved <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> textbooks in Ebonyi State junior secondary schools. The study {{was carried out}} in Ebonyi State of Nigeria. Two research questions and one hypothesis guided the study. Evaluation research design was adopted. One instrument was used, A 5 -point quantitative approach for content evaluation of science textbooks (QACEST). QACEST formula was used to answer research questions while the null hypothesis was tested using chi-square test of goodness of fit. The result revealed among others; STAN <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> project, spectrum <b>basic</b> <b>science,</b> <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> for upper <b>basic</b> all had adequate topical coverage while <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> for Nigerian junior secondary school had topical coverage inadequate.

40|$|Proponents of Evidence-based {{medicine}} (EBM) do {{not provide}} a clear role for <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> in therapeutic decision making. Of what they do say about <b>basic</b> <b>science,</b> {{most of it is}} negative. <b>Basic</b> <b>science</b> resides on the lower tiers of EBM 2 ̆ 7 s hierarchy of evidence. Therapeutic decisions, according to proponents of EBM, should be informed by evidence from randomised studies (and systematic reviews of randomised studies) rather than <b>basic</b> <b>science.</b> A framework of models explicates the links between the mechanisms of <b>basic</b> <b>science,</b> experimental inquiry, and observed data. Relying on the framework of models I show that <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> often plays a role not only in specifying experiments, but also analysing and interpreting the data that is provided.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Medical {{and dental}} {{students}} often participate in joint <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> curricula, {{such as the}} <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> curriculum at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. Reports from the USA and Australia, however, show {{that it may be}} problematic because joint <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> curricula are mostly tailored around the needs of the medical students only, which may lead to prejudice and marginalisation of dental students. There are no local studies to inform decision-making in this regard. OBJECTIVES. To determine whether dental students perceived the joint <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> curriculum at the University of Pretoria to be relevant to their needs and if they felt marginalised. METHODS. Reflective essays with regard to the 2011 and 2012 second-year dental students’ perceptions of the first 2 years of study in the joint curriculum were qualitatively analysed using a thematic approach. Frequency distributions of the identified themes were also calculated. RESULTS. Despite positive comments, the dental students perceived that the joint <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> curriculum at the University of Pretoria may not be relevant to their needs and that they are being marginalised in the teaching and learning processes. CONCLUSION. The current study highlights the need for improvements {{in the manner in which}} joint <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> curricula are being administered in order to foster interprofessional collaboration. Alternatively, dental and medical students should be separated to ensure that the educational objectives of <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> curricula are being met for minority groups, such as dental students.

40|$|The {{past several}} decades have seen a rapid and {{profound}} expansion of knowledge within the biomedical sciences. Achievements in molecular biology, human genetics, and neuroscience, among others, {{have contributed to the}} realization that the complexity of science now lends itself to interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts. This transformation of biomedical science has led to questions regarding the organization of academic departments in U. S. medical schools around traditional <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> disciplines. Some have proposed that the discipline-based department impedes scientific progress and a new structure that breaks down boundaries is needed. Others believe that traditional <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> departments continue to foster valuable and distinct contributions to research and education. To examine the ways in which <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> departments have evolved in this larger pattern of change in biomedical science, previous research analyzed the restructuring of medical school <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> departments from 1980 to 1999. This Analysis in Brief extends those findings with five additional years of data from 2000 to 2004 and explores two specific questions on recent trends in these reorganizations. Data tracking the numbers of <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> departments and specific changes occurring within them were triangulated among the AAMC Faculty Roster, the AAMC Directory of American Medical Education, and individual institutional information (Web sites and personal correspondence).

Recognizing the within-firm heterogeneity of inventive activities, we look not only at the firm level, but also at the firm-technology level for characteristics determining breakthroughs. A key finding is that firms pursuing <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> are more likely to produce breakthrough inventions. At the same time, doing more <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> in science disciplines that are closely linked to a given technology domain does not increase the likelihood of BTs in that particular technology. The insignificance of <b>basic</b> <b>science</b> intensity at the technology level, coupled to the significance at the firm level, suggests that the breakthrough rewards from science capacity are not reaped in the technology areas immediately involved in <b>basic</b> <b>science,</b> but in other areas of the technology portfolio of the firm.
