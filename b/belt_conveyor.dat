50|$|A {{conveyor}} belt is the carrying medium of a <b>belt</b> <b>conveyor</b> system (often shortened to <b>belt</b> <b>conveyor).</b> A <b>belt</b> <b>conveyor</b> system {{is one of}} many types of conveyor systems. A <b>belt</b> <b>conveyor</b> system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of carrying medium—the {{conveyor belt}}—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward. The powered pulley is called the drive pulley while the unpowered pulley is called the idler pulley. There are two main industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand, overburden and more.|$|E

The downtime cost of <b>belt</b> <b>conveyor</b> systems may vary from one application to another. The financial loss due to the downtime of <b>belt</b> <b>conveyor</b> systems can be in a range of 100,000 to 200,000 Euro per hour, considering the loss of the revenue from material conveying, and shutdowns of subsequent material processing facilities (Lodewijks, 2015).|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem of}} reducing energy consumption and dioxide {{emissions in the}} stage of construction and operation of mine <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors</b> is connected with their broad use in the industry. However, this notion is related to a reduction of electric energy consumption for conveyor drive and for production of conveyor components and assemblies (belts, rollers, load-bearing structure etc.). An essential role is played by an increased life of <b>belt</b> <b>conveyors</b> assemblies and components, principally belts. A reduced electric energy consumption results in a decreased CO 2 emissions, e. g. hard coal – fired power station issues 0. 28 kg CO 2 per production of 1 kWh, in to answer production of 1 t steel accounts for 3. 2 t CO 2 emissions.
