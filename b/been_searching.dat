5|$|An earlier fleet {{had been}} the first to reach India by circumnavigating Africa. That {{expedition}} had been led by Vasco da Gama and returned to Portugal in 1499. For decades Portugal had <b>been</b> <b>searching</b> for an alternate route to the East, in order to bypass the Mediterranean Sea which was {{under the control of the}} Italian Maritime Republics and the Ottoman Empire. Portugal's expansionism would lead first to a route to India, and later to worldwide colonization. A desire to spread Catholic Christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration. There also was a long tradition of pushing back Muslims, which stemmed from Portugal's fight for nationhood against the Moors. The fight expanded first to North Africa and eventually to the Indian subcontinent. An additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical Prester John—a powerful Christian king with whom an alliance against Islam could be forged. Finally, the Portuguese Crown sought a share in the lucrative West African trade in slaves and gold, and India's spice trade.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{can leave}} the capital, Littlefinger offers to take Ned to the last person Jon Arryn spoke to before his death. It {{turns out to be}} a prostitute, Mhaegan, the mother of a baby daughter, who is another of Robert's illegitimate children.

When Ned and his guards try to leave, they are ambushed by Jaime Lannister and his men, who want answers for Tyrion's arrest. Ned claims {{responsibility}} for Tyrion's arrest, which leads to a brutal fight between his and Jaime's men. In the end, Ned's guards are killed, including his captain Jory Cassel, whom Jaime stabs through the eye with a dagger. Ned duels with Jaime but is speared through the leg by one of Jaime's guards before Stark and Lannister can finish the fight on their own.

Jaime storms away, leaving Ned bleeding in the dirt, where he quickly faints.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming twentieth anniversary of his reign on November 20, 303, Diocletian declared a general amnesty in a third edict. Any imprisoned clergyman could now be freed, {{so long as he}} agreed to make a sacrifice to the gods. Diocletian may have <b>been</b> <b>searching</b> for some good publicity with this legislation. He may also have sought to fracture the Christian community by publicizing the fact that its clergy had apostatized. The demand to sacrifice was unacceptable to many of the imprisoned, but wardens often managed to obtain at least nominal compliance. Some of the clergy sacrificed willingly; others did so on pain of torture. Wardens were eager to be rid of the clergy in their midst. Eusebius, in his Martyrs of Palestine, records the case of a clergy who, after being brought to an altar, had his hands seized and made to complete a sacrificial offering. The clergyman was told that his act of sacrifice had been recognized and was summarily dismissed. Others were told they had sacrificed even when they had done nothing.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} in hand {{is an effort}} to introduce a new efficient searching technique known as Multiple Values Bidirectional Square Root Search. In this technique, a sorted list of values can <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> from another sorted list very efficiently. The overall time for sorting the values to <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> and <b>searching</b> <b>is</b> less than the time taken by the Linear Search and Binary Search. In this technique, the size of targeting list is reduced for every next value to <b>be</b> <b>searched.</b> As a result the searching time of remaining values to <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> <b>is</b> reduced, while in linear search and binary search the size of target list remains same for every value to <b>be</b> <b>searched.</b> In other words, we can say that the targeting list is traversed completely each time for every value to <b>be</b> <b>searched</b> from beginning to end.

5|$|The {{original}} Chicago work {{went on a}} tour {{of eight}} cities before returning to Chicago in 1933 where it was displayed at the World's Fair. It was in a warehouse until it was purchased by Winston-Salem, North Carolina, artist and collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965. King had first seen the painting in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair. Years later he described the painting and how magnificent it was seeing it displayed in Chicago to his friend Ed Grout of Maryland. Mr. Grout arranged a meeting with the nephew of George McConnel and the painting was purchased by Mr. King. King appeared on the panel game show I've Got A Secret on May 30, 1966, displaying a 22' by 25' section of the painting (his secret was that this was only part of the painting). It was revealed that King had <b>been</b> <b>searching</b> for it for some time, and now that he'd found it, he hoped to construct a new cyclorama building.|$|E
5|$|After {{this part}} of Poland was annexed by Nazi Germany, Oświęcim (Auschwitz) was located {{administratively}} in Germany, Province of Upper Silesia, Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz, Landkreis Bielitz. It was first suggested as a site for a concentration camp for Polish prisoners by SS-Oberführer Arpad Wigand, an aide to Higher SS and Police Leader for Silesia, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski. Bach-Zelewski had <b>been</b> <b>searching</b> for a site to house prisoners in the Silesia region, as the local prisons were filled to capacity. Richard Glücks, head of the Concentration Camps Inspectorate, sent former Sachsenhausen concentration camp commandant Walter Eisfeld to inspect the site, which already held sixteen dilapidated one-story buildings that had once served as an Austrian and later Polish Army barracks and a camp for transient workers. Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel (SS), approved the site in April 1940, intending to use the facility to house political prisoners. SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel) Rudolf Höss oversaw {{the development of the}} camp and served as the first commandant. SS-Obersturmführer (senior lieutenant) Josef Kramer was appointed Höss's deputy. Auschwitz I, the original camp, became the administrative center for the whole complex.|$|E

5|$|Dawn of Mana {{opens on}} the fictional island of Illusia, {{a place where}} the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a {{continent}} composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While they are out, Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the labyrinth of roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had <b>been</b> <b>searching</b> for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Eastwood {{was cast}} as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hour-long western series Rawhide, the {{breakthrough}} {{in his career}} he had long <b>been</b> <b>searching</b> for. However, Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Clint to feel comfortable with the part. Filming began in Arizona {{in the summer of}} 1958. It took just three weeks for Rawhide to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an Emmy, it was a major success for several years, and reached its peak at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961. The Rawhide years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day, yet he still received criticism by some directors for not working hard enough. By late 1963 Rawhide was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked freshness in the script; it was canceled {{in the middle of the}} 1965–66 television season. Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, although he was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode. In the show's first season Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of Rawhides cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{originally}} had {{a capacity of}} about 12,000, but club officials decided that {{was not enough to}} give them any hope of joining the Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, but in 1891 Newton Heath used what little financial reserves they had to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000spectators. However, this transaction put the club at odds with the railway company, who refused to contribute any finance to the deal. The two organisations began to drift apart from then onwards, and in 1892 the club attempted to raise £2,000 in share capital to pay off the debts incurred by the expansion of the ground. The split also led the railway company to stop paying the rent due on the ground to the cathedral, who {{at about the same time}} decided to increase the rent. Under increasing financial pressure, especially as the cathedral authorities felt it inappropriate for the club to charge admission to the ground, an eviction notice was served on the club in June 1893. The club's management had <b>been</b> <b>searching</b> for a new stadium since the first eviction attempt in May the previous year, and they were able to move to a new ground on Bank Street, three miles away in Clayton. It proved impossible though to take the two grandstands to the new ground, and they were sold for £100.|$|E
