5|$|Due {{to their}} {{enormous}} size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine of a <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> {{being attacked by}} orcas off the Baja California Peninsula; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but the <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> sustained serious wounds and probably {{died as a result}} of them shortly after the attack. In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> off California, with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed. A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in Monterey Bay, with the orcas swimming in a line up to the blue whale's side. The <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> fled and escaped. Orcas have virtually no chance against an adult <b>blue</b> <b>whale,</b> but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment. Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.|$|E

5|$|Authorities {{classify}} {{the species}} into {{three or four}} subspecies: B. m. musculus, the northern <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> consisting of the North Atlantic and North Pacific populations, B. m. intermedia, the southern <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> of the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda, the pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific, and the more problematic B. m. indica, the great Indian rorqual, which {{is also found in}} the Indian Ocean and, although described earlier, may be the same subspecies as B. m. brevicauda.|$|E
40|$|Pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) are ≤ 24. 1 m and are {{generally}} found north of 52 °S in summer, whereas the more southerly Antarctic <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> (B. m. intermedia) may exceed 30 m. Previous assessments {{have assumed that}} catches and recent surveys south of 60 °S recorded Antarctic <b>blue</b> <b>whales,</b> but these may have included pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whales.</b> Here, we use ovarian corpora, which accumulate with ovulations and hence with length, to separate these subspecies. The resulting Bayesian mixture model, applied to 1, 380 Northern Region (north of 52 °S and 35 °– 180 °E) and 3, 844 Southern Ocean (south of 52 °S) <b>blue</b> <b>whales,</b> estimated that only 0. 1 % (95 % credibility intervals 0. 0 %– 0. 4 %) of the Antarctic region <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> were pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> and, unexpectedly, found significantly lower lifetime ovulation counts for pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> than for Antarctic <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> (7. 6 vs. 13. 6). Over four decades, despite substantial depletion of Antarctic <b>blue</b> <b>whales,</b> there was no trend in the estimated proportion of pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> in the Antarctic.

The difference between the humpback and the <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help.

40|$|When sexually mature, Antarctic (true) <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> are {{substantially}} longer than pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whales.</b> To estimate {{the proportions of}} these two subspecies in various regions, Bayesian mixture models were fitted to catch length frequencies of sexually mature females. The extent of rounding to 5 -ft intervals was also estimated. Antarctic <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> dominated (99. 2 %) pelagic catches south of 52 °S, whereas pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> dominated (99. 9 %) north of 52 °S and in 35 °– 180 °E. South of 60 °S, only 0. 7 % (95 % credibility interval 0. 5 %– 1. 0 %) were pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whales,</b> lower than the 7 % upper bound currently assumed. Shore-based catches from SW Africa and those before 1937 from South Georgia and the South Shetlands were estimated to contain 90 %– 92 % Antarctic <b>blue</b> <b>whales.</b> Actual proportions were probably higher, but these data show evidence of rounding (up to 19 % of records), poor length-estimation methods, and other problems. The mean length of sexually mature female Chilean <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> (77. 1 ft, 23. 5 m) was intermediate between pygmy (68. 9 ft, 21. 0 m) and Antarctic <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> (83. 4 – 86. 3 ft, 25. 4 – 26. 6 m). A good fit to these data was obtained only by assuming that the Chilean whales are a separate subspecies or distinctive population. This finding {{is also consistent with}} their discrete distribution, and genetic and call type differences, compared to Antarctic and pygmy <b>blue</b> <b>whales...</b>|$|R
5|$|In addition, the {{population}} of <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> occurring off Chile and Peru {{may also be a}} distinct subspecies. Some Antarctic <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean. In Chile, the Cetacean Conservation Center, with support from the Chilean Navy, is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of Chiloe Island in the Gulf of Corcovado (Chiloé National Park), where 326 <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> were spotted in 2007.

5|$|Soon, <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> {{were being}} hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), Newfoundland (1898), and Spitsbergen (1903). In 1904–05 the first <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> were taken off South Georgia. By 1925, {{with the advent}} of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of <b>blue</b> <b>whales,</b> and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to {{increase}} dramatically. In the 1930–31 season, these ships caught 29,400 <b>blue</b> <b>whales</b> in the Antarctic alone. By the end of World War II, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance.|$|R
5|$|As of 2014, {{the eastern}} North Pacific <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> {{population}} had rebounded {{to an estimated}} 2,200 individuals, which {{is thought to be}} about 97% of its pre-whaling numbers.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the whaling ban, studies have examined whether the conservation reliant global <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> population is increasing or remaining stable.

The northeastern call predominates in the Gulf of Alaska, the U. S. West Coast, and the eastern tropical Pacific, and the northwestern call predominates from south of the Aleutian Islands to the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia (Stafford et al. 2001). Both call types are represented in lower latitudes in the central North Pacific but differ in their seasonal patterns (Stafford et al. 2001).

Virtually all books and articles that mention the <b>blue</b> <b>whale</b> claim that it can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters).
