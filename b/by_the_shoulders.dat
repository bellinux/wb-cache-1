5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Ángela Peralta {{died in the}} Hotel Iturbide in Mazatlán {{at the age of}} 38 on 30 August 1883. She {{married her}} lover Julián Montiel y Duarte on her deathbed. According to an {{eyewitness}} account of the marriage ceremony, she was already unconscious when it took place. One of the singers from her company, Lemus, supported her <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders.</b> When asked if she took Montiel y Duarte as her husband, Lemus moved her head to make it appear that she was nodding her assent. Before her burial in Mazatlán, her body lay in state, dressed in one of her opera costumes and her best jewels. In 1937, her remains were disinterred and brought to the Rotunda de Hombres Ilustres (the Rotunda of Illustrious People) in Mexico City's Panteón de Dolores. Both Mazatlán and San Miguel de Allende have theatres named in her honour.|$|E

2500|$|The message (and its {{trailing}} padding) became famous, {{and created}} some ill feeling, since {{it appeared to}} be a harsh criticism by Nimitz of Halsey's decision to pursue the decoy carriers and leave the landings uncovered. [...] "I was stunned as if I had been struck in the face", Halsey later recalled. [...] "The paper rattled in my hands, I snatched off my cap, threw it on the deck, and shouted something I am ashamed to remember", letting out an anguished sob. RADM Robert Carney, Halsey's chief of staff (who had argued strongly in favor of pursuing the carriers), witnessed Halsey's emotional outburst and reportedly grabbed him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoulders</b> and shook him, shouting, [...] "Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together!" [...] Recognizing his failure, Halsey sulked in inactivity for a full hour while Taffy 3 was fighting for its lifefalsely claiming to be refueling his shipsbefore eventually turning around with his two fastest battleships, three light cruisers and eight destroyers and heading back to Samar, too late to have any impact on the battle.|$|E
