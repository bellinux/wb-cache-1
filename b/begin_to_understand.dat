25|$|In {{the third}} phase, differentiation, {{children}} begin {{to learn that}} written language regularly differs in structure and style from spoken language. The growth from consolidation to differentiation can be challenging for some children to grasp. Children can 'struggle with the transformation from the basically overt language of speech to the essentially covert activity of writing'. In this phase, the child learns that writing is generally considered more formal than spoken language, which {{is thought to be}} casual and conversational. Here, it is believed that children <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that writing serves a purpose.|$|E

25|$|During school-aged years, {{academic}} achievement {{is a significant}} contributor to self-esteem development. A student consistently achieving success or consistently failing will have a strong academic effect on their individual self-esteem. Social experiences are another important contributor to self-esteem. As children go through school, they <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> and recognize differences between themselves and their classmates. Using social comparisons, children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities. These comparisons {{play an important role}} in shaping the child's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves. As children go through adolescence, peer influence becomes much more important. Adolescents make appraisals of themselves based on their relationships with close friends. Successful relationships among friends are very important to the development of high self-esteem for children. Social acceptance brings about confidence and produces high self-esteem, whereas rejection from peers and loneliness brings about self-doubts and produces low self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), {{the largest}} Latter Day Saint denomination, the Melchizedek priesthood {{is one of}} two {{governing}} priesthoods, which is typically given {{as a matter of course}} to worthy male members 18 years and older. No exact rule exists about how much time a man must be a member first; he may receive this priesthood as soon as local church leaders feel he is prepared. Ordination is based on the recipient's age and worthiness and does not require any specific training or aptitude. A candidate for this ordination is interviewed and often counseled to study the 84th, 107th, and 121st sections of the Doctrine and Covenants to <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the covenant a person makes with God when he receives the Melchizedek priesthood. The candidate is also usually asked to stand in a gathering of the members of the church to be publicly accepted as being worthy of ordination. For male Latter-day Saints, receiving the Melchizedek priesthood is considered to be a saving ordinance of the gospel.|$|E
25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E

The Gullwings organize a concert to which everyone in Spira is invited, supporters of the Youth League and New Yevon alike. Additionally, the Songstress dressphere worn by Yuna is revealed to hold Lenne's memories, resulting in a sphere screen projecting them to everyone in attendance during the concert.

The Usher line of supplies with Yoobi features a collaboration with Jonni Cheatwood, the artist who does the designing. The slogan is [...] "Mixing street smarts with school smarts". The collection is available online and at Targets nationwide, and for every purchase, school supplies are donated to kids in need in US classrooms. [...] When asked why he partnered with Yoobi, Usher said, [...] "Preparing future leaders through my New Look Foundation has always been about having the proper tools to succeed in life. If they don’t have the tools, {{young men and women}} from underserved communities can’t even <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the idea of having a}} new or different perspective.

Kline, who gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, was mainly concerned with the film's [...] "rather clumsy" [...] direction and screenwriting. Maseko directed with [...] "energy and verve," [...] though his [...] "struggles to capture the human drama" [...] led to the impression that Drum was [...] "a clunky TV movie, with awkward camera angles, wonky editing and clumsy sound recording." [...] Filardi was guilty of a dialogue which [...] "echoes with cliches, while contrived plotting put characters into situations that may be true, but they feel corny and movie-like." [...] Kline also criticised the wide variety of political issues that characterised the film, though added that [...] "maybe this helps us <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what life must have been like under such an oppressive government." ...|$|E

500|$|Infants <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{words such}} as [...] "Mommy", [...] "Daddy", [...] "hands" [...] and [...] "feet" [...] when they are {{approximately}} 6 months old. Initially, these words refer to their own mother or father or hands or feet. Infants begin to produce their first words when they are approximately one year old. Infants' first words are normally used in reference to things that are of importance to them, such as objects, body parts, people, and relevant actions. Also, the first words that infants produce are mostly single-syllabic or repeated single syllables, such as [...] "no" [...] and [...] "dada". By 12 to 18 months of age, children's vocabularies often contain {{words such as}} [...] "kitty", [...] "bottle", [...] "doll", [...] "car" [...] and [...] "eye". Children's understanding of names for objects and people usually precedes their understanding of words that describe actions and relationships. [...] "One" [...] and [...] "two" [...] are the first number words that children learn {{between the ages of}} one and two. Infants must be able to hear and play with sounds in their environment, and to break up various phonetic units to discover words and their related meanings.|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, {{with the exception of}} the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is happening to them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> more about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. [...] "The first episode is written in a way that you could never do a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in," [...] said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.|$|E
