The organic acids were positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon and contributed signi®cantly to the organic acidity of the solution (up to 26 %). Forest ¯oor solutions under Tsuga canadensis contained the most dissolved C and the most weak acidity among the six tree species. Under Tsuga canadensis we also found signi®cant amounts of strong acidity caused by deposition of sulphuric acid from the atmosphere and by strong organic acids. <b>Base</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> was the most important mechanism by which acidity was neutralized.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{indicators}} of soil restoration during secondary succession in a heterogeneous valley in the high tropical Andes. A combination of chronosequence and permanent plot methods was used to detect changes in this heterogeneous matrix. Thirty-six plots with different fallow times (1 – 9 years) and four noncultivated plots with natural vegetation (pa´ramo) were sampled twice in a 3 -year interval (1996 and 1999). The following soil properties were determined: total C and N, pH, exchangeable <b>bases,</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> capacity, and microbial biomass N (MB-N). Using the chronosequence approach, successional increases in soil pH and Mg were detected, pointing to these variables as indicators of soil restoration during the fallow period. Comparing the noncultivated pa´ramo with the fallow plots, a significant decrease in MB-N was found, suggesting that this is a sensitive agricultural disturbance indicator. The permanent plot analysis failed to detect successional trends in any of the study variables, probably as a result of a lack of sensitivity of the indicators used within the 3 -year interval. Nevertheless, a strong acidification was detected by the permanent plot method when fallow plots were cultivated. We conclude that the size of important soil components such as total soil organic matter or microbial biomass is not a sensitive soil restoration indicator in these heterogeneous mountain systems but that other integrative variables such as pH could be more sensitive to successional changes in key soil processes (e. g., nitrification or nutrient losses). 619 - 628 lsarmien@ula. vellambi@ula. v...|$|R

Kriging maps showed the highest infection rate of Sigatoka occurred in high areas of the field which had the highest concentration of sand, while the lowest disease was found in lower areas with lower silt, organic matter, total exchangeable <b>bases,</b> effective <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> capacity, <b>base</b> saturation, Ca andMgin soil, and foliar sulfur (S). These results may help farmers manage Yellow Sigatoka disease more effectively, with balanced fertilization and reduced fungicide application. This practice minimizes the environmental impact and cost of production while contributing to production sustainability. 201...|$|R
40|$|Acid {{deposition}} and {{its effects}} were studied by analysing the chemistry in precipitation, stream water, soil water and soils in two catchments in Hunan. One site, Linkesuo (denoted LKS), is {{on the outskirts of}} Changsha, the provincial capital of Hunan, the other (Bailutang, denoted BLT) on the outskirts of Chenzhou in southern Hunan. Volume-weighted average pH values and sulphate concentrations in wet deposition were 4. 58 (BLT) and 4. 90 (LKS) and 174 µmol c L- 1 and 152 µmol c L- 1, respectively. Wet deposition of sulphate has been estimated as 4. 3 gS m- 2 yr- 1 and 3. 4 gS m- 2 yr- 1 at BLT and LKS, respectively. Estimates of the corresponding total depositions (dry + wet) are 6. 1 gS m- 2 yr- 1 and 5. 3 gS m- 2 yr- 1. In precipitation and throughfall, sulphate was the major anion and calcium the major cation. In stream and soil water, nitrate was slightly higher than sulphate on an equivalent basis and magnesium (Mg) not much lower than calcium (Ca). Important soil properties, such as soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM) content, exchangeable acidic <b>cations,</b> exchangeable <b>base</b> <b>cations,</b> effective <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> capacity (CECe), <b>base</b> saturation (BS), and aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe) pools, were determined for five forest soil profiles (consisting of four horizons) in each of the two catchments. The soils in BLT are generally more acid, have lower BS and higher Al and F...|$|R
30|$|The geology, {{environment}} and movement of water control {{the type and}} concentration of salts in natural waters (Raghunath 1982; Gopinath and Seralthan 2006). Hence, a hydrochemical diagram proposed by Chadha (1999) was also applied to identify different hydrochemical processes. The data was converted to percentage reaction values (milliequivalent percentages), and expressed as the difference between alkaline earths (Ca + Mg) and alkali metals (Na + K) for cations, {{and the difference between}} weak acidic anions (HCO 3  + CO 3) and strong acidic anions (Cl + SO 4). The hydrochemical processes suggested by (Chadha 1999) are indicated {{in each of the four}} quadrants of the graph. These are broadly brief as reverse ion exchange water (Ca–Mg–Cl type), Recharging water (Ca–Mg–HCO 3 − type), seawater/end-member waters (NaCl type), and base ion exchange water (Na–HCO 3 type). Recharging waters are formed when water enters into the ground from the surface, it carries dissolved carbonate in the form of HCO 3 and the geochemically mobile Ca. Reverse ion exchange waters are less easily defined and less common, but represent groundwater where Ca + Mg is in excess to Na + K either due to the preferential release of Ca and Mg from mineral weathering of exposed bedrock or possibly reverse <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> reactions of Ca + Mg into solution and subsequent adsorption of Na onto mineral surfaces. Seawater types are mostly constrained to the coastal areas as they show typical seawater mixing. Finally, base ion exchange waters, which are more prominent in the study area form a wide band between the western part of the study area and the sea coast and possibly represent base exchange reactions or an evolutionary path of groundwater from Ca-HCO 3 -type fresh water to Na–Cl mixed seawater where Na-HCO 3 is produced by ion exchange processes.|$|R
40|$|Mediated {{electrochemical}} oxidation (MEO) {{has been developed}} as a method to treat mixed hazardous waste. The technology has {{for the most part}} been targeted toward wastes generated by the nuclear industry, consisting of a hazardous or non-hazardous organic material contaminated by a radioactive substance. The MEO process consists of the electrochemical generation of a powerful oxidizing agent, which serves as an electron transfer mediator to bring about the oxidation of the organic component. Numerous studies on a variety of organic substrates have demonstrated complete oxidation to carbon dioxide can be realized under the proper reaction conditions, with water serving as the source of oxygen. The radioactive component, usually an actinide element or heavy metal isotope, can then be recovered from the resulting organic free aqueous solution by standard methods such as ion exchange or solvent extraction. In addition to the variety of organic compounds tested, investigators have also looked at a number of process parameters including choice of mediator, temperature, concentration of mediator, current density, anode material, acid concentration, and cell separator material. From these studies it would appear that for a given organic substrate, the two most important process parameters are choice of mediator and temperature. The purpose of this work is to evaluate these two parameters for a given organic material, holding all other parameters constant. The organic material chosen for this study is the industry standard sulfonated styrene-divinyl benzene <b>based</b> <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resin. This material is ubiquitous throughout the nuclear complex as a process residue, and is very resistant to chemical attack making it an ideal substrate to evaluate MEO capability. A high acid concentration is necessary to solubilize the mediator in its higher oxidation state, 6 M nitric acid was chosen since it is compatible with existing subsequent actinide element recovery processes...|$|R
40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC) method <b>based</b> on <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> separation {{has been developed}} for the measurement of dopamine (DA), 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and norepinephrine (NE) in microdialysates. The separation conditions have been optimised for using electrochemical detection. All three bioamines were resolved in less than 22 min using isocratic conditions. The optimum oxidation potential for the three bioamines {{was found to be}} + 0. 4 V vs. in situ Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Linear regression analysis of HPLC-peak area as a function of concentrations in the range 1 - 50 ng x ml(- 1) gave coefficients of correlation between 0. 998 and 0. 999. The limit of detection for DA, 5 -HT and NE was found to be between 50 and 100 pg x ml(- 1) with a signal to noise ratio of 3 : 1. The method has been applied to the simultaneous measurement of the three monoamines in microdialysates from the medial prefrontal cortex under basal conditions and following the administration of the antipsychotic drug clozapine (10 mg x kg(- 1) s. c. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to analyze yields, {{biological}} efficiency, earliness (expressed as days to first harvest), and precociousness and establish models for the mushroom growing according to these parameters. The experiment followed a double factorial design with four sources of calcium (calcitic limestone, calcitic limestone+gypsum, dolomitic limestone and dolomitic limestone+gypsum) and 2 application times (25 days before casing and at the moment of casing), with 4 replicates for each treatment. Different calcium sources influenced differently Agaricus subrufescens production, especially as regards earliness, which showed significantly higher values when dolomitic limestone with gypsum was applied. Yield and biological efficiency were negatively correlated with H+AL, organic matter and Mg amount. Furthermore, earliness was positively correlated with H+Al, organic matter, and the amount of Mg and Fe. Finally, negative correlations were observed between precociousness and the amount of Ca, SB (sum of <b>base),</b> CEC (<b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> capacity) and V% (percentage of base saturation). The models presented in this work are extremely important for predicting the agronomic performance of Agaricus subrufescens on the basis of chemical analysis provided by the casing soil...|$|R
