5|$|Salford's built {{environment}} {{is made up}} of a range of <b>building</b> <b>stock.</b> Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of the {{built environment}} is poor.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a description of}} regional <b>building</b> <b>stocks</b> in the South West of Sweden and the South East of Norway and provides a first validation by means of modelled Final Energy Demand, which is compared with available statistics. The aim {{of the work is}} to provide a basis for modelling the assessment of effects and costs of various energy conservation measures applied to the existing <b>building</b> <b>stocks</b> of regions within a country. The aggregated descriptions of the national <b>building</b> <b>stocks</b> of Sweden and Norway through representative buildings are downscaled to the regions. We conclude that the uncertainty in the methodology applied is higher for the regions than for the national level, due primarily to less data available for validation than on the national level. This uncertainty raises concern about how targets on increased energy efficiency and emissions reductions and are going to be monitored, if such targets are to be fulfilled...|$|R

Finland's most significant architectural achievements are related to modern architecture, mostly because the current <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> has less than 20% that dates back to before 1955, which relates significantly to the reconstruction following World War II and the process of urbanisation which only gathered pace after the war.|$|E

30|$|A community’s capital—for example, built, economic, {{social, and}} human—is most {{commonly}} used to distinguish categories of recovery models. Of all potential types of capital, built capital is most frequently modeled. Modeling of lifeline infrastructure has been researched most often compared to all other recovery topics. The sectors of these recovery models include power systems (Çağnan and Davidson 2007), water systems (Davis 2013), and transportation networks (Lee and Kim 2007). Recovery models of built capital {{have been developed to}} represent the reconstruction of residential <b>building</b> <b>stocks</b> (Miles and Chang 2006, 2011; Nejat and Damnjanovic 2012; Grinberger and Felsenstein 2014; Huling and Miles 2015; Nejat and Ghosh 2016; Eid and El-Adaway 2017) and, less commonly, commercial <b>building</b> <b>stocks</b> (Miles and Chang 2006, 2011; Hwang et al. 2016).|$|R
25|$|Existing {{low-cost}} units tend to {{be older}} than the housing stock in general. For example, in 1995, 68% of the affordable rental housing stock was constructed before 1970 and another 21% were built before 1980. A considerable share of the older affordable rental stock {{has been removed from}} the market since 1995, but many of the remaining units are in older buildings. Due for example to differences in building standards, technical development and historical maintenance, the older <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> is generally of worse quality than newer buildings. Deficits include cold down draft, poor insulation and inefficient windows and appliances.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of the neighborhood is predominately Craftsman, Craftsman Bungalow, and Bungalow with modest Tudor or Colonial Revival detailing; One may also find Shotgun Houses, Queen Anne or American Foursquare styled homes, as well as various period revival influences including Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture. The dominance of these styles in the neighborhood reflects its principal growth period of 1920 to 1929 with roughly 40% of <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> constructed within this decade. Combined with construction undertaken in the 1930s, this period accounts {{for the majority of}} housing stock built within the neighborhood. Although construction of Interstate 630 in the 1970s dramatically altered the southern edges of the area, the neighborhood is largely intact and much of the original housing stock remains.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s the {{character}} of the subdivision began to change, as many prominent members of the local German Jewish community moved to Brush Park; this period of the neighborhood's history is recorded by the neoclassical Temple Beth-El, designed by Albert Kahn for the Reform Congregation and constructed in 1902. Around the same time, Brush Park saw the construction of its first apartment buildings. One of the neighborhood's earliest examples of this type of structure was the Luben Apartments, built in 1901 by architect Edwin W. Gregory and demolished in 2010. The Luben featured large and sumptuous units, and its elaborate limestone façade blended with those of the surrounding mansions; however, the construction of apartment buildings undoubtedly represented a decrease in the quality of Brush Park's <b>building</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E

25|$|Net Zero Energy Building Certification {{launched}} in 2011, {{with an international}} following. The first project, Painters Hall, is Pringle Creek’s Community Center, café, office, art gallery, and event venue. Originally built in the 1930s, Painters Hall was renovated to LEED Platinum Net Zero energy building standards in 2010, demonstrating the potential of converting existing <b>building</b> <b>stock</b> into high‐performance, sustainable building sites. Painters Hall features simple low-‐cost solutions for energy reduction, such as natural daylighting and passive cooling lighting, that save money and increase comfort. A district ground-source geothermal loop serves the building’s GSHP for highly efficient heating and air conditioning. Excess generation from the 20.2kW rooftop solar array offsets pumping for the neighborhoods geo loop system. Open to the public, Painters Hall is a hub for gatherings of friends, neighbors, and visitors {{at the heart of}} a neighborhood designed around nature and community.|$|E
25|$|The Brynmor Jones Library, {{which houses}} {{more than a}} million volumes, was {{constructed}} in two phases: the first phase was fully completed in 1959, with a tower block extension officially opened in 1970. During the 1950s and 1960s a considerable number of academic buildings were built, including the Larkin and Wilberforce Buildings (originally given other names). The 'Martin Plan' of 1967, Sir Leslie Martin was the university architect, envisaged a campus with its tallest buildings in the centre surrounded by buildings diminishing in height towards the perimeter. In the course of the 1960s most of the departments housed in temporary structures were moved into new purpose-built premises. However, Biochemistry was still partially located in a 'hut' {{to the rear of the}} Venn building into the early 1980s. This early phase of expansion through building ended in 1974, after this year there was to be no further academic building construction on the campus until 1996. However, student numbers doubled in this period, with the university becoming highly efficient in using its existing <b>building</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
