40|$|A simple, {{affordable}} light-source {{rotation system}} provides automatic detection and defect-angle estimation of <b>bent</b> <b>pins.</b> Many electronic components rely on rows of pins {{to establish an}} electric connection with circuits. A common defect is <b>bent</b> <b>pins,</b> which compromise the electric connection {{and can lead to}} de-fective circuits and systems. Controlling the quality of pinned components can help assure the correct functioning of most appliances we use daily. Methods to detect <b>bent</b> <b>pins</b> already exist. Some rely on testing by contact, while others use vision systems in optimized illumi-nation conditions. However, because they usually need special-ized hardware or precise experimental settings, existing systems are often large or expensive. We developed one with simple ele-ments tomake detection affordable for small- andmedium-sized companies. The system also allows estimating defect angles to quantify the bends. The photometric stereo principle, the observation of a fixed object with a fixed camera during changing illumination conditions, has been used successfully to measure the sur-face of objects. 1 The method works especially well on ob-jects presenting a specular or mirror-like reflection 2 for which the reflected light and illumination directions are symmetri-cal to the surface normal vector or reflection. Because com-ponent pins are metallic, they reflect light specularly. Us-ing light-source rotation and the geometrical constraints of specular reflection, it is easy to distinguish <b>bent</b> <b>pins</b> from normal ones and to estimate their angle. We want to detect and quantify vertical bends, the most com-mon defects. A vertical bend pin has a surface plane that has been abnormally rotated around the x vector (see Figure 1). The idea is to move a light source around the component in a vertical plane while a camera in the same plane observes the reflected light of the pins during rotation. Because of the mirror-like geometry, the reflected light will reach maximum intensity, and at that point <b>bent</b> and normal <b>pins</b> will shine with Figure 1.

60|$|A boy {{does not}} {{put his hand}} into his pocket until every other means of gaining his end has failed, but to that {{extremity}} had Tommy now come. For months his only splendid possession had been a penny despised by trade because of a large round hole in it, as if (to quote Shovel) some previous owner had cut a farthing out of it. To tell the escapades of this penny (there are no adventurers like coin of the realm) would be one way of exhibiting Tommy to the curious, {{but it would be}} a hard-hearted way. At present the penny was doubly dear to him, having been long lost and lately found. In a noble moment he had dropped it into a charity box hanging forlorn against the wall of a shop, where it lay very lonely by itself, so that when Tommy was that way he could hear it respond if he shook the box, as acquaintances give each other the time of day in passing. Thus at comparatively small outlay did he spread his benevolence over weeks and feel a glow therefrom, until the glow went, when he and Shovel recaptured the penny with a thread and a <b>bent</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{instinct}} of getting, of hoarding, was {{the motive}} {{of all their}} foraging; they had no other idea of property than the bounty of nature; and this was well enough {{as far as it}} went, but their impulse was not to share this bounty with others, but to keep it each for himself. They hoarded nuts and acorns, and hips and haws, and then they wasted them; and they hoarded other things merely from the greed of getting, and with no possible expectation of advantage. It might be well enough to catch bees in hollyhocks, and imprison them in underground cells with flowers for them to make honey from; but why accumulate fire-flies and even dor-bugs in small brick pens? Why heap together mussel-shells; and what did a boy expect to do with all the marbles he won? You could trade marbles for tops, but they were not money, like pins; and why were pins money? Why did the boys instinctively choose them for their currency, and pay everything with them? There were certain very rigid laws about them, and a <b>bent</b> <b>pin</b> could not be passed among the boys any more than a counterfeit coin among men. There were fixed prices; three pins would buy a bite of apple; six pins would pay your way into a circus; and so on. But where did these pins come from or go to; and what did the boys expect to do with them all? No boy knew. From time to time several boys got together and decided to keep store, and then other boys decided to buy of them with pins; but there was no calculation in the scheme; and though I have read of boys, especially in English books, who made a profit out of their fellows, I never knew any boy who had enough forecast to do it. They were too wildly improvident for anything of the kind, and if they had any virtue at all it was scorn of the vice of stinginess.|$|E

60|$|Adventures {{like this}} are among the bitter {{memories}} of the angler. The fish that break away are monstrous animals; imagination increases their bulk, and fond desire paints them clean-run and bright as silver. There are other chances of the angler's life scarcely less sad than this. When a hook breaks just as the salmon was losing strength, was ceasing to struggle, and beginning to sway with the mere force of the stream, and to show his shining sides--when a hook breaks at such a moment, {{it is very hard}} to bear. The oath of Ernulphus seems all too weak to express the feelings of the sportsman and his wrath against the wretched tackle-maker. Again, when the fish is actually conquered; when he is being towed gently into some little harbour among the tall slim water- grasses, or into a pebbly cove, or up to a green bank; when the bitterness of struggle is past, and he seems resigned and almost happy; when at this crisis the clumsy gilly with the gaff scratches him, rouses him to a last exertion, and entangles the line, so that the salmon breaks free--that is an experience to which language cannot do justice. The ancient painter drew his veil over the face of Agamemnon present at his daughter's sacrifice. Silence and sympathy are all one can offer to the angler who has toiled all day, and in this wise caught nothing. There is yet another very bitter sorrow. It is a hard thing for a man to leave town and hurry to a river in the west, a river that perhaps he has known since he fished for minnows with a <b>bent</b> <b>pin</b> in happy childhood. The west is not a dry land; effeminate tourists complain that the rain it raineth every day. But the heavy soft rain is the very life of an angler. It keeps the stream of that clear brown hue, between porter and amber, which he loves; and it encourages the salmon to keep rushing from the estuary and the sea right up to the mountain loch, where they rest. But suppose there is a dry summer--and such things have been even in Argyleshire. The heart of the tourist is glad within him, but as the river shrinks and shrinks, a silver thread among slimy green mosses in the streams, a sheet of clear water in the pools, the angler repines. Day after sultry day goes by, and there is no hope. There is a cloud on the distant hill; it is only the smoke from some moor that has caught fire. The river grows so transparent that it is easy to watch the lazy fish sulking at the bottom. Then comes a terrible temptation. Men, men calling themselves sportsmen, have been known to fish in the innocent dewy morning, with worm, with black lob worm. Worse remains behind. Persons of ungoverned passions, maddened by the sight of the fish, are believed to have poached with rake-hooks, a cruel apparatus made of three hooks fastened back to back and loaded with lead. These are thrown over the fish, and then struck into him with a jerk. But the mind willingly turns away from the contemplation of such actions.|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{foundation}} boundary conditions was studied considering the two extreme cases, {{as is the}} usual practice; namely <b>pinned</b> and fixed <b>bent</b> foundations. The nonlinear time-history analyses were performed for only soil D, with two levels of ground motions and with nonlinear shear key elements and abutment-soil springs for bridges with aspect ratio of 0.3. It was determined that {{the deck of the}} bridges with <b>pinned</b> <b>bent</b> foundation experienced larger displacements than that with fixed bent foundation by about 22 % for PGA of 0.6 [*]g regardless of skew angle. The effect of introducing fixity was larger for the larger level of ground motions, leading to larger difference between response values for any skew angle for 0.6 [*]g case. Introducing fixity led to larger demand on column forces (moment, axial, and shear) and column ductility. Abutment-soil springs attached to bridges on <b>pinned</b> <b>bent</b> foundation showed larger displacement either into or away from abutments by largest percentage of about 36 %. For fixed <b>bent</b> foundation and <b>pinned</b> <b>bent</b> foundation cases, yielding of shear keys was reported in an average sense under PGA of 0.6 [*]g with lower shear key deformations for the fixed case. In summary, introducing fixed bent foundation condition reduced displacements in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the bridge deck significantly. The bent forces on columns increased, which led to the demand on columns to increase significantly. On the other hand, the deformation and force demands at the abutments and on the shear keys reduced noticeably. Also, <b>pinned</b> <b>bent</b> foundation assumption led to larger in-plane deck rotations as the skew angle increases compared to the bridges with fixed bent foundation.|$|R
40|$|The {{underwater}} site of HMAV Bounty and {{the area}} of the mutineer settlement at Adamstown on Pitcairn Island were investigated archaeologically during a four-month expedition in 1998 and 1999. Due to high energy environmental conditions on the maritime site and human activity associated with collecting or recovering material post the vessel’s wrecking in 1790, only 147 artefacts and or concretions remained to be recovered during the maritime excavation. These artefacts consequently represent a unique collection of provenanced material from which a chemical and metallurgical investigation can be undertaken. Comparative analysis was conducted between some copper maritime and terrestrial artefacts to reveal the extent of recycling by the mutineer settlement. Further comparative analysis was conducted between copper artefacts from HMAV Bounty and HMS Sirius (1789), as both vessels were extensively refitted a year apart at Deptford dockyard on the Thames before both departed on voyages to the Pacific. Copper-iron composite objects found on the Bounty wreck-site were identified as <b>Bent’s</b> <b>pins</b> which have not been found previously in the artefact assemblage of two contemporary RN vessels excavated in the Pacific...|$|R
5000|$|Next to {{the church}} in an open field once stood a well known as Ffynnon Faglan or Baglan's Well (B mutates to F).

To the south and east of the chapel an extensive grave was found, trenches cut across in different places gave indications that several thousand bodies had been at one time or other buried there. This large number of bodies in an island that certainly never contained more than two inhabited houses, seems to point out that Barry Island, had somewhat the reputation of a holy island, and that bodies had, therefore, been brought from elsewhere for interment here.|$|R

40|$|Intermittent faults in electrical/electronic {{interconnections}} are recognised {{as one of}} {{the major}} sources of No Fault Found (NFF) events. These can be caused due to surface corrosion (e. g. oxidation of pins or fretting wear), <b>bent</b> <b>pins,</b> debris within the female connector, or incorrect installation during initial manufacture and assembly. Unless such issues are narrowed down to a specific root cause, any corrective actions or troubleshooting will be difficult to carry out, and hence its resolution may not make its way into future designs of the system. This leads to further susceptibility to NFF. Intermittent behaviour is often a clear sign of a partially damaged connector, or a connector undergoing a particular degradation mechanism, with the level of intermittency being further aggravated through process variation of harsh environments and parametric faults. In order to further our understanding of the relationship between degradation, operating conditions, intermittent behaviour within the subject, an experimental investigations have been carried out. This paper {{is a work in progress}} paper that illustrates a test regime that has been used to stimulate intermittence in electronic connectors whilst subjected to vibration, using both a traditional oscilloscope and bespoke intermittent fault detection equipment, in order to capture an intermittent signature.

40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic feed-thru connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or recessed contact pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact pin retention forces, contact crimp failures, unmated connectors and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged connector elastomeric seals and cryogenic connector failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact retention, plating issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, <b>bent</b> <b>pins,</b> contact crimp barrel cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related.

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of splitting of timber loaded parallel to grain {{is not clear}} {{and it is difficult}} to evaluate the splitting strength. In this research, splitting tests on Japanese cedar and Douglas fir were conducted to clarify splitting strength. A monotonic tensile force was applied to a drift-pinned joint with steel side plates and splitting failure originated from the pin hole. In order to evaluate the splitting strength, specimens with various parameters, i.e., diameter of drift pin, end margin, edge margin and thickness were used. All parameters affected the splitting strength, but particularly, end margin and thickness also affected the failure mode. As the end margin lengthened, the failure mode was transferred from shear to splitting. On the other hand, as thickness increased, the drift <b>pin</b> <b>bent</b> more at splitting. This bending of the drift pin caused a lag of bearing stress to timber, and the failure mode was transferred from full width splitting to partial width splitting. The splitting strength under various conditions could be evaluated by consideration of the difference in failure modes.|$|R
