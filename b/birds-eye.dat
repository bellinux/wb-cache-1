5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} production team IKIOI. It opens with a <b>birds-eye</b> view shot from the ground, showing several buildings and trees; just before the first verse, a short shot of Amuro is seen. The first verse opens with Amuro walking down a street in Los Angeles, California, singing to the track. During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings and landscapes around Los Angeles. The camera then pans into several individuals citizens in the city: an elderly couple, {{a man in his}} car, a couple who have just finished surfing, and a woman walking her dog.|$|E
5|$|A foot pursuit {{in which}} Diesel, Brewster and Walker are chased across favela rooftops by Johnson {{and his team}} was filmed {{over the course of}} a week in the small {{hillside}} town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, <b>birds-eye</b> view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.|$|E
5|$|Wembley bosses were {{in dispute}} with {{newsreel}} companies over the broadcast {{rights for the}} 1936 final. Gaumont British Film Company initially had offered £900 to film inside the ground, but this was refused by the authorities who wanted a sum of £1,500. They later backed down {{and said that they}} would accept the initial offer, but the film company was now only willing to pay £500. A solution could not be reached, and the media were banned from inside of the stadium. To get around the ban and be able to report on the match, a number of autogyros were hired to fly the reporters over the stadium giving them a <b>birds–eye</b> view of the match, with the only filming inside Wembley conducted by the official stadium cameraman. Autogyros had been used to film the final in 1935, and also by the Metropolitan police for crowd control.|$|E
25|$|Wyck's {{works are}} notable for their flair and colour, {{as well as}} the {{excellent}} attention to detail. He highlights features such as flourishing sabres, firing muskets, flaring horses nostrils and cannons spouting flames. But most importantly he brought the viewer into the battle {{at a time when the}} prevailing trend was to present <b>birds-eye</b> views over a battle, showing disposition and locations of troop formations. He personalised the soldiers, and created an atmospheric presentation of the scenes depicted. He also celebrated notable commanders and recognisable figures within his works, a feature that made him popular with those commissioning works.|$|E
25|$|In the Dunjonmaster program, {{the screen}} is divided into a <b>birds-eye</b> view {{representation}} of the surroundings and a status summary for the character. Traps, treasures and secret doors are hidden inside the dungeons. Temple of Apshai uses a hybrid between a turn-based and a real time combat system. A player's turn {{can be used to}} walk up to 9 steps in the direction the character is facing, turning towards either direction, trying to talk the monster out of the fight, or executing a number of different attacks. A bow and arrows can be used to attack enemies from afar. If the player doesn't make any input for a while, the enemies continue to move and attack in set intervalls regardless. All actions decrease the player character's fatigue rating, depending on stats and carrying weight. When this value sinks below zero, the character cannot act anymore before resting. The player gains experience points while adventuring, which raise a number of hidden statistics.|$|E
500|$|The single premiered on May 29, 2013 as {{the lead}} single from Amuro's {{eleventh}} studio and second bilingual (Japanese and English language) album, Feel (2013). It is also her second digital-only single after [...] "Damage" [...] (2012), and Amuro's second single released from her own label Dimension Point. The artwork to [...] "Contrail" [...] features a <b>birds-eye</b> view of two contrails above a cityscape. Amuro had contemplated in releasing the single as a CD single, but later scrapped the idea because she felt the digital release and promotion through the television series would be enough. In 2014, Amuro re-recorded the song for her 2014 compilation album Ballada.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time artists were often {{involved}} in the expansion of Western cartography, and more aware than might always seem evident of the scientific and nautical advances of the age. According to Margarita Russell, one of Erhard Reuwich's woodcuts from the first printed travel book (1486) shows him trying to demonstrate {{his understanding of the}} curvature of the earth with a ship half-seen on the horizon. [...] The many coastal views in the book's woodcuts are important in the development of such representations. [...] <b>Birds-eye</b> plans of cities, often coastal, which we would today usually consider as cartography, were often done by artists, and considered as much as works of art as maps by contemporaries.|$|E
2500|$|Star Wars: Force Commander is a {{real-time}} strategy video game. The player commands {{forces as}} though they are the commander rather than an infantry unit. The game utilizes a <b>birds-eye</b> view around a 3D map. The levels are largely plot-focused, with initial levels playing as the Imperial faction against the Rebellion, whilst as the plot progresses and the character defects to the Rebellion, players then fight against the Imperials. Levels are ground assault based, as the game lacks space combat. Outsides of the main story-mode Campaign, scenarios can be re-played under the Scenario option, and players can set up their own battles in the Skirmish mode where up to four sides can compete against one another, though they only have the faction choice of Imperials or the Rebellion.|$|E

[...] On 11 July 2013, it was {{reported}} that Carl and Phil would be involved in a [...] "massive car accident which leaves both men unconscious", caused by Carl. The storyline involves a flipped car and a helicopter, from which a <b>birds-eye</b> view of the crash scene is seen. It is reported to have cost £1million to make, said to be the most expensive stunt EastEnders has ever filmed. The crash was filmed over two days and was directed by Michael Owen Morris, who had to create what was originally scripted as [...] "car hits wall" [...] and compared it to a James Bond film. Newman said the crash was [...] "A suitably explosive start to a jam-packed autumn and winter full of love, romance and reprisals", while a show insider said, [...] "The crash is going to change things for many residents in Albert Square. There will be serious repercussions and with the twists and turns we have planned for the aftermath, everything might not be as it seems." [...] It was also hoped that the storyline would be [...] "the most talked about TV moment of the year".|$|E
