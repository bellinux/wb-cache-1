This study {{performed}} {{tensile test}} using small-size flat specimen and ball indentation test {{at room temperature}} to characterize the local tensile properties of <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>weld</b> joints. The weld specimens used were fabricated by joining between SA 508 Gr. 3 ferritic steel and Type 316 stainless steel with Alloy 82 buttering on the ferritic steel side and Alloy 82 / 182 weld metal. The test results showed that yield stress (YS) of weld metal was slightly {{higher than that of}} Type 316 and smaller than that of SA 508 Gr. 3, and ultimate tensile stress (UTS) of weld metal was similar as those of Type 316 and SA 508 Gr. 3 base metals. Also, the values of YS and UTS of buttering layer (Alloy 82) were nearly same as those of weld metal. Heat-affected-zones (HAZs) showed higher YS and UTS values compared to their base metals. Especially, the strengths of SA 508 Gr. 3 were significantly higher than those of surrounding materials. Also, it was known that the ball indentation test reasonably measured the local YS and UTS of <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>weld</b> joints...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} the Ninth International Conference on NDE in Relation to Structural Integrity for Nuclear and Pressurised Components was {{the link between the}} {{information}} provided by NDE and the use made of this information in assessing structural integrity. In this context, {{there is a need to}} determine NDE performance against structural integrity requirements through a process of qualification. There is also a need to develop NDE to address shortcomings revealed by such qualifications or otherwise. Finally, the links between NDE and structural integrity require strengthening in many areas so that NDE is focussed on the components at greatest risk and provides the precise information required for assessment of integrity. These were the issues addressed by the papers presented at the conference. The level of interest in the subject matter of the conference was maintained from previous events and over 150 suitable papers were submitted for presentation at the conference. This required the programme to be organised in three parallel sessions, each on a specific theme, to provide each paper with sufficient time for presentation and to accommodate all of them within the overall time allocated. A major conference theme was related to the links between NDE and structural integrity. One of the three sessions contained all the qualification and structural integrity papers, including those on risk-informed inspection. This session also included papers on NDE reliability, material properties measurement and mathematical predictions of inspection performance through modelling. A second session was devoted to the theme of development of new inspection methods. The third session was concerned with inspections of specific reactor components. Two developments noted at the previous conferences in Budapest, San Diego, Yokohama and Berlin were the increased number of papers on the subjects of austenitic and <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>weld</b> inspection and also the use of phased arrays. These were also well represented in the programme of the conference in Seattle and are clearly topics which continue to arouse a high level of international interest. Seventeen countries were represented in the final programme from Europe, America, Asia and Africa. In the event, the conference was highly successful. The 156 presented papers maintained the high promise suggested by the written abstracts and the programme was chaired in a professional and efficient way by the session chairmen who were selected for their international standing in the subject. The number of delegates, at 312, was also highly gratifying, showing the high level of international interest in the subject. This is also indicated by the large number of countries, 17, represented by the delegates. These Proceedings provide the permanent record of what was presented. They indicate the state of development at the time of writing of all aspects of this important topic and will be invaluable to all workers in the field for that reason. JRC.

40|$|<b>Bi-metallic</b> piping <b>welds</b> are {{frequently}} used in light water nuclear reactors to connect ferritic steel pressure vessel nozzles to {{austenitic stainless steel}} primary cooling piping systems. An important aspect for the integrity of such welds {{is the presence of}} residual stresses. Measurement of these residual stresses presents a considerable challenge because of the component size and because of the material heterogeneity in the weld regions. The specimen investigated here was a thin slice cut from a full-scale <b>bi-metallic</b> piping <b>weld</b> mock- up. A similar mock-up had previously been investigated by neutron diffraction within a European research project called ADIMEW. However, at that time, due to the wall thickness of the pipe, stress and spatial resolution of the measurements were severely restricted. One aim of the present investigations by high energy synchrotron radiation and neutrons used on this thin slice was to determine whether such measurements would render a valid representation of the axial strains and stresses in the uncut large-scale structure. The advantage of the small specimen was, apart from the easier manipulation, the fact that measurement times facilitated a high density of measurements across large parts of the test piece in a reasonable time. Furthermore, the recording of complete diffraction patterns within the accessible diffraction angle range by synchrotron X-ray diffraction permitted mapping the texture variations. The strain and stress results obtained are presented and compared for the neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. A strong variation of the texture pole orientations is observed in the weld regions which could be attributed to individual weld torch passes. The effect of specimen rocking on the scatter of the diffraction data in the butt weld region is assessed during the neutron diffraction measurements. JRC.

40|$|Current design {{standards}} and codes {{do not provide}} specific guidance how to perform engineering criticality assessment with <b>bi-metallic</b> girth <b>weld</b> in lined or clad pipe. Recently, Bonora et al. (Proc. ASME 2013 32 nd OMAE conf.) proposed the equivalent material method (EMM) which allows one to still use current design assessment routes. The method consists in considering instead of three materials in the weld joint, a single “equivalent ” material with a flow curve defined as the interpolated lower bound of the three weld joint material flow curves. In this work, {{the applicability of the}} EMM was verified considering the effect associated to weld residual stresses. To this purpose, two flaw geometry configurations have been investigated. Particular relevance was given to the multi-pass weld process simulation. Numerical results indicate that the EMM always provides reasonable results in terms of applied J with respect to those obtained considering the effective multi-materials configuration in the weld joint...|$|R
40|$|At present, design {{standards}} and prescriptions {{do not provide}} specific design routes to perform engineering criticality assessment (ECA) of bimetallic girth welds. Although the authors has shown the possibility to implement ECA in accordance with available prescriptions of such flawed weld joint following the equivalent material method (EMM), when dealing with ductile crack initiation and propagation- {{as a result of}} the large scale yielding occurring at the crack tip for high fracture toughness material operating in the brittle-ductile transition region – fracture mechanics concepts such as JIc or critical CTOD may breakdown. In this work, the possibility to accurately determine the condition for ductile crack growth initiation and propagation in <b>bi-metallic</b> girth <b>weld</b> flaws using continuum damage mechanics is shown. Here, the base metal as well as the clad and the weld metal have been characterized to determine damage model parameters. Successively, the geometry transferability of model parameters has been validated. Finally, the model has been used to predict crack initiation for two bi-material interface circumferential crack configurations...|$|R
40|$|Welding {{is applied}} in many {{industrial}} sectors to join components, {{and has become}} an important manufacturing process because it enables the fabrication of structures that could not otherwise be constructed. Weld regions have inhomogeneous microstructures and {{are more susceptible to}} crack initiation and crack propagation than the surrounding base material regions. Residual stresses are also formed, which superimpose with applied loads, resulting in a reduction of the maximum applied load a component can sustain. In particular for nuclear installations, the limited failure tolerance and the relative abundance of rather large welds require a reliable assessment of component integrity for lifetime management. Residual stresses need to be considered in such assessments because they can contribute to initiation and propagation of defects. Commonly, residual stresses are more difficult to determine experimentally or to predict by numerical methods than stresses resulting from applied loads; hence residual stress assessment in welded nuclear components is an important area of research. The present work concerns the experimental determination of residual stresses by neutron diffraction in three full-scale mock-ups of components found in nuclear power installations. Two of these mock-ups represent dissimilar metal girth welds joining ferritic steel pressure vessel nozzles to austenitic stainless steel primary piping sections. The third represents a welded clad layer on a section of a reactor pressure vessel wall. In this work neutron diffraction has been used as the technique for residual stress determination. This technique is based on the principle of Bragg diffraction and measures changes in lattice spacing; i. e., strain. Residual stresses can be determined in three directions in the bulk of a component at a spatial resolution of typically 1 - 5 mm. Such a resolution is appropriate in view of the distances over which the residual stresses normally vary in welded metallic components. There are a number of challenges associated with neutron diffraction measurements addressed in the current study. One of these is that component dimensions and geometries necessitate machining to facilitate access of the neutron beams to the measurement locations. Neutron diffraction measurements are also known {{to be sensitive to the}} inhomogeneity in the microstructure and to local variations in chemical composition in the weld region; therefore dedicated reference specimens are needed in order to calibrate the strain determinations. Prior to the description of the experimental work undertaken, background information is provided on the main aspects of the work. Definitions are given for residual stresses and strains and their main characteristics are explained (chapter 2). A short overview of the most important techniques for strain and stress measurement being used today is given in chapter 3. These are the relaxation techniques, where the relaxation of strains due to material removal is measured; and the diffraction techniques, where lattice deformations caused by stresses are observed through Bragg diffraction. A detailed account of residual stress determination based on neutron diffraction is followed by a description of the facility at the Joint Research Centre that was used for the present investigations. An overview of the industrially relevant welding techniques is given in chapter 4, where additional detail is provided on the arc welding methods used for the manufacture of the components investigated in this study. The mechanism responsible for residual stress formation in welds, namely local plastic deformation caused by steep temperature gradients, and the dendritic microstructure of stainless steel fusion welds similar to those investigated here are discussed based on a few examples. The experimental work and the results obtained are described in chapters 5, 6 and 7 with each chapter covering one of the three components. The first component is a “thin" walled (25 mm wall thickness) <b>bi-metallic</b> girth <b>welded</b> pipe. The second component is a ferritic steel block with a 10 mm thick welded stainless steel clad layer applied to one of its surfaces. This component represents a nuclear reactor pressure vessel wall with a thickness of 146 mm. The third component is a thick walled (51 mm wall thickness) <b>bi-metallic</b> girth <b>welded</b> pipe. Both, the thin and the thick walled bi-metallic pipes, represent joints between ferritic steel pressure vessel nozzles and austenitic stainless steel pipes. For each component, details are provided concerning the manufacturing techniques employed, including the welding processes, the associated heat treatments and the final machining applied to the thick walled pipe. For the access of the neutron beams in three measurement orientations windows and access slots were cut into each of the <b>bi-metallic</b> piping <b>weld</b> specimens. The clad layer specimen thickness was locally reduced from 146 mm to 25 mm. This significant reduction was necessary to achieve a high spatial resolution in the measurements. The alterations described lead to stress relaxation and stress redistribution within the components. For the thick bi-metallic pipe the relaxation of strains was monitored by strain gauges during cutting showing negligible impact at the location of the neutron diffraction measurements. All component modifications are described in detail as well as the design and manufacture of the reference specimens needed for the calibration of the strain measurements. The measurement procedures and the data analyses are explained, and for each specimen the neutron diffraction results are presented in terms of residual strains and the derived stresses. In the thin walled bi-metallic pipe, tensile residual stresses have been found in the welding direction within the fusion zone. These tensile stresses reach values not far below the yield level of the material near the outer surface; and they decrease to almost 0 MPa toward the inner surface of the pipe. In the ferritic part of the pipe compressive residual stresses have been found near the austenitic-ferritic material interface. Here, the highest compression is observed close to the inner surface, decreasing toward the outer surface. In the welding transverse direction, tensile stresses have been obtained near the outer surface changing gradually to compressive stresses near the inner surface. The maximum stress levels attained in tension and compression are slightly lower than those in the welding direction. The piping radial direction exhibits overall the lowest stress levels in this component with values varying between + 100 MPa and - 100 MPa. The stainless steel clad layer of the clad component exhibits high tensile stresses in the welding longitudinal direction as well as in the welding transverse direction. The stress level ranges between 250 and 500 MPa with a considerable scatter of the data. The ferritic steel substrate is found to be in compression in both directions with minimum stress levels between - 150 and - 200 MPa near the austenitic-ferritic material interface. The stresses in the interface normal direction observed in this component scatter about 0 MPa. In the fusion zone of the thick walled bi-metallic piping component, tensile residual stresses have been found in the welding direction. In the ferritic part compressive residual stresses have been found in this direction near the austenitic-ferritic interface. Both of these observations are similar to those made for the thin walled component. The maximum stress levels observed are slightly higher than in the thinner component; the tensile stresses in the fusion zone reach the nominal yield level. No clear trend is observed for the welding longitudinal stresses between the outer and the inner surface. For the other two measurement directions the scatter of the data is so high that the magnitude of the stresses cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. For all three components the data recorded from the fusion zones exhibit higher scatter than those from the base materials. The neutron diffraction results have been compared to third party numerical predictions of the residual stresses and to stress measurements by strain relaxation techniques. The numerical predictions have been performed by finite element analyses. Simplified and more detailed approaches have been applied. In the simplified approaches the welding process itself has been neglected unlike in the detailed models. In all cases the detailed numerical assessments produced a better agreement with the neutron diffraction results than the simplified ones. In particular, in the fusion zones the simplified numerical approaches under predict the residual stresses found by neutron diffraction. The applied third party strain relaxation techniques were the ring core method and deep hole drilling for the clad layer component, and surface hole drilling and the crack compliance method for the thick walled bi-metallic pipe. Most comparisons with the neutron diffraction data show a qualitative, but not a close quantitative agreement. The discrepancies are attributed to the use of differently extracted test pieces from the original components and to the differences in the measurement geometries that apply to the different methods used. Subsequent to the presentation of the measurements and their results, an assessment of the experimental methods and the analysis of the results are performed. In particular attention is given to the method of obtaining the measurement uncertainties. In stress determination by neutron diffraction it is common practice to calculate the uncertainties solely from the fitting uncertainties of the neutron data; a practice that has been applied in this work as well. The detailed assessment of the results indicates that this approach can provide appropriate uncertainty values only for materials that are sufficiently homogenous. This is the case, for example, for the ferritic steel substrate of the clad layer component. For the less homogeneous regions, like the welds in these components, it is observed that the experimental data exhibit larger scatter than one would expect on the basis of the counting statistics. The analysis of the effect suggested that the uncertainty is underestimated by a factor of up to 10 in the worst case presented. The second uncertainty contributor analysed in more detail is the uncertainty in the detector position.. The analysis shows that, for the highest strains measured, an uncertainty in detector position as small as 1 ° or 2 ° results in an additional strain uncertainty comparable to that stemming from the fitting uncertainties. Other sources of uncertainty, such as possible errors in specimen positioning or variations of the specimen temperature, are also briefly analysed. It is found that these do not produce significant additional uncertainty contributions in these investigations. Based on the observations and subsequent analyses of the findings and comparisons several conclusions are derived. The most significant conclusions can be summarized as follows:  The applied cutting schemes for the specimens and the use of the dedicated reference specimens have made the neutron diffraction measurements possible. The necessary alterations to the specimens have an impact on the stresses under investigation. It is demonstrated that the impact should be quantified through experiments or modelling, in order to relate the stresses measured to the original stresses present in the test piece.  It is shown that for a material like the welds studied in this work, the impact of the material inhomogeneity on the neutron diffraction measurements must be considered in a complete uncertainty analysis. It is found that this uncertainty contribution can be larger than the contribution from the fitting uncertainty of the neutron data.  The neutron diffraction stress measurements can be used for the validation of numerical stress prediction methods. It is demonstrated that the simplified numerical approaches for these specimens are not sufficient. Following from the above, a number of recommendations are formulated for further improvements in the application of neutron diffraction for future residual stress measurements in large welded components. In similar cases it is recommended to apply experimental techniques capable of mitigating the problem of the high scatter in the results obtained for the fusion zones. The time-of-flight technique is presented as one option, or where possible, rocking of the specimen during measurements could be applied to increase the number of grains sampled during a diffraction measurement. Furthermore, the importance of quantifying the stress relaxation due to modifications of the specimens is pointed out. This quantification could be achieved by numerical simulation, but preferably by measurement, in particular when the recommendations just mentioned are followed...|$|R
