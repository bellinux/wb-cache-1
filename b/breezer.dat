50|$|Joe Breeze (born 1953) is {{a bicycle}} framebuilder, {{designer}} and advocate from Marin County, California. An early {{participant in the}} sport of mountain biking, Breeze, along with other pioneers including Gary Fisher, Charlie Kelly, and Tom Ritchey, {{is known for his}} central role in developing the mountain bike. Breeze is credited with designing and building the first all-new mountain bikes, which were called <b>Breezers.</b>|$|R

[...] The <b>Breezer</b> has a tricycle undercarriage with spatted wheels mounted on composite sprung cantilever legs fixed to the lower fuselage. [...] The nosewheel is steerable. [...] A ballistic parachute is an option: either a Junkers or a BRS 5UL type may be fitted. [...] A 74kW (99hp) Rotax 912 ULS is the standard powerplant {{but there are other}} options such as the 60kW (80hp) Rotax 912 UL or the Jabiru 2200 and 3300 engines of similar powers.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Breeze {{sold the}} <b>Breezer</b> brand to Advanced Sports International {{and since then}} {{has worked for the}} company as <b>Breezer</b> frame designer, {{designing}} transportation bikes, road bikes and mountain bikes under the <b>Breezer</b> name.|$|E
50|$|In 1980-81 Breeze built {{a second}} series of <b>Breezer</b> {{mountain}} bikes with oversize tubing in a diamond frame, and in 1982 to 1985 {{he built a}} third series. Breeze continued to develop and refine his mountain bike designs in the 1980s and 1990s.In 1986 he designed the American <b>Breezer,</b> an aluminum mountain bike built in St. Cloud, Minnesota.In the 1990s he designed a line of steel and aluminum <b>Breezer</b> bikes sold worldwide. Mountain bike models included the <b>Breezer</b> Lightning, Jet Stream, Thunder, Storm, Beamer, Twister, and Tornado.The 1993 <b>Breezer</b> Venturi, a road bike, featured compact geometry,which later became standard in the industry.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, Joe Breeze {{was one of}} five riders from Marin County {{to travel}} to Crested Butte, Colorado, to {{participate}} in the Pearl Pass Tour, a two-day, off-road ride from Crested Butte to Aspen, over 12,700 foot Pearl Pass. Joe Breeze, Charlie Kelly, and Wende Cragg rode their 1977 and 1978 <b>Breezers,</b> while the other participants, including Gary Fisher and Michael Castelli of Marin County and several Crested Butte residents, rode modified Schwinns from the 1930s to 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The main bus {{services}} {{are provided by}} Wilts & Dorset. Number 40 runs between Swanage and Poole, number 44 between Swanage and the nearby village of Worth Matravers (via Harmans Cross), and the number 50 runs between Swanage and Bournemouth via the Sandbanks Ferry. Double-deck open top buses are used on the Poole and Bournemouth to Swanage routes in the summer months. The buses on these routes are branded as Purbeck <b>Breezers.</b> Swanage has seen serious cuts to its bus services in recent years, reducing the frequency of services to Poole and Wareham and much reducing links to Harmans Cross and Worth Matravers.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, the {{association}} with City Sightseeing was dropped, the 2006 review concluding that marketing {{should be developed}} with core funding partners, in a way [...] "appropriate for the New Forest destination". The same buses as used in 2006 were used on the tour this year, which by now Solent Blue Line had acquired from Wilts & Dorset, both being part of Go South Coast. As {{part of the new}} marketing, the vehicles were painted in a new green livery with ponies on the side, essentially a green version of Southern Vectis' Island <b>Breezers</b> livery. The Tour's website was launched, and 60,000 leaflets were distributed to over 300 places. An official guide was also launched, given to passengers as they boarded the tour. The buses no longer towed trailers, carrying bicycles on the lower deck instead.|$|R

40|$|The Netherlands {{does not}} make {{sufficient}} use of national strategies or action plans in tackling its public health problems. Lessons from abroad teach us that a comprehensive national strategy {{can contribute to the}} creation of a more systematic body of policy and less fragmented preventive measures. This is the conclusion reached by the RIVM in an international comparative report 'Lessons from abroad - An international perspective on public health policy'. The Report was presented to Ab Klink, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sports on July 9 th 2007. Last year, the RIVM concluded that Dutch public health lags behind leading European nations. * The percentage of smokers hasn't decreased as fast as in other countries and Dutch young people drink alcohol more often than their European peers. The alcohol and tobacco control policies in place in the Netherlands are not as strict as those in other countries. Prevention of depression and reducing health inequalities miss a coherent strategy. Lessons from abroad outlines existing policies on smoking, alcohol, overweight, depression, health inequalities, youth and screening throughout the world. For example Germany, Switzerland, France and Denmark levy extra taxes on <b>breezers</b> to discourage young people to drink alcohol. In some countries a package of cigarettes is two times as expensive as in the Netherlands. Scotland, Finland and Australia promote mental health through programmes at school and work. Market forces and other -international- influences sometimes interfere with good policy-making, but they also offer opportunities. To ensure a more coherent body of health policy, the RIVM recommends that Dutch public authorities make use of the lessons from abroad to set realistic goals and effective measures...|$|R

50|$|The heavy old fat-tire bike frames, made of mild steel, {{were not}} {{standing}} up to the rigors of mountain biking. Breeze was asked by Charlie Kelly to build a mountain bike frame and in early 1977 Breeze agreed to do so.While working on the design for the mountain bike, Breeze took orders to make mountain bikes for several other Marin County off-road cycling enthusiasts. He completed the prototype (<b>Breezer</b> #1) in Fall 1977 and rode it to victory at Repack.Breeze finished nine more <b>Breezer</b> mountain bikes by June 1978.
