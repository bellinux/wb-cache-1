2500|$|People {{who choose}} to treat navicular disease through shoeing may use a shoe {{designed}} to lift and support the heels. [...] This can sometimes be accomplished with a flat shoe and trimming alone. Wedge pads or wedged shoes are often used, but can amplify heel-related problems if present. Another strategy {{is to use a}} bar type shoe. Often, an egg-bar shoe, or straight bar shoe. [...] Some horses benefit from shoes that change the <b>breakover</b> of their foot (like a rolled toe). With or without shoes, the hoof must be trimmed {{in such a way as}} to restore the balance and angle that may have been lost. Horses with long toe-low heel conformation need careful trimming to counter this. Horses with upright feet may need their heels lowered and a shoe that will allow their heels to spread. Early intervention is key; in one study, shoeing was successful in 97% of horses treated within ten months of the onset of signs, while only 54% of horses lame for over a year responded.|$|E

5000|$|Assuming no tire deflection, and {{assuming}} an ideal <b>breakover</b> angle scenario (two flat surfaces {{coming to a}} point, a vehicle with the lowest point of the chassis located at its midsection, etc.), an approximation for the <b>breakover</b> angle of a vehicle can be calculated as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{this mode}} of operation, the anode is given a {{positive}} voltage while the cathode is given a negative voltage, keeping the gate at zero potential i.e. disconnected. In this case junction J1 and J3 are forward-biased, while J2 is reverse-biased, due to which only a small leakage current exists from the anode to the cathode until the applied voltage reaches its <b>breakover</b> value, at which J2 undergoes avalanche breakdown, and at this <b>breakover</b> voltage it starts conducting, but below <b>breakover</b> voltage it offers very high resistance to the current and {{is said to be}} in the off state.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Breakover</b> {{angle is}} the maximum {{possible}} supplementary angle (usually expressed in degrees) that a vehicle, {{with at least}} one forward wheel and one rear wheel, can drive over without the apex of that angle touching any point of the vehicle other than the wheels. This definition is contingent upon the wheels being in continuous contact with the supporting surface(s). <b>Breakover</b> angle may also be referred to as [...] "break-over angle" [...] or [...] "break over angle." [...] <b>Breakover</b> angle is different from ground clearance in that ground clearance is the shortest distance between the ground and lowest point on the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Some {{thyristors}} can be gated {{into the}} ON state. Other thyristors cannot be gated ON, {{but they can}} be turned ON when the applied voltage reaches a certain <b>breakover</b> value.|$|E
5000|$|The DIAC is a diode that conducts {{electrical}} current only after its <b>breakover</b> voltage, VBO, {{has been reached}} momentarily. The term is an acronym of [...] "diode for alternating current".|$|E
50|$|A Silicon Diode for Alternating Current (SIDAC) {{is a less}} {{commonly}} used device, electrically similar to the DIAC, but having, in general, a higher <b>breakover</b> voltage and greater current handling capacity.|$|E

50|$|The SIDAC {{is another}} member of the {{thyristor}} family. Also referred to as a SYDAC (Silicon thYristor for Alternating Current), bi-directional thyristor <b>breakover</b> diode, or more simply a bi-directional thyristor diode, it is technically specified as a bilateral voltage triggered switch. Its operation {{is similar to that of}} the DIAC, but SIDAC is always a five-layer device with low-voltage drop in latched conducting state, more like a voltage triggered TRIAC without a gate. In general, SIDACs have higher <b>breakover</b> voltages and current handling capacities than DIACs, so they can be directly used for switching and not just for triggering of another switching device.|$|E
50|$|Off-road {{geometry}} {{figures for}} approach, departure and ramp <b>breakover</b> angles are 22°, 21° and 18° respectively. Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance is 8.7 in. Underbody (overall) ground clearance is 9.1 inches (230 mm).|$|E
50|$|Most DIACs have a three-layer {{structure}} with <b>breakover</b> voltage of approximately 30 V. Their behavior {{is similar to}} that of a neon lamp, but it can be more precisely controlled and takes place at a lower voltage.|$|E
50|$|Lightning arresters {{are rated}} by the peak current they can withstand, {{the amount of}} energy they can absorb, and the <b>breakover</b> voltage that they require to begin conduction. They are applied as part of a {{lightning}} protection system, in combination with air terminals and bonding.|$|E
50|$|If {{a vehicle}} drives over a <b>breakover</b> angle larger {{than what it}} is capable of clearing, the vehicle will contact the apex of the angle, which will quite likely prevent the vehicle from {{continuing}} any further in its direction of travel, possibly even completely immobilizing the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Trisil is a {{trade name}} for a {{thyristor}} surge protection device, an electronic component designed to protect electronic circuits against overvoltage. Unlike a transient voltage suppression diodes, such as Transil, a Trisil acts as a crowbar device, switching ON when the voltage on it exceeds its <b>breakover</b> voltage.|$|E
50|$|Small signal Shockley diodes are {{no longer}} manufactured, but the {{unidirectional}} thyristor <b>breakover</b> diode, {{also known as the}} dynistor, is a functionally equivalent power device.An early publication about dynistors was published in 1958.In 1988 the first dynistor using Silicon carbide was made.Dynistors can be used as switches in Micro- and Nanosecond Power Pulse Generators.|$|E
50|$|A {{suspension}} lift is a modification, often done by Jeep, truck, SUV and offroad enthusiasts {{to raise}} the ride height of their vehicle. Suspension lifts (also referred to as lift kits or leveling kits) enable steeper approach, departure, and <b>breakover</b> angles, higher ground clearance, and helps accommodate larger wheels and tires. Due to the raised center of gravity, maximum safe operating angles are reduced and roadholding is often significantly impaired with a lift kit.|$|E
50|$|Mobility {{parameters}} {{include a}} climatic operational range of -32 °C (-46 with kits) to +52 °C. The MTVR has a maximum speed of 105 km/h and on-road cruising range of 483 km. It can climb a 60% gradient and traverse a 40% side slope with its maximum cross-country load. It can ford 1.52m {{of water and}} surmount a 610 mm vertical step. Turning radius and approach, departure, and ramp <b>breakover</b> angles vary by variant.|$|E
