5|$|Assessing Valencia's hitting during 2010 spring training, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said: “I {{guarantee}} you one thing, he can hit a fastball; {{and if he}} sits on a breaking ball, he can hit that, too.” On June 3, Valencia was called up to replace Michael Cuddyer, who had <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bereavement list {{following the death of}} his father-in-law. In his debut that day, he went 1 for 3.|$|E

5|$|At E3 2015, Square Enix Montreal {{announced}} Lara Croft Go, {{a successor}} to Hitman Go set within the Tomb Raider universe. It was released on 27 August 2015. In the game, players use touchscreen controls to move Lara Croft around a level composed of nodes and lines. While the core mechanics and design are similar to Hitman Go, the developers did not want Lara Croft Go {{to feel like a}} re-skin, so an emphasis has <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> puzzle-driven exploration and gameplay elements of the Tomb Raider brand. The following year, Square Enix Montreal announced a similar title Deus Ex Go, based on the Deus Ex series.|$|E

5|$|Barrett {{became a}} free agent {{after the end of the}} season, but was offered {{arbitration}} from the Padres. The Tampa Bay Rays expressed interest in signing Barrett, even though the signing would involve trading the Padres a future second round draft pick as compensation. Barrett accepted the Padres' arbitration offer on December 7. The Padres placed Barrett on the disabled list on April 8, 2008, after he sustained an elbow injury. The team later activated him on May 25, after he had recovered, and completed a minor league rehabilitation assignment. On July 2, 2008, Barrett was rushed to the hospital after fouling a pitch off his face. He required surgery to repair the damage, and had <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disabled list for the second time in 2008. The Padres waived Barrett on October 11, after he previously expressed interest in testing the free-agent market.|$|E
5|$|Their next {{task was}} {{the capture of}} the road bridge {{spanning}} the Aller river {{as part of the}} 11th Armoured Division's advance on the town of Essel. The 1st Commando Brigade carried out a preliminary move across the river over a railway bridge some distance away from their objective and after forcing their way across, they removed the explosives that had <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge and dug in on the other side. Over the course of about three-and-a-half hours they repelled a number of determined counterattacks, before No. 6 Commando, supported by Vickers machine guns fixed bayonets and charged the German marines that were defending the bridge, and inflicting heavy casualties upon them.|$|E
5|$|With a {{strength}} that {{continued to grow}} until there was about 350 men around the bridge, the charges that had <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge were removed and No. 3 Commando settled in to defend the bridge {{as they waited for}} 50th Division to arrive. Over {{the course of the next}} few hours they were subjected to mortar fire and shelling from a Panzer IV tank. Eventually, as casualties mounted and their reinforcement became overdue the Commandos were forced to abandon the position, nevertheless they had prevented the bridge from being blown up and it was eventually recaptured as the Eighth Army arrived a short time later. The unit, however, suffered heavily for the success, suffering 30 killed, 66 wounded and 59 missing or captured. The bridge was later renamed No. 3 Commando Bridge in their honour.|$|E
50|$|Minor League Baseball uses a 7-day {{disabled}} list for all injuries. Players who are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 40-man roster but get hurt in <b>the</b> minor leagues <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> minor league DL, but not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> major league DL. One problem this poses {{is that a}} player who is injured in the minors and who would <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> major league 60-day DL cannot <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 60-day, meaning the 40-man roster spot is not freed up.|$|R

5|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{mountain}} tourists, ease of access {{into the high}} mountain environment, plus promotion and encouragement by tour companies offering ascents of Mont Blanc to people {{with little or no}} previous alpine experience, have led to an increase in mountain accidents and even inappropriate demands to be rescued. With up to 30,000 climbing parties now attempting to ascend Mont Blanc each year, it has gained the reputation of being one of the world's deadliest mountains. Deaths from mountaineering-related accidents across the Mont Blanc massif average almost 100 a year, with the majority occurring on Mont Blanc itself. There have also been various stunts, some of which the local authorities have decried as reckless or stupid. In recent years, guards have <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most popular route of ascent to Mont Blanc's summit at peak periods {{in order to ensure that}} those entering the mountain environment are adequately equipped and skilled. This has led to calls to limit access to the most popular summits and for the mountains to be treated with greater respect.|$|E
5|$|Lacking any {{reserves}} and possessing only limited artillery support, the division's engineers prepared the bridges over the rivers for detonation. From 27 March onwards minor actions were fought {{along the line}} as the German advance began to reach the Australians. On 30 March a serious attempt at penetrating the line around Sailly-Laurette was held and broken up by the 11th Brigade, with German losses being assessed at around {{one and a half}} brigades, or roughly between 3 and 4,000 men. On 6 April further attempts were made and in the confusion the charges that had <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bouzencourt Bridge were fired and it was dropped into the Somme Canal. Nevertheless, the attempt was beaten off by the 10th Brigade. Following this the Australians were able to begin taking the initiative and throughout May they began to slowly recapture some of the ground that had been lost earlier as they undertook a series of peaceful penetration operations.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 2013, Universal Orlando {{announced}} {{the expansion of}} Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Diagon Alley, along with the Hogwarts Express attraction, to be located on the former site of the Jaws attraction. By the end of August 2013, all six passenger cars and both tenders had been spotted in the backstage area, waiting to be assembled on the track. The first of the two trains was installed on the track on October 24, 2013. By the beginning of December 2013, the second train had <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track. In January, the resort previewed {{the interior of the}} Hogwarts Express through a live cast.

In mid-March 2014, Universal Orlando Resort released further information about the ride, including concept animations. On June 24, 2014, the resort announced that the Diagon Alley expansion, including the Hogwarts Express, would officially open to the public on July 8, 2014. A week later, Universal Orlando soft-opened the Hogwarts Express, without any announcement. Within a month of the Hogwarts Express' opening, one million riders had ridden the attraction.

5|$|Roberts {{stayed at}} Cambridge for the 201617 season, with the {{campaign}} following a similar pattern to the previous year {{as he was in}} and out of the starting line-up. He made his first start a month into the new season, helping Cambridge win their first game of the season as they won 21 away at Newport County on 24 September 2016. Three days later, he scored the only goal of the game when he turned the ball home from close range after 65 minutes in a 10 victory against Yeovil Town. The win moved Cambridge off the bottom of the table. Roberts' return to the first-team coincided with an upturn in form for the Cambridgeshire side and he remained a permanent fixture in the centre of defence for the following five months of the season. He scored his second goal of the season courtesy of a 92nd minute equaliser in an eventual 42 extra-time FA Cup win at Dover Athletic on 17 November 2016, with Roberts playing all four FA Cup games as Cambridge would progress to the Third Round and face Leeds United live on BBC. His third and final goal of the campaign was a notable 93rd minute winner in a 32 win over Newport County in February 2017, scoring from a rebound in a game Cambridge had trailed by two goals. Roberts did not make an appearance beyond March 2017, and played 31 games in total during the season, scoring three times. At the end of the season, in May 2017, Cambridge announced their released and retained list, stating that Roberts had <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> transfer-list with a year remaining on his contract.|$|E
