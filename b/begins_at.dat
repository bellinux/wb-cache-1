5|$|Between the two buffer regions {{there is}} an end-point, or {{equivalence}} point, at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: pKa2 − pKa1 is about three in this example. (If the difference in pK values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point <b>begins</b> <b>at</b> about pH  6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of {{a small amount of}} strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region <b>begins</b> <b>at</b> about pH 11 (pKw − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.|$|E
