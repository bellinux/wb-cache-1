50|$|Grannizia went to {{the same}} place and was rude, {{complaining}} of the lice in their hair. They brought her to the wardrobe, and she grabbed the fanciest dress. They did not give it to her, but sent her out the stable door, where a donkey's testicle fell on her forehead. Her furious mother took Cicella's clothing and gave it to Grannizia, and sent Cicella to tend pigs. There, a nobleman, Cuosemo, saw her and asked her stepmother for leave to marry her. Caradonia agreed, sealed up Cicella in a barrel, and presented Grannizia as the bride instead. After the wedding night, {{he went back to the}} house, and a tabby cat told him that Cicella was in the barrel. He let her out, put Grannizia in her place, and fled with her. Caradonia returned with wood, created a fire, and boiled water to scald Cicella to death. She poured it in the barrel. Grannizia died, and Caradonia opened the <b>barrel,</b> <b>saw</b> her own daughter, and drowned herself in the well.|$|E
50|$|In early 1940, {{one of the}} rifles, {{its stock}} and <b>barrel</b> <b>sawed</b> off, was smuggled out of Poland across the Tatra Mountains into Hungary for the Allies by Krystyna Skarbek and Polish fellow couriers. The rifle never saw service with the Allies, however, because the {{drawings}} and specifications had been destroyed by the Poles during the invasion of Poland; reverse engineering would have required too much time.|$|R
6000|$|... "The gun {{was made}} to conceal. That's why the <b>barrels</b> were <b>sawed.</b> It would fit into any box. How could he swear {{there was no such}} gun in the house?" ...|$|R
25|$|Skarbek helped organise {{a system}} of Polish {{couriers}} who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish anti-tank rifle, model 35, with the stock and <b>barrel</b> <b>sawn</b> off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her Budapest apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the Allies, as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war {{and there was no}} time for reverse engineering. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.|$|R
5000|$|Gary O'Hara, a Confederate Lieutenant, {{returns from}} the war, to fight one at home. Prior to his release from the Prisoner of War camp his pistol has its <b>barrel</b> <b>sawn</b> off, {{as well as his}} brother Phil's gun and all the pistols from Lieutenants of the South. He arrives at his house and finds his wife living in poverty. He {{promises}} her to reunite and three months and travels to Yellowstone to make a living. There, he meets the wealty landowner and banker McCoy, who hires Gary and asks him to arrest a new gangster in town named [...] "Black Jack", who has supposedly wreaked havoc in the community.|$|R
60|$|Maenck {{drew his}} revolver. He broke the <b>barrel,</b> and <b>saw</b> {{that there was}} a good {{cartridge}} in each chamber of the cylinder. He closed it quietly. Then he threw open the door, stepped into the room, took deliberate aim, and fired.|$|R
5000|$|Mill Pond Falls {{was named}} for a saw mill built on Mill Pond in 1860. At that time, Newington was still {{a part of the}} town of Wethersfield and its economy was based on the {{production}} of pipestaves, metal rings that cover whiskey <b>barrels.</b> <b>Saw</b> mills were involved in the production of pipestaves, and therefore essential to town economy. The falls were used as a source for energy for the mill, and their beauty and fame were overlooked for the time being. [...] Mill Pond Falls' contribution to Newington's economy is honored by the Newington Town Seal, on which the falls are the focal point. [...] Today, the sawmill is replaced by the town garage, yet the falls remain. Over the years, the town has taken advantage of the falls' natural beauty by surrounding it with Mill Pond Park, a facility that allows residents to visit and view the falls.|$|R
60|$|The {{dead man}} {{lay on his}} back, {{sprawling}} with outstretched limbs in {{the centre of the}} room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which covered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet. The doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood on the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly injured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with the <b>barrel</b> <b>sawed</b> off a {{foot in front of the}} triggers. It was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had been wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had {{the boys}} taken their position, and looked along their <b>barrels,</b> when they <b>saw</b> a dozen dark figures spring up among the rocks fifty yards away.|$|R
50|$|During the Iraq War, the United States Marine Corps ordered 180 Mk 11 Mod 1 rifles. These were Mk 11s {{equipped}} with the upper receiver of the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System. The M110 upper gave the Mk 11 Mod 1 a URX modular rail system and a flash suppressor on the <b>barrel.</b> These <b>saw</b> limited use before they were phased out when the Marines chose to purchase the Mk 11 Mod 2, which was simply the USSOCOM and U.S. Navy designation for the complete M110 rifle.|$|R
5000|$|Autonomous Challenge: The {{autonomous}} {{challenge is}} the major event. Qualification for this event is required. A fully autonomous ground vehicle must navigate an outdoor obstacle course. The course consists of a lane painted with white or yellow lines on a grassy field. Obstacles come {{in a wide variety}} of shapes and colors including <b>barrels,</b> cones, <b>saw</b> horses, and posts. The vehicles often use a camera to detect the boundary lines and a laser rangefinder to detect obstacles, although a variety of other approaches have been used.|$|R
5000|$|Final model. The RM2 {{was made}} shortly after World War 2 and {{chambered}} for the [...]30-06 US (7.62×63mm) ammunition, which was adopted {{as the new}} standard by the Mexican army during the late 1940s. This weapon was light and dispensed with a quick-detachable <b>barrel.</b> It never <b>saw</b> any significant use outside Mexico.|$|R
60|$|Without a {{word the}} lantern was raised until the light glittered on the <b>barrels.</b> Then I <b>saw</b> nothing {{whatever}} except the gun! In sheer desperation I pulled the trigger. The tremendous {{appearance in the}} dark of the sheet of flame that belched forth, and the crash of the report in the silent night, gave me quite new ideas as to firearms.|$|R
60|$|Around one {{isolated}} potato-barrel stood {{four young}} gentlemen, two black, two white, becomingly dressed, each {{with the head}} of a slender cane pressed against his teeth, and each with a foot propped up on the barrel. Another young gentleman came up, looked longingly at the <b>barrel,</b> but <b>saw</b> no rest for his foot there, and turned pensively away to seek another barrel. He wandered here and there, but without result. Nobody sat upon a barrel, as is the custom of the idle in other lands, yet all the isolated barrels were humanly occupied. Whosoever had a foot to spare put it on a barrel, if all the places on it were not already taken. The habits of all peoples are determined by their circumstances. The Bermudians lean upon barrels because of the scarcity of lamp-posts.|$|R
5000|$|The Ranger's [...] "Big Iron" [...] {{actually}} existed. It was a one-off custom handgun chambered in [...]45 Colt and {{featured a}} Great Western {{copy of the}} Colt Single Action Army frame, Colt 1860 Army backstrap, grip frame and grips and a cut down 9 1/2" [...] Marlin rifle <b>barrel.</b> Marty Robbins <b>saw</b> it in Andy Anderson's famed North Hollywood gun shop in the late 1950s and wrote the song around it. Its current whereabouts are unknown.|$|R
6000|$|They led {{the horses}} into the yard, {{and one of}} Cossar's men, seeing the door open--the whole of the middle portion of the door had been gnawed out--walked into the house. Nobody missed him for the time, the rest being {{occupied}} with the barrels of paraffin, and the first intimation they had of his separation from them was the report of his gun and the whizz of his bullet. [...] "Bang, bang," [...] both barrels, and his first bullet it seems went through the cask of sulphur, smashed out a stave from the further side, and filled the air with yellow dust. Redwood had kept his gun in hand and let fly at something grey that leapt past him. He {{had a vision of}} the broad hind-quarters, the long scaly tail and long soles of the hind-feet of a rat, and fired his second <b>barrel.</b> He <b>saw</b> Bensington drop as the beast vanished round the corner.|$|R
60|$|He pointed {{through the}} brake to a long, low {{building}} that now raised itself, {{white in the}} sunlight, above the many blackened piles. Calvert saw in a single reconnoitring glance that it had but one approach--the flight of steps from the Marsh. Instructing his men to fall in on {{the outer edge of}} the brake and await his orders, he quickly made his way across the space and ascended the steps. Passing along the gallery he knocked at the front door. There was no response. He repeated his knock. Then the window beside it opened suddenly, and he was confronted with the double-muzzle of a long ducking-gun. Glancing instinctively along the <b>barrels,</b> he <b>saw</b> at their other extremity the bright eyes, brilliant color, and small set mouth of a remarkably handsome girl. It was the fact, and to the credit of his training, that he paid more attention to the eyes than to the challenge of the shining tubes before him.|$|R
60|$|THERE was no wind, and {{the night}} was very still, when Appleby lay aching in every limb behind an aloe hedge which cut off the dim white road. Harper sat on the {{steaming}} earth close beside him contemplatively munching {{the end of a}} cigar, for smoking was distinctly inadvisable just then, and he was in need of something to stay the pangs of hunger. Here and there a dusky figure showed among the leaves, and now and then a low murmur or a soft rustling rose from the black shadow of the overhanging palms; but the scarcely audible sound sank once more into the silence, and a muleteer had just passed along the dusty road apparently without the faintest suspicion that rather more than a hundred famishing men had watched him with fingers tightening on their rifle <b>barrels.</b> He <b>saw</b> and heard nothing, which was fortunate for him, and now his voice and the tramp of his team came back faintly across the cane.|$|R
5000|$|To combat an {{apparent}} problem with people throwing coal ashes into the street, the act also required {{every person in}} London, Westminster, Southwark and surrounding suburbs to sweep the area {{in front of their}} house [...] "... every Wednesday and every Saturday in the Weeke". The act also prohibited the hooping of <b>barrels</b> and <b>sawing</b> of stones or rough timber in the streets. Rakers and scavengers were to use [...] "... a Bell Horne Clapper or otherwise and shall make distinct and loud noise and give notice to the Inhabitants of theire coming ..." [...] so [...] "... that all persons concerned may bring forth theire respective Ashes Dust Dirt Filth and Soil to the respective Carts or Carriages". These scavengers were to be elected according to existing customs, and within 20 days rubbish collection rates (to be paid quarterly) were to be set by churchwardens and other leaders of the parish.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{had laid}} their plans, you see," [...] says the Captain, {{taking up the}} Spanish gun across his knees, and looking, lazily, at the {{inlaying}} on the stock, [...] "with {{a great deal of}} art; and the corrupt or blundering local authorities were so easily deceived;" [...] he ran his left hand idly along the <b>barrel,</b> but I <b>saw,</b> with my breath held, that he covered the action of cocking the gun with his right--"so easily deceived, that they summoned us out to come into the trap. But my intention as to future operations--" [...] In a flash the Spanish gun was at his bright eye, and he fired.|$|R
5000|$|A {{prince and}} his men hunted a hind with a golden ring on its horns. A {{darkness}} came over them, and they lost the hind and their way, and separated because they each thought they knew better the way back home. The prince came upon {{a woman on the}} seashore, next to a <b>barrel.</b> He <b>saw</b> a golden ring in the barrel, and mentioned it. The woman said he might have it if he took it out; when he bent over, she pushed him in, fastened the top, and threw it into the sea. It drifted a time, but hit against rocks. He guessed he was near land, kicked out the top, and swam ashore. A giant found him there and took him home to his wife. One day, the giant showed him everything of the house but the parlour. When the giant was gone, he tried to look in As soon as he did, something within moved and tried to speak, frightening him off. He tried two more times, and the third was brave enough to see a great black dog, and that it said, [...] "Choose me, Prince Ring." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{had gone}} {{but a few}} paces along the pier when we came upon an old man, who was evidently a watchman, for he sat in an overset barrel, close {{to a place where}} masons had been lately working upon a break in the pier, and had in front of him a fire such as one sees slung under tinkers' carts. I saw that he was also a voteen, as the peasants say, for there was a rosary hanging from a nail {{on the rim of the}} <b>barrel,</b> and I <b>saw</b> I shuddered, and I did not know why I shuddered. We had passed him a few yards when I heard him cry in Gaelic, 'Idolaters, idolaters, go down to Hell with your witches and your devils; go down to Hell that the {{herrings}} may come again into the bay'; and for some moments I could hear him half screaming and half muttering behind us. 'Are you not afraid,' I said, 'that these wild fishing people may do some desperate thing against you?' ...|$|R
60|$|After {{they had}} been out a month Will found it {{necessary}} to put in to get water. He chose a spot where a little stream could be seen coming down from the mountains and losing itself in the shingle, and he rowed ashore and set some of his men to fill the <b>barrels.</b> When he <b>saw</b> the work fairly under weigh he started to walk along the shore with Dimchurch and Tom. They had gone but a short distance when a number of negroes rushed suddenly out upon them. Will had just time to discharge his pistols before he was knocked senseless by a negro armed with a bludgeon. Tom and Dimchurch stood over him and made a desperate defence, and just before they were overpowered Dimchurch shouted {{at the top of his}} voice: “Put off, we are captured,” for he saw that the number of their assailants was so great that it would only be sacrificing the crew to call them to their assistance. They were bound and carried away by the exulting negroes.|$|R
50|$|A sawed-off shotgun (US, CAN) {{also called}} a sawn-off shotgun (UK, IRL, AU, NZ) and a short-barreled shotgun (SBS) (U.S. {{legislative}} terminology), {{is a type}} of shotgun with a shorter gun barrel—typically under 18 inches—and often a shortened or absent stock. Despite the colloquial term, barrels do not, strictly speaking, have to be shortened with a <b>saw.</b> <b>Barrels</b> can be manufactured at shorter lengths as an alternative to traditional, longer barrels. This makes them easier to transport due to their smaller profile and lighter weight. The design also makes the weapon easy to maneuver in cramped spaces, a feature sought by military close quarters combat units, law enforcement SWAT team users, and home defense purposes. With modern pump action/magazine tube shotguns, the shorter barrel limits the magazine capacity of the weapon due to the magazine tube protruding beyond the barrel. Therefore, the magazine tubes are matched in length to the barrel, which causes a {{reduction in the number of}} shells that can be held in the magazine tube.|$|R
60|$|The Prince, too, had {{got lost}} like the rest, and wandered {{on for a}} time until {{he came to a}} little {{clearing}} in the forest not far from the sea, where he saw a woman sitting on a chair and a big barrel standing beside her. The Prince went up to her and saluted her politely, and she received him very graciously. He looked down into the <b>barrel</b> then, and <b>saw</b> lying at the bottom an unusually beautiful gold ring, which pleased him so much that he could not take his eyes off it. The woman saw this, and said that he might have it if he would take the trouble to get it; for which the Prince thanked her, and said it was at least worth trying. So he leaned over into the barrel, which did not seem very deep, and thought he would easily reach the ring; but the more he stretched down after it the deeper grew the barrel. As he was thus bending down into it the woman suddenly rose up and pushed him in head first, saying that now he could take up his quarters there. Then she fixed the top on the barrel and threw it out into the sea.|$|R
5000|$|Some superstitious fans {{attribute}} the Cubs collapse to an incident at Shea Stadium: A black cat (an omen of bad luck) walked behind the Cubs' on-deck circle where captain Ron Santo was standing. Some fans blame key errors by center fielder Don Young and Santo's immediate criticism. According to Santo, [...] "At no time did I give the impression, {{let alone a}} direct quote, that Don Young cost us the ballgame". Banks stated, however, that after an error by Young, Santo [...] "went crazy. Young was so upset, he ran out ... I had never seen something so hurtful". According to Banks, [...] "They say one apple can spoil the whole <b>barrel,</b> and I <b>saw</b> that", with the incident dividing the team into factions. Still others blame the number of day games that the Cubs had to play. (Lights were not installed in Wrigley Field until 1988.) Chicago's summers are quite humid (85-90 degrees Fahrenheit on average), and playing in this heat day after day may have taken a toll (although the average temperature that summer was 71.8 degrees, which was relatively low). From August 14 {{through the end of}} the season, the Mets had an amazing 38-11 record, while the Cubs record was 18-27 for the same period, slumping to 8-17 in September and 9-18 for September and October.|$|R
