25|$|Costs of {{emptying}} {{septic tanks}}. The cost of emptying septic tanks can be significant. Some people avoid using their septic tanks, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> do the tank fills up {{more quickly and}} they must pay to empty it more often.

25|$|In the {{introductory}} paragraph, Colet concludes {{by stating that}} his presence {{is due to the}} need for the Council to consider a Church reformation. First, Colet criticises the living style of the priests. Colet explains that the priests should set an example for others as be a beacon of light, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are instead figures of darkness, the Church will be engulfed by darkness. Colet cites four evils, referencing the Apostle, that constitute the corrupt, priestly living: devilish pride, carnal concupiscence, worldly covetousness, and worldly occupations.|$|E
25|$|Including {{the lower}} bending stiffness, {{composite}} baseball bats {{have a higher}} damping rate. The damping rate corresponds to how quickly the material lessens the vibrations it is experiencing. Russell also states that composite bats have a damping rate anywhere from 2 to 10 times more than standard aluminum bat. Many ball players therefore refer to composite bats as more forgiving <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> do not {{make contact with the}} ball on the sweet spot, they will not feel the vibrations (sting) from the missed hit.|$|E

50|$|Some greyfields {{may also}} be {{considered}} favorable to investors <b>because</b> even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are outclassed or physically in disrepair, they have revenue in place through long- or short-term leases. Greyfields with short-term leases may work well for an investor/developer who has a strategy involving intensive real estate asset management. By actively managing the greyfield in a short-term lease environment, rents may be increased after improvements are made.|$|R
25|$|In Eastern Christianity it {{is common}} to hang {{decorated}} common ostrich eggs on the chains holding the oil lamps. The initial reason was probably to prevent mice and rats from climbing down the chain to eat the oil. Another, symbolical explanation is based in the fictitious tradition that female common ostriches do not sit on their eggs, but stare at them incessantly until they hatch out, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> stop staring even for a second the egg will addle. This is equated to the obligation of the Christian to direct his entire attention towards God during prayer, lest the prayer be fruitless.|$|E
25|$|According to the Life of St. Macarius, when he {{was still}} a baby, he would start crying every time he heard the ringing of the bells of the nearby church. There was no way to console the child. The parents would not want to bring the baby boy to the church, afraid that he would disturb the service with his crying; but {{eventually}} they decided to try. And, to their surprise, as soon as they brought the child to the church, he became quiet, smiling joyfully. From this time on, the parents had to attend every service at the parish church, and to take the child with them, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> stayed at home during the service, the baby would again start crying.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, cores {{are usually}} supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means {{are required to}} support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied {{in the form of}} chaplets. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects or create a weak spot in the casting. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets are stronger than the lower ones because the core will want to float up in the molten metal.|$|E
50|$|When a Tenctonese falls ill, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are recuperating in a hospital, it is {{customary}} {{to bring}} them gifts of living things such as small animals or potted plants to brighten their mood. Conversely, it is considered disturbing {{to bring them}} a gift of {{a bouquet of flowers}} (as humans often do in hospitals), <b>because</b> even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are still fresh and colorful, the flowers are technically dead - and it is morbid to remind a sick person about mortality.|$|R
50|$|After the Gilberts and Marshalls were taken, the Allies built naval bases, fortifications, and airfields on {{the islands}} to prepare for {{an assault on the}} Marianas. The Japanese defeat forced {{military}} leaders to draw back to a new defensive perimeter, the Absolute National Defense Zone, which included the Marianas and Palau. These islands were heavily fortified for an upcoming assault <b>because</b> <b>if</b> captured, <b>they</b> would put American heavy bombers within range of Tokyo.|$|R

[...] An animatronic version of Chamberlain's head which operated by remote control was used in some scenes. [...] Some of the actors had to only pretend to look at the animatronic head during their scenes, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> looked at it while it responded, they would laugh and break character.|$|E
500|$|The {{first result}} {{had already been}} {{determined}} by G. Bauer in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called hypergeometric series, which had first been researched by Leonhard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Hardy found these results [...] "much more intriguing" [...] than Gauss's work on integrals. After seeing Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy commented that the theorems [...] "defeated me completely; I {{had never seen anything}} in the least like them before". He figured that Ramanujan's theorems [...] "must be true, <b>because,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them". Hardy asked a colleague, J. E. Littlewood, {{to take a look at}} the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were [...] "certainly the most remarkable I have received" [...] and said that Ramanujan was [...] "a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power". One colleague, E. H. Neville, later remarked that [...] "not one [...] could have been set in the most advanced mathematical examination in the world".|$|E

500|$|According to {{historian}} John Barry, William Arnold was {{banished from}} Hingham {{for reasons that}} were not religious, {{but he does not}} give the actual reason, nor does he cite any sources. [...] Years later, Arnold's son Benedict recorded in the family record: [...] "Memm. [...] We came to Providence to Dwell the 20th of April, 1636. [...] per me Bennedict Arnold." [...] He was using the name Providence loosely, since Providence Plantation had not yet been founded. The Arnolds initially settled with Roger Williams at Seekonk near the western edge of Plymouth Colony where Rehoboth is today. [...] William Arnold stated in 1659: [...] "for as much that I was one that the very first day entred [...] with some others upon the land of providence, and so laid out my money to buy and helpe pay for it". [...] The settlers could not remain in Seekonk <b>because,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did, Plymouth would be harangued by Massachusetts for harboring its fugitives. [...] Plymouth governor Edward Winslow gently urged Williams to move with his fellow settlers across the Seekonk River into the lands of the Narragansetts. [...] Most historians agree that it was about June 1636 when the small group of settlers moved across the river and settled {{on the bank of the}} Moshassuck River at a place which Williams named Providence Plantation.|$|E

[...] Similarly, systematic desensitization may also be used. Many patients can deal with exposure easier if they are {{in the company of a}} friend on whom they can rely. Patients must remain in the situation until anxiety has abated, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> leave the situation, the phobic response will not decrease and it may even rise.|$|E

Later, Ismail was a critic of Lee Kuan Yew, the Singaporean Prime Minister, for his attempt to de-emphasise race in Malaysian politics through the establishment of a non-racial political coalition, the Malaysian Solidarity Council (MSC).
