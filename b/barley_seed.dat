Although this modification process {{is important for}} malt quality, the modification patterns of individual <b>barley</b> <b>seeds</b> {{have yet to be}} reported. The use of destructive microscopy methods have previously limited the investigations to ensemble averages. X-ray dark-field radiography is a recent non-destructive imaging method which is sensitive to microstructural variations. In this study, the method was applied for quantitative in-situ monitoring of <b>barley</b> <b>seeds.</b> Microstructural changes relating to water uptake and modification were monitored over a 43 - 55 h period. Sub-resolution stress cracks as well as a dark-field signal believed to originate from starch granules were detected. The evolution of the dark-field signal followed the known modification pattern in <b>barley</b> <b>seeds.</b> Through image analysis, quantitative parameters describing the movement of the front of the observed pattern were obtained. Based on these findings, X-ray dark-field radiography presents a possible novel approach to monitor the modification of germinating <b>barley</b> <b>seeds.</b> Comment: 5 figures, 2 tables, 16 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the changes induced upon germination and growth rate, expressed by vigor index of <b>barley</b> <b>seeds</b> exposed to microwave (MW) treatment. As a microwave source was used a magnetron MWG 20 H, which emits radiation with a frequency of 2. 45 GHz. In the experiment, <b>barley</b> <b>seeds</b> were exposed for 0 s, 10 s and 20 s. The germination energy (GE) and germination (G), cotyledon length (CL), leaves length (LL) and roots length (RL) in cm were determined on the 3 th, 7 th and 14 th day after irradiation in order to estimate the influence of microwave treatment on them. The hypothesis was that seeds exposed to MW will behave differently than those unexposed. It was observed that the best results in terms of GE, G and vigor index (SVI) were obtained in <b>barley</b> <b>seeds</b> for the treatment with output microwaves power of 400 W for 20 s. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Diastase was {{the first}} enzyme discovered. It was {{extracted}} from malt solution in 1833 by Anselme Payen and Jean-François Persoz, chemists at a French sugar factory. The name [...] "diastase" [...] comes from the Greek word διάστασις (diastasis) (a parting, a separation) because, when beer mash is heated, the enzyme causes the starch in the <b>barley</b> <b>seed</b> to transform quickly into soluble sugars and hence the husk to separate {{from the rest of}} the seed.

Engels often cited the case of the <b>barley</b> <b>seed</b> which, in its natural state, germinates and out of its own death or negation produces a plant. The plant in turn grows to maturity and is itself negated after bearing many barley seeds. Thus, all nature is constantly expanding through dying. The elements of opposition which produce conflict in each thing and give it motion also tend to negate the thing itself; but out of this dynamic process of dying the energy is released to expand and produce many more entities of the same kind.³ ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{tetrazolium}} test is used {{to control}} seed quality of various plant species since it allows a rapid evaluation of viability. Freshly harvested <b>barley</b> <b>seeds</b> show dormancy that can make the germination test ineffective for an immediate evaluation. Therefore, {{the development of more}} efficient methods, such as the tetrazolium test, is necessary. The objective of this research work was to study various procedures for performing the tetrazolium test on <b>barley</b> <b>seeds.</b> Five lots of cv. BRS 195 <b>barley</b> <b>seeds</b> were used and subjected to the following treatments: two different methods of seed preconditioning (direct immersion in H 2 O and between sheets of moistened paper towels); two types of preparation for staining (longitudinal cross-section of the seed through the embryo with immersion of one half in a 2, 3, 5 triphenyl tetrazolium chloride solution or placing both halves on top of filter paper moistened with the tetrazolium salt solution); two methods of staining (on top of filter paper and direct immersion in the tetrazolium salt solution). Three concentrations of the tetrazolium salt solution (0. 1 %, 0. 5 %, and 1. 0 %) were used. It was concluded that the tetrazolium test on <b>barley</b> <b>seeds</b> may be accomplished with preconditioning by direct immersion in H 2 O and staining by immersing in a 0. 1 % or 0. 5 % concentration of tetrazolium salt solution or staining on top of filter paper moistened with such solution at a 1. 0 % concentration...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the thiamethoxan influence in the physiological performance of wheat and <b>barley</b> <b>seeds.</b> It was used seeds of two wheat and barley cultivars, and product concentrations of 0. 0, 150, 300, 450, 600 ml of thiamethoxan to 100 kg of seeds. To evaluate the physiological quality of seeds, it was conducted the tests of germination, first count, cold, lengths of seedlings, shoots and roots and emergence in field. The product tiamethoxan stimulates the physiological performance of wheat and <b>barley</b> <b>seeds,</b> with varying intensity according to cultivar.

40|$|This study explores {{metabolic}} {{responses of}} germinating <b>barley</b> <b>seeds</b> upon {{the application of}} pulsed electric fields (PEE).

The seeds were then allowed to finish germination in saturated air. It is shown that exposure of germinating barley to PEE affects radicle emergence without significantly affecting the seeds gross metabolic activity, as quantified by isothermal calorimetry. An exploration of protein 2 -DE profiles of both the embryo and the starchy endosperm showed that, at the studied time scale, no significant changes were found in proteins present at concentrations higher than the detection limit. However, western blotting demonstrated that a-amylase concentration decreases in the PEF-treated seeds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Highly significant positive correlations among initial seed infestation, primary infection of seedlings and disease severity during the growing season as well as among disease severity at flowering and infestation of the harvested grains were found. The seed infestation level was much less than proportionally related to the primary infection of seedlings and to the disease severity later in the season.
