In a stream cipher the plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time, and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption. Also known as a state cipher, the stream cipher was invented in 1917 by Gilbert Sandford Vernam at Bell Labs.|$|E
25|$|Windows Media Audio (WMA) is {{the most}} common codec of the four WMA codecs. Colloquial usage of the term WMA, {{especially}} in marketing materials and device specifications, usually refers to this codec only. The first version of the codec released in 1999 is regarded as WMA 1. In the same year, the <b>bit</b> <b>stream</b> syntax, or compression algorithm, was altered in minor ways and became WMA 2. Since then, newer versions of the codec have been released, but the decoding process remained the same, ensuring compatibility between codec versions. WMA is a lossy audio codec based on the study of psychoacoustics. Audio signals that are deemed to be imperceptible to the human ear are encoded with reduced resolution during the compression process.|$|E

25|$|The codec's <b>bit</b> <b>stream</b> syntax {{was frozen}} {{at the first}} version, WMA 9 Pro. Later {{versions}} of WMA Pro introduced low-bit rate encoding, low-delay audio, frequency interpolation mode, and an expanded range of sampling rate and bit-depth encoding options. A WMA 10 Pro file compressed with frequency interpolation mode comprises a WMA 9 Pro track encoded at half the original sampling rate, which is then restored using a new compression algorithm. In this situation, WMA 9 Pro players which have not been updated to the WMA 10 Pro codec can only decode the lower quality WMA 9 Pro stream. Starting with WMA 10 Pro, eight channel encoding starts at 128kbit/s, and tracks can be encoded at the native audio CD resolution (44.1kHz, 16-bit), previously the domain of WMA Standard.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentally, WMA is a {{transform}} coder {{based on}} modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), somewhat similar to AAC, Cook and Vorbis. The <b>bit</b> <b>stream</b> of WMA {{is composed of}} superframes, each containing 1 or more frames of 2048 samples. If the bit reservoir is not used, a frame is equal to a superframe. Each frame contains a number of blocks, which are 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048 samples long after being transformed into the frequency domain via the MDCT. In the frequency domain, masking for the transformed samples is determined, and then used to requantize the samples. Finally, the floating point samples are decomposed into coefficient and exponent parts and independently huffman coded. Stereo information is typically mid/side coded. At low bit rates, line spectral pairs (typically less than 17kbit/s) and a form of noise coding (typically less than 33kbit/s) {{can also be used}} to improve quality.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{paradigm}} of logical computation on stochastic <b>bit</b> <b>streams</b> has several key advantages compared to deterministic computa-tion based on binary radix, including error-tolerance and low hardware area cost. Prior {{research has shown}} that sequential logic operating on stochastic <b>bit</b> <b>streams</b> can compute non-polynomial functions, such as the tanh function, with less energy than conventional implementations. However, the functions that can be computed in this way are quite limited. For example, high order polynomials and non-polynomial functions cannot be computed using prior approaches. This paper proposes a new finite-state machine (FSM) topology for complex arithmetic computation on stochastic <b>bit</b> <b>streams.</b> It describes a general methodology for syn-thesizing such FSMs. Experimental results show that these FSM-based implementations are more tolerant of soft errors and less costly in terms of the area-time product that conventional implementations.

40|$|Abstract — Heterodyne {{generation}} of parallel random <b>bit</b> <b>streams</b> from chaotic emission of an optically injected semicon-ductor laser is investigated. The continuous-wave optical injection invokes chaotic dynamics in the laser. The broadband chaotic emission is detected through optical heterodyning and electrical heterodyning into different channels. The channels digitize the signals into parallel independent random <b>bit</b> <b>streams.</b> Because of efficient utilization of different {{portions of the}} chaos bandwidth, heterodyne detections enable parallel {{generation of}} random <b>bit</b> <b>streams,</b> offer high total output bit rates, and require no high-bandwidth analogue-to-digital converters. In the experiment, two optical heterodyne channels and four electrical heterodyne channels are implemented. Each channel is required to digitize only 2. 5 GHz of a much broader chaos bandwidth. The sampling rate is 10 GHz with five least significant bits selected from every 8 -bit sample. The total output bit rate reaches 100 Gb/s and 200 Gb/s for optical and electrical heterodyning, respectively.
