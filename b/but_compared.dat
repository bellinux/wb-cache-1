5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, <b>but</b> <b>compared</b> with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E

25|$|The metametals are zinc, cadmium, mercury, indium, thallium, tin and lead. They are ductile {{elements}} <b>but,</b> <b>compared</b> {{to their}} metallic periodic table neighbours to the left, have lower melting points, relatively low electrical and thermal conductivities, and show distortions from close-packed forms. Sometimes beryllium and gallium are included as metametals despite having low ductility.|$|E
25|$|In {{the east}} side of Toronto, areas near Don River {{received}} some flooding, but it was not as severe due to the substantially smaller amount of rainfall. Since most of the rain still went into the river, the level of the water rose substantially, and there was some flooding, <b>but</b> <b>compared</b> to the Humber or Etobicoke Creek, there was relatively little property damage, and no loss of life was reported.|$|E
25|$|It {{was from}} around 1770 that Arnold {{developed}} the portable precision timekeeper, {{almost from the}} point where John Harrison ended his work in this field. <b>But,</b> <b>compared</b> to Harrison's complicated and expensive watch, Arnold's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable. Importantly, the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity {{at a reasonable price}} whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment.|$|E

25|$|The flow of European {{immigration}} continued {{during the}} 1950s and afterward; <b>but</b> <b>compared</b> {{to the previous}} decade, it diminished considerably. The Marshall Plan implemented by the United States to help Europe recover {{from the consequences of}} World War II was working, and emigration lessened. During the period 1951–1960, only 242,889 Europeans entered Argentina: 142,829 were Italians, 98,801 were Spaniards, 934 were French, and 325 were Poles. The next decade (1961–1970), the total number of European immigrants barely reached 13,363 (9,514 Spaniards, 1,845 Poles, 1,266 French and 738 Russians).|$|E
25|$|Foregoing a full album, {{the band}} {{released}} two EPs in 1984, Remote Luxury in March and Persia in August, {{but only in}} Australia and New Zealand. Both EPs reached the Top50 on the Australian Albums Chart. Again, almost all tracks were written by Kilbey, <b>but</b> <b>compared</b> to Seance, the atmosphere was lighter and less gloomy. The band's trademark guitar sound was complemented by the keyboards of guest musicians Davey Ray Moor (from The Crystal Set, which included Kilbey's brother Russell) and Craig Hooper (from The Reels), who joined as an auxiliary member. Hooper soon left to form The Mullanes.|$|E
25|$|As in Mexico, some {{elements}} of the Catholic Church in the United States are trying to combat Santa Muerte worship, in Chicago particularly. <b>But</b> <b>compared</b> to the Catholic Church in Mexico, the official reaction in the U.S. is mostly either non-existent or muted. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has not issued an official position on this relatively new phenomenon in the country. Opposition to the veneration of Santa Muerte took an unprecedented violent turn in late January, 2013, when vandal(s) smashed a controversial statue of the folk saint, which {{had appeared in the}} San Benito, Texas, municipal cemetery {{at the beginning of the}} month.|$|E

25|$|The Matthew Cooke Manuscript is {{the second}} oldest of the Old Charges or Gothic Constitutions of Freemasonry, and the oldest known set of charges to be written in prose. It {{contains}} some repetition, <b>but</b> <b>compared</b> to the Regius there is also much new material, much of which is repeated in later constitutions. After an opening thanksgiving prayer, the text enumerates the Seven Liberal Arts, giving precedence to geometry, which it equates with masonry. There follows {{the tale of the}} children of Lamech, expanded from the Book of Genesis. Jabal discovered geometry, and became Cain's Master Mason. Jubal discovered music, Tubal Cain discovered metallurgy and the art of the smith, while Lamech's daughter Naamah invented weaving. Discovering that the earth would be destroyed either by fire or by flood, they inscribed all their knowledge on two pillars of stone, one that would be impervious to fire, and one that would not sink. Generations after the flood both pillars were discovered, one by Pythagoras, the other by the philosopher Hermes. The seven sciences were then passed down through Nimrod, the architect of the Tower of Babel, to Abraham, who taught them to the Egyptians, including Euclid, who in turn taught masonry to the children of the nobility as an instructive discipline. The craft is then taught to the children of Israel, and from the Temple of Solomon finds its way to France, and thence to Saint Alban's England. Athelstan now became one of a line of kings actively supporting masonry. His youngest son, unnamed here, is introduced {{for the first time as}} leader and mentor of masons. There follow nine articles and nine points, and the document finishes in a similar manner to the Regius.|$|E

Federal Election Commission decision as [...] "uninformed, arrogant, naïve", and, decrying its effects and the future scandals {{he thought it would}} bring, said it would become considered the court's [...] "worst decision ... in the 21st century". McCain took the lead in opposing the defense spending sequestrations brought on by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and gained attention for defending State Department aide Huma Abedin against charges brought by a few House Republicans that she had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.|$|E

500|$|The {{underside}} of the BT49 is shaped to create downforce through ground effect: air is accelerated under the car, reducing the air pressure beneath it and pushing the tyres down harder onto the track. This provides more grip and thus higher cornering speeds, <b>but</b> <b>compared</b> to conventional wings creates less of the drag that slows the car in a straight line. In its original form, the reduced pressure area under the car was sealed off with sliding skirts which rose and fell with {{the movement of the}} car to ensure no air could leak under it. According to Murray, the aerodynamics were the car's great strength: [...] "It had more [...] than any other car and it all came from the ground effect. We ran the car with no front wing at all and scarcely any at the back." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{gave the}} film a mixed review. He wrote, [...] " [...] is an instant guilty pleasure, a gorgeously shot, {{visually}} complex film whose badness is what's so good about it. You might howl at the sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with the body-fatiguing, mind-numbing rigors of ballet, but its lurid imagery and a hellcat competition between two rival dancers is pretty irresistible." [...] Honeycutt commended Millepied's [...] "sumptuous" [...] choreography and Libatique's [...] "darting, weaving" [...] camera work. The critic {{said of the}} thematic mashup, [...] "Aronofsky ... never succeeds in wedding genre elements {{to the world of}} ballet ... White Swan/Black Swan dynamics almost work, but the horror-movie nonsense drags everything down the rabbit hole of preposterousness." [...] Similarly, in a piece for The Huffington Post, Rob Kirkpatrick praised Portman's performance <b>but</b> <b>compared</b> the film's story to that of Showgirls (1995) and Burlesque (2010) while concluding Black Swan is [...] "simply higher-priced cheese, Aronofsky's camembert to [...] Antin's cheddar.|$|E
500|$|On 9 January 1884 Carmen {{was given}} its first New York Metropolitan Opera performance, to a mixed {{critical}} reception. The New York Times welcomed Bizet's [...] "pretty and effective work", <b>but</b> <b>compared</b> Zelia Trebelli's {{interpretation of the}} title role unfavourably with that of Minnie Hauk. Thereafter Carmen was quickly incorporated into the Met's regular repertory. In February 1906 Enrico Caruso sang José at the Met for the first time; he continued to perform in this role until 1919, two years before his death. On 17 April 1906, on tour with the Met, he sang the role at the Grand Opera House in San Francisco. Afterwards he sat up until 3 am reading the reviews in the early editions of the following day's papers. Two hours later he was awakened by the first violent shocks of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, after which {{he and his fellow}} performers made a hurried escape from the Palace Hotel.|$|E
