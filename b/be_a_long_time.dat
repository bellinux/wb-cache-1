5|$|The first {{operations}} in 1940 concerned Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain by the Wehrmacht. The unit was to receive 30 PR Supermarine Spitfire aircraft, specialised and adapted for reconnaissance use. They would {{be capable of}} 1,750 miles round trips. However, just 13 aircraft were available to the unit, and their range limited to 1,300 miles. Eventually, an assortment of Vickers Wellington and Spitfire flights were established. In August 1940, the first PR Spitfires arrived, but teething problems ensured that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before standardisation was achieved with equipment. In August, Coastal Command flew 193 sorties over the suspected invasion ports in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E

It {{took two}} minutes to fuel before launch, which could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> in {{high-speed}} intercepts, and its hypergolic propellants (hydrazine and nitric acid) were very dangerous to handle, leading to several serious accidents.|$|E
25|$|Barrett had a {{tremendous}} impact on the developing field of social work and on services for women and children. Under her leadership, the NFCM became an established social service organization that provided a wide spectrum of services to women. The mission initiated activities that many now consider essential services for women and children. Florence Crittenton homes pioneered women-oriented policies in the areas of health care, employment for women, and children's rights. The organization campaigned for equality for women and for recognition of women's needs... Despite differences in class and race with most of their clients, FC volunteers tried to emphasize gender identity.... It would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before a group of women had the resources to duplicate Crittenton efforts.|$|E

25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E
500|$|Modeled on the Montgomery Bus Boycott, protest {{actions in}} Birmingham began in 1962, when {{students}} from local colleges {{arranged for a}} year of staggered boycotts.

[...] Despite the adverse publicity, Bottomley was returned by the electors of Hackney South {{at each of the}} two 1910 general elections; his tactics included recruiting men in boots tipped and heeled with iron, who marched outside his opponent's meetings and rendered the speeches inaudible. In June 1910 he founded the John Bull League, with a mission to promote [...] "commonsense business methods" [...] into government; readers of the magazine could join the League for a shilling (5p) a year. Although still nominally a Liberal, Bottomley had become a trenchant critic of his party, and often aligned himself with the Conservative opposition in attacking Asquith's government.|$|E

500|$|The Leicester Chronicle {{suspected}} that [...] "it will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> perhaps, {{before we have}} another match so keenly contested". The visitors scored early on, but Small Heath's shoot-on-sight policy produced goals for Hands, after a clash with Mobley left Preston goalkeeper James Trainer on the floor, and for Wheldon, before Edward Brueton, deputising in goal for the injured Partridge, let in a soft goal just before half-time. The second half brought [...] "more finesse and less vigour" [...] from the home side, but Preston grew stronger, took the lead, and Small Heath [...] "appeared to be done with". Then Trainer could only turn Mobley's lob in off the post, the same player gave his side the lead, but [...] "before the Small Heath contingent had finished congratulating one another", [...] "North End charging down the field finely from the centre kick scored again before the whistle sounded" [...] to make the final score 4–4. Match receipts totalled nearly £250, a ground record.|$|E

Canning said that despite the Tracy character not having too much screen time here [...] "his bits were funny, and his idea to add a woman to his entourage {{had a lot of}} potential", and noted that Liz/Randy's plot ended [...] "brilliantly" [...] when the story crossed over to Jenna/James Franco's storyline. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave it a positive review writing it was a [...] "good episode", and [...] "ot one of the best but it still had enough funny situations", and thanked NBC for broadcasting two episodes. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons remarked that the two episodes were terrific, and what stood out from both airings [...] "was how much serialized plot these two eps covered... For a show that's usually so episodic, it was an interesting—totally successful—change of pace." ...|$|E

Nelson found himself towards {{the rear of the}} British line and realised that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before he could bring Captain into action. Instead of continuing to follow the line, Nelson disobeyed orders and wore ship, breaking from the line and heading to engage the Spanish van, which consisted of the 112-gun San Josef, the 80-gun San Nicolas and the 130-gun Santísima Trinidad. Captain engaged all three, assisted by [...] which had come to Nelson's aid. After an hour of exchanging broadsides which left both Captain and Culloden badly damaged, Nelson found himself alongside San Nicolas. He led a boarding party across, crying [...] "Westminster Abbey or glorious victory!" [...] and forced her to surrender. San Josef attempted to come to the San Nicolas’s aid, but became entangled with her compatriot and was left immobile. Nelson led his party from the deck of San Nicolas onto San Josef and captured her as well. As night fell, the Spanish fleet broke off and sailed for Cadiz. Four ships had surrendered to the British and two of them were Nelson's.|$|E

[...] Conversely, Pamela Hansford Johnson of the New Statesman called Advise and Consent [...] "politically repellent and artistically null with a steady hysterical undertone." ...|$|E

Stead's team had earlier won two games against the Duke of Richmond's XI (also representing Sussex) and their victory over Gage's XI was reported as [...] "the third time this summer that the Kent men have been too expert for those of Sussex".|$|E
2500|$|The {{advent of}} practical, {{widespread}} portable ultrasonography (point-of-care ultrasonography) {{in the late}} 1990s to early 2000s led some physicians to ask how soon it would be before stethoscopes would become obsolete. Others answered that they thought {{the relationship of the}} various tools (stethoscopes and digital devices) would change but that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before stethoscopes were obsolete. A decade later, in 2016, the same two sides of the coin were still recognized. One cardiologist said, [...] "the stethoscope is dead", but a pediatrician said, [...] "We are not at the place, and probably won't be for a very long time", where stethoscopes were obsolete. One consideration is that it depends on the segment of health care (emergency medical services, nursing, medicine) and the specialty. [...] "Stethoscopes retain their value for listening to lungs and bowels for clues of disease, experts agree." [...] But for the cardiovascular system, [...] "auscultation is superfluous", one cardiologist said. Thus, it could be that cardiology in the secondary and tertiary care settings may abandon the stethoscope many years before primary care, pediatrics, and physical therapy do.|$|E

[...] Their films were contracted to United Artists, and when United Artists went into bankruptcy and restructuring in 1950, the films of Gloria Films were tied up in litigation and the couple lost everything. [...] Many small production companies went bankrupt as a result of United Artists' troubles – Caspary could not afford to, as she would have lost future royalties for works she had already written and any payments for reprints of her books.
