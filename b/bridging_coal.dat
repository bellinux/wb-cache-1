50|$|Kander is {{best known}} for his Yangtze - The Long River series, for which he earned the Prix Pictet Prize. Kander made several voyages along the course of China's Yangtze River, {{travelling}} upstream from mouth to source over a period of three years. Using the river as a metaphor the journey begins at the coastal estuary, where thousands of ships leave and enter each day, and moves past renowned suicide <b>bridges,</b> <b>coal</b> mines and the largest dam in the world - the Three Gorges Dam. Further inland we encounter Chongqing - the fastest-growing urban centre on the planet. Kander never photographed further than twenty miles from the river itself. In the shadow of epic construction projects we see workers, fishermen, swimmers and a man washing his motorbike in the river. Dense architecture gives way to mountains in the upper reaches towards the river's Tibetan source - a sparsely populated area where the stream is mostly broken ice and just ankle deep. The photographs are dominated by immense architectural structures where humans are shown as small in their environment. Figures are dwarfed by landscapes of half completed bridges and colossal Western-style apartment blocks that are rapidly replacing traditional Chinese low-rise buildings and houseboats.|$|R
5000|$|The Sandfly Colliery Tramway (also {{known as}} the Kaoota Tramway) was a 20 km, [...] narrow gauge tramway linking the Kaoota Mine to Margate, Tasmania. Constructed in 1905-06, the Tramway climbed 457 m above sea level and crossed ten <b>bridges.</b> After <b>coal</b> mining ceased the tramway was used to {{transport}} logs, fruit and passengers. The line was lifted and abandoned in 1922 after bushfires destroyed several bridges along the line. Currently, 6 km of the old track is used as cycling/walking tracks, while {{the remainder of the}} old line is on private property.|$|R
25|$|He was {{a leading}} proponent of Wivenhoe and Burdekin Dams, {{encouraging}} the modernising and electrifying of the Queensland railway system, {{and the construction of}} the Gateway <b>Bridge.</b> Airports, <b>coal</b> mines, power stations, and dams were built throughout the state. James Cook University was established. In Brisbane, the Queensland Cultural Centre, Griffith University, the Southeast Freeway, and the Captain Cook, Gateway and Merivale bridges were all constructed, as well as the Parliamentary Annexe that was attached to Queensland Parliament House. Bjelke-Petersen was one of the instigators of World Expo 88 (now South Bank Parklands) and the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games.|$|R
50|$|Rothley {{station was}} built partly {{in a cutting}} {{at the north end}} (across which the bridge 354 crosses) and on an {{embankment}} at the south end.

500|$|The new station {{opened on}} 10 August 1885, and was {{originally}} known as [...] "Patchway & Stoke Gifford", but reverted to [...] "Patchway" [...] from 27 October 1908. The station {{was on a}} north/south alignment and had two platforms, separated by two running lines, with a third line, a goods loop, behind the western platform. There was a goods yard {{to the south of}} the station on the eastern side, with an adjacent signal box. As now, the eastern platform was for trains towards Bristol, the western platform for trains towards Wales. The station buildings were of a standard 1880s GWR design, with tall chimneys and fretted wooden canopies. The main building was on the eastern platform, containing the booking office, toilets, and waiting rooms. A matching brick shelter with canopy was built on the western platform. The eastern platform also had a [...] "bicycle house" [...] at the northern end. A large covered and glazed footbridge linked the two platforms. The goods yard included two sidings: a short, south-facing one adjacent to a loading dock; and a longer north-facing one. There was also a weigh <b>bridge,</b> <b>coal</b> office. At {{the north end of the}} station was a south-facing siding and an oil store. The station did not have a dedicated approach road as it was adjacent to the road between Gloucester Road to the west and Gypsy Patch Lane to the south. The road subsequently became known as Station Road. At the time of construction, the station was mostly surrounded by fields, with the Bristol conurbation almost [...] away.|$|R
50|$|The Coal River Valley {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} areas used by the first British settlers outside Hobart; the nearby town of Richmond dates from 1823 when a <b>bridge</b> across the <b>Coal</b> River was constructed. The name Coal River comes from the abundant natural source of coal in the area. The first British settlers used the valley as a mixture of grazing, pastureland and crop growing.|$|R

40|$|Since {{our last}} {{quarterly}} report our research activities {{have focused on}} characterization of coal macromolecule by P. chrysosporium in vivo in;two different culture media and by sodium oxalate in vitro. Wood rotting fungi mediate solubilization of low rank coal by secreting oxalic acid which chelates metal ions whose chelating metal ions oxalic acid breaks these ionic <b>bridges</b> rendering the <b>coal</b> macromolecules water soluble. Thus solubization by sodium oxalate in vitro represents a biomimetic process...|$|R
40|$|Coal seam gas (CSG) {{is gaining}} global {{interests}} {{due to its}} natural abundance and environmental benefits in comparison to more traditional energy sources. To efficiently recover this clean and abundant energy, a detailed understanding of the fundamental properties of coal is required, which makes the coal characterisation be of paramount importance. However, coal is highly heterogeneous at multiscales, such that the characterisation of coal lags behind that of conventional reservoir rocks. X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) has been widely applied to obtain the 3 D digital representation of the coal samples. However, micro-CT images always suffer from a trade-off between the sample size to be scanned and the obtained resolution, and commonly pose a major challenge for direct numerical simulations due to the simulation instabilities. This thesis designs a complete and comprehensive coal characterisation framework, and demonstrates the capability of a digital model, named “Digital Coal”, {{can be used to}} characterise the multiscale structure of coal as well as petrophysical properties. The “Digital Coal” model developed in this thesis can preserve multiscale features of real coal samples, including the coal lithotype distribution on centimetre-length scale, cleat network and mineralisation on millimetre- to centimetre-length scale as well as cleat rough surface structure on micrometre-length scale. Our developed “Digital Coal” integrates multiscale geostatistics that are obtained from micro-CT data of different resolutions. Hence, it is not restricted by imaging resolution and can be constructed with extended domain size. Therefore, “Digital Coal” can act {{as an alternative to the}} segmented micro-CT images, such that we can avoid the challenges that are inherent to micro-CT images, such as the resolution limitation and segmentation errors. This study <b>bridges</b> <b>coal</b> properties at multiple scales, which can be potentially applied for the prediction of CSG and water production on reservoir scales by populating the model into reservoir simulators...|$|R
50|$|Completed in 1932, the two-lane Ben Williamson <b>Bridge</b> connects <b>Coal</b> Grove, Ohio to Ashland, Kentucky, {{crossing}} the Ohio River. Named for Senator Ben M. Williamson, it was formerly a two-way span before the parallel Simeon Willis Memorial Bridge was completed upstream in 1985, {{it is used}} for Kentucky-bound traffic today. In 1989, the bridge was closed and renovated during which time traffic in both directions was diverted to the Willis Bridge. In early 2007, traffic was again diverted to the Willis Bridge in order to renovate and paint the bridge. The bridge was reopened on October 30, 2007. The bridge was also closed briefly and traffic again diverted to the Willis Bridge {{in the summer of}} 2013 after a tractor-trailer ran into the tower on the Ohio side.|$|R
40|$|Nigeria is richly {{endowed with}} vast natural {{resources}} that are widely distributed across the country among these are;solid minerals, petroleum and natural gas. About fifty solid minerals have been discovered in five hundred locations in the country (Alison-Madueke, 2009). As a result of this, mining is done virtually in all {{the states of the}} federation. Mining industries have been viewed as key drivers of economic growth and the development process, as lead sectors that drive economic expansion which can lead to higher levels of social and economic well being (<b>Bridge,</b> 2008). <b>Coal</b> and tin ranked high as Nigeria‟s foreign exchange earners during the colonial period and after the country‟s independence in 1960, other minerals such as limestone, gold, marble, clay etc were mined to a lesser degree mainly for local consumption (Adekeye, 1999) ...|$|R

50|$|Some of {{the canals}} {{opening in the}} 1790s offered routes for traffic by-passing large {{sections}} of the River Trent. By 1796 the Derby Canal connected directly to the Erewash Canal at Sandiacre and the River Trent at Swarkestone. The Nottingham Canal ran from the Erewash Canal junction at Langley Mill, which itself linked to the Cromford Canal, down to the River Trent near Trent <b>Bridge</b> in Nottingham. <b>Coal</b> from Derbyshire could be transported to Nottingham and Derby without using the river.|$|R
50|$|The British Industrial Revolution is {{characterized}} by developments {{in the areas of}} textile manufacturing, mining, metallurgy and transport driven by the development of the steam engine. Above all else, the revolution was driven by cheap energy in the form of coal, produced in ever-increasing amounts from the abundant resources of Britain. Coal converted to coke gave the blast furnace and cast iron in much larger amounts than before, and a range of structures could be created, such as The Iron <b>Bridge.</b> Cheap <b>coal</b> meant that industry was no longer constrained by water resources driving the mills, although it continued as a valuable source of power. The steam engine helped drain the mines, so more coal reserves could be accessed, and the output of coal increased. The development of the high-pressure steam engine made locomotives possible, and a transport revolution followed.|$|R

500|$|The firefight {{included}} large-scale {{troop movements}} and the simulated destruction of major <b>bridges</b> [...] <b>coal</b> dust and dynamite {{were used to}} create explosions. Nine troop formations held three positions each during the tightly scripted invasion sequence; they were directed via telephone (one line per formation) and flash-lamp signals from the headquarters established at the Chamber of Commerce building. The defensive pattern employed {{was similar to that}} used during the First World War in Paris to conduct soldiers to the front. Light tanks were stationed at road and rail junctions as fighting intensified. Thirty anti-aircraft vehicles fired blanks at fighter planes overhead, assisted by anti-aircraft gunners on buildings downtown. The first mock casualty was reported at 8:00am. Dressing stations were set up at strategic points to treat the mock casualties; they also treated the two real casualties of the event – a soldier who sprained his ankle, and a woman who cut her thumb preparing toast during the early-morning blackout.|$|R
