25|$|Inherited {{metabolic}} disorders {{characterized by}} deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiency. These include {{deficiencies in the}} enzymes holocarboxylase synthetase or <b>biotinidase.</b> Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively, and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. Biochemical and clinical manifestations include: ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, skin rash, feeding problems, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia, and coma.|$|E
25|$|The {{screening}} process, however, {{is characterized}} by a high false positive rate. In one study, CAH screening had the lowest positive predictive value (111 true-positive cases among 20,647 abnormal screening results in a 2-year period, or 0.53%, compared with 6.36% for <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency, 1.84% for congenital hypo-thyroidism, 0.56% for classic galactosemia, and 2.9% for phenylketonuria). According to this estimate, 200 unaffected newborns required clinical and laboratory follow-up for every true case of CAH.|$|E
25|$|Biotin {{deficiency}} can {{be caused}} by inadequate dietary intake or inheritance of one or more inborn genetic disorders that affect biotin metabolism. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning or skin rash typically on the face. Neonatal screening for <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency began in the United States in 1984 and today many countries test for this disorder at birth. Individuals born prior to 1984 are unlikely to have been screened, thus the true prevalence of the disorder is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Biotinidase</b> {{deficiency}} {{is not due}} to inadequate biotin, {{but rather}} to a deficiency in the enzymes that process it. <b>Biotinidase</b> catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides (the proteolytic degradation products of each holocarboxylase) and thereby recycles biotin. It is also important in freeing biotin from dietary protein-bound biotin. General symptoms include decreased appetite and growth. Dermatologic symptoms include dermatitis, alopecia, and achromotrichia (absence or loss of pigment in the hair). Perosis (a shortening and thickening of bones) {{is seen in the}} skeleton. [...] Fatty liver and kidney syndrome and hepatic steatosis also can occur.|$|E
2500|$|Biotin is {{important}} in fatty acid synthesis, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis. It covalently attaches to the epsilon-amino group of specific lysine residues in these carboxylases. This biotinylation reaction requires ATP and is catalyzed by holocarboxylase synthetase. In bacteria, biotin is attached to biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) by biotin protein ligase (BirA in E. coli). The attachment of biotin to various chemical sites, biotinylation, is used as an important laboratory technique to study various processes, including protein localization, protein interactions, DNA transcription, and replication. [...] <b>Biotinidase</b> itself {{is known to be}} able to biotinylate histone proteins, but little biotin is found naturally attached to chromatin.|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{approaches}} include {{enhancement of}} residual enzyme activity (in {{cases where the}} enzyme is made but is not functioning properly), inhibition of other enzymes in the biochemical pathway to prevent buildup of a toxic compound, or diversion of a toxic compound to another form that can be excreted. [...] Examples {{include the use of}} high doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) in some patients with homocystinuria to boost the activity of the residual cystathione synthase enzyme, administration of biotin to restore activity of several enzymes affected by deficiency of <b>biotinidase,</b> treatment with NTBC in Tyrosinemia to inhibit the production of succinylacetone which causes liver toxicity, and the use of sodium benzoate to decrease ammonia build-up in urea cycle disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Because newborn {{screening}} programs test {{for a number}} of different conditions, a number of different laboratorial methodologies are used, as well as bedside testing for hearing loss using evoked auditory potentials and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. [...] Newborn screening started out using simple bacterial inhibition assays to screen for a single disorder, starting with phenylketonuria in the early 1960s. [...] With this testing methodology, {{newborn screening}} required one test to detect one condition. [...] As mass spectrometry became more widely available, the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and amino acids from a single dried blood spot. [...] This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening. [...] Enzyme assays are used to screen for galactosemia and <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency. [...] Immunoassays measure thyroid hormones for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism and 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone for the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. [...] Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and severe combined immunodeficiency.|$|E
50|$|The enzyme <b>biotinidase</b> cleaves biocytin {{and makes}} biotin {{available}} {{to be reused}} by other enzymes. Because biocytin is the natural substrate of the enzyme <b>biotinidase,</b> biocytin {{can be used to}} measure the <b>biotinidase</b> activity and therefore diagnose <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Biotinidase</b> ( [...] , amidohydrolase <b>biotinidase,</b> BTD) is {{an enzyme}} that in humans is encoded by the BTD gene.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{the results}} of {{worldwide}} screening of <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency in 1991, the incidence of the disorder is:5 in 137,401 for profound <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike most vitamins, {{which are}} noncovalently bound to enzymes, biotin is {{chemically}} linked (covalently bound), and therefore cannot be easily {{removed from the}} enzyme denaturation. Without <b>biotinidase</b> activity, the vitamin biotin cannot be separated from foods and therefore cannot {{be used by the}} body. <b>Biotinidase</b> deficiency is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the BTD gene. When <b>biotinidase</b> activity is deficient, biotin can be neither recycled within the body nor removed from ingested food. Nor can biotin be recycled from enzymes to which it is bound. Deficient <b>biotinidase</b> activity causes specific metabolic enzymes, called carboxylases, to be nonfunctional, inhibiting the proper processing of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Individuals lacking <b>biotinidase</b> activity can still have normal carboxylases if they ingest small amounts of biotin.Approximately 1 in 60,000 newborns are affected by profound (less than 10 percent of normal enzyme activity) or partial (10-30 percent of normal enzyme activity) <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency.|$|E
50|$|Symptom {{severity}} is predictably {{correlated with}} {{the severity of the}} enzyme defect. Profound <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency refers to situations where enzyme activity is 10% or less. Individuals with partial <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency may have enzyme activity of 10-30%.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Biotinidase</b> {{deficiency}} {{can also}} appear later in life. This {{is referred to}} as [...] "late-onset" [...] <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency. The symptoms are similar, but perhaps more mild, because if an individual survives the neonatal period they likely have some residual activity of biotin-related enzymes. Studies have noted individuals who were asymptomatic until adolescence or early adulthood. One study pointed out that untreated individuals may not show symptoms until age 21. Furthermore, in rare cases, even individuals with profound deficiencies of <b>biotinidase</b> can be asymptomatic.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the BTD gene cause <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency. <b>Biotinidase</b> is {{the enzyme}} {{that is made}} by the BTD gene. Many {{mutations}} that cause the enzyme to be nonfunctional or to be produced at extremely low levels have been identified. Biotin is a vitamin that is chemically bound to proteins. (Most vitamins are only loosely associated with proteins.) Without <b>biotinidase</b> activity, the vitamin biotin cannot be separated from foods and therefore cannot {{be used by the}} body. Another function of the <b>biotinidase</b> enzyme is to recycle biotin from enzymes that are important in metabolism (processing of substances in cells). When biotin is lacking, specific enzymes called carboxylases cannot process certain proteins, fats, or carbohydrates. Specifically, two essential branched-chain amino acids (leucine and isoleucine) are metabolized differently.|$|E
50|$|The {{chromosomal}} locus is at 3p25. The BTD gene has 4 exons of lengths 79 bp, 265 bp, 150 bp and 1502 bp, respectively. There {{are at least}} 21 different mutations {{that have been found}} to lead to <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency. The most common mutations in severe <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency (<10% normal enzyme activity) are: p.Cys33PhefsX36, p.Gln456His, p.Arg538Cys, p.Asp444His, and p.Ala171Thr;Asp444His. Almost all individuals with partial <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency (10-30% enzyme activity) have the mutation p.Asp444His in one allele of the BTD gene in combination with a second allele.|$|E

5000|$|Genetic mutation: Mikati et al. (2006) {{reported}} {{a case of}} partial <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency (plasma <b>biotinidase</b> level of 1.3 nm/min/mL) in a 7-month-old boy. The boy presented with perinatal distress followed by developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and infantile spasms without alopecia or dermatitis. The child's neurologic symptoms abated following biotin supplementation and antiepileptic drug therapy. DNA mutational analysis revealed {{that the child was}} homozygous for a novel E64K mutation and that his mother and father were heterozygous for the novel E64K mutation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Biotinidase</b> {{deficiency}} can {{be found}} by genetic testing. This is often done at birth as part of newborn screening in several states throughout the United States. Results are found through testing {{a small amount of}} blood gathered through a heel prick of the infant. As not all states require that this test be done, it is often skipped in those where such testing is not required. <b>Biotinidase</b> deficiency can also be found by sequencing the BTD gene, particularly in those with a family history or known familial gene mutation.|$|E
50|$|Individuals lacking {{functional}} <b>biotinidase</b> enzymes {{can still}} have normal carboxylase activity if they ingest adequate amounts of biotin. The standard treatment regimen calls for 5-10 mg of biotin per day.|$|E
50|$|The BTD gene {{is located}} on the short (p) arm of {{chromosome}} 3 at position 25, from base pair 15,618,326 to base pair 15,662,328. Mutations in the BTD gene cause <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency.|$|E

50|$|Approximately 100 {{mutations}} in the BTD gene {{that lead to}} <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency have been discovered. These mutations either prevent the enzyme from being made or cause the enzyme that is produced to be nonfunctional.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biotinidase</b> {{deficiency}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} metabolic disorder in which biotin is not released from proteins {{in the diet}} during digestion or from normal protein turnover in the cell. This situation results in biotin deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{symptoms}} of <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency (and dietary deficiency of biotin) {{can be quite}} severe. A 2004 case study from Metametrix [...] detailed the effects of biotin deficiency, including aggression, cognitive delay, and reduced immune function.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biotinidase</b> {{deficiency}} is inherited in an {{autosomal recessive}} pattern, {{which means the}} defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the defective gene - one from each parent - must be inherited {{for a person to}} be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are usually not affected by the disorder, but are carriers of one copy of the defective gene. If both parents are carriers for the <b>biotinidase</b> deficiency, there is a 25% chance that their child will be born with it, a 50% chance the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance the child will be unaffected.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{allows the}} body to use and to recycle the B vitamin biotin, {{sometimes}} called vitamin H. <b>Biotinidase</b> extracts biotin from food because the body needs biotin in its free, unattached form. This enzyme also recycles biotin from enzymes in the body that {{use it as a}} helper component in order to function. These enzymes, known as carboxylases, are important in the processing of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Biotin is attached to these carboxylase enzymes through an amino acid (the building material of proteins) called lysine, forming a complex called biocytin. <b>Biotinidase</b> removes biotin from biocytin and makes it available to be reused by other enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of a <b>biotinidase</b> {{deficiency}} {{can appear}} {{several days after}} birth. These include: seizures, hypotonia and muscle/limb weakness, ataxia, paresis, hearing loss, optic atrophy, skin rashes (including seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis), and alopecia. If left untreated, the disorder can rapidly lead to coma and death.|$|E
50|$|Holocarboxylase {{synthetase}} deficiency is {{an inherited}} metabolic disorder {{in which the}} body is unable to use the vitamin biotin effectively.
