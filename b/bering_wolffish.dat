5000|$|The <b>Bering</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas orientalis) is {{a marine}} {{fish in the}} family Anarhichadidae, the [...] "wolffish".|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bering</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{lives on}} rocky, gravel and sandy substrates, and algae-encrusted bottoms in shallow, inshore locations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bering</b> <b>wolffish</b> has an {{elongate}} and laterally compressed body, {{with a thin}} caudal peduncle. It has a steep snout, and, {{like other}} wolffish, has long, canine teeth that protrude out past {{the tips of the}} jaws.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bering</b> <b>wolffish</b> {{species has}} an {{inconsistent}} distribution. It is found from the Northeastern Pacific Ocean from Hokkaido to the Sea of Okhotsk, to Alaska. Although insufficiently documented, {{it is also}} known to occur across the Northwestern Pacific, the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} wolffish (Anarhichas denticulatus), or rock turbot, {{is a large}} marine fish of the Anarhichadidae family. Other common names include the bull-headed catfish, blue catfish, broad-headed catfish, jelly wolffish, and the Arctic wolffish. Inuit in the Western Arctic (Bathurst Inlet) do not distinguish between the {{northern wolffish}} and the <b>Bering</b> <b>wolffish</b> (A. orientalis), calling both by the name akoak or akoaksaluk ("old woman fish").|$|E
50|$|Steller's sea eagle mainly {{feeds on}} fish. Their favored prey in river {{habitats}} are salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and trout. Among these, pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) and chum salmon (O. keta) are reportedly favored, sometimes intensely supplemented by grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and three-spined stickleback (Gastrossteus aculeatus). While pink and chum salmon average approximately 2200 and 5000 g in mature mass, respectively, Steller's sea eagle not infrequently preys on fish up to 6000 to 7000 g. In coastal areas, nesting eagles may feed on <b>Bering</b> <b>wolffish</b> (Anarchichas orientalis), Hemitripterus villosus, Aptocyclus ventricosus and Myoxocephalus spp. Like most Haliaeetus eagles, they hunt fish {{almost exclusively in}} shallow water. Relatively large numbers of these normally solitary birds can be seen congregating on particularly productive spawning rivers in August through September due to an abundant food supply. On Kamchatka, aggregations {{of as many as}} 700 eagles have been reported, though much smaller groups are the norm. In summer, live fish, typically in the range of 20 to 30 cm in length, are fed to the young at the nest. Normally, the parents catch about two or three fish for the young to eat each day. In autumn, when many salmon die after spawning, dead fish tend to be consumed more often than live ones, and these are the main food for Steller's sea eagles that overwinter in inland rivers with unfrozen waters. On Hokkaido, eagles are attracted by abundant Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) which peak in the Rausu Sea and the Nemuro Straits in February. This resource supports an important commercial fishery which in turn helps to support eagles. Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), along with the cod, is the most important food source for wintering eagles in Japan. These eagles may walk boldly within a few feet of fishermen when both are capturing fish during winter, but only familiar ones they have encountered previously: they behave warily and keep their distance if strangers are present.|$|E
