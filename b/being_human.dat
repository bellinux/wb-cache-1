5|$|In 2008 the BBC Three series <b>Being</b> <b>Human</b> {{became popular}} in Britain. It {{featured}} an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol. Another popular vampire-related show is CW's The Vampire Diaries. The continuing {{popularity of the}} vampire theme has been ascribed {{to a combination of}} two factors: the representation of sexuality and the perennial dread of mortality.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months prior}} to his {{graduation}} from Guildhall, McGregor won {{a leading role in}} Dennis Potter's six-part Channel 4 series Lipstick on Your Collar (1993). Not long afterwards, he starred in the BBC adaptation of Scarlet and Black (also 1993) with a young Rachel Weisz, and made his film debut in Bill Forsyth's <b>Being</b> <b>Human</b> (1994). For his role in the thriller Shallow Grave (also 1994), he won an Empire Award. The film was his first collaboration with director Danny Boyle. His international breakthrough followed with the role of heroin addict Mark Renton in Boyle's Trainspotting (1996), an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel of the same name.|$|E
5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living <b>being,</b> <b>human</b> or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

The <b>human</b> <b>being</b> who is aware that a soul exists within the inner being can consider it as an individual.

5|$|In 2011 {{the cable}} station Syfy premiered the series <b>Being</b> <b>Human,</b> an Americanized {{version of the}} {{previously}} released British series of the same name. A lesbian character named Emily Levison, played by actress Alison Louder, was introduced as the sister {{to one of the}} main characters. That same year the FX cable series American Horror Story highlighted gay ghost couple Chad Warwick and Patrick, played by Zachary Quinto and Teddy Sears. The HBO cable station premiered Game of Thrones, based on the book series of the same name. The series included gay couple Renly Baratheon and Loras Tyrell, played by actors Gethin Anthony and Finn Jones. MTV also premiered the cable series Teen Wolf that same year. One of the characters depicted is an out gay high school lacrosse player named Danny Mahealani, played by Keahu Kahuanui.|$|E

50|$|The chapter {{presents}} the metaphysical {{definition of a}} <b>human</b> <b>being</b> as Consciousness, Atman, Soul. In verse 3, it develops the foundation for this definition by explaining that speech cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who are born without the power of speech (dumb); that sight cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who are born without the ability of sight (blind); that hearing cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who are born without the ability to hear (deaf); that mind cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who are without the power of clear thinking (foolishness); that arms or legs cannot define a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> because we see <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> midst us who lose their arms or legs (cut in an accident). A being has life-force, which is consciousness. And that which is conscious, has life-force.|$|R

25|$|The non-motivated {{purposes}} of art {{are those that}} are integral to <b>being</b> <b>human,</b> transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose.

5000|$|The {{catch is}} that any such {{characteristic}} that is possessed by all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> will not be possessed only by <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> For example, all <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> but not only <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> are capable of feeling pain; and while only <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are capable of solving complex mathematical problems, not all humans can do this.|$|R

25|$|The existentialist {{school of}} thought views {{loneliness}} as the essence of <b>being</b> <b>human.</b> Each human being comes into the world alone, travels through life as a separate person, and ultimately dies alone. Coping with this, accepting it, {{and learning how to}} direct our own lives with some degree of grace and satisfaction is the human condition.|$|E
25|$|What seems true is more {{important}} than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality. A person can know that a computer is a box made of wires and processors but can still assign a personality to it. The important point to remember is that these responses are just part of <b>being</b> <b>human</b> and participating in a communication event.|$|E

Several games shows also film in the city, including BrainTeaser and Deal or No Deal. Other prolific series to be filmed here include Shoestring (1970s), Robin of Sherwood (1980s) and The House of Eliott (1990s). The sitcom Only Fools and Horses was filmed in Bristol, despite being set in London as was The Young Ones.|$|E

There is no book of the New Testament in which love is not mentioned, {{and the kind of}} love which is specifically Christian was so much a novelty that to express its revolutionary significance, it was necessary to infuse new meaning into a Greek word rarely seen in profane literature: 'agape'."

25|$|Of {{the four}} protagonists, Mihai {{is the most}} level-headed, experienced, and least anti-heroic of the group. Despite his old age and <b>being</b> <b>human,</b> Mihai has skills that equate or even exceed most of the cast. However, Mihai has a terrible sense of {{direction}} and has a constant run of bad luck. He and Badou share a close bond along with Kiri and Mimi, and also shares concern for Heine and Naoto. So far, his link to the underground is not as deep as the others, but Richter Berthein seems to {{know a great deal}} about the assassin.|$|E
25|$|The channel aired various comedies and dramas; one of {{its most}} popular sitcoms was Gavin & Stacey, which first aired in May 2007 and was written by and {{starring}} James Corden and Ruth Jones alongside Mathew Horne, Joanna Page, Alison Steadman and Rob Brydon. The sitcom was an instant hit, with subsequent series being moved to other BBC channels and the show being granted a Christmas special. Another example is <b>Being</b> <b>Human,</b> a drama in which a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf share a flat, which has become a success and heralded several new series. American programming also features, with American Dad! and Family Guy being the notable examples.|$|E
25|$|Human {{security}} can {{be defined}} as one of the foundational conditions of <b>being</b> <b>human,</b> including both (1) the sustainable protection and provision of the material conditions for meeting the embodied needs of people, and (2) the protection of the variable existential conditions for maintaining a dignified life. Within this definition it then makes sense that the core focus of human-security endeavours should be on the most vulnerable. It makes sense that risk management should be most responsive to immediate events or processes that have both an extensive and intensive impact in producing material and existential vulnerabilities of people in general or a category of persons across a particular locale.|$|E

Instead of taking the chance to run home Belle helps {{him back to the}} castle. She cleans his injuries and after a brief argument about whose fault this is, the Beast thanks her for her kindness and thus their friendship is born. Wanting to give her a thank-you gift, the Beast gives Belle his huge library, which excites her. She notes a change in the Beast's personality as the servants note a change in Belle and the Beast's relationship ("Something There"). They express their hope of <b>being</b> <b>human</b> once more ("Human Again") while Belle asks the Beast to accompany her to dinner that night.|$|E
