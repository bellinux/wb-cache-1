2500|$|Relations {{between the}} {{settlers}} and the Noongar people had deteriorated badly {{in the final}} years of Stirling's reign, with settlers shooting at Aboriginal people indiscriminately for the spearing of stock, leading to payback killings of settlers. Stirling's response was to attempt to subdue the Aboriginal people through harsh punishment. When Stirling retired he was replaced as Governor by John Hutt, 1 January 1839, who rather than adopting Stirling's vindictive vengeful policies against Aborigines, tried protecting their rights and educating them. [...] This ran foul of frontier settlers intent on seizing Aboriginal lands without compensation, who felt they needed strong-arm tactics to protect themselves from Aboriginal [...] "reprisals". [...] In 1887 a reserve for the remaining Whadjuk people was established near Lake Gnangara, one of a whole series of wetlands which may have, within the memory of Aboriginal people here, been a series of caves along an underground river whose roof fell in. [...] This reserve was re-established in 1975. [...] In addition to the [...] "feeding station" [...] at Mount Eliza, under the control of Francis Armstrong, first [...] "Protector of Aborigines". [...] Hutt also tried to establish an Aboriginal yeomanry by giving Aboriginal [...] "settlers" [...] grants of government land. [...] The lands chosen for this venture were marginal and Aboriginal people were expected to make improvements without giving them access to needed <b>bank</b> <b>finance,</b> so the scheme quickly collapsed. [...] Aboriginal campsites were temporarily established at many metropolitan locations including Ellenbrook, Jolimont, Welshpool and Allawah Grove. [...] These sites however were frequently moved at the discretion of European authorities once an alternative use was found for the land (as happened at Karrakatta Cemetery, the Swanbourne Rifle Range and Perth Airport).|$|E

He knew, however, that any great measure must be undertaken by a finance minister with a clear position and strong hands, and he told Graham that even if he saw his way distinctly to a plan, he did not feel individually strong enough for the attempt. Nor was there time. To reconstitute the Savings <b>Bank</b> <b>finance,</b> to place the chancery and some other accounts on a right basis, and to readjust the banking relations properly so-called between the Bank and the state, would be even more than a fair share of financial work for the session. Before the year was over he passed a bill, for which he had laid before the cabinet elaborate argumentative supports, removing a number of objections to the then existing system of dealing with the funds drawn from Savings Banks.[335] ...|$|E

40|$|Using Indonesia Islamic banks {{data from}} 2003 to 2014, this paper employs panel {{regression}} methodology by investigating {{the responses of}} Islamic banks to changes in financing rate and monetary policy may differ, depending on their characteristics. The {{results suggest that the}} financing rate has negative impact on Islamic <b>bank</b> <b>financing,</b> while bank-specific characteristics have positive influence on Islamic <b>bank</b> <b>financing.</b> The degree of size and capital have greater impact than liquidity on Islamic <b>bank</b> <b>financing.</b> On the other hand, changes in monetary policy is insignificant on <b>bank</b> <b>financing,</b> which implies that the transmission of monetary policy through the Islamic segment of the banking sector is weak.
