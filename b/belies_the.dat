25|$|In {{the genus}} Pinguicula, the {{mucilage}} glands are quite short (sessile), and the leaf, while shiny (giving the genus its common name of 'butterwort'), {{does not appear}} carnivorous. However, this <b>belies</b> <b>the</b> fact that the leaf is an extremely effective trap of small flying insects (such as fungus gnats), and its surface responds to prey by relatively rapid growth. This thigmotropic growth may involve rolling of the leaf blade (to prevent rain from splashing the prey off the leaf surface) or dishing of the surface under the prey to form a shallow digestive pit.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, the Gramophone Company {{acquired}} the premises and converted it into studios.

In 1934, the inventor of stereo sound, Alan Blumlein, recorded Mozart's Jupiter Symphony which was conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham at the studios.|$|E
25|$|During the Third Doctor's tenure, {{producer}} Barry Letts {{was adamant}} that the device {{not become a}} cure-all for the series, and limited its use to avoid writers becoming over-reliant on it. During this time, the device underwent significant design changes. In The Sea Devils, the Doctor used it to detonate landmines; Michael E. Briant explains that this was feasible, stating that the sonic waves shook the mines. In The Three Doctors the sonic screwdriver is almost unrecognisable, being a unique, one-use prop with a plastic red spherical head. In the DVD commentary, Letts himself remarks on {{the thickness of the}} prop {{and the fact that it}} <b>belies</b> <b>the</b> idea that it was the regular one, prompting Katy Manning to question whether it was indeed a sonic screwdriver. This was due to the serial being produced out of transmission order: the original sonic screwdriver prop went missing during the recording of Carnival of Monsters, requiring a new prop to be built for the rest of the season; The Three Doctors was recorded after Carnival, but set before it, so the screwdriver could be seen to revert to its previous appearance for one story after The Three Doctors before receiving a more permanent redesign thereafter.|$|E

500|$|Built between 1154 and 1500, York Minster {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} Gothic churches in the world.
