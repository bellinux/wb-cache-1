5000|$|Normally, {{boiling water}} does not <b>boil</b> <b>over.</b> When fats, starches, {{and some other}} {{substances}} are present in boiling water, for example by adding milk or pasta, <b>boiling</b> <b>over</b> can occur. A film forms {{on the surface of}} the boiling liquid; for example, cream can <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> as milk fat separates from the milk. [...] The increased viscosity of the liquid causes the steam bubbles to form foam trapped under the film, pushing the film up and over the lip of the pot, <b>boiling</b> <b>over.</b> A milk watcher disrupts this process by collecting small bubbles of steam into one large bubble and releasing it in a manner which may puncture the surface film. The device also rattles when boiling occurs, alerting the cook who may then lower the heat setting of the stove.|$|R
