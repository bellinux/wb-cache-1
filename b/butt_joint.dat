5|$|Welds can be geometrically {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways. The five basic types of weld joints are the <b>butt</b> <b>joint,</b> lap joint, corner joint, edge joint, and T-joint (a variant of this last is the cruciform joint). Other variations exist as well—for example, double-V preparation joints are characterized by the two pieces of material each tapering to a single center point at one-half their height. Single-U and double-U preparation joints are also fairly common—instead of having straight edges like the single-V and double-V preparation joints, they are curved, forming {{the shape of a}} U. Lap joints are also commonly more than two pieces thick—depending on the process used and the thickness of the material, many pieces can be welded together in a lap joint geometry.|$|E

40|$|Interlaminar slip {{occurs in}} stress-laminated-timber (SLT) decks {{subjected}} to concentrated loads, such as vehicles. <b>Butt</b> <b>joints</b> in SLT decks {{can be regarded}} as local discontinuities with increased load transfer resulting in increased frictional forces. Multiple tests were performed with different combinations of pre-stress level, number of loads, span-to-depth ratio, beam width and butt-joint configurations. The results of the tests have been analysed and compared with non-linear finite element analyses using solid elements and contact properties. The experimental results and the analysis showed that, {{in the case of a}} high span-to-depth ratio in the deck and without <b>butt</b> <b>joints,</b> there is little or no interlaminar slip. Test elements without <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> showed little slip at pre-stress levels of 300 kPa or higher. A significant reduction in post-slip stiffness was observed for the test elements with <b>butt</b> <b>joints.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

25|$|The biscuit {{reinforced}} <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> is {{a fairly}} recent innovation in <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> construction. It is used primarily in carcase and frame construction. The biscuit is an oval shaped piece of specially dried and compressed wood, usually beech, which is installed in matching mortises in both members of the joint {{in a similar fashion}} to a loose or floating tenon. Biscuit joints are common in both frame and carcase construction. They are particularly convenient for panel glue ups as they facilitate alignment of panel members.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of two comparative studies concerning some properties of underwater air-water coated-electrode welded <b>joints</b> (fillet and <b>butt</b> <b>joints).</b> The testes were performed using normal strength naval steel and hydro-protected medium coated-electrode (Ti). The welding environmental factors were accorded to the Romanian Register of Shipping regulations. The mechanical properties and HV 10 hardness of the welded joints were established. The tensile strength decreases with 25 % in case of <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> and with 40 % in case of tee joints (underwater coated-electrode welded), comparing with air welding. The cracking of welded joints happened in welded beam. Impact KV (20 oC) tests revealed that the values for underwater coated-electrode butt-welded joints decreases with 70 % comparing with air welding. For both tested situations (tee and <b>butt</b> <b>joints),</b> the high cooling rate (in case of underwater welding) generated HV 10 hardness values increased comparing with air welding.

25|$|This is a {{variation}} of the screwed <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> in which the screws are inserted into pocket holes drilled in the rear face of one of the joint members.

25|$|A {{rotating}} cylindrical tool with a profiled probe is {{fed into}} a <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> between two clamped workpieces, until the shoulder, {{which has a}} larger diameter than the pin, touches {{the surface of the}} workpieces. The probe is slightly shorter than the weld depth required, with the tool shoulder riding atop the work surface. After a short dwell time, the tool is moved forward along the joint line at the pre-set welding speed.|$|E
25|$|The screwed <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> uses {{one or more}} screws {{inserted}} {{after the}} joint has been brought together. The screws are usually inserted into an edge on the long grain side of one member and extend through the joint into the end grain of the adjacent member. For this reason, long screws are required (usually 3 times {{the thickness of the}} member) to ensure good traction. These joints may also be glued although it is not necessary.|$|E
40|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>joints</b> {{containing}} glued {{cover plates}} and bolts {{are used in}} structures subjected to severe loading {{with a view to}} maximising the structural integrity.

This paper presents an analysis of bonded-bolted steel <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> with particular attention to the effect of the loss of bolt tightness to the structural behaviour. Bonded-bolted <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to biaxial stress field have been investigated using three-dimensional finite element modelling subjected to two-step loading, the first involving pre stressing of the bolts followed by application of inplane bending.

40|$|Abstract: A new {{attempt is}} {{proposed}} to improve the load-carrying capacity of high strength steel undermatching <b>butt</b> welded <b>joints</b> by shape design. Based {{on the principle that}} reasonable geometric parameters designs of welded joints can regulate the distribution of stress and strain, reduce the stress concentration factors in low strength weld zone, the geometric parameters of undermatching <b>butt</b> <b>joints,</b> such as weld toe radius, height of excess weld metal and width of the cover passes are designed. A series of tests were completed to investigate the effect of weld shape design on the mechanical properties and security of undermatching <b>butt</b> <b>joints.</b> The results showed that the critical crack sizes of the 0. 6 ~ 1. 0 undermatching joints is {{greater than or equal to}} the one of base metal, the joints strengths approach to the tensile strength of base mental, and the fatigue strength is far higher than that of the as-welded equalmatching <b>butt</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractAluminum alloy {{integral}} {{panels are}} widely used in modern large aircraft. The common forming method for integral panels is press bend forming and assisted with peen forming. Because of the larger thickness size and high strength of <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> on integral panels, the press bend forming method, which is simple, convenient and short production cycle, is used to manufacture <b>butt</b> <b>joints.</b> In order to improve curvature accuracy of <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> during press bend forming, a Dynamic Three Point Multi-step (DTPMS) press bend forming method was proposed in this paper. Then, the problem of springback in bending process was analyzed, and the calculation model of punch displacement and workpieces’ deflection was further established based on elastoplastic theory, energy method and mathematics. Finally, the proposed method was verified in ABAQUS/Standard {{and it can be}} concluded that the method is efficient...|$|R
25|$|This {{produces}} a joint {{which is much}} stronger than a <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> without reinforcement. The dowels offer some holding strength even after the glue has deteriorated. Over time, dowels may shrink and become loose. They take on an oval shape in section owing to the different rate at which wood moves with different orientations of the grain. Loose dowels allow the joint to flex, although it may not fall apart. This phenomenon is evident in creaking chairs and wobbling book cases. For this reason, dowel joints are not preferred for high-quality furniture.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> is a {{technique}} in which two pieces of wood [...] are joined by simply placing their ends together without any special shaping. The name 'butt joint' comes {{from the way the}} wood is joint together. The <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> is the simplest joint to make since it merely involves cutting the wood [...] to the appropriate length and [...] butting them together. It is also the weakest because unless some form of reinforcement is used (see below) it relies upon glue alone to hold it together. Because the orientation of the wood usually presents only one end to long grain gluing surface, the resulting joint is inherently weak.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> is a {{very simple}} joint to construct. Members are simply docked (cut off) at the right angle and have a {{required}} length. One member will be shorter than the finished size by {{the thickness of the}} adjacent member. For enclosed [...] constructions, such as four-sided frames or boxes, the thickness of the two adjacent members must be taken into consideration. For example: when constructing a four sided box made from 19mm thick material that is to be of finished size 600mm x 600mm, two of the members will be docked at 600mm and two will be docked at 600mm - 19mm - 19mm = 562mm.|$|E
40|$|Dissimilar Al/steel <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> of 6. 0 mm thick plates {{have been}} {{achieved}} using fiber laser keyhole welding autogenously. The cross sections, interface microstructures, hardness and tensile properties of Al/steel <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> obtained under different travel speeds and laser beam offsets were investigated. The phase morphology and thickness of the intermetallic compound (IMC) layers at the interface were analyzed by scanning electronic microscopes (SEM) using the energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The results show that travel speeds and laser beam offsets are of considerable importance for the weld shape, morphology and thickness of IMC layers, and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of Al/steel <b>butt</b> <b>joints.</b> This proves that the IMC layers consist of Fe 2 Al 5 phases and Fe 4 Al 13 phases by EBSD phase mapping. Increasing laser beam offsets from 0. 3 mm to 0. 7 mm significantly decreases the quantity of Fe 4 Al 13 phases and the thickness of Fe 2 Al 5 layers at the interface. During tensile processing, the Fe 2 Al 5 layer with the weakest bonding strength is the most brittle region at the interface. However, an intergranular fracture that occurred at Fe 2 Al 5 layers leads to a relatively high UTS of Al/steel <b>butt</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A {{variation}} of the dowel method for reinforcement {{is the use of}} a Miller dowel in place of the usual straight cylindrical dowel. The Miller dowel is a stepped dowel and is drilled with a special stepped drill bit. [...] It is drilled from the outside face of the frame piece to be joined and therefore generally leaves an exposed dowel protruding after glue dries, and the excess dowell head is thus usually flush cut. [...] The advantages of the special dowel are documented in various media promoting the method, but one advantage that should not be overlooked is speed of assembly. [...] The <b>butt</b> <b>joint</b> can often be joined temporarily and sometimes more accurately with simply glue, allowing faster set up than the usual tedious alignment procedures mentioned above. [...] After the glue dries one or more Miller dowels are then used to reinforce the joint. [...] Dowel trimming and sanding of the surface, followed by normal finishing then proceed in the usual manner. [...] The blind alignment problems of floating dowels are virtually eliminated by the use of the Miller dowel. [...] Not all projects are appropriate for the stepped dowel method if an exposed dowel end is not visually acceptable, however.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Influence of basic parameters of laser welding on shape {{and quality of the}} <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> and the range of optimal parameters of welding were determined. Findings: It was showed that there is a wide range of laser autogenous welding parameters which ensures high quality joints of mechanical strength not lower than the strength of the base material (BM). The <b>butt</b> <b>joints</b> of austenitic steel AISI 321 sheets welded by the HPDL diode laser at optimal parameters are very high quality, without any internal imperfections and the structure and grain size of weld metal and HAZ is very small and also the HAZ is very narrow and the fusion zone is very regular. Research limitations/implications: Studies of the weldability of stainless steels indicate that the basic influence on the quality of welded joints and reduction of thermal distortions has the heat input of welding, moreover the highest quality of welded joints of austenitic stainless steel sheets are ensured only by laser welding.
