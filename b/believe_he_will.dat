5|$|Using the equipment, {{they are}} able to {{intercept}} messages in Latin detailing an upcoming exchange at South Station in an hour. They realize the handler removed a small crystalline disk from the Federal agent's hand when he identified her body, and that he is now going to exchange it for something else. Olivia intercepts the man, who is killed before she can talk to him. She chases another man involved in the exchange, who commits suicide in front of a bus after giving them a briefcase containing the disc. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) secretly gives the disc to Nina for analysis, while Roy is sent home, as they <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> no longer see visions because the Ghost Network has been compromised.|$|E
25|$|As Joey {{tentatively}} {{enters the}} stage space, he is {{met with a}} spontaneous ovation sparked by the immediacy of the live moment, in turn aided {{by the fact that}} Kohler and Jones never stray from the game that dictates they treat him as a live horse. This playful notion helps Joey’s creators invite the audience to believe in his aliveness, and the audience succumbs, not only for his lifelike movement, but also for the way he is activated by those around him. As both creators and performers, Jones and Kohler soothe Joey’s “nervousness,” and a planned moment when Joey “notices” the audience elicits a generous laugh. Joey shies, nervously clops his hooves, and nickers gently to demonstrate alarm. He sniffs Kohler’s jacket pocket, as he “knows” there is a snack in there. Later, when Jones crosses the stage to demonstrate a feature, he is careful not to walk behind Joey, lest he is kicked. The audience must <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not be kicked – only a spiteful puppeteer could activate such a trick – but Jones’s conviction that he should respect the animal’s space foregrounds the moment’s liveness and heightens the audience’s engagement. Finally, a jockey is introduced, and Joey patiently holds still while he is mounted. Joey accepts the rider’s weight without complaint, comfortably parades around the stage, and swiftly exits before the effect is mundane. For the entire time that Joey inhabits the stage, the audience is noticeably spellbound.|$|E
25|$|Silas is not put {{on trial}} as he is moved to a mental {{institution}} when he is deemed insane. In July 2012, Lynsey is strangled by an unseen person in similar circumstances to Silas' victims. When Silas demands to see Texas in relation to possible information on Lynsey's murder, Texas visits him {{in the mental health}} institution where he is serving his sentences. Silas taunts Texas by explaining how he killed her sister India. He tells Texas that another young woman will die the following day. Texas visits him again a few days later, and tells Silas that she is no longer frightened of him. Silas warns her that another copycat killing will soon occur. He explains that to prevent this he will tell her the identity of the killer if she gives him India's ring. Texas agrees and he tells her that the killer is Will Savage (James Atherton). Texas snatches the ring back, angering Silas. When on a routine appointment at the hospital, Silas fakes a heart attack. He escapes and visits Lynsey's body in the mortuary. Silas sees an apparition of Lynsey who he compliments, telling her she played a good game. Lynsey taunts him saying his game is over as he did not get to what he most wanted as someone else killed her. Silas tells her his game is not over. Silas kidnaps Texas in her flat and leads Texas to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> kill her before telling her that he will bide his time and then kill her, this way she will be living in fear of him. Silas then boards a bus, full of young women who are going to a hen party.|$|E

In 2011, Riley, now aged 56 and suffering from physical disabilities, appealed his most recent denial {{on the grounds that}} there was no evidence he continued to be a danger to the community, that the parole board did not consider his age, and that his sentence had been unconstitutionally excessive.

2500|$|The {{followers}} of Jesus {{became known as}} Christians (as in Acts [...] ) because they believed Jesus to be the Khristós or Mashiach prophesied in the Hebrew Bible. Jesus was not, and is not, accepted in Judaism as a Jewish messiah, {{and the concept of}} a divine messiah was always rejected by Judaism as idolatry. Religious Jews still await their messiah's first coming and the Messianic prophecies of Jewish tradition to be accomplished. Religious Christians believe in the Second Coming of Christ, and they await the rest of Christian messianic prophecies to be fulfilled. One of those prophecies, distinctive in both the Jewish and Christian concept of the messiah, is that a Jewish king from the Davidic line, who will be [...] "anointed" [...] with holy anointing oil, will be king of God's kingdom on earth, and rule the Jewish people and mankind during the Messianic Age and World to come.

Before he left, Sun Quan told him, [...] "I actually didn't want to send you on this mission. I did so because I was worried that Zhuge Liang might misinterpret my dealings with the Caos. We should work more closely together with Shu after eliminating {{the threat of the}} Shanyue. As an envoy, you've a mission to complete but you aren't restricted in speech." [...] Zhang Wen replied, [...] "I've never held great responsibilities in the court before, nor do I possess the ability to handle diplomatic affairs well.

2500|$|Teachings about Jesus and testimonies {{about what}} he {{accomplished}} during his three-year public ministry are found throughout the New Testament. [...] Core biblical teachings about the person of Jesus Christ may be summarized that Jesus Christ was and forever is fully God (divine) and fully human in one sinless person at the same time, and that through the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation {{and the promise of}} eternal life via his New Covenant. [...] While there have been theological disputes over the nature of Jesus, Christians believe that Jesus is God incarnate and [...] "true God and true man" [...] (or both fully divine and fully human). [...] Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. [...] As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. [...] Scripture asserts that Jesus was conceived, by the Holy Spirit, and born of his virgin mother Mary without a human father. [...] The Biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include miracles, preaching, teaching, healing, Death, and resurrection. [...] The apostle Peter, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the 1st century, said, [...] "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." [...] Most Christians now wait for the Second Coming of Christ when they <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> fulfill the remaining Messianic prophecies.|$|E

It may be difficult, but I still intend to gather and bring them together. I am afraid {{this is not what}} you wish to see." [...] Sun Ce knelt down and said, [...] "What I want is your sincerity.

He is known for keeping his promises. I <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>will</b> not deceive me." [...] The following day, Sun Ce hosted a banquet and had a pole erected in the middle, so as to keep track of time by observing its shadow. By midday, when the shadow was shortest, Taishi Ci returned as promised. Sun Ce was overjoyed. He often consulted Taishi Ci on military affairs later on.|$|E
