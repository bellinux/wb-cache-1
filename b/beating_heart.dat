5|$|Phillip Padgett (John Hawkes), {{a fledgling}} author, {{sits at a}} desk, {{suffering}} from writer's block. He eventually retires {{to the bathroom to}} discard a spent cigarette. Without warning or concern, the man suddenly reaches into his chest and removes a bloody heart. Later, he walks down metal stairs into a cluttered basement, and opens the door of an incinerator. Noticing a <b>beating</b> <b>heart</b> amidst the flames, and unfazed by the vision, he nonchalantly tosses in a paper bag.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{signed for}} Rangers in July 1995, for a club record fee of £4.3million, on wages of £15,000 a week. He made an {{immediate}} impact; {{in the fifth}} league {{game of the season}} in the Old Firm match at Celtic Park he scored a goal after running almost the full length of the pitch. On 30 December, in a match against Hibernian, Gascoigne was booked by referee Dougie Smith after he picked Smith's yellow card up from the ground and jokingly 'booked' the referee. Rangers {{went on to win the}} league in the 1995–96 season, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against Aberdeen at Ibrox Stadium; Gascoigne scored a hat-trick during the game. Rangers won the double as they also won the Scottish Cup by knocking out Keith, Clyde, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Celtic, before <b>beating</b> <b>Heart</b> of Midlothian 5–1 in the final at Hampden Park. He scored 19 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions, and was named as both PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year and SFWA Footballer of the Year.|$|E

25|$|Segars was the {{precursor}} of applying NURBS to phantom design. In 2001 his doctoral thesis described {{the method of}} developing a dynamic NURBS-based cardiac-torso (NCAT) phantom in detail. The phantom has a 4D <b>beating</b> <b>heart</b> model which was derived from 4D tagged (MRI) data. The remaining organs in the torso of the phantom were designed based on the Visible Human Project CT data set and were composed of 3D NURBS surfaces. Respiratory motion was also incorporated into this phantom.|$|E
25|$|The Ex-Maze is a {{minimally}} invasive procedure, first reported in 2007, that also creates a lesion pattern across both atria epicardially on the <b>beating</b> <b>heart.</b> As with other procedures off-bypass, the surgeon can confirm that AF corrects to normal sinus rhythm during the procedure. Laparoscopic instruments {{are used to}} access the pericardium through the diaphragm. Like many heart-cauterizing instruments, the Ex-Maze device uses heat generated by a radiofrequency coil. The coil is inside a plastic tube that uses suction to maintain contact against the beating heart’s surface.|$|E
25|$|The adidas Golden Ball {{could only}} {{go to one}} of the members of the victorious Ghanaian side, and so it was, with Lamptey taking home a very special {{souvenir}} from his Italian sojourn. Lamptey was the <b>beating</b> <b>heart</b> of a very good side. His fast feet, speed of thought, and clever interplay with captain Alex Opoku and fellow midfielders Mohammed Gargo and Emmanuel Duah were on display for all to see. His willingness to get into the box was critical too, and his four goals made him joint top-goalscorer.|$|E

25|$|Arnold tongues {{were first}} {{investigated}} {{for a family}} of dynamical systems on the circle first defined by Andrey Kolmogorov. Kolmogorov proposed this family as a simplified model for driven mechanical rotors (specifically, a free-spinning wheel weakly coupled by a spring to a motor). These circle map equations also describe a simplified model of the phase-locked loop in electronics. The map exhibits certain regions of its parameters where it is locked to the driving frequency (phase-locking or mode-locking in the language of electronic circuits). Among other applications, the circle map has been used to study the dynamical behaviour of a <b>beating</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, {{a form of}} {{artificial}} ventilation, is the act of assisting or stimulating respiration, a metabolic process referring to the overall exchange of gases in the body, where a rescuer presses his or her mouth against that of the victim and blows air into the person's lungs. Assistance takes many forms, but generally entails providing air for {{a person who is}} not breathing or is not making sufficient respiratory effort on his/her own. It is used on a patient with a <b>beating</b> <b>heart</b> or as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to achieve the internal respiration).|$|E

500|$|The {{sequence}} in which Hawkes rips his heart out {{was created by}} using a rubber heart. The fact that the faux blood begins leaking through his shirt was added to [...] "hide the fact that [...] doing a little sleight of hand". The image of the <b>beating</b> <b>heart</b> in the furnace was created by overlapping a shot of a fake <b>beating</b> <b>heart</b> and a shot of actual fire. The two were then merged in post-production by animator John Wash, because the fire would have melted the actual heart model. The beating of the hearts of Naciamento's victims was created via a pump that was operated off-screen. The actual milagro prop was crafted several times because, according to Manners, the face was particularly difficult to get right. In fact, the second time the medallion appears in the episode, {{it is a different}} prop.|$|E

500|$|The {{meditation}} scene required {{clips from}} previous episodes {{to appear in}} flashback. Initially, Paul Rabwin and the special effects crew cut the necessary scenes and placed them in animated bubbles. According to Rabwin, at this point, the crew was just experimenting with ideas. Eventually, the crew decided that the bubbles were too [...] "hokey", so they adopted a more standard slit-scan effect. In order to create the sequence of Scully visualizing Waterston's heart condition, Nicolas Surovy had to lie naked on a platform surrounded by a blue screen. A sphere was matched via motion control as a marker for a prosthetic <b>beating</b> <b>heart</b> that was crafted and filmed separately. The two shots were then combined.|$|E
500|$|WALL•E {{proves to}} this {{generation}} {{and beyond that}} the film medium's only true boundaries are the human imagination. Writer/director Andrew Stanton {{and his team have}} created a classic screen character from a metal trash compactor who rides to the rescue of a planet buried in the debris that embodies the broken promise of American life. Not since Chaplin's [...] "Little Tramp" [...] has so much story—so much emotion—been conveyed without words. When hope arrives {{in the form of a}} seedling, the film blossoms into one of the great screen romances as two robots remind audiences of the <b>beating</b> <b>heart</b> in all of us that yearns for humanity—and love—in the darkest of landscapes.|$|E
