40|$|Motivated by the {{formation}} of brine channels, this paper is devoted to a continuum model for salt separation and phase transition in saline water. The mass density and the concentrations of salt and ice are the pertinent variables describing saline water. Hence the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> is considered for the single constituents (salt, water, ice). To keep the model as simple as possible, the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> momentum and energy are considered for the mixture as a whole. However, due to the internal structure of the mixture, an extra-energy flux is allowed to occur {{in addition to the}} heat flux. Also, the mixture is allowed to be viscous. The constitutive equations involve the dependence on the temperature, the <b>mass</b> density <b>of</b> the mixture, the salt concentration and the ice concentration, in addition to the stretching tensor, and the gradient of temperature and concentrations. The <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> for the single constituents eventually result in the evolution equations for the concentrations. A whole set of constitutive equations compatible with thermodynamics are established. A free energy function is given which allows for capturing the main feature which occurs during the freezing of the salted water.
