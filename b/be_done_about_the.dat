5|$|Wilfrid's monasteries in Mercia may {{date from}} this time, as King Wulfhere of Mercia gave him large grants {{of land in}} Mercia. Wilfrid may have persuaded King Ecgberht of Kent in 669 to build a church in an {{abandoned}} Roman fort at Reculver. When Theodore, the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, arrived in England in 669 {{it was clear that}} something had to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation in Northumbria. Ceadda's election to York was improper, and Theodore did not consider Ceadda's consecration to have been valid. Consequently, Theodore deposed Ceadda, leaving the way open for Wilfrid, who was finally installed in his see in 669, the first Saxon to occupy the see of York. Wilfrid spent the next nine years building churches, including at the monastery at Hexham, and attending to diocesan business. He continued to exercise control over his monastic houses of Ripon and Hexham while he was bishop. Oswiu's death on 15February 670 eliminated a source of friction and helped to assure Wilfrid's return.|$|E

25|$|The Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad is {{situated}} in the northern province of Punjab and is a modern and well-equipped stadium. But no matter how impressive a venue is, not much can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> weather and Faisalabad has suffered {{at the hands of}} the elements. In 1998–99 fog caused the third Test against Zimbabwe was abandoned without a ball being bowled, while bad light is often an issue especially for matches played during the winter. However, when play has been possible, some memorable performances have taken place. An exciting Test was played out in 1997–98 when South Africa skittles Pakistan for 92, successfully defending a target of 142 on the final day. Then, in 2004–05, Sanath Jayasuriya smashed 253 as Sri Lanka powered to a 201-run victory. But the ground is most famous for the confrontation between Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana during England's 1987–88 tour, which led to a day being lost during the match and some long-lasting bad feeling between the teams.PCB(Pakistan Cricket Board) also conducts its domestic tournaments at this venue.Recencently, Super 8 T20 was held here from 11 to 18 May.The stadium itself is only 2km out of the city centre, which can be reached by a walk through the tree-lined suburbs.|$|E
25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E

These are the only wild apes or monkeys found in Europe. This species, known scientifically as Macaca sylvanus, is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List and is declining. Three-quarters of the world population live in the Middle Atlas mountains of Morocco. Recent genetic studies and historical documents point to their presence on the Rock before its capture by the British, having possibly been introduced during the Islamic period. A superstition analogous {{to that of the}} ravens at the Tower of London states that if the apes ever leave, so will the British.
