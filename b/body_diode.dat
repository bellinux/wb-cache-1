Power MOSFETs with either voltage- or current-sensing self-driven gate drives {{are used to}} replace the diodes in the rectifier circuits.

This paper presents Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) seven level inverter with less number of clamping diodes which is suitable for regenerative loads such as three phase induction motor with regenerative braking. To reduce the stress across the main switches, diodes are clamped anti-parallel to the main switches. In Earlier configurations, the numbers of clamping diodes were increased proportionately with the number of levels and the number of impedance network required increases with increase number of levels.

40|$|Existing nonisolated {{full-bridge}} {{neutral point}} clamped (NPC) inverters for a single-phase grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) system have limitations such as shoot-through and low European Union (EU) efficiency. In {{order to address}} these limitations, an NPC superjunction MOSFET nonisolated inverter with full-bridge configuration (NIIFBC) is proposed in this paper. This inverter reduces the possibility of shoot-through, thereby improving {{the reliability of the}} grid-tied PV system. It controls the grid current by energizing two coupled inductors individually during positive and negative half-grid cycles. This obviates the possibility of reverse recovery loss in switches due to their <b>body</b> <b>diodes.</b> Furthermore, two external silicon carbide diodes of a clamping branch cause negligible reverse recovery loss in switches besides a constant common-mode voltage.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of SiC power devices requires evaluation of benefits {{and issues of}} the technology in applications. This is important since SiC power devices are still not as mature as their silicon counterparts. This research, in its own capacity, highlights {{some of the major}} challenges and analyzes them through extensive experimental measurements which are performed in many different conditions seeking to emulate various applications scenarios. It is shown that fast SiC unipolar devices, inherently reduce the switching losses while maintain low conduction losses comparable with contemporary bipolar technologies. This translates into lower temperature excursions and an enhanced conversion efficiency. However, such high switching rates may trigger problems in the device utilizations. The switching rates influenced by the device input capacitance can cause significant ringing in the output, especially in SiC SBDs. Measurements show that switching rate of MOSFETs increases with increasing temperature in turn on and reduces in turn off. Hence, the peak voltage overshoot and oscillation severity of the SiC SBD increases with temperature during diode turn off. This temperature dependence reduces at the higher switching rates. So accurate analytical models are developed for predicting the switching energy in unipolar SiC SBDs and MOSFET pairs and bipolar silicon PiN and IGBT pairs. A key parameter for power devices is electrothermal robustness. SiC MOSFETs have already demonstrated such merits compared to silicon IGBTs, however not for MOSFET <b>body</b> <b>diodes.</b> This research has quantified this in comparison with the similarly rated contemporary device technologies like CoolMOS. In a power MOSFET, high switching rates coupled with the capacitance of drain and body causes a displacement current in the resistive path of P body, inducing a voltage on base of the parasitic NPN BJT which might forward bias it. This may lead to latch up and destruction if the thermal limits are surpassed. Hence, trade offs between switching energy and electrothermal robustness are explored for the silicon, SiC and superjunction power MOSFETs. Measurements show that performance of <b>body</b> <b>diodes</b> of SiC MOSFETs is the most efficient due to least reverse recovery. The minimum forward current for inducing dynamic latch up decreases with increasing voltage, switching rate and temperature for all technologies. The CoolMOS exhibited the largest latch up current followed by the SiC and silicon power MOSFETs. Another problem induced by high switching rates is the electrical coupling between complementing devices in the same phase leg which manifests as short circuits across the DC link voltage. This has been understood for silicon IGBTs with known corrective techniques, however it is seen that due to smaller Miller capacitance resulting from a smaller die area, the SiC module exhibits smaller shoot through currents in spite of higher switching rates and a lower threshold voltage. Measurements show that the shoot through current exhibits a positive temperature coefficient for both technologies the magnitude of which is higher for the silicon IGBT. The effectiveness of common techniques of mitigating shoot through is also evaluated, showing that solutions are less effective for SiC MOSFET because of the lower threshold voltages and smaller margins for a negative gate bias...|$|R
