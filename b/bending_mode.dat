40|$|The {{infrared}} absorption spectra of matrix-isolated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and free-base phthalocyanine (H 2 Pc) {{have been recorded}} in the region from 400 to 4000 cm− 1 in solid N 2, Ar, Kr and Xe. Raman spectra have been recorded in doped KBr pellets. The isotopomers HDPc and D 2 Pc have been synthesised {{in an attempt to}} resolve the conflicting assignments that currently exist in the literature for the N–H <b>bending</b> <b>modes</b> in H 2 Pc spectra. A complete correlation between the vibrational modes of the three free-base isotopomers and ZnPc has been achieved. Comparison of the IR and Raman spectroscopic results, obtained with isotopic substitution and with predictions from large basis set ab initio calculations, allows identification of the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OP) N–H <b>bending</b> <b>modes.</b> The largest IP isotope shift is observed in the IR at 1046 cm− 1 and at 1026 cm− 1 in Raman spectra while the largest effect in the OP <b>bending</b> <b>modes</b> is at 764 cm− 1. OP <b>bending</b> <b>modes</b> are too weak to be observed in the experimental Raman data. The antisymmetric N–H stretching mode is observed at ∼ 3310 cm− 1 in low temperature solids slightly blue shifted from, but entirely consistent with the literature KBr data. With the exception of the N–H stretches, the recorded H/D isotope shifts in all the N–H vibrations are complex, with the IP <b>bending</b> <b>modes</b> exhibiting small νH/νD ratios (the largest value is 1. 089) while one of the observed OP modes has a ratio < 1. DFT results reveal that the small ratios arise in particular from strong coupling of the N–H IP <b>bending</b> <b>modes</b> with IP stretching modes of C–N bonds. The unexpected finding of a νH/νD ratio smaller than one was analysed theoretically by examining the evolution of the frequencies of the free base by increasing the mass from H to D in a continuous manner. A consequence of this frequency increase in the heavier isotopomer is that the direction of the N–D OP bend is reversed from the N–H OP bend...|$|R

The Raman phosphate (PO 4) 3 - stretching region shows strong differences between the fairfieldite phosphate minerals which is attributed to the cation substitution for calcium in the structure. In the infrared spectra complexity exists with multiple (PO 4) 2 - antisymmetric stretching vibrations observed, indicating a reduction of the tetrahedral symmetry. This loss of degeneracy is also reflected in the <b>bending</b> <b>modes.</b> Strong Raman bands around 600 cm- 1 are assigned to v 4 phosphate <b>bending</b> <b>modes.</b> Multiple bands in the 400 – 450 cm- 1 region assigned to m 2 phosphate <b>bending</b> <b>modes</b> provide further evidence of symmetry reduction of the phosphate anion.

5000|$|To get {{a feeling}} for the {{probability}} that the vibration of molecule may be thermally excited,we inspect the Boltzmann factor ,where [...] is the excitation energy of the vibrational mode, [...] the Boltzmann constant and [...] the absolute temperature. At 298 K (25 °C), typical values for the Boltzmann factor β are:β = 0.089 for ΔE = 500 cm−1 β = 0.008 for ΔE = 1000 cm−1 β = 7×10−4 [...] for ΔE = 1500 cm−1. (The reciprocal centimeter is an energy unit that is commonly used in infrared spectroscopy; 1 cm−1 corresponds to 1.23984×10−4 eV). When an excitation energy is 500 cm−1, then about 8.9 percent of the molecules are thermally excited at room temperature. To put this in perspective: the lowest excitation vibrational energy in water is the <b>bending</b> <b>mode</b> (about 1600 cm−1). Thus, at room temperature less than 0.07 percent of all the molecules of a given amount of water will vibrate faster than at absolute zero.|$|E
50|$|In CO2, the bending {{vibration}} ν2 (667 cm−1) has symmetry Πu. The first excited state of ν2 is denoted 0110 (no excitation in the ν1 mode, one quantum of excitation in the ν2 <b>bending</b> <b>mode</b> with angular momentum about the molecular axis equal to ±1, no excitation in the ν3 mode) and clearly transforms {{according to the}} irreducible representation Πu. Putting two quanta into the ν2 mode leads to a state with components of symmetry (Πu × Πu)+ = Σ+g + Δ g. These are called 0200 and 0220, respectively. 0200 has the same symmetry (Σ+g) and a very similar energy to the first excited state of v1 denoted 100 (one quantum of excitation in the ν1 symmetric stretch mode, no excitation in the ν2 mode, no excitation in the ν3 mode). The calculated unperturbed frequency of 100 is 1337 cm−1, and, ignoring anharmonicity, the frequency of 0200 is 1334, twice the 667 cm−1 of 0110. The states 0200 and 100 can therefore mix, producing a splitting and also {{a significant increase in}} the intensity of the 0200 transition, so that both the 0200 and 100 transitions have similar intensities.|$|E
