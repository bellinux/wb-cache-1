40|$|Reservoir {{sedimentation}} generally takes {{a form of}} delta {{which is}} composed from fourparts, namely top-set, fore-set, bottom-set and density-current bed. To estimate the formof delta deposition is very important and an analytical estimation for it has been developedonly for bed load transportation which corresponds to the case without <b>bottom-set</b> <b>bed.</b> Itis not clear how {{the existence of the}} <b>bottom-set</b> <b>bed</b> affects on the river-bed variation oftop-set bed obtained by the above estimation. This may be a difficult poin in applyingthe above estimation to actual problems. In this paper, author treated the above problem and developed an analytical methodto estimate the river bed variation due to the sediment deposition in both case with andwithout <b>bottom-set</b> <b>bed.</b> And also, it is made clear that the <b>bottom-set</b> <b>bed</b> has little effecton the river bed variation of upstream part of top-set bed and the analysis without <b>bottom-set</b> <b>bed</b> is useful for practical problems...|$|E
40|$|Delta {{formation}} {{and its associated}} hydraulics in stream channels have beenstudied experimentally. Using a wide basin incorporating with water supply channeland a longshore current generator. Tests {{have been carried out}} under two broad categories, these being the caseswith and without longshore current. The outflow behaved like a jet at the initial stage of building up a delta. Thesize of delta was progressively advanced mainly in the longitudinal direction of theflow, with the width increased at much slower rate. The suspended sediment settleddown at place far from the river mouth and bedload deposited at its front. Afterthis initial stage of delta formation the advancing speed decreased and the deltabegan to develop laterally. Finally, the delta configuration appeared to be smoothand symmetric, with a steep inclination in the front of delta so-called "fore-set bed",then connected to a much milder slope in its lower portion, which was called"bottom-set bed". In the second category of test, the outflow was strongly affected by the long-shore current. As the center line of the outflow was forced to turn transversely, thedelta appeared to be asymmetric about the original center line. Under the interac-tion of bed configuration and outflow, self adjustment in the plan form was appar-ent, resulting, {{in the direction of the}} outflow being straightened gradually. As a result, the plan shape of the delta became symmetric similar to that ob-tained in the test without longshore current, but the <b>bottom-set</b> <b>bed</b> which wasformed by the suspeded load was always influenced by the longshore current. The grain size distribution on the delta surface was found to be coarser inupstream and finer in downstream. Analyzing the core sampling data it was alsofound that the sediment in the upper layer of the delta was coarser than that inlower layer, and a distinct boundary existed between the coarser and the finersediment...|$|E
