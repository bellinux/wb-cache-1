25|$|He {{became a}} member of the Democratic {{leadership}} as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton after they worked closely on several issues, including when he served as the ranking House Democrat in favor of NAFTA's passage in 1993. For his work as a <b>back</b> <b>channel</b> to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's president at the time of the negotiations, he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, Mexico's highest award for a foreigner. Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1996 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured by the Iraqis after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milošević.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{employs a}} combination of diplomatic and intelligence history to challenge established narratives about the relations between Nationalist China and the Third Reich during WWII. This approach allows for the exploration of how Chiang Kai-shek’s wartime diplomacy influenced Chinese foreign policy {{in regards to the}} Axis Powers. Archival documents reveal that in the fight for China’s survival pragmatism, rather than ideology, was the most important force behind Chiang Kai-shek’s foreign policy strategy. As earlier research has shown, Republican Chinese foreign policy had many pragmatic traits, and in this project it becomes evident that diplomatic communication was maintained by Chiang Kai-shek with as many countries as possible. This foreign policy approach was influenced by the experience of having unreliable allies throughout the 1920 s and 1930 s. This approach resulted in the maintenance of communication with Germany, even beyond the crucial official break in diplomatic {{relations between the two countries}} in July 1941. This project explores how clandestine <b>back</b> <b>channels</b> emerged as the preferred tool for fostering Sino-German relations, and how these <b>back</b> <b>channels</b> continued from 1942 until 1945 in Switzerland. Special envoys with intelligence links, appointed by Chiang Kai-shek, conversed with representatives of the German party intelligence service, the RSHA, and with the German Resistance movement of 20 July 1944. These <b>back</b> <b>channels</b> reflected Chiang Kai-shek’s pragmatic foreign policy, and these connections subsequently contributed to the difficulties that arose between the Western Allies and China at the end of the war. ...|$|R

It opened in 1995 to replace a structure of historic significance. The original Pratt/Bowstring/Pennsylvania through truss spans, designed by Theodore Cooper, were formerly the (third) Sixth Street Bridge, spanning the Allegheny River, in downtown Pittsburgh, and were built in 1892 by the Union Bridge Company. They were floated downstream by the Foundation Company in 1927 rather than being demolished when the bridge was removed to enable construction of the present (fourth) Three Sisters (Pittsburgh) Sixth Street Self-anchored suspension bridge. However, by the late 1980s, the old bridge could no longer support traffic volumes {{and was replaced by}} a newer structure.|$|E

2500|$|Hope for the Accord gained {{momentum}} after New Brunswick {{proposed a}} series of alternate concerns {{that would have to}} be addressed to enable passage of the original agreement.

[...] Despite his opposition, leading Liberal leadership candidate Jean Chrétien, wishing the issue to be off the table, contributed to the commission via a <b>back</b> <b>channel.</b> On May 17, 1990, the commission recommended a companion accord that would be approved by all provinces along with Meech Lake; This would permit the original accord to stay in place, saving face for Quebec and the federal government, while addressing the concerns of other provinces.

[...] Stott met with key representatives of the Gestapo and, as negotiations became more protracted, Stott began to take them seriously. It became clear that any withdrawal from Greece by the Germans would be at the exclusion of the ELAS from the peace process. When senior SOE officers in Cairo became aware of the extent of the negotiations that Stott was facilitating between the Germans and the Greeks, he was ordered to abandon his negotiations and return to Egypt.
