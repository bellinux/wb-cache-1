25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

This is reflected in lyrics such as [...] "You know I'm gonna be like this forever/I'm never gonna <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should." [...] The song was written to appear on the follow-up to Bat Out of Hell, but which Steinman recorded himself. Because of this, Meat Loaf was aware that there is a [...] "core of fans that know that song," [...] so he [...] "had that under the microscope more than any other on the album." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974 Harrison founded Dark Horse Records. In {{addition}} to eventually releasing his own albums on the label, he initially used {{the company as}} an avenue for collaboration with other musicians. He wanted Dark Horse {{to serve as a}} creative outlet for artists, as Apple Records had for the Beatles. Harrison explained: [...] "Most of the stuff will <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> produce". Eric Idle commented: [...] "He's extremely generous, and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you'll never, ever hear of." [...] The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter, whose album Harrison produced, which provided Dark Horse with their first hit, [...] "Costafine Town". Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes, Henry McCullough, Jiva, and Stairsteps.|$|E

500|$|... "Chatterbox" [...] {{was written}} and sung by Thunders, whom Willis felt [...] "uses {{his voice as}} a wailing instrument" [...] {{in a manner similar}} to rock singer Robert Plant. The song was Thunders's first time singing lead and {{featured}} vocals Weisbard and Marks said were delivered in a quavering but proud New York accent. His lyrics described the narrator's growing frustration over a crossed-wire phone connection with a female subject. On [...] "Human Being", an ode to self-respect and personal liberty, Thunders introduced his guitar playing with a roughly performed variation on Bill Doggett's 1956 song [...] "Honky Tonk". Johansen addressed critics of the band in the song, telling them if they found him objectionable they should instead find themselves [...] "a saint", [...] "a boy who's gonna <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> ain't", and a [...] "plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint who's gonna sit through the madness and always act so quaint".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E
500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E

Tanaka said that {{his interest in the}} cinema came about through a circuitous route. Early in life {{he wanted to be a}} novelist. His interest in writing shifted to poetry. Tanaka remembered, [...] "I wrote a lot of poems. Each expression in a poem may contain countless meanings, otherwise it wouldn't be a good poem. In other words, each expression provides a lot of imagery. Then I thought that in reverse, I could use images to express my poetic world. I thought the image world of film-making might <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should explore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackwell {{first became}} {{interested}} in music through the influence of her fourth grade teacher, Nancy Notargiacomo, who eventually became her voice and piano teacher when she was 10. She also credits her high school choral director for encouraging her to pursue a music career. In a 2003 interview Blackwell recalled, [...] "I {{did not come from}} a musical family. I had a fourth grade teacher that introduced me to music and I sang at the Catholic church. In high school I started doing musicals − The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Oliver!, and so forth. I thought maybe this would <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would pursue after high school, although even in my {{senior year in high school}} I had doubts.

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in chapter [...] when Moses was keeping his {{father-in-law}} Jethro's flock at {{the mountain of}} God, Horeb (another name for the Biblical Mount Sinai), the angel of God appeared {{to him in a}} flame {{in the midst of a}} bush that burned but was not consumed. God called to Moses from the bush, and Moses answered: [...] "Here I am." [...] God told Moses not to draw near, and to take off his shoes, for the place on which he stood was holy ground. God identified as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reported having seen the Israelites' affliction and heard their cry, and promised to deliver them from Egypt to Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey. God told Moses that God was sending Moses to Pharaoh to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, but Moses asked who he was that he should do so. God told Moses that God would be with him, and after he brought them out of Egypt, he would serve God on that mountain. Moses asked God whom he should say sent him to the Israelites, and God said [...] "I Will <b>Be</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Will Be" [...] ( [...] , Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh), and told Moses to tell the Israelites that [...] "I Will Be" [...] ( [...] , Ehyeh) sent him. God told Moses to tell the Israelites that the Lord ( [...] , YHVH), the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, had sent him, and this would be God's Name forever.
