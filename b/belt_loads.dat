40|$|In the mid- 1990 s, {{seat belt}} load-limiting devices were {{introduced}} on many new passenger {{vehicles equipped with}} front airbags. These devices are intended to re-duce belt-induced injuries such as rib fractures by allowing forward movement of occupants ’ torsos when <b>belt</b> <b>loads</b> exceed some threshold. Load limiters {{have been shown to}} reduce thoracic injury risk in controlled experiments with cadavers and in full-width rigid barrier frontal crash tests. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has evaluated many vehicles equipped with load limiters in 64. 4 km/h (40 mi/h) frontal offset crash tests. Re-sults indicate that in some crash circumstances the amount of forward movement allowed by load limit-ers could increase the risk of head injury from con-tacts with vehicle interior components. Thus, al-though load limiters perform well in rigid barrier tests with high deceleration, short duration, and low intrusion, the forward movement they allow in crashes with longer duration and higher intrusion may increase head injury risk. To examine the effects of load limiters on driver fatality risk in real-world crashes, the present study compared rates of belted driver deaths per vehicle registration before and after load limiters were added to seat belts. Study vehicles were restricted to mod-els and years with no other significant design changes. Fatality rate comparisons for passenger cars with and without load limiters suggest these devices have not reduced fatality risk and even may have increased risk. Also presented in this study is a review of a small number of cases from the National Automotive Sam-pling System that illustrate how increased occupant forward movement can contribute to head injury risk even in vehicles with front airbags...|$|E

40|$|The {{role that}} {{wheelchair}}s and wheelchair mounted headrests play in rear impact occupant protection {{for children who}} remain seated in wheelchairs while traveling in motor vehicles was investigated using sled testing and computer simulation. Study goals were to establish pediatric wheelchair and headrest design guidelines and {{to determine the effect}} of headrests on relative injury risk outcome measures under rear impact conditions. Two series of sled tests (16 mph, 11 g) were conducted using a Hybrid III 6 -year old anthropomorphic test device (ATD) seated in identically configured manual pediatric wheelchairs, with and without headrests. Wheelchairs remained intact and the ATD remained upright. Rear impact front wheelchair securement points were subjected to loads similar to previously described (Ha, DongRan, 2004) rear securement points in frontal impact, although Ha used the more severe 30 mph, 20 g frontal impact WC 19 - Wheelchairs Used as Seats in Motor Vehicles (ANSI/RESNA, 2000) crash pulse. Sled test ATD data analysis indicated that wheelchair headrest use had a potentially protective effect based on pediatric head and neck injury risk outcomes. Sled test data established response corridors for MADYMO computer simulation model development, and defined statistical test target thresholds for model validation. Two simulation models were developed, with and without a headrest. The models validated well for tiedown loads, wheelchair acceleration, lap <b>belt</b> <b>loads</b> and chest acceleration. Outcomes related to head and neck response were not as strongly validated. Model ATD neck response characterization methods were developed. Finally, parametric sensitivity analyses were used to develop wheelchair and headrest design guidelines for pediatric manual wheelchairs in rear impact for front securement point loads, rear wheel loads and seatback loads. Pediatric injury outcome measure sensitivity to wheelchair, headrest and crash pulse parameters was evaluated. Neck injury criteria (Nij) was sensitive to headrest placement; resulting recommendations specify placing the headrest {{as close as possible to}} the back of the head, and top of the headrest pad should be at least 5 cm above the head center of gravity.

40|$|For {{assessment}} of their performance and {{for the development of}} injury risk functions {{there is a need for}} additional biofidelity data. In this report two types of data are made available: Part A - post mortem human subject exposed to various restraints; Part B – volunteer shoulder rang-of-motions. Part A LAB- 2002 : Load-limiting belt restraints have been present in cars since 1995. An accident study showed the greater effectiveness in thorax injury prevention using a 4 kN load limiter belt with an airbag than using a 6 kN load limiter belt without airbag. Frontal sled crashes were performed using PMHS. Restraint conditions evaluated are 6 kN load-limiting belt and 4 kN load-limiting belt with an airbag. Loads between the occupant and the sled environment were recorded. Various measurements characterize the PMHS behaviour and injuries were noted. LAB- 2005 : Many studies have reported multiple rib fractures sustained by an Out-of-Position (OOP) driver subjected to a frontal airbag deployment. Two successive phases occur during the bag deployment: punch-out loading of the thorax, followed by a membrane effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the thoracic injuries generated by each phase separately. Tests of nine post-mortem human surrogates were carried out on a static test bench using a driver side airbag module. Three loading configurations were performed: membrane only, punch-out only, and both types combined. The membrane-only tests were performed with the thorax initially positioned at 13, 78 and 128 mm from the plate in order to vary the load magnitude. The punch-out and the combined tests were performed with the thorax initially 8 mm from the module. Accelerometers and angular rate sensors were fixed on the sternum and on the first, fourth, and eighth thoracic vertebrae of the PMHS. Ribs 2 to 6 were instrumented with strain gauges. The reaction force of the bag on the plate was measured using four 2 -axis load cells. Results showed that both pure punch-out and pure membrane loading can result in thoracic injuries. However, the rib fracture locations seemed to differ from one type of loading to the other. Moreover, for the same initial distance between the airbag module and the thorax, the injuries were more severe in the combined effect tests than in the pure punch-out or pure membrane. LAB- 2008 : Ribs of 8 PMHS were equipped with up to 96 strain gauges. In a first series of 3 tests, the subjects were seated upright and their chests were loaded by a 23. 4 kg impactor propelled at 4. 3 m/s in pure frontal, oblique and pure lateral directions. In a second series of 3 tests, the subjects were loaded by the deployment of an unfolded airbag in the same 3 directions. Part B The shoulder complex is rarely exposed to injuries in frontal and oblique frontal collisions, but influence the belt interaction and as such the thorax compression and head kinematics. The purpose of this study was to establish response requirements for the shoulder complex in terms of range-of-motion and stiffness. Six male volunteers were seated in a rigid seat that simulated a car driver’s posture whilst in a special designed test rig. Loads to the shoulders were applied through the arms, by means of brackets fastened to the elbows, loads rearward were applied by means of a strap around the shoulder complex. Torso movement was blocked by two pre-tensed diagonal belts that were routed close to the neck to avoid excessive clavicle interaction. Shoulders were loaded with increasing load from 0 ̶ 200 N/shoulder at 50 N increments. A test series included four load series: shoulders pulled straight forward, forward-upward, upward and rearward. Each volunteer was exposed to three tests. Shoulder positions relative to the spine were obtained from film analysis. Photo markers were mounted on the volunteer’s skin: head, posterior tip of acromion process, chest, T 1 and T 4. The right and left acromion relative to T 1 displacements were used to calculate the shoulder range-of-motion in three directions. <b>Belt</b> <b>loads</b> and seat back loads were recorded. Average resultant volunteers’ acromion relative to T 1 range-of-motion, at the maximum load, was 55 mm for forward loads, 69 mm for forward-upward loads, 73 for mm upward loads and 50 mm for rearward loads. The volunteers provided measurements with reasonable repeatability. The volunteers curved their spines only slightly when shoulder loads were applied. Hence, shoulder complex motion was successfully isolated and results reflect pure shoulder relative to chest motions. The applied loads were lower than those commonly seen in frontal crashes, however the shoulder is highly mobile and its response to loads is largely dependent on muscle characteristics. As such studies using volunteers may be complimentary to tests with post mortem human subjects...|$|E

The goals were to resolve discrepancies and fill in some of the gaps with regard to the biomechanical response of the human abdomen to dynamic loading in the automotive environment. Three types of impact tests were conducted. Following a review and reanalysis of the data in the literature on abdominal impact response, rigid-bar tests were performed into the mid and upper abdomen of unembalmed instrumented human cadavers using different impactor speeds. Most tests were conducted using a free-back condition, but several tests were conducted using a fixedback condition {{to examine the effects of}} body mass and spinal flexion on the response. Force-deflection corridors were developed and compared to those previously established by other researchers. The second type of test involved dynamic <b>belt</b> <b>loading</b> of the unembalmed cadaver abdomen at the lower and midabdomen regions. The results were used to establish new abdominal force-deflection corridors for <b>belt</b> <b>loading.</b> The third type of test conducted involved static deployment of passenger frontal-impact airbags into the closely positioned abdomen. Three airbag tests were conducted using three unembalmed cadavers.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that booster seats reduce the risk of abdominal injuries by improving the fit of the seat belt on young children and encouraging better posture and compatibility with the vehicle seat. Recently, several studies have reported cases of abdominal injuries in booster seated children questioning the protective effects of these restraints. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine cases of abdominal injuries in booster seated children through parametric modeling to gain a thorough understanding of the injury causation scenarios. The Partners for Child Passenger Safety and CIREN in-depth crash investigation databases were queried to identify children in belt-positioning booster seats with abdominal injuries. The injury causation scenarios for these injuries were delineated using the CIREN Biotab method. The cases were modeled, using MADYMO with variations in key parameters, to determine the ranges of loads and loading rates for the abdomen and thorax. A parametric study was completed examining the influence of pretensioners and load limiters on the injury metrics obtained. Query of the two databases revealed three cases involving abdominal injuries to booster seated children. Children in two of the cases sustained a thoracic injury (AIS 3 /AIS 4) in addition to their abdominal injuries (AIS 2) and review of these cases pointed to the role of shoulder <b>belt</b> <b>loading</b> in the injury causation. Modeling of these cases revealed chest compressions and accelerations of 30 – 53 mm and 41 – 89 g, respectively and abdominal deflection and velocity of 7. 0 – 13. 3 mm and 1. 2 – 2. 2 m/s, respectively.
