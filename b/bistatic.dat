5|$|Another {{attempt to}} revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known more {{generally}} as <b>bistatic</b> radar, was made in March 1940 when a modified set was mounted in Bristol Blenheim L6622. This set was tuned to the transmissions of the new Chain Home Low transmitters, dozens of which were being set up along the UK coastline. These experiments did not prove successful, with a detection range {{on the order of}} , and the concept was abandoned for good.|$|E
5|$|In years since, {{signatures}} of water {{have been found}} to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the <b>bistatic</b> radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.|$|E
25|$|Airplane {{scattering}} (or {{most often}} reflection) is observed on VHF through microwaves and, besides back-scattering, yields momentary propagation up to 500km even in mountainous terrain. The most common back-scatter applications are air-traffic radar, <b>bistatic</b> forward-scatter guided-missile and airplane-detecting trip-wire radar, and the US space radar.|$|E
25|$|On 21 August 2009 Chandrayaan-1 {{along with}} the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter {{attempted}} to perform a <b>bistatic</b> radar experiment using their Mini-SAR radars to detect the presence of water ice on the lunar surface. The attempt was a failure; {{it turned out the}} Chandrayaan-1 radar was not pointed at the Moon during the experiment.|$|E
25|$|Also in Azerbaijan {{there was}} a former Soviet early warning radar. The Gabala Radar Station was a <b>bistatic</b> phased-array installation, {{operated}} by the Russian Space Forces. The contract was signed in 2002 and was due to expire in 2012 where {{it was to be}} given back to the Azerbaijani government. The contract costed Russia $7 million per year. The radar station had a range of up to , and was designed to detect intercontinental ballistic missile launches as far as from the Indian Ocean. In December 2012 Russia announced that negotiations had been unsuccessful and that they had stopped using the radar station. The site was given back to Azerbaijan and all the equipment dismantled and transported to Russia. Nowadays, Russia covers the area from the Armavir Radar Station.|$|E
2500|$|Active sonar uses a sound {{transmitter}} and a receiver. [...] When {{the two are}} in the same place it is monostatic operation. [...] When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is <b>bistatic</b> operation. [...] When more transmitters (or more receivers) are used, again spatially separated, it is multistatic operation. [...] Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception. [...] Active sonobuoy fields may be operated multistatically.|$|E

5000|$|Early radars {{were all}} <b>bistatic</b> because the {{technology}} to enable an antenna to be switched from transmit to receive mode had not been developed. Thus many countries were using <b>bistatic</b> systems in air defence networks during the early 1930s. For example, the British deployed the CHAIN HOME system; the French used a <b>bistatic</b> Continuous Wave (CW) radar in a [...] "fence" [...] (or [...] "barrier") system; the Soviet Union deployed a <b>bistatic</b> CW system called the RUS-1; and the Japanese developed a <b>bistatic</b> CW radar called [...] "Type A".|$|E
50|$|The <b>bistatic</b> {{angle is}} the angle {{subtended}} between the transmitter, target and receiver in a <b>bistatic</b> radar. When {{it is exactly}} zero the radar is a monostatic radar, when it is close to zero the radar is pseudo-monostatic, {{and when it is}} close to 180 degrees the radar is a forward scatter radar. Elsewhere, the radar is simply described as a <b>bistatic</b> radar. The <b>bistatic</b> angle {{is an important factor in}} determining the radar cross section of the target.|$|E
50|$|In monostatic sonar the {{receiver}} {{is listening to}} the echo which is reflected (scattered) right back from the target.Bistatic sonar can work in two ways: by utilizing either the target backscattering or forward scattering. Backscattering <b>bistatic</b> sonar is the sonar in which the <b>bistatic</b> angle φ is less than 90°.Forward scattering is the physical phenomena based on Babinet's principle. Forward scattering <b>bistatic</b> sonar is the sonar in which the <b>bistatic</b> angle φ is greater than 90°.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bistatic</b> range {{refers to}} the basic {{measurement}} of range made by a radar or sonar system with separated transmitter and receiver. The receiver measures the time difference of arrival of the signal from the transmitter directly, and via reflection from the target. This defines an ellipse of constant <b>bistatic</b> range, called an iso-range contour, on which the target lies, with foci centred on the transmitter and receiver. If the target is at range Rrx from the receiver and range Rtx from the transmitter, and the receiver and transmitter are a distance L apart, then the <b>bistatic</b> range is Rrx+Rtx-L. Motion of the target causes a rate of change of <b>bistatic</b> range, which results in <b>bistatic</b> Doppler shift.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>bistatic</b> radar with {{wavelength}} λ, {{where the}} distance between transmitter and target is Rtx and distance between receiver and target is Rrx, the received <b>bistatic</b> Doppler frequency shift is calculated as: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{a passive}} radar system, {{there is no}} {{dedicated}} transmitter. Instead, the receiver uses third-party transmitters in the environment, and measures the time difference of arrival between the signal arriving directly from the transmitter and the signal arriving via reflection from the object. This allows the <b>bistatic</b> range of the object to be determined. In addition to <b>bistatic</b> range, a passive radar will typically also measure the <b>bistatic</b> Doppler shift of the echo and also its direction of arrival. These allow the location, heading and speed of the object to be calculated. In some cases, multiple transmitters and/or receivers can be employed to make several independent measurements of <b>bistatic</b> range, Doppler and bearing and hence significantly improve the final track accuracy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bistatic</b> radar is {{the name}} given to a radar system which {{comprises}} a transmitter and receiver which are separated by a distance that {{is comparable to the}} expected target distance. Conversely, a radar in which the transmitter and receiver are collocated is called a monostatic radar. A system containing multiple spatially diverse monostatic radar or <b>bistatic</b> radar components with a shared area of coverage is called multistatic radar. Many long-range air-to-air and surface-to-air missile systems use semi-active radar homing which is a form of <b>bistatic</b> radar.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bistatic</b> imaging is a {{technique}} for using imaging using <b>bistatic</b> radar (two radar instruments, with one emitting and one receiving). The result is a more detailed image than would have been rendered with just one radar instrument. <b>Bistatic</b> imaging {{can be useful in}} differentiating between ice and rock on the surface of a remote target, such as the moon, due to the different ways that radar reflects off these objects - with ice, the radar instruments would detect [...] "volume scattering", and with rock, the more traditional surface scattering would be detected.|$|E

The fluttar radars were designed to fill the low-altitude gaps between SENTINEL monostatic surveillance radars. Fluttar radars were deployed on the DEW line for approximately five years.|$|E
50|$|In {{a simple}} <b>bistatic</b> {{configuration}} (one transmitter and one receiver) {{it is possible}} to determine the location of the target by simply calculating the point of intersection of the bearing with the bistatic-range ellipse.
