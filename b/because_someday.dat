Shion then asks Naruto, if he will help her (a double entendre asking if he will be the father of her child), much to the shock of Sakura, Kakashi and Lee. Naruto, clueless as usual, agrees without realizing the second meaning of her question.|$|R

[...] A {{worldwide}} {{nuclear war}} {{at the dawn}} of Earth's 21st Century (dubbed the [...] "Second Holocaust") killed 3 billion Humans worldwide and damaged Earth's climate with a [...] "nuclear winter". A Mutzachan scout ship drawn to the high radiation readings made first contact with some survivors. A rescue mission used high technology to stabilize the environment in exchange for the rights to extract the radioactive waste left behind at the impact craters. Eventually terraforming technology restored the planet, but most Humans who were able to had already left for the stars. [...] Humans, like most emigre communities, feel a nostalgic connection for the place they are from, but few actually want to go back. Pacifism is a popular and widespread belief-system due to the Second Holocaust; however, few Humans are total pacifists and most see it as a philosophy rather than a way of life. They also have a sort of [...] "Manifest Destiny" [...] belief that they are destined to control the Alliance <b>someday</b> <b>because</b> of their unique qualities; the other Alliance races think this belief is adorable.|$|R

[...] Memphis Baker of The Independent praised visual {{aspects of the}} artwork, but criticized using Jobs as a {{representation}} of refugees and that the mural needed a footnote: [...] "The idea that 'there might be a Steve Jobs' among those living in the Jungle should be washed quickly away. It is pat. It is besides the point. Better treatment and faster asylum procedures are owed {{to the people in}} the Jungle because they are people; some saintly, some less so; some business-minded, some illiterate." [...] Wireds Issie Lapowsky shared a similar view. She described the mural as [...] "poignant" [...] and that Banksy raising awareness of conditions in the Jungle was [...] "worth something." [...] But also added [...] "I hope the world will rally to help the millions of refugees who are in need simply because they are in need, and not <b>because</b> they may <b>someday</b> invent the next iPhone." [...] Ashley Carman of The Verge said [...] "While the sentiment and effort to make people care about the refugee crisis certainly warrants applause, it's also worth noting that Jobs rejected his birth parents as anything more than a biological relationship." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Silent Vigil {{played a}} huge role in redefining Duke’s {{external}} image within the Durham African-American {{community as well}} as setting an important internal precedent for student activism down the line. Even though “stories about the ‘Silent Vigil’ were not carried in newspapers across the country,” the demonstration attempted to show “to Black America that White America still cares and still acts with deeds not words.” Professor Samuel Dubois Cook stated to the Vigil participants, “I and other Negroes can go on hoping and believing in the promise of America; we can go on believing {{that we are going to}} be free <b>someday</b> <b>because</b> of people like you and all other members of this magnificent vigil." [...] Furthermore, the Silent Vigil set a new standard for student activism on campus. As Professor John Cell noted, “The image Duke had of itself and the kind of people who were in positions of power changed.” It showed students, black and white alike, that administrative change, even in a Southern university, could be implemented and initiated by the students and for the students. As University Archivist, William E. King, notes, “Silent Vigil’s greatest significance lay in the choice it delineated for those living in the tumultuous year of 1968. The old order clearly was changing. Did one react by supporting traditional values and the status quo or did one grasp at growth and change.” Such a difference in reacting to campus inequalities was demonstrated by the Allen Building Takeover in 1969, when students in the Afro-American Society took control of Duke’s main administrative building to advocate for their rights as students. The criticism from alumni and trustees resulting from the buildup of student-administration conflict eventually caused President Douglas Knight to resign.|$|R

40|$|Although many past court {{decisions}} have been adjudicated {{in favor of the}} press, the judiciary has so far been unwilling to deliver the definitive decision that will lead to clear, concise resolution of the conflict between the right to privacy v the right to know. The conflict is especially evident in cases involving crime victims, more specifically in rape cases. Thirteen crime victim/press cases are studied at various levels for this paper. All of the cases deal specifically with rape. The cases help to support the conclusion that both the press and crime victims should not risk that some day the courts will hand down a decision that will overwhelmingly favor one right over the other. Both concepts have a 2 ̆ 7 right to exist 2 ̆ 7 in a democratic society. Therefore, each side has too much to lose to risk being on the losing side of the next precedent-setting decision. As a result, both sides must work harder towards resolving their conflicts together, before their differences force the courts to choose the 2 ̆ 7 winner 2 ̆ 7. Because we lack a clear, concise trend derived from {{court decisions}} {{on the issue of the}} press 2 ̆ 7 right to publish versus the the rape victim 2 ̆ 7 s right to privacy, and <b>because</b> <b>someday,</b> precedent could be set that too strongly favors one right over the other, this conflict is best resolved by advocates on both sides continually working together to keep cases out of unpredictable courts...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we address}} {{problems}} from two topics of applied mathematics: linear integer programming and polyhedral computation. Linear integer programming concerns solving optimisation problems to maximise a linear cost function over {{the set of}} integer points in a polyhedron. Polyhedral computation is concerned with algorithms for computing different properties of convex polyhedra. First, we explore the theory and computation of Gröbner bases and Markov bases for linear integer programming. Second, we investigate and improve an algorithm from polyhedral computation that converts between different representations of cones and polyhedra. A Markov basis {{is a set of}} integer vectors such that we can move between any two feasible solutions of an integer program by adding or subtracting vectors in the Markov basis while never moving outside the set of feasible solutions. Markov bases are mainly used in algebraic statistics for sampling from a set of feasible solutions. The major contribution of this thesis is a fast algorithm for computing Markov bases, which we used to solve a previously intractable computational challenge. Gröbner basis methods are exact local search approaches for solving integer programs. We present a Gröbner basis approach that can use the structure of an integer program in order to solve it more efficiently. Gröbner basis methods are interesting mainly from a purely theoretical viewpoint, but they are also interesting because they may provide insight into why some classes of integer programs are difficult to solve using standard techniques and <b>because</b> <b>someday</b> {{they may be able to}} solve these difficult problems. Computing the properties of convex polyhedra is useful for solving problems within different areas of mathematics such as linear programming, integer programming, combinatorial optimisation, and computational geometry. We investigate and improve an algorithm for converting between a generator representation of a cone or polyhedron and a constraint representation of the cone or polyhedron and vice versa. This algorithm can be extended to compute circuits of matrices, which are used in computational biology for metabolic pathway analysis. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{find out}} and to analyze the factors that {{affecting}} the fuel subsidy (BBM) which written in the state budget. The data {{has been used in}} this study as follows secondary data obtained from the records and reports from various agencies such as statistic bureau (BPS), Ministry of Finance, Indonesia bank, the US. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Directorate General of oil and Gas, previous journals and the results of studies. Variables has been analyzed by using path analysis {{to find out}} direct and indirect effect as well as Sobel test to find out the level of significance of intervening variable as moderator variable. Test of model validity by using the coefficient of total determination and trimming theory to find out the variation of fuel subsidy (BBM) in Indonesia that it {{can be explained by the}} exogen variable. Based on the regression results found the coefficient of total determination 0. 998 its means 99. 8 percent explained by the model while the remaining 0. 2 percent explained by other variables outside of the model. Variable of dollar rate is the dominant variable which directly affects on the fuel subsidy. While the fuel subsidized consumption variable is the dominant variable which indirect effect on fuel subsidies through fuel import. To reduce the burden of fuel subsidy in the future state budget hence the government needs to increase oil lifting to reduce fuel imports by way of exploring new wells to replace the old wells which its lifting is declining and increasing investment in the construction of oil refineries in Indonesia to maintain national energy security as well as trying to develop renewable energy instead of oil as fuel <b>because</b> <b>someday</b> oil as a source of un-renewable energy surely be depleted in number while the man and all their needs would increase from year to year. The government should provide adequate public transportation, thereby reducing private vehicle mobility and most importantly is the government more serious in the implementation of the program of conversion fule to liquid gas for vehicles both in terms of conversion technology and security guarantees for each user of liquid gas. </p...|$|E
