Not all agreed, however; Paste Magazine included the comic book in its list of favorite horror comics in late 2016.|$|E

At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.|$|E

5|$|Born ca. 1170, Michael was a {{descendant}} of Alexios I Komnenos and a cousin of emperors Isaac II Angelos and Alexios III Angelos. He began his public career in 1190, as a hostage to the Third Crusade, {{and went on to}} serve as governor of the province of Mylasa and Melanoudion in the 1190s and again in ca. 1200/1. During the latter tenure he rebelled against Alexios III but was defeated and forced to flee to the Seljuk Turks. In the aftermath of the sack of Constantinople <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourth</b> Crusade in 1204, he attached himself to Boniface of Montferrat. Soon, however, he abandoned the Crusader leader and went to Epirus, where he established himself as ruler, apparently through marriage with the daughter or widow of a local magnate.|$|E
5|$|Despite these reverses, {{in early}} 1261, Emperor Michael VIII {{set his sights}} on {{capturing}} the great prize: Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, which had been the seat of the Latin Empire since its capture <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourth</b> Crusade in 1204. To this end, Michael concluded an alliance with Genoa in March, and in July 1261, as the one-year truce concluded after the previous failed Nicaean attack was nearing its end, Strategopoulos, recently released from Epirote custody, was sent with a small advance force of 800 soldiers (most of them Cumans) to keep a watch on the Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins.|$|E
5|$|Finucane had {{completed}} 108 fighter operations over France <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> week of June 1942. On 27 June, Leigh-Mallory, {{with the approval}} of Sholto Douglas, promoted Finucane to wing commander. Finucane became the youngest wing commander in the RAF, and was to lead the Hornchurch Wing. Duncan Smith later said, that though he admired Finucane, he resented the young fighter pilot's appointment and felt as an older, experienced leader, he could have led the wing himself. Duncan Smith also felt the press gave the young pilot too much attention. Nevertheless, the two maintained a cordial relationship. In his short time as wing commander of Hornchurch, Finucane made a few alterations to the formation. The most notable was to tighten flying discipline, loosen formation flying and increase low-level navigation skills.|$|E
