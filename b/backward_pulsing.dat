40|$|Abstract Background Proteins that migrate through {{cross-linked}} polyacrylamide gels (PAGs) {{under the}} influence of a constant electric field experience negative factors, such as diffusion and non-specific trapping in the gel matrix. These negative factors reduce protein concentrations within a defined gel volume with increasing migration distance and, therefore, decrease protein separation efficiency. Enhancement of protein separation efficiency was investigated by implementing pulsed field-inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE). Results Separation of model protein species and large protein complexes was compared between FIGE and constant field electrophoresis (CFE) in different percentages of PAGs. Band intensities of proteins in FIGE with appropriate ratios of forward and <b>backward</b> <b>pulse</b> times were superior to CFE despite longer running times. These results revealed an increase in band intensity per defined gel volume. A biphasic protein relative mobility shift was observed in percentages of PAGs up to 14 %. However, the effect of FIGE on protein separation was stochastic at higher PAG percentage. Rat liver lysates subjected to FIGE in the second-dimension separation of two-dimensional polyarcylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D PAGE) showed a 20 % {{increase in the number of}} discernible spots compared with CFE. Nine common spots from both FIGE and CFE were selected for peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry (MS), which revealed higher final ion scores of all nine protein spots from FIGE. Native protein complexes ranging from 800 kDa to larger than 2000 kDa became apparent using FIGE compared with CFE. Conclusion The present investigation suggests that FIGE under appropriate conditions improves protein separation efficiency during PAGE as a result of increased local protein concentration. FIGE can be implemented with minimal additional instrumentation in any laboratory setting. Despite the tradeoff of longer running times, FIGE can be a powerful protein separation tool. </p...|$|R

An NO synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine monomethyl ester (L-NAME) was administered at graded intravenous doses. This agent caused dose-dependent increases in AP and TPR with decreases in HR. At an accumulative dose of 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, APm was increased by 29 ± 3 [*]mmHg (+ 31 %) and TPR by 49 ± 6 (× 103) dyne[*][*]s[*][*]cm− 5 (+ 50 %), while HR was reduced by 37 ± 5 [*]b. p. m.

L-NAME also did not significantly affect the ventricular work including the steady, oscillatory and total work. Aminoguanidine, a specific inhibitor for inducible NO synthase (iNOS), in dose 10 – 60 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. v. did not alter the AP, HR and other parameters. The result indicated that blockade of constitutive NOS, but not iNOS is involved in these changes. Angiotensin II (Ang) in various infusion doses was used to produce a profile of AP increase similar to that caused by L-NAME. Ang remarkably increased Zc, while TPR was moderately elevated. The pattern of haemodynamic changes was different from that following L-NAME.

This study evaluates a novel method of determining PTT from waveform decomposition of central aortic pressure using a single pulse measurement. Aortic pressure was estimated from a transformed radial pulse and decomposed into forward and backward waves using a triangular flow wave.

Linear regression between measured PTT (y; milliseconds) and calculated PTT (x; milliseconds) was y= 1. 05 x- 2. 1 (r= 0. 67; P< 0. 001). This model was tested in a separate group of 44 subjects (21 females; age 55 ± 14 years) by comparing measured carotid-femoral PWV (y; meters per second) and PWV calculated using the estimated value of PTT (eTR/ 2) and carotid femoral distance (x; meters per second; y= 1. 21 x- 2. 5; r= 0. 82; P< 0. 001).

40|$|The present thesis {{includes}} {{results of}} several investigations concerning {{the propagation of}} optical pulses in optical fibers and spatio-temporal beams in optical Kerr media and ionizable media. Both numerical and analytical methods {{play an important role}} in the investigations. Special emphasis has been given to new aspects of problems involving conversion of non-linear modes in optical pulses, fast adiabatic compression, wavebreaking-free pulses and passive mode-locking by dissipative four-wave mixing which have been described for the first time. The applicability of these phenomena for the problem of optical pulse generation and compression has been discussed. Several problems concerning the dynamics of spatial optical beams have been studied for one and two dimensions. The dynamics of TE polarized one-dimensional optical beams on planar slabs have been analyzed and a non-linear equaivalent to the Snell law has been found for the transmission-reflection of the beam thorugh the slab. Furthermore, the properties of the first azimuthal mode of a laser beam propagating in a cubic-quintic non-linear medium has been studied. It has been found that this mode is azimuthally stable provided the beam flux is over a certain a certain threshold which is calculated analytically. Finally the robust nature of the dynamics of a single azimuthal mode as well as of the mutual intercation between two modes are described. Full spatio-temporal dynamics of optical pulses in ionizable media have been studied for the cases of impact as well as field-induced ionizations. These calculations have beeen extended to include both forward and <b>backward</b> going light <b>pulses</b> and all the temporal scales by the development of a finite differences time domain code that solves the Maxwell equations in two dimensions together with the equations for the cold electron plasma.

40|$|The {{generation}} of short and intense light pulses is {{of importance to}} many scientific and tech-nical applications. Standard approaches [1, 2] are limited by technological constraints and the parameters that can be achieved. The pulse energy {{is limited by the}} thermal damage of the op-tical elements, in particular by the grating damage in compressors. The compression schemes based on the backward parametric amplification in gases or liquids offer much higher damage thresholds but there the pulse length is limited by the phonon period of the order of 100 ps[3]. These limitations can be overcome by using plasmas as amplifying medium [4, 5, 6]. In this case the coupling between the seed pulse and the pump pulse delivering the energy takes place via a 3 -wave coupling mechanism where the role of the third wave is taken up by either the electron plasma wave (stimulated Raman scattering, SRS) or by the ion-acoustic wave (IAW) (stimulated Brillouin scattering, SBS). In the ideal case the <b>backward</b> propagating short <b>pulse</b> completely depletes the pump energy as it advances in the amplifying medium and reaches intensities far above the pump intensity. The use of SRS-based amplification schemes in the weak coupling regime of plasmas has been exploited theoretically and experimentally recently [6]. Compression of a light pulse in a plasma in the weak coupling regime of SBS was considered in [5]. SBS has several advan-tages for pulse compression with respect to SRS: a small frequency shift, higher amplification coefficient and weak sensitivity to density perturbations. Historically SBS has been disregarded as the compressed pulse duration is limited to pi/ωcs, i. e. half an ion-acoustic wave period. However, the SBS response time can be decreased by passing into the strong coupling regime, which we are studying here. There the ion-plasma response is characterised by the frequency ωsc ∼ k 2 ov 2 Eω 2 pi/ω...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} status of plans to {{commission}} a short-pulse, quad of beams on the National Ignition Facility (NIF), capable of generating > 10 kJ of energy in 10 ps. These beams will initially provide an advanced radiographic capability (ARC) to generate brilliant, x-ray back-lighters for diagnosing fuel density and symmetry during ignition experiments. A fiber, mode-locked oscillator generates the seed pulse for the ARC beam line in the NIF master oscillator room (MOR). The 200 fs, 1053 nm oscillator pulse is amplified and stretched in time using a chirped-fiber-Bragg grating. The stretched pulse is split to follow two separate beam paths through the chain. Each pulse goes to separate pulse tweakers where the dispersion can be adjusted to generate a range of pulse widths and delays at the compressor output. After further fiber amplification the two pulses are transported to the NIF preamplifier area and spatially combined using shaping masks to form a split-spatial-beam profile that fits in a single NIF aperture. This split beam propagates through a typical NIF chain where the energy is amplified to several kilojoules. A series of mirrors directs the amplified, split beam to a folded grating compressor that is located near the equator of the NIF target chamber. Figure 1 shows a layout of the beam transport and folded compressor, showing the split beam spatial profile. The folder compressor contains four pairs of large, multi-layer-dielectric gratings; each grating in a pair accepts half of the split beam. The compressed output pulse can be 0. 7 - 50 ps in duration, depending on {{the setting of the}} pulse tweaker in the MOR. The compressor output is directed to target chamber center using four additional mirrors that include a 9 meter, off-axis parabola. The final optic, immediately following the parabola, is a pair of independently adjustable mirrors that can direct the pair of ARC beams to individual x-ray backlighter targets. The first mirror after the compressor leaks {{a small fraction of the}} light that is transported to a diagnostics station where detailed measurements of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ARC pulse will be recorded for each shot. A NIF quad of short-pulse beams will support up to eight, independently-timed, short-pulse beams, capable of producing an x-ray motion picture. Alternatively, the combined aperture of the quad can direct > 10 kJ of energy in 10 psec onto a single target, enabling research into fast ignition and high-energy-density science on the NIF. We will discuss modifications to the NIF to accommodate ARC, including features such as simultaneous NIF-ARC operation in the same NIF quad, protection against <b>backward</b> propagating <b>pulses</b> from the target and plans to coherently add split beams...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} devoted to {{theoretical}} studies of pulse propagation of light through linear and nonlinear media, and of light-induced nuclear dynamics. The {{first part of the}} thesis addresses propagation of light pulses in linear periodical media - photonic crystals. The main accent was put on studies of the angular properties of two qualitatively different types of photonic crystals: holographic photonic crystals, and impurity band based photonic crystals. The anisotropy of band structure, group velocity and pulse delay with respect to the light polarization are analyzed. In {{the second part of the}} thesis a strict theory of nonlinear propagation of a few strong interacting light beams is presented. The key idea of this approach is a self-consistent solution of the nonlinear wave equation and the density matrix equations of the material. This technique is applied to studies of dynamics of cavityless lasing generated by ultra-fast multi-photon excitation. It is shown that interaction of co- and counter-propagating pulses of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) affects the dynamics and efficiency of nonlinear conversion. Our dynamical theory allows to explain the asymmetric spectral properties of the forward and <b>backward</b> ASE <b>pulses,</b> which were observed in recent experiment with different dye molecules. It is shown that the ASE spectral profile changes drastically when the pump intensity approaches the threshold level. The effect of the temporal self-pulsation of ASE is studied in detail. The third part of the thesis {{is devoted to}} light-induced nuclear dynamics. Time- and frequency-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of molecules driven by strong and coherent infrared (IR) pulses shows that the phase of the IR field strongly influences the trajectory of the nuclear wave packet, and hence, the X-ray spectrum. Such a dependence arises due to the interference of one (X-ray) and two-photon (X-ray + IR) excitation channels. The phase of the light influences the dynamics also when the Rabi frequency approaches the vibrational frequency, breaking down the rotating-wave approximation. The probe X-ray spectra are also sensitive to the delay time, the duration, and the shape of the pulses. The evolution of the nuclear wave packets in the dissociative core-excited state affects the dynamics of resonant Auger scattering from fixed-in-space molecules. One of the important dynamical effects is the atomic-like resonance which experiences electronic Doppler shift. We predict that the scattering of the Auger electrons by nearby atoms leads to new Doppler shifted resonances. These extra resonances show sharp maxima in the bond directions, which makes them very promising as probes for local molecular structure using energy and angular resolved electron-ion coincidence techniques. Our theory provides prediction of several new effects, but also results that are in good agreement with the available experimental data. QC 2010090...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{theoretical}} studies {{of the role of}} nuclear vibrations on nonlinear and linear absorption, pulse propagation, and resonant scattering of light. The molecular parameters needed for the simulations are obtained through suitable quantum chemical calculations, which are compared with available experimental data. The first part of the thesis addresses to modeling of ampli ed spontaneous emission (ASE) in organic chromophores recently studied in a series of experiments. To explain the threshold behavior of the ASE spectra we invoke the idea of competition between di erent ASE channels and non-radiative quenching of the lasing levels. We show that the ASE spectrum changes drastically when the pump intensity approaches the threshold level, namely, when the ASE rate approaches the rate of vibrational relaxation or the rate of solute-solvent relaxation in the rst excited state. According to our simulations the ASE intensity experiences oscillations. Temporal self-pulsations of forward and <b>backward</b> propagating ASE <b>pulses</b> occur due to two reasons: i) the interaction of co- and counter-propagating ASE, and ii) the competition between the ampli ed spontaneous emission and o -resonant absorption. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we explore two-photon absorption taking into account nuclear vibrational degrees of freedom. The theory, applied to the N 101 molecule [p-nitro-p'- diphenylamine stilbene], shows that two-step absorption is red shifted relative to one-photon absorption spectrum in agreement with the measurements. The reason for this e ect is the one-photon absorption from the first excited state. Simulations show that two mechanisms are responsible for the population of this state, two-photon absorption and offresonant one-photon absorption by the wing of the spectral line. In the third part of the thesis we study multi-photon dynamics of photobleaching by a periodical sequence of short laser pulses. It is found that the photobleaching as well as the uorescence follow double-exponential dynamics. The fourth part of the thesis {{is devoted to}} the role of the nuclear dynamics in x-ray spectroscopy. Our studies show that the vibronic coupling of close lying core excited states strongly a ects the resonant x-ray Raman scattering from ethylene and benzene molecules. We demonstrate that the manifestation of the non-adiabatic e ects depends strongly on the detuning of photon energy from the top of photoabsorption. The electronic selection rules are shown to break down when the excitation energy is tuned in resonance with the symmetry breaking vibrational modes. Selection rules are then restored for large detuning. We obtained good agreement with experiment. Finally, our multi-mode theory is applied to simulations of the resonant Auger and x-ray absorption spectra of the ethyne molecule. QC 2010081...|$|R
