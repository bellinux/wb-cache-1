5|$|Spain were {{up against}} Portugal {{in the round}} of 16, and Villa {{would prove to be}} vital once again, as Xavi backheeled an Andrés Iniesta pass to the on-rushing Villa, who hit the back of the net on the rebound after having his first shot saved by Eduardo, proving enough to give Spain a place in the quarter-finals against Paraguay, where Villa scored a goal from a rebound after Pedro hit the post. Once again, Villa's goal proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> as the match {{finished}} 1–0, while Spain booked a game with Germany in the semi-finals, where Spain recorded yet another 1–0 victory with the only goal coming from Carles Puyol.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next {{lost its}} second {{straight}} game, against the Los Angeles Dons in Los Angeles. The Dons opened the scoring {{on the first}} play from scrimmage after the Browns kicked off. Chuck Fenenbock ran the ball 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland came back to build a 16–7 lead at halftime, but Groza missed his first extra point in 24 tries after Bill Lund ran for a touchdown in the second quarter. The missed extra point proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in the game. Los Angeles went back on top {{in the fourth quarter}} with a Dale Gentry run for a touchdown and a field goal by Joe Aquirre with just 18 seconds left and won by one point, 17–16. A fumble by Browns halfback Ray Terrell at the Los Angeles 35-yard line in the fourth quarter gave the Dons the ball and led to Aquirre's game-winning field goal. Cleveland's running game stalled for the second game in a row; the team gained only 43 yards rushing. Bill Willis, the Browns' defensive star, sat out the entire game with a strep infection. Two other Browns players, Bob Steuber and Alex Kapter, suffered leg injuries and were helped off the field.|$|E

His final round of 76 was the highest winning score by a major champion since 1955.

25|$|Jason Garrison's {{power play}} goal at 8:49 {{of the third}} period proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in Tampa Bay's victory in game two. Lightning {{starting}} goaltender Ben Bishop had left the game moments earlier for undisclosed reasons and was replaced with Andrei Vasilevskiy. Because {{he was on the}} ice during Garrison's winning goal, Vasilevskiy was credited with his first playoff victory, and became the first goalie to win a Finals game in relief since Lester Patrick helped the New York Rangers defeat the Montreal Maroons in overtime of game two of the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals, 2–1.|$|E
25|$|During the season, {{there was}} ongoing {{speculation}} {{that if the}} talented Fremantle lineup failed to reach the finals, it might cost Fremantle coach Chris Connolly {{his job at the}} club, and that the two points potentially lost by the siren mistake could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between making or missing the finals. Ironically, however, it was St Kilda coach Grant Thomas who was dismissed {{at the end of the}} season after (though not necessarily because) the club was defeated by Melbourne and eliminated in the first week of the finals, which would certainly not have happened if St Kilda had finished third and claimed a double-chance.|$|E

Although the call was heavily criticized, after the incident he would not see much action during the team's second worst start in franchise history (one win in their first eight games), that eventually cost the job of head coach Wade Phillips. His special teams shortcomings were also being criticized during the losing streak. On December 5 against the Indianapolis Colts when the season was already lost, he rushed 19 times for 100 yards and a touchdown in a win.|$|E

The Sussex chase looked on when they were 112 for 1 with Matt Prior and Chris Adams at the crease, as they were just waiting for opportunities to up the run-rate, but instead Symonds and England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff ran through them with the ball, and Robin Martin-Jenkins and Ahmed eventually had to consolidate to 214 for 8, losing by 35 runs.|$|E
