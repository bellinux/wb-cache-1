The stations share resources, which allows WGBA to use WTMJ's resources for breaking news, live events and sports coverage. This became more evident in 2008, when WGBA outsourced sports and weekend weather reports to WTMJ, and had simulcast that station's morning and noon newscasts for a short time.|$|R

Part of the analysis is also focused on blending of advertising and editorial content, which were investigated through framing analysis.
