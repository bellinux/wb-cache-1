40|$|I want {{to thank}} Rodney Douglas, my thesis advisor and {{inspirational}} source very much for his great support. His guidance was very gentle {{and he was very}} careful not to disturb my own intuition and approach to the field while providing guidelines and stopping me when I was getting too far off track. Rodney’s support went well beyond scientific supervision: He helped me gain self-confidence about my project and motivated me in difficult times. It was a great privilege for me to work on such a visionary project. A project that might not have found many homes at the current stage of technology – but the stimulating environment created by the professors Kevan Martin and Rodney Douglas in the Institute of Neuroinformatics have provided the perfect balance between pioneering spirit and grounding to reality. I {{would also like to thank}} Hava Siegelmann for accompanying me along the first part of my thesis and for the inspiring discussions we held. I am very happy that she and Christoph von der Malsburg can be the coexaminers of my thesis and I would like to thank them <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> goin...|$|E
60|$|A {{long time}} ago there lived a king and queen who had no children, {{although}} they <b>both</b> wished <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> a little son. They tried not to let each other see how unhappy they were, and pretended to take pleasure in hunting and hawking {{and all sorts of}} other sports; but at length the king could bear it no longer, and declared that he must go and visit the furthest corners of his kingdom, {{and that it would be}} many months before he should return to his capital.|$|R
40|$|First and {{foremost}} I {{want to thank}} God for blessing me with amazing opportunities in life and my mother for giving me all of the support and encouragement to move out and pursue my professional achievements. Life could have been easier and joyful in Brazil, but thank you for understanding why I took the road less traveled. Dr. Pluhar my advisor, thank for seeing the potential in me. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity you gave me and for your contributions to my education and further professional development. Dr. Ohlfest my co-advisor, {{thank you for the}} amazing mentorship and for inspiring me to build my skills as an investigator. I will never forget the day that you gave me the Gabrilovich paper “Myeloid-derived suppressor cells as regulators of the immune system ” and said: “Michelle I want you to read this”. Dr. Olin, my co-advisor, thank you for sharing your knowledge with me {{in the first years of}} my lab training, especially with the flow cytometry that we <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like, and <b>for</b> all the supporting and guidance at your new lab in this past year. Lastly thank you for the laughs we shared during all of these years. Next time I go to a conference, I promise I will never miss my poster presentation. Drs. Pennell and Modiano my committee members, thank you. I am fortunate and deeply grateful to have you as members of my committee and helping me with your scientific knowledge. I also want to thank Dr. Gerry O’Sullivan for the histopathological analysis of canine gliomas, my friend Amber Winter from the Canine Investigation Cente...|$|R
