To demonstrate the causative relationship between Clostridium tyrobutyricum and late blowing in cheese, many cheesemaking experiments were performed to provoke this defect by using spores from several strains of the major dairy-related clostridia. A method of PCR amplification of a part of the 16 S rRNA gene in combination with hybridization with species-specific DNA probes was developed to allow the specific detection of clostridial sequences in DNAs extracted from cheeses. The sensitivity was increased by using nested PCR.

In {{an effort to make}} T. fusca produce a high yield of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid,</b> multiple <b>fermentation</b> parameters were explored and optimized. The effect of different carbon sources (mannose, xylose, lactose, cellobiose, glucose, sucrose, and acetates) on <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> production was studied, where cellobiose produced the highest yield of 0. 67 g/g C (g-butyric acid/g-carbon input).

The maximum titer of 2. 1 g/L <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> was achieved on 9. 66 g/L cellulose. Fermentation was performed on ground corn stover as a substrate to evaluate the production of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> on lignocellulosic biomass, and the optimized conditions resulted in a titer of 2. 37 g/L <b>butyric</b> <b>acid.</b> The <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis pathway was identified involving five genes that catalyzed reactions from acetyl-CoA to butanyol-CoA in T. fusca.

30|$|Butyric acid is {{currently}} produced from petroleum by oxidation of butyraldehyde obtained from oxosynthesis or hydroformylation of propylene (Playne 1985).

Although <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> was discovered by Pasteur already in 1861 (Gottschalk 1985), it is only during the last decades that it has received increasing worldwide attention as the necessity for a bio-based and sustainable society has come in the forefront.|$|E
30|$|In-situ {{removal of}} the acids from the {{fermentation}} broth {{could be one of}} the solutions to reduce product inhibition (Zigova and Sturdik 2000). Using simultaneous solvent extraction, this technique was applied on <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> by Clostridium butyricum (Zigova et al. 1999). The problem with this technique is that an immiscible or partially immiscible organic solvent can be toxic to the bacteria. To minimize the toxic effect of the organic solvent, a fibrous bed bioreactor was developed successfully and used for <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation</b> by Clostridium tyrobutyricum (Wu and Yang 2003). Application of in situ electrodialysis is an alternative method where no organic solvents are used and toxic effects are thus eliminated. This technique was tested for lactic (Boniardi et al. 1997), acetic, propionic (Zhang et al. 1993) and even for butyric acid extraction (Du et al. 2012 a) and higher productivity was reported in all cases. Electrodialysis includes an anion exchange membrane (for acid–anion separation) and is subject to limitations by fouling effects. A relatively new technique, Reverse Electro Enhanced Dialysis, REED, (Rype and Jonsson 2002; Prado-Rubio et al. 2011) has been reported to be superior in that respect and it has so far been successfully applied to lactic acid extraction (Garde 2002) and recombinant protein production (Madsen et al. 2006). The REED system continuously removes acid anions from the fermentation broth by replacing them with hydroxide ions. This ion exchange also provides stabilization of the pH in the reactor. Thus, the usual practice of regulating the pH by adding a base (NaOH, KOH or NH 4 OH) can be avoided and inhibition from cations, especially when high amounts of acids are produced, is consequently prevented.|$|E

The crops were treated with formic acid (FA), sodium nitrite–hexamine mixture (NaHe) or homofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The control silage was made without additive. Additives {{were not able to}} improve the quality of white lupin–wheat silage in all trials, compared with untreated silage. The treatment with LAB showed good results only at the first stage of crop maturity with sufficient amounts of water-soluble carbohydrate in the pre-ensiling crops. The FA treatment showed elevated butyric acid levels in all trials, which suggests that the FA application level used (4 L t 1 FM, 100 % FA) was insufficient to decrease pH enough for preventing the growth of clostridia and <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation.</b> NaHe was the only additive that was able to inhibit the activity of clostridia in all trials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Split and {{secondary}} fermentation defects in Swiss-type cheese varieties are manifested as undesirable slits or cracks {{that may lead}} to downgrading of the cheese. Split defect is associated with an excessive production of gas or an unsuitable cheese body that cannot accommodate gas produced, or a combination of both factors. Secondary fermentation is the apparent production of gas after the desired propionic fermentation of the warm room has taken place. No consensus exists as to the definitive causes of the defects, but possible causes are reviewed under factors that are associated with rheological behaviour (including cheese manufacture, acidification, intact protein content and proteolysis, seasonality of milk supply and ripening or storage temperature and duration) or with overproduction of gas (including milk microflora, propionic acid bacteria (PAB) – in particular strains with high aspartase activity and ability to grow at low temperatures, lactic acid bacteria, interactions between starter bacteria, facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli (FHL) and other sources of gas including <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> <b>fermentation).</b> The influence of other parameters such as copper concentration, air incorporation, salt content, rind formation and cheese wrapping materials is also considered. Methods to reduce the prevalence of the split defect {{and secondary}} fermentation include addition of water to improve elastic properties by the removal of unfermented carbohydrate and the use of FHL to control PAB activity to prevent the production of excessive gas...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> by Clostridium butyricum ZJUCB at various pH values was investigated. In order {{to study the}} effect of pH on cell growth, <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis and reducing sugar consumption, different cultivation pH values ranging from 6. 0 to 7. 5 were evaluated in 5 -L bioreactor. In controlled pH batch fermentation, the optimum pH for cell growth and <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> production was 6. 5 with a cell yield of 3. 65 g/L and <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> yield of 12. 25 g/L. Based on these results, this study then compared batch and fed-batch <b>fermentation</b> of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> production at pH 6. 5. Maximum value (16. 74 g/L) of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration was obtained in fed-batch fermentation compared to 12. 25 g/L in batch fermentation. It was concluded that cultivation under fed-batch fermentation mode could enhance <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> production significantly (P< 0. 01) by C. butyricum ZJUCB...|$|R
50|$|<b>Butyric</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{fatty acid}} {{occurring}} {{in the form of}} esters in animal fats. The triglyceride of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> makes up 3-4% of butter. When butter goes rancid, <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> is liberated from the glyceride by hydrolysis, leading to the unpleasant odor. It is an important member of the fatty acid subgroup called short-chain fatty <b>acids.</b> <b>Butyric</b> <b>acid</b> is a medium-strong acid that reacts with bases and strong oxidants, and attacks many metals.|$|R
40|$|Background: Currently, {{the most}} {{promising}} microorganism used for the bio-production of <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> is Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 (T); however, it is unable to use sucrose as a sole carbon source. Consequently, a newly isolated strain, Bacillus sp. SGP 1, that was found to produce a levansucrase enzyme, which hydrolyzes sucrose into fructose and glucose, was used in a co-culture with this strain, permitting C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 (T) to ferment sucrose to <b>butyric</b> <b>acid.</b> Results: B. sp. SGP 1 alone did not show any <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> production and the main metabolite produced was lactic acid. This allowed C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 (T) to utilize the monosaccharides resulting from the activity of levansucrase together with the lactic acid produced by B. sp. SGP 1 to generate <b>butyric</b> <b>acid,</b> which was the main fermentative product within the co-culture. Furthermore, the final acetic acid concentration in the co-culture was significantly lower when compared with pure C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755 (T) cultures grown on glucose. In fed-batch fermentations, the optimum conditions {{for the production of}} <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> were around pH 5. 50 and a temperature of 37 degrees C. Under these conditions, the final butyrate concentration was 34. 2 +/- 1. 8 g/L with yields of 0. 35 +/- 0. 03 g (butyrate) /g (sucrose) and maximum productivity of 0. 3 +/- 0. 04 g/L/h. Conclusions: Using this co-culture, sucrose can be utilized as a carbon source for <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> production at a relatively high yield. In addition, this co-culture offers also the benefit of a greater selectivity, with <b>butyric</b> <b>acid</b> constituting 92. 8 % of the <b>acids</b> when the <b>fermentation</b> was terminated. open 2...|$|R
