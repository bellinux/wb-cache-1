[...] Because quality counterfeit items are often difficult to discern from authentic goods, this approach enables potential customers to access an item's current and previous ownersits provenanceprior to purchase.|$|E

40|$|Competitive {{elections}} {{in many parts}} of Africa generate powerful incentives to presidential candidates (and to a lesser extent political parties) to brand themselves in ways that transcend regional or ethnic loyalties. In Malawi, Joyce Banda - President from 2012 to 2014 - sought to distinguish herself from her competitors by branding herself and her new People's Party as the champions of social protection for women, children, and the poor. Some of the conditions that favoured Banda's adoption of a social <b>protection</b> <b>brand</b> were specific to the political context in Malawi. Elsewhere in East and Southern Africa, presidential candidates and parties have generally denounced 'handouts' and avoided the social <b>protection</b> <b>brand.</b> In practice, her rhetorical embrace of social protection and 'handouts' was not matched by delivery during her two years in office. Banda's defeat in the 2014 Malawi election, although caused partly by other factors, suggests that there are limits to the efficacy of social <b>protection</b> <b>branding.</b> Nonetheless, the fact that she has used this brand at all suggests that social protection has grown in political significance, as an expression of pro-poor priorities...|$|R

2500|$|The rise of {{retailing}} {{and marketing}} in England and Europe {{has been extensively}} studied, but less is known about developments elsewhere.

Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960â€“1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable {{for a wide variety of}} ordinary consumers rather than just the elite. The rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic <b>brands,</b> trademark <b>protection</b> and sophisticated <b>brand</b> concepts.|$|R
