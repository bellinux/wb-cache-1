By comparison, two of Wells Fargo’s largest competitors, Bank of America and J.P.

25|$|The Syrian Civil War and its {{domestic}} impact have furthered the polarisation of Lebanese politics. The March 14 Alliance, dominated by Christian- and Sunni-based parties, is broadly {{sympathetic to the}} Syrian opposition to Bashar Al-Assad. In August, youth members of 14 March parties including Kataeb, Lebanese Forces, National Liberal Party, Future Movement and Islamic Group held a rally to demand the expulsion of the Syrian Ambassador. 8 March parties generally supported {{the continuation of the}} Assad government, <b>but</b> <b>analysts</b> believe some groups within the coalition may seek new alliances if the Assad government falls.

25|$|North Korean People's Liberation Front {{claims that}} it has support and {{contacts}} within disaffected officers of the Korean People's Army, <b>but</b> <b>analysts</b> are not convinced of this. They also claim to have contacts within the police of North Korea. Hankuk University of Foreign Studies professor Namkung Young says {{that members of the}} organization know the North Korean situation well, but they should be more realistic with their goals. Furthermore, he noted that South Korean support for the organization could increase tensions between the governments. A U.S. military analyst was unaware of any independent sources supporting the claims that the North Korean military would be discontent enough to attempt a coup.|$|E
25|$|In Colombia, however, a wave {{of attacks}} by the FARC in June seemed to undo the {{progress}} made in Havana. Sabotage to energy infrastructure left Buenaventura and Tumaco without electricity, 13,000 barrels of oil were spilled in Putumayo, a power pylon in Caquetá was bombed and a police colonel was assassinated in Ipiales. These attacks left over one million people without electricity, and the attacks against oil infrastructure created an environmental catastrophe. With these actions, the FARC had sought to regain the military initiative after the hits they suffered from the military in May and put political pressure on the government, <b>but</b> <b>analysts</b> judged that the guerrilla had miscalculated as it had further reduced their credibility {{in the eyes of}} the public.|$|E

500|$|According to Judge Jay Bybee of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, {{those in}} favor of popular {{elections}} for senators believed that two primary problems were caused by the original provisions: legislative corruption and electoral deadlocks. There {{was a sense that}} senatorial elections were [...] "bought and sold", changing hands for favors and sums of money rather than because of the competence of the candidate. Between 1857 and 1900, the Senate investigated three elections over corruption. In 1900, for example, William A. Clark had his election voided after the Senate concluded that he had bought votes in the Montana legislature. <b>But</b> <b>analysts</b> Bybee and Todd Zywicki believe this concern was largely unfounded; there was a [...] "dearth of hard information" [...] on the subject. In more than a century of legislative elections of U.S. senators, only 10 cases were contested for allegations of impropriety.|$|E
2500|$|According to analysts, the UK government's {{decision}} to finally {{go ahead with}} the airport, after long delays, seems to be driven in part by concerns over a continuing tense standoff with Argentina in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute.

2500|$|Sony's {{strategy}} {{came at a}} cost. The company initially priced the PlayStation 3 at $599 for the 60 GB {{model and}} $499 for a 20 GB (released outside the PAL region), roughly double {{the price of the}} PlayStation 2 and substantially higher than competing consoles. [...] But the PS3 console sold at an estimated loss of more than US$200 per unit, resulting in losses estimated at about $3 billion. [...] <b>But</b> <b>analysts,</b> such as Richard Cooper with Screen Digest, expected Sony to recoup far more than that through the sale of games on the system.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2007, BMC bought Emprisa Networks (based in Fairfax, Virginia) [...] "for {{its network}} compliance, change, {{configuration}} management and automation product". Analysts from Gartner Group commented: [...] "BMC is correctly framing the Emprisa acquisition {{as a key}} step in its developing end-to-end IT service automation strategy, which leverages BMC's strength in configuration management databases (CMDBs) and change management." [...] <b>But</b> <b>analysts</b> commented that BMC still needs: [...] "integration with other network management disciplines where it {{has little or no}} presence" [...] as well as a [...] "field training plan and more field sales and technical expertise in network management" [...] and [...] "close cooperation with its reseller partner Entuity."

2500|$|Like his {{predecessors}} Tomiichi Murayama and Junichiro Koizumi, Abe {{issued a statement}} commemorating the 70th anniversary {{of the end of}} the Second World War on 14 August 2015. This statement had been widely anticipated, with some commentators expecting Abe to amend or even refuse to repeat the previous leaders' apologies for Japan's role in the war. In the statement, Abe committed to uphold the previous apologies and expressed [...] "profound grief and eternal, sincere condolences" [...] for the [...] "immeasurable damage and suffering" [...] Japan had caused for [...] "innocent people" [...] during the conflict. He also argued that Japan should not be [...] "predestined to apologise" [...] forever, noting that more than eighty percent of Japanese people alive today were born after the conflict and played no part in it. The governments of both China and South Korea responded with criticism of the statement, <b>but</b> <b>analysts</b> noted that it was muted and restrained in tone, in comparison to the harsher rhetoric that has been used previously. A representative of the US National Security Council welcomed the statement, and referred to Japan as having been a [...] "model for nations everywhere" [...] in its record on [...] "peace, democracy, and the rule of law" [...] since the war's end. Professor Gerald Curtis of Colombia University argued that the statement [...] "probably satisfies no constituency" [...] either in Japan or abroad, but that by repeating the words [...] "aggression", [...] "colonialism", [...] "apology" [...] and [...] "remorse" [...] used in the Murayama Statement of 1995, it was likely to be enough to improve relations with China and Korea.|$|E
