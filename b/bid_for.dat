5|$|In the {{unsuccessful}} Lillehammer <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1992 Winter Olympics, {{ice hockey}} events were proposed played in Hamar and Gjøvik. However, in the Lillehammer <b>bid</b> <b>for</b> the 1994 Winter Olympics, all ice events {{were moved to}} Lillehammer proper, after recommendations from the International Ice Hockey Federation, who wanted all the ice hockey events {{to take place in}} the same town. This would involve building two temporary ice rinks at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, and after the Olympics moving them to Gjøvik and either Moelv, Brumunddal or Kongsvinger. By 1989, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to include short-track speed skating, increasing the number of ice halls from two to three. In April, the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) therefore proposed building permanent ice rinks in Hamar and Gjøvik.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bidding</b> <b>for</b> multi-items in {{simultaneous}} auctions raises challenging problems. In multi-auction settings, {{the determination}} of optimal bids by potential buyers requires combinatorial calculations. While an optimal bidding strategy is known when bidding in sequential auctions, only suboptimal strategies are available when <b>bidding</b> <b>for</b> items being sold in simultaneous auctions. We investigate a multidimensional bid improvement scheme, motivated by optimization techniques, to derive optimal <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> item bundles in simultaneous auctions. Given a vector of initial bids, the proposed scheme systematically improves <b>bids</b> <b>for</b> each item. Such multidimensional improvements result in locally optimal bid vectors. Globally optimal bid vectors are guaranteed in the limit for infinite restarts. For ease of presentation we use two-item scenarios to explain the working of the algorithm. Experimental results show polynomial complexity of variants of this algorithm under different types of bidder valuations for item bundles. ...|$|R
