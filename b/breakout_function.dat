50|$|The {{architectural}} {{design of the}} Perth Arena in Perth, Western Australia was heavily influenced by the eternity puzzle; the exterior design is also strongly reflected throughout the main arena, foyers, <b>breakout</b> <b>function</b> rooms and {{the entrance to the}} venue.|$|E
50|$|The Boracay Convention Center {{consists}} of exhibit halls. The front hall is strategically {{designed to accommodate}} multi-level booths and heavy machinery. The main hall {{can be converted to}} a basketball court which complies with Philippine Basketball Association standards and a volleyball court and/or for badminton games as well. It has eight <b>breakouts</b> <b>function</b> rooms that are adaptable to any setup that an event may require. The meeting rooms are intended for board meetings, seminars, and even break-out rooms for plenaries in the function rooms.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Breakout</b> Gateway Control <b>Function</b> (BGCF) is a SIP proxy which {{processes}} {{requests for}} routing from an S-CSCF when the S-CSCF {{has determined that}} the session cannot be routed using DNS or ENUM/DNS. It includes routing functionality based on telephone numbers.|$|R

50|$|In IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF) control Media Gateways (MGW)s to {{send and}} receive call to / from the PSTN circuit {{switched}} (CS) networks using.

30|$|This layer routes {{the data}} and synchronizes the media and IPMS layers. It {{consists}} of the media gateway controller function (MGCF), media resource function controller (MRFC) and <b>breakout</b> gateway control <b>function</b> (BGCF). The BGCF acts as the SIP proxy, {{which is responsible for}} processing the request to route the data from the S-CSCF whenever it determines that a session cannot be established using a DNS. Furthermore, the BGCF contains the routing features based on the telephone records.|$|R
30|$|BGCF (<b>Breakout</b> Gateway Control <b>Function).</b> BGCF {{determines the}} next hop for routing of a SIP message {{terminating}} in PSTN/CS. For PSTN/CS terminations, the BGCF selects the network in which PSTN/CS breakout is to occur. If the BGCF determines that the breakout is {{to occur in}} the same network in which the BGCF is located, then the BGCF selects a MGCF which is responsible for signaling interworking with the PSTN/CS Domain. If the break out is in another network, the BGCF will forward this session signaling to another BGCF in the selected network.|$|R
40|$|Observations {{show that}} {{high-velocity}} jets stem from deeply embedded young stars, which {{may still be}} experiencing infall from their parent cloud cores. Yet theory predicts that, early in this buildup, any outgoing wind is trapped by incoming material of low angular momentum. As collapse continues and brings in more rapidly rotating gas, the wind can eventually break out. Here we model this transition by following {{the motion of the}} shocked shell created by impact of the wind and a rotating, collapsing envelope. We first demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, that our previous, quasi-static solutions are dynamically unstable. Our present, fully time-dependent calculations include cases both where the wind is driven back by infall to the stellar surface and where it erupts as a true outflow. For the latter, we find that the time of breakout is 5 104 yr for wind speeds of 200 km s 1. The reason for the delay is that the shocked material, including the swept-up infall, must be able to climb out of the star’s gravitational potential well. We explore the critical wind speed necessary for <b>breakout</b> as a <b>function</b> of the mass transport rates in the wind and infall, as well as the cloud rotation rate 0 and time since the start of infall. Breakout does occur for realistic parameter choices. The actual breakout times would change if we relaxed the assumption of perfect mixing between the wind and infall material. Our expanding shells do not exhibit the collimation of observed jets but continue to expand laterally. To halt this expansion, the density in the envelope must fall off less steeply than in our model.

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of radiation emitted following shock breakout from a star's {{surface with a}} power-law density profile ρ∝ x^n is investigated. Assuming planar geometry, local Compton equilibrium and bremsstrahlung emission as the dominant photon production mechanism, numerical solutions are obtained for the photon number density and temperature profiles {{as a function of}} time, for hydrogen-helium envelopes. The temperature solutions are determined by the breakout shock velocity v_ 0 and the pre-shock breakout density ρ_ 0, and depend weakly on the value of n. Fitting formulas for the peak surface temperature at <b>breakout</b> as a <b>function</b> of v_ 0 and ρ_ 0 are provided, with T_peak≈ 9. 44 [12. 63 (v_ 0 /c) ^ 1 / 2] eV, and the time dependence of the surface temperature is tabulated. The time integrated emitted spectrum is a robust prediction of the model, determined by T_ peak and v_ 0 alone and insensitive to details of light travel time or slight deviations from spherical symmetry. Adopting commonly assumed progenitor parameters, breakout luminosities of 10 ^ 45 erg/s and 10 ^ 44 erg/s in the 0. 3 - 10 keV band are expected for BSG and RSG/He-WR progenitors respectively (T_peak is well below the band for RSGs, unless their radius is 10 ^ 13 cm). > 30 detections of SN 1987 A-like (BSG) breakouts are expected over the lifetime of ROSAT and XMM-Newton. An absence of such detections would imply that either the typical parameters assumed for BSG progenitors are grossly incorrect or that their envelopes are not hydrostatic. The observed spectrum and duration of XRF 080109 /SN 2008 D are in tension with a non-relativistic breakout from a stellar surface interpretation. Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 3 table...|$|R
