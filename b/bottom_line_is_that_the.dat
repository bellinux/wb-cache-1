500|$|In 2011, Romm {{stated that}} [...] "Feeding some 9 billion people by mid-century {{in the face}} of a rapidly {{worsening}} climate may well be the greatest challenge the human race has ever faced." [...] Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up notes: [...] "the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> economic cost of action is low, whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater". [...] Romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale that can save the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global GDP per year. He also asks in the book, [...] "will the United States be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies, or will we be importing them from Europe, Japan, and the likely clean energy leader in our absence, China." [...] In 2005, with respect to the U.S. Congress's actions on climate, including its votes on the XL Pipeline, Romm told The Guardian: [...] "Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the cuts, McCall made a number of changes to his squad during the summer of 2009. His team started the 2009–10 season by going four games without scoring, until they {{recorded}} a 5–4 victory against Cheltenham Town. After the game, McCall said: [...] "That was the youngest, and certainly cheapest, team Bradford have put out {{for a long time and}} I’m really proud of them." [...] City continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached the area semi-finals of the Football League Trophy where they lost to Carlisle United, managed by McCall's friend Greg Abbott, but at the start of 2010 found themselves 16th in League Two and eight points off the play-offs after a run of five defeats in seven games. McCall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games, saying: [...] "The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players and me personally will get judged on results. And the results aren't good enough." [...] Despite the club's slide down the table, he denied he would resign, but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing Gareth Evans to give City a late 2–1 away at Torquay United saved McCall from being sacked. However, defeat to Bury in the club's following fixture was McCall's last game as manager, with McCall saying after the game: [...] "It's time for somebody else to come in and take up the reins and hopefully do well." [...] He won a little more than one-third of his 133games in charge of City. McCall left by mutual consent.|$|E

2500|$|Maayana Miskin of Arutz Sheva {{characterized}} the movement as [...] "a mass protest". Writing for The American Thinker, Ethel C. Fenig described the protest {{movement as a}} cause for freedom of speech. Westword commented positively on the protest idea, [...] "Sounds like an idea we'd like to frame." [...] The editor of Family Security Matters, Pam Meister, discussed the protest movement {{from the perspective of}} freedom of speech, and commented, [...] "I realize that in a free society, someone {{is always going to be}} doing or saying something that will offend somebody somewhere. I also realize that more free speech, not censorship, is the answer." [...] Andrew Mellon of Big Journalism wrote in favor of the protest movement, commenting, [...] "The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment guarantees free speech including criticism of all peoples. We are an equal-opportunity offense country. To censor ourselves to avoid upsetting a certain group (in a cartoon no less) is un-American." [...] Mario Roy of La Presse discussed the incident, and noted, [...] "it is likely that institutions will apply more and more self-censorship.

And even though some fans of metalcore and screamo will lament the band's pop-friendly makeover, that doesn't make The Dream any less excellent. Churko has clearly done right by In This Moment." [...] Adrian Begrand from PopMatters wrote that the album [...] "appeals to parents of Paramore fans, one that will have them remembering just how flat-out fun hard rock and pop metal was two decades ago.

5000|$|The next {{chapters}} {{move into}} the politics of global warming and what Romm sees as a [...] "right-wing disinformation machine" [...] that confuses and misleads the public, by, for example, fostering what Romm calls [...] "Anti-Scientific Syndrome". The book says, [...] "the economic cost of action is low, whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater - {{what exactly is the}} 'price' of 5 feet of sea level rise in 2100 … and losing all of the inland glaciers that provide a significant fraction of water to a billion people?

He added that it would [...] "undermine our economy, hamstring our workers," [...] and [...] "effectively decapitate our coal industry". He said he was open to renegotiating the arrangement or negotiating a new one, but European and UN leaders said the pact [...] "cannot be renegotiated at the request of a single party".
