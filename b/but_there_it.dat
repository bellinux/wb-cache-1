25|$|In general relativity, {{something}} somewhat analogous happens, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> is the Ricci tensor which vanishes in any {{vacuum region}} (but {{not in a}} region which is matter-free but contains an electromagnetic field), {{and it is the}} Weyl curvature which is generated (via another first order covariant differential equation) by variations in the stress–energy tensor and which then propagates into vacuum regions, rendering gravitation a long-range force capable of propagating through a vacuum.|$|E

25|$|As it {{has been}} since Aztec times, the state has been a {{favorite}} retreat for those in Mexico City, especially Cuernavaca, due to its warm year-round climate. This has been especially true since the latter 20th century and has spurred a major housing boom which continues to this day.

500|$|The Peterloo Massacre {{has been}} {{called one of the}} {{defining}} moments of its age. Many of those present at the massacre, including local masters, employers and owners, were horrified by the carnage. One of the casualties, Oldham cloth-worker and ex-soldier John Lees, who died from his wounds on 9 September, had been present at the Battle of Waterloo. Shortly before his death he said to a friend that he had never been in such danger as at Peterloo: [...] "At Waterloo there was man to man <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> was downright murder." [...] When news of the massacre began to spread, the population of Manchester and surrounding districts was horrified and outraged.|$|E

500|$|A four-story Major Block 1 building, {{designed}} by T. V. Widskier, sat on this location until the Great Chicago Fire. [...] After the fire, this {{was replaced with}} the Major Block 2, which eventually {{became known as the}} Roanoke Building. [...] Major Block 2 stood from 1872–1912 as a seven-story building on spread foundations. [...] It was {{designed by}} Dixon & Hamilton and had a length of [...] along South LaSalle Street and a width of [...] along West Madison Street. [...] A commonly published illustration of this building shows it as a five-story building. From June 8, 1873 to January 1, 1887 the original Roanoke building served as the Chicago location for the National Weather Service Weather Forecast official climate site. The building is mentioned in Saul Bellow's More Die of Heartbreak <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> is referred to as a wealthy residence building and not as an office building.|$|E
2500|$|Christie found Belcher [...] "childish, {{mean and}} somehow {{addictive}} as a personality: 'Never, to this day, have I {{been able to}} rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace', wrote Agatha of the fictionalised Belcher, whom she put into The Man in the Brown Suit. 'I dare say it's reprehensible, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> is.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 4th century BC, a few Doric temples were erected with 6 × 15 or 6 × 14 columns, {{probably}} {{referring to}} local Archaic predecessors, e.g. the Temple of Zeus in Nemea {{and that of}} Athena in Tegea. Generally, Doric temples followed a tendency to become lighter in their superstructures. Columns became narrower, intercolumniations wider. This shows a growing adjustment to the proportion and weight of Ionic temples, mirrored by a progressive tendency among Ionic temples to become somewhat heavier. In the light of this mutual influence {{it is not surprising}} that in the late 4th century BC temple of Zeus at Nemea, the front is emphasised by a pronaos two intercolumniations deep, while the opisthodomos is suppressed. [...] Frontality is a key feature of Ionic temples. The emphasis on the pronaos already occurred in the slightly older temple of Athena at Tegea, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> was repeated in the opisthodomos. Both temples continued the tendency towards more richly equipped interiors, in both cases with engaged or full columns of the Corinthian order.|$|E

My husband is gone. Some terrible thing has happened. Whatever the mystery may be, he will never come back alive. My only fear is that I am dragging you into a matter that should from the beginning have been entrusted to--Oh, it's monstrous!' It appeared for a moment as if she were blinking to keep back her tears, yet her scrutiny seemed merely to harden.|$|R

He paused, and {{together}} they slowly ascended the path already glimmering with a heavy dew. At the porch they paused once more. And now it was the stranger that held out his hand.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the next}} {{entry in the}} journal, written presumably in 1821 but undated, he writes: [...] "I {{now for the first}} time in my life began to think that I shant not clear a fortune by my first {{literary}} undertaking." [...] He describes how the first volume was printed [...] "with a fine portrait of John Philpot Curran..." [...] Regarding the sale of the first volume of Worthies of Ireland he writes: [...] "I sent a quantity of copies to Ireland where I expected it would have the greatest sale – <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>it</b> met with little or none. In this country it sold much better – but the sale in both countries was such as to make me determined never to complete the work. This determination however I was induced to change two years approximately afterwards by my printer consenting to take the expenses on himself provided I would finish the work in one more volume. This I agreed to do...". Five editions of both volumes were published in 1821 and 1822 and are held by 37 libraries worldwide.|$|E
