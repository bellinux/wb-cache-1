[...] Another Ki-27 Nate was credited {{to him on}} 20 January, and three days later he achieved [...] another victory but his aircraft was badly shot up {{and he had to}} crash land. The remainder of the 2nd Squadron were sent to Rangoon on 25 January. [...] On 28 January 1942, Newkirk told Chennault that the [...] "aeroplanes we have here are now are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> patchwork quilts for the holes in them. The engines are also getting tired" [...] Newkirk left Rangoon on 10 February but, to get to the AVG base in Kunming, he had to go via India. By 7 March 1942, Rangoon had fallen and the defense of the Burma Road became the priority of the Flying Tigers.|$|E

I am the same man today." [...] Similarly, Powell responded to student hecklers at a speech in Cardiff: [...] "I hope those who shouted [...] "Fascist" [...] and [...] "Nazi" [...] are aware that before they were born I was fighting against Fascism and Nazism." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1917 {{summer in}} the {{northern}} hemisphere, the political and the strategic interests of the British government and the EEF coincided. This was {{due in part to the}} failure on the Western Front of the French Republic's Nivelle offensive and the success of the German submarine campaign against British Empire shipping. The destruction of British shipping caused severe shortages in Britain, and although the United States of America had entered the war, their military support would not be apparent for some time. Britain was about to enter a fourth year of extremely costly war, and their Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, appreciated the need to take into account the [...] "Home Front." [...] He believed a striking military success could bolster the morale of the civil population, and he told Allenby that [...] "he wanted Jerusalem as a Christmas present for the British nation." [...] Lloyd Gorge made clear that this victory was needed in order [...] "to strengthen the staying power and morale" [...] of Britain. The British War Cabinet needed a successful Palestine offensive at a time when there was not much good news coming out of the Western Front, and when it was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the war could extend into 1919. If they could capture Jerusalem this would put pressure on the Ottoman Empire, which could in turn place a strain on the German alliance, at the same time enhancing Britain's long term aim of strengthening their influence in the Middle East. By the end of October, the EEF was ready to attack.|$|E

As soon as I saw them I could not help smiling to myself to remember the anxiety with which I had approached. They received me and my hastily-concocted story, that I had been walking from Peebles and had lost my way, with incoherent benignity; jostled me among them into the room {{where they had been}} sitting, a plain hedgerow alehouse parlour, with a roaring fire in the chimney and a prodigious number of empty bottles on the floor; and informed me that I was made, by this reception, a temporary member of the Six-Feet-High Club, an athletic society of young men in a good station, who made of the Hunters’ Tryst a frequent resort. They told me I had intruded on an ‘all-night sitting,’ following upon an ‘all-day Saturday tramp’ of forty miles; and that the members would all be up and ‘as right as ninepence’ for the noonday service at some neighbouring church—Collingwood, if memory serves me right. At this I could have laughed, but the moment seemed ill-chosen. For, though six feet was their standard, they all exceeded that measurement considerably; and I tasted again some of the sensations of childhood, as I looked up to all these lads from a lower plane, and wondered what they would do next. But the Six-Footers, if they were very drunk, proved no less kind. The landlord and servants of the Hunters’ Tryst were in bed and asleep long ago. Whether by natural gift or acquired habit they could suffer pandemonium to reign all over the house, and yet lie ranked in the kitchen like Egyptian mummies, only that the sound of their snoring rose and fell ceaselessly like the drone of a bagpipe. Here the Six-Footers invaded them—in their citadel, so to speak; counted the bunks and the sleepers; proposed to put me in bed to one of the lasses, proposed to have one of the lasses out to make room for me, fell over chairs, and made noise enough to waken the dead: the whole illuminated by the same young torch-bearer, but now with two candles, and rapidly <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a man in a snowstorm.
