40|$|This study {{investigated}} the possibilities of improving the <b>biogasification</b> from solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) of composting rice straw (RS) based on the optimized digestion temperature, initial substrate concentration (ISC) and C/N ratio. RS compounds, such as lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, were significantly degraded after composting. A significant interactive effect of temperature, ISC and C/N ratio {{was found on the}} <b>biogasification</b> of SS-AD of composting RS, and a maximum biogas production was achieved at 35. 6 degrees C, with a 20 % ISC and a C/N ratio of 29. 6 : 1. The verification experiment confirmed the optimization results. High-throughput sequencing analysis indicated that microbial communities in the SS-AD mainly consist of Methanobacteria, Bacteroidia, Clostridia, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. A dominant Methanobacteria was shifted from Methanobacterium to Methanoculleus during the SS-AD process.

Life Cycle Assessment modelling may be {{a useful tool for}} assessing the best waste management option regarding GW potential. The current study evaluates the contribution of an existing MSW management (MSWM) system to greenhouse gases in Gulberg Town, Lahore, Pakistan. This research also presents a comparison of scenarios with different waste management options. Life Cycle Assessment methodology has been used to conduct the study. EASETECH has been used for modelling. The short-term scenarios (STSs) have been developed to promote the thinking of integration of treatment technologies in the current waste management system within a few months. The results show that the major contribution to the total emissions comes from the anaerobic digestion of organic material from open waste dumps. Currently, recycling is the best treatment option for reducing the CO 2 -eq values in the study area. It was clarified that recycling is the best option for reducing the CO 2 -eq values, whereas <b>biogasification</b> comes in second in terms of savings and reduction.

40|$|Tailings from {{sugar beet}} {{processing}} are currently managed by landfilling or land application. For example, American Crystal Sugar Company generates 400 tons per day of sugar beet tailings and spends close to $ 1 million dollars per year disposing them. Anaerobic conversion of sugar beet tailings into energy {{would not only}} generate biogas for energy, but also reduce the quantity of waste stream that requires disposal. The concept of flooded sequential batch anaerobic composting (SEBAC- 2) technology, developed at the University of Florida was initially implemented for the <b>biogasification</b> of sugar beet tailings. Preliminary experiments were conducted at mesophilic (37 ?C) temperatures and {{it was found that}} daily methane production rates and methane yield failed to increase even after 40 days of digestion. Persistent high volatile fatty acids build up and high soluble COD during <b>biogasification</b> were perceived to be significant reason for the failure. This thesis presents findings related to the implementation of single-stage and two-stage thermophilic high-solids systems for enhanced <b>biogasification</b> of sugar beet tailings. The single stage system was operated in different modes: no pre-treatment, pre-treatment, no bulking, bulking and maceration. The methane yields varied between 170 to 285 L kg VS- 1 and time required to achieve 95 % of methane potential varied between 8 to 15 days. Single-stage with pre-treatment and bulking showed the highest methane potential, the shortest retention time and low volatile fatty acids accumulation. Two-stage system was operated by sequencing a single-stage high solids system with an anaerobic filter reactor. The methane yields varied between 293 to 315 L kg VS- 1 and time required to achieve 95 % of methane potential varied between 7. 5 to 10 days. The volatile fatty acid accumulation was also found to be low. The advantages of operating a two-stage system was the elimination of pre-treatment, and bulking, in addition to reduced retention times and higher loading rates. The retention time in the two-stage thermophilic system was reduced to almost 1 / 3 from previously operated SEBAC- 2 mesophilic system...|$|E

40|$|ARCTECH has {{developed}} a novel process (MicGAS) for direct, anaerobic biomethanation of coals. Biomethanation potential of coals of different ranks (Anthracite, bitumious, sub-bitumious, and lignites of different types), by various microbial consortia, was investigated. Studies on <b>biogasification</b> of Texas Lignite (TxL) were conducted with a proprietary microbial consortium, Mic- 1, isolated from hind guts of soil eating termites (Zootermopsis and Nasutitermes sp.) and further improved at ARCTECH. Various microbial populations of the Mic- 1 consortium carry out the multi-step MicGAS Process. First, the primary coal degraders, or hydrolytic microbes, degrade the coal to high molecular weight (MW) compounds. Then acedogens ferment the high MW compounds to low MW volatile fatty acids.

40|$|A partial {{combustion}} burner {{is introduced}} as a cleaning {{system for the}} tar content of gaseous (bio) fuel. The results of experiments, using a synthetic low calorific gas mixture, demonstrate the effectivity of the proposed process. In these experiments naphthalene is added as a model tar component. The effect of partial combustion of the fuel gasmixture on the naphthalene is examined for different air/fuel ratios (¿) and varying hydrogen-methane fuel concentrations. For a fuel gasmixture with high methane concentrations or for higher ¿-values the total tarcontent slightly decreases. In this case the naphthalene polymerises, i. e. forms higher ring components and sometimes even turn into soot. At lower ¿'s and higher hydrogen concentrations the tarcontent strongly decreases. Moreover, the naphthalene is now cracked, i. e. converted into lighter tars and permanent gases. It is found that, for fuel gases representative for <b>biogasification</b> products and at a ¿ of 0. 2, the presented burner reduces the tar content of the gas with over 90 % by cracking.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} a continuous-flow, mesophilic (35 °C), plug-flow digester to cometabolic degradation of toluene by an anaerobic microbial consortium in the presence of conventional pollutants serving as the major carbon and energy sources. In contrast to conventional practice, digester contents were not mixed. Reactor effluents were recirculated to the influent end at a rate of 20 vol. percent of the influent flow rate. The anaerobic digester was charged with 50 mg/l of toluene. The total COD (chemical oxygen demand) concentration of the mixed, non-hazardous carbon sources was 11, 000 mg/l. Experimental results showed that anaerobic digestion occurring in a plug-flow reactor can simultaneously stabilize and detoxify conventional and hazardous wastes with the production of a methane-rich (up to 80 mol % methane) fuel gas. The observed gas yield of 0. 36 ± 0. 01 SCM/kg VS added was higher than that of conventional, complete-mix digesters under similar operating conditions of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR). Toluene did not inhibit anaerobic <b>biogasification</b> of non-hazardous substrates. A toluene degradation efficiency of 95 % and a total COD reduction of 96 % were observed at an HRT of 13 days and an OLR of 0. 81 kgCOD/m 3 -day.

Previous studies have shown that chemical pretreatment prior to anaerobic digestion (AD) can increase the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass and methane yield. In the present study, the effect of rice straw pretreatment using ammonium hydroxide (NH 3 •H 2 O) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) on the <b>biogasification</b> performance through AD was investigated. A self-designed, laboratory-scale, and continuous anaerobic biogas digester was used for the evaluation. Results showed that the contents of the rice straw, i. e. the lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose were degraded significantly after the NH 3 •H 2 O and H 2 O 2 treatments, and that biogas production from all pretreated rice straw increased. In addition, the optimal treatments for biogas production were the 4 % and 3 % H 2 O 2 treatments (w/w), which yielded 327. 5 and 319. 7 mL/gVS, biogas, respectively, higher than the untreated sample. Biogas production from H 2 O 2 pretreated rice straw was more favorable than rice straw pretreated with same concentration of ammonia, ranking in the order of 4 % ≈ 3 % > 2 % > 1 %.

40|$|Recent {{works on}} dry {{anaerobic}} digestion (AD) show {{that not only}} methane but also hydrogen, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and ethanol can be produced from municipal solid waste (MSW), dewatered sewage sludge, animal manure or crop residue by dry AD processes. Up to now only methane production from household wastes has already been commercialized by using dry AD technology. Single-stage dry AD processes with semicontinuous or continuous operation mode dominates the commercialized dry AD plants. To get enhanced <b>biogasification</b> efficiency, naturally microbial pretreatment methods (like stack-pretreatment and aerobic or facultative composting) and co-digestion are practically useful for dry AD, especially {{for the treatment of}} carbon- and nitrogen- rich organic solid wastes, i. e. crop residue and animal manure. Dry AD could achieve comparable production efficiency to wet AD systems, yielding 121 - 340 L of CH 4 from per gram volatile solids (VS) of organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW) and 51 - 55 ml H 2 /g- VSreduced from OFMSW, sewage sludge, and paper and food wastes. Still, future researches are necessary and demanding for dry AD to better challenge with other low-cost treatment and disposal methods, which are also proposed in this review mainly relating with its longer solids retention time, feedstocks collection, inhibitory substances, online process monitoring, and establishment of process assessment index system. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Biogenic methane {{production}} from coal necessarily involves {{a community of}} microorganisms acting in concert. The large, lignin-like molecules in coal cannot be metabolised by methanogens and other microorganisms are required to catalyse the breakdown of coal to acetate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This thesis investigated the microbial processes involved in the nutrient and oxygen-stimulated methane production at the Lithgow State Coal Mine (LSCM) in the Eastern NSW coalfields. Sub-bituminous coal from the LSCM was found to contain long chain aliphatic compounds ranging from C 11 to C 27 and aromatic compounds, such as methylated naphthalenes, fluorene and phenanthrene. When treated with oxidative chemicals and enzymes mimicking microbial coal degradation, compounds such as acetate, propionate and formate were produced. Methane production and microbial community changes were studied during a field trial with wells drilled into the LSCM coal seam. Microbial analysis using the 16 S rRNA showed {{the presence of a}} diverse range of methanogens, including Methanosarcina, Methanoregula and Methanosaeta, associated with LSCM coal. An increase in Methanosarcina abundance was observed to coincide with the increase in methane production in the nutrient-only treated well, while the calcium peroxide (CaO 2) + nutrient well saw a shift in methanogen composition from Methanosarcina-dominated to Methanoregula-dominated. This may potentially represent a change in substrate utilisation from the methanogenic community in this well where Methanoregula, using a different substrate, was able to out-compete Methanosarcina. High abundances of Desulfovibrio were also observed {{as well as a number}} of bacteria potentially capable of hydrocarbon degradation, such as Dechloromonas, Georgfuchsia and Bradyrhizobium under anaerobic conditions. A PCR approach for detection of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation genes showed the presence of a number of genes in the benzoyl-CoA reduction pathway, which is central to many anaerobic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation processes. Metagenomic analysis of microbial communities in the field trial revealed a number of relevant pathways for the <b>biogasification</b> of coal, including anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation pathways, dissimilatory sulphate and nitrate reduction and all three known pathways of methanogenesis. Six microbial genomes (for two species of Methanosarcina, two Alteromonas, unclassified Bacteroidetes and unclassified Firmicutes) were binned from the metagenomic data obtained from the field trial and this is the first time genomes have been isolated from a coal associated community. Methanosarcina genomes showed the presence of all three major methanogenic metabolisms as well as the ability to fix nitrogen, an important survival mechanism in conditions of low nutrients. The complete pathway for dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification were also observed in the binned genome for Alteromonas. This work has shown the production of methane from sub-bituminous coal can be stimulated by the addition of nutrients, which activates a set of microorganisms involved in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation, methanogenesis, sulphate and nitrate reduction and fermentation. This work has provided important insights into the microbial community dynamics and the metabolic processes occurring in-situ, during the <b>biogasification</b> of coal...|$|E

The study used the mass balance approach and examined all aspects of the plant. The most critical aspect characterised the materials entering, transferred within and exiting the process in order to understand <b>biogasification</b> potentials, degrees of stability of the materials and material composition.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare, from an {{environmental}} point of view, different alternatives for the management of municipal solid waste generated in the town of Castellón de la Plana (Spain). This town currently produces 207 ton of waste per day and the waste management system employed today involves the collection of paper/cardboard, glass and light packaging from materials banks and of rest waste at street-side containers. The proposed alternative scenarios were based on a combination of the following elements: selective collection targets to be accomplished by the year 2015 as specified in the Spanish National Waste Plan (assuming they are reached to an extent of 50 % and 100 %), different collection models implemented nationally, and diverse treatments of both the separated biodegradable fraction and the rest waste to be disposed of on landfills. This resulted in 24 scenarios, whose environmental behaviour was studied by applying the life cycle assessment methodology. In accordance with the standard, an inventory model was developed for the following stages of the waste management life cycle: pre-collection (bags and containers), collection, transport, pre-treatment (waste separation) and treatment/disposal (recycling, composting, <b>biogasification</b> + composting, landfill with/without energy recovery). Environmental indicators were obtained for different impact categories, which made it possible to identify the key variables in the waste management system and the scenario that offers the best environmental behaviour. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was used to test some of the assumptions made in the initial life cycle inventory model. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{demand in}} China has risen rapidly, driven by its massive {{economic}} growth. Meanwhile, the energy system in China heavily depends on fossil fuels, which causes serious problems {{of climate change}} and air pollution. China started to develop renewable energy about 30 years ago, aiming to alleviate the pressure of energy shortage and fossil fuel related environmental problems. The central government has shown great determination to promote the utilization of renewable energy resources and it set ambitious targets to increase the proportion of renewable energy in the country’s total energy consumption to 10 % by 2010 and 15 % by 2020. China has {{a large amount of}} renewable energy resources within its vast territory. Large potentials of producing bioenergy, solar energy, wind energy, hydro energy, geothermal and ocean energy have been identified in China. During the past three decades, the Chinese government made major efforts to develop these renewable energy resources. A series of policies have been formulated to promote renewable energy utilization. As the second largest investor on renewable energy in the world, China has invested considerable financial resources to renewable energy projects. As a result, the installed capacity of renewable energy in China has increased sharply, especially in the fields of wind power, solar thermal and hydro power. However, China lacks effective monitoring and evaluation systems to review the performance of renewable energy policies, programs and projects. It is not yet clear whether the objectives of China’s renewable energy development policy will be reached in an efficient and effective way. Under such circumstances, this study evaluates the performance of renewable energy policies and practices in China. The following three research questions are given a central place: What is the performance of the implementation of renewable energy policies and practices in China up till now? What are the driving forces behind the successes/failures of renewable energy development in China? What reforms can be recommended for future renewable energy policies and programs in China? In order to answer these questions, this study uses various ideas and concepts of policy evaluation theories as sources of inspiration and information to build an analytical model for evaluating the performance of renewable energy developments in China. Within this analytical model, the performance of renewable energy development is evaluated by criteria of economic performance, technological performance, and environmental and social impacts. The driving (f) actors behind the performance are subsequently analyzed using a triad-network model. Finally, recommendations for future development of renewable energy in China are formulated, based on these analyses. This study takes primarily a qualitative research strategy, based on case study research. Three main cases form the central part of this study: one case of <b>biogasification</b> developments in Shandong Province, one case of onshore wind power developments in Inner Mongolia, and one case of solar water heater developments in Zhejiang Province. Data for each case study are collected through site observation, via in-depth interviews with key informants, via questionnaires and through secondary analysis of existing data, statistics and written sources. A structured approach – triangulation – is applied to combine the various data sources and data collection methods. Results of the case study on <b>biogasification</b> prove that these projects do not bring developers and users economic benefit, due to the large-scale close down of biogas stations after a relatively short life time. The biogas stations also suffer from various technological problems such as tar jam, leakage of gas pipes and difficulties in treating wet feedstock. However, the establishment of <b>biogasification</b> projects improves the environmental quality of local area and {{the quality of life of}} local residents. The analyses of wind power projects illustrate the poor economic performance of wind power projects due to the vicious competition for concession projects. Most of the wind farms are well designed and equipped with relatively new wind turbine technology, but many of them are used at low efficiency. The wind power projects reduce the consumption of fossil fuels for power generation and thus contribute to the reduction of air pollutant emission (among which greenhouse gasses). The construction of wind farms has marginal direct impacts on the life of local people and ecosystems. Nevertheless, these projects bring local areas some indirect benefits, such as improvements in the mobility infrastructure and accessibility and attractiveness to tourists (and thus economic income). From the solar water heater case study it could be concluded that this technology brings both producers and end users major economic benefits. The use of solar water heater also reduces air pollutant emissions by reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. While overall this relatively simple technology functions well, the expansion of solar water heater utilization encounters some technological challenges. It proves difficult to adapt the solar water heaters onto existing buildings. Water tanks and pipes installed outside of the buildings are not resistant to extreme temperatures, as they freeze during extremely cold winters. The development and implementation of solar water heater has comes together with a number of social problems, especially in relation to obstructions by city administrations and real estate management in some cities. The analyses of the driving forces behind these three renewable energy developments show some remarkable differences. The <b>biogasification</b> projects in China are strongly influenced and pushed by policy networks and societal networks, while economic networks play a marginal role in their development and implementation. Wind power projects in China are strongly influenced and advanced by policy networks and economic networks, while the influence of social networks is marginal. And the solar water heater projects in China are strongly guided and implemented by economic networks and societal networks, whereas policy network institutions and actors play less prominent roles. These driving networks, and the absence other networks, partly explain the performance of each of the renewable energy projects in China. These findings also result in a number of recommendations for further developing renewable energy in China. In order to strengthen the poorly developed or absent network drivers in each case, improvements should be made with respect to institutional reform and policy revision, the further creation of market dynamics, and technology improvement. Some of the concrete recommendations formulated in this study are: • The management of and investment in renewable energy projects should be improved by involving private companies into project development. • Feed-in tariffs should be introduced in wind power projects. • It is necessary to open up renewable energy development planning and siting to public participation and create a better platform for the public to express their opinion. • A semi-protected market should be established to promote renewable energy development. In this semi-protected market, the developers continue to receive governmental subsidies, while the renewable energy products are sold increasingly according to “real” market rules and conditions, and foreign investments play a more important role than present. • Technology improvements should aim to solve the technological problems in the short term, to improve efficiency of renewable energy utilization in the medium term, and to diversify the renewable energy technologies in the long term. Finally this study formulates implications for future research. Research is recommended especially with respect to public participation and acceptance of renewable energy development as that hardly takes place at the moment; with respect to evaluation modes of performance evaluation itself; and with respect to China’s post-Kyoto renewable energy development strategies...|$|E

The purpose of my study was to analyse the efficiency of producing transportation fuels, spezifyed ethanol and biogas from straw. Extraction of sugar from straw under different conditions with respect to pH, temperature and extraction time were studied. Thereafter <b>biogasification</b> with bacteria to form CH 4 and ethanol fermentation with Saccharomyces was performed and the gas production measured. The extractions were carried out separately at 121 °C and 140 - 145 °C, with 20, 40, 60, 120 minutes extraction time. The pH during the processes was set to 5 and 3 with buffer solution. To consider the extraction rate, the better conditions are lower pH, higher temperature and longer extraction time. The results show the optimal extraction is performed at 140 - 145 °C for 120 minutes with pH 3. The gasification was carried out at 37 °C with using Baker’s yeast. The results indicate that in contrast to the extraction, the gasification is better with the samples which extraction was carried out at lower temperature and higher pH. The best gasification was achieved by the samples with 121 °C and pH 5 extraction irrespectively of the extraction time, although they had the worst extraction rate results.

It is shown that the technology has received attention from the initial days of the energy crisis in 1973, including a “Colombo Declaration” calling for regional development of biogas technology. However, there has been limited popularization and application of biogas in the country. Biogas systems have been promoted for their capability to provide lighting and as a cooking gas, both energy needs, {{and then as a}} way to produce biofertilizer from solid waste streams for agricultural needs. Biogas systems used and in use, are identified and reasons for failures are summarized. The ways in which the process has been promoted are also considered and it is seen that the container approach has been given more weightage than the process itself. The process taking place during <b>biogasification</b> has been largely ignored and taken for granted in the dissemination of the technology. Also shown is the fact that promises made in trying to get the technology accepted are impossible to fulfil when a simple analysis is performed. This is shown with respect to cattle-owning families of Sri Lanka. The paper concludes with the recent developments in attempts to introduce biogas systems in the country. From a developing country perspective the paper argues that the ways in which this technology has been promoted are unacceptable. Biogas utilization can take place professionally if a systematic approach is adopted and if the advocates look at the technology in an objective manner.

Therefore, investigation of pore structure and gas capacity of the coal is essential for accurate estimations of coal bed gas potential. Coal samples of lignite to sub-bituminous rank were obtained from different depths of Soma basin and were characterized by low pressure CO 2 adsorption isotherms at 273 K. Micropore surface areas of the samples were calculated by using D-R model, changed from 224. 909 m 2 /g to 287. 097 m 2 /g. Micropore volume and capacity were determined by Dubinin-Radushkevich equation to vary between 0. 070 and 0. 093 cm 3 /g and between 39. 06 m 3 /ton and 48. 44 m 3 /ton, respectively. Pore widths of all samples were below 1 nm; suggesting that micropore ratios of the samples are very high. On the other hand, high pressure (up to 17 MPa) adsorption isotherms suggest that methane adsorption capacity of the as receive Soma Lignites vary from 12. 99 m 3 /ton to 18. 13 m 3 /ton. Effects of outgas temperature, organic carbon content on gas adsorption capacity of the samples were determined.

40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{developing}} economy of Egypt {{with the increasing}} population density and depleting natural resources, the management of energy and environment has become of utmost importance to the sustainability of our development. A clear example is the severe air pollution, which is causing the most environmental damage, being mostly attributed to the energy sector, and largely attributed to uncontrolled burning of solid waste and agriculture residue. It mainly affects Greater Cairo, which hosts 20 % of the nation’s population. This {{comes at a time}} where Egypt is rapidly approaching energy dependency. Utilizing this “waste” as a resource, or fuel, for bioenergy systems would entail many environmental and developmental benefits. This research has aimed to investigate the status and prospects of developing this bioenergy industry, and to discuss the approach to assess its sustainable development impacts as Clean Development Mechanism Projects (CDM) encompassing the environmental, social, and economic aspects {{in the context of the}} related legal and institutional framework existing today, and stakeholders’ activities. The findings of the research are later elaborated in the context of a case study of <b>biogasification</b> demonstrational plants established in Egypt delivering town gas from rice straw, while discussing the positive and negative sustainable development impacts. The research findings showed promising prospects for a growing bioenergy industry in Egypt and thereby emphasized the importance of identifying such synergies in environmental planning and management such as in addressing air pollution and promoting rural development, and it also emphasized the importance of practicing a holistic approach for assessing projects, policies and programs related to energy and environment. Findings also revealed a lack of proactive hosting of CDM projects in practice to direct activities toward national development priorities and finding synergies given that the CDM has come to be the driving force for bioenergy projects in Egypt. From the international perspective, a stricter and regular monitoring of SDA practices in the host country is recommended. www. ima. kth. s...|$|E
40|$|Australia {{has ever}} {{increasing}} pressure {{to increase its}} renewable and alternative energy sources from the implementation of environmental protection schemes, legislations and taxes such as the carbon tax, implemented in July 2012. There is an increasing movement globally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the reliability upon fossil fuels. The development of <b>biogasification</b> plants in sectors such as agriculture, which produces the highest volumes of methane per sector, can assist businesses to reduce emissions, reduce sludge volume, lower reliability on the power grid, decrease costs of taxes and policies and increase revenue through excess supply back to the power grid. Abattoir wastewater, in particular, has considerable volumes of methane and carbon dioxide gases being produced {{through the use of}} anaerobic treatment ponds that reduce the organic loading of wastes. These ponds have the potential to be transformed into covered anaerobic ponds or digestion reactor tanks to produce methane {{in a way that it}} can be captured. Once obtained the methane gas can be used to produce electricity or flared. Little research is available on the feasibility of methane capturing through the anaerobic digestion of abattoir wastewater as the wastes are hard to characterise due to their varying composition between different abattoirs. Abattoir wastewater is typically hard to digest and therefore co-digestion has been investigated to evaluate the methane potential when combined with other easily biodegradable, carbon rich sources. This dissertation reports on the findings made from two experimental processes. The first of which looked into the feasibility of co-digestion with nutrient rich vegetable wastewater and the second looked into the impacts of inoculum to substrate ratio and temperature on the biogas production of the abattoir wastewaters alone. The results from the feasibility test showed that co-digestion was not compatible with the abattoir wastewater. It was evident that the abattoir wastewater produced higher volumes of biogas when anaerobically digested alone, than in comparison to the volume of biogas produced through co-digestion. The blood water alone produced the highest volumes of biogas with 736. 9 mL/ 200 mg/L DTOC closely followed by the saveall wastewater with 724. 9 mL/ 200 mg/L DTOC. The mixture of 80 % vegetable waste, and 10 % of each abattoir wastewater stream gave 588. 6 mL/ 200 mg/L DTOC followed by the glucose substrate with 308. 4 mL/ 200 mg/L DTOC. The lowest biogas production was by the vegetable wastewater with 69. 1 mL/ 200 mg/L DTOC. From the second experimental process it was found that low inoculum to substrate ratios and higher temperatures produced the highest volumes of biogas. The optimum was found at an ISR of 5 and a temperature of 40 °C but further research needs to be completed for a true conformation of these results. This research will give further insight into the potential volumes of methane and biogas that can be obtained through the optimisation of a number of variables. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of initiating anaerobic digestion (AD) of dry layer-hen poultry dung at the sub-atmospheric pressure of - 30 cmHg on biodegradation, <b>biogasification,</b> and biomethanation. The setup was performed as a batch process at an average ambient temperature of 29 ± 2 0 C and a retention time of 15 days. Comparisons were made with two other experiments which were both begun at ambient atmospheric pressure; one was inoculated with digestate from a previous layer-hen dung AD, while the other was not inoculated. The bioreactors initiated at sub-atmospheric pressure, ambient atmospheric pressure without inoculum, and ambient atmospheric pressure with inoculum showed the following for biogas and biomethane yields respectively: 16. 8 cm 3 g- 1 VS and 15. 46 cm 3 g 1 VS, 25. 10 cm 3 g- 1 VS and 12. 85 cm 3 g- 1 VS, 21. 44 cm 3 g- 1 VS and 14. 88 cm 3 g 1 VS. In the same order, after AD, the following values were recorded for volatile solids and total viable counts (prokaryotes and fungi) in the digestates: 40. 33 % and 23. 22 x 106 cfu mL- 1, 43. 42 % and 22. 17 x 106 cfu mL- 1, 41. 11 % and 13. 3 x 106 cfu mL- 1. The feedstock showed values of 83. 93 % and 3. 98 x 106 cfu mL- 1 for volatile solids and total viable count respectively. There was a slight difference in the volatile solids of the digestates of the three bioreactors after AD. The pH recorded for the feedstock slurry before AD was 7. 9 at 30 oC, while after AD, the digestates from all the three bioreactors showed the same pH of 5. 9 at 29 0 C. Statistical analysis using ANOVA showed {{no significant difference in}} biogas yields of the feedstock for the three bioreactors (A, B, C). ANOVA showed no significant difference for biomethane yields in the bioreactors initiated at sub-atmospheric pressure and for those initiated at ambient atmospheric pressure with inoculums. However, it showed significant difference in the bioreactor initiated at sub-atmospheric pressure and that initiated at ambient atmospheric pressure without inoculums, and significant difference in the two sets of bioreactors initiated at ambient atmospheric pressure (with and without inoculum). Initiating AD at reduced atmospheric pressure (- 30 cmHg) and the addition of inoculum at ambient atmospheric pressure both increased biomethanation, by 20. 31 % and 15. 80 % respectively. The AD initiated at sub-atmospheric pressure yielded the least amount of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas), and improved biodegradation and biomethanation. The results also suggest that biomethane production is dependent on specific methanogenic growth. Analyzing the populations of methanogens isolated from the different bioreactors in relation to their biomethane yields suggests that Methanosarcina barkeri may have been largely responsible for the differences in biomethane yields...|$|E
