5|$|Their {{sensitivity}} to water quality also makes them suitable for bioassays. Americamysis bahia and Americamysis almyra are frequently {{used to test}} for pesticides and other toxic substances, with A. bahia found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> during the periods when it is moulting.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma is causing bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested}} that bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E
50|$|Both the utricle and the saccule provide {{information}} about acceleration. The difference between them is that the utricle <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to horizontal acceleration, whereas the saccule <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to vertical acceleration.|$|R

5|$|The {{modality}} {{of choice}} is computed tomography (CT scan) without contrast, of the brain. This has a high sensitivity and will correctly identify over 95 percent of cases—especially {{on the first day}} after the onset of bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than CT after several days. Within six hours of the onset of symptoms CT picks up 98.7% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E
50|$|The hydrogen-bond {{networks}} make {{both natural}} and synthetic polymers sensitive to humidity levels in the atmosphere because water molecules can diffuse into the surface and disrupt the network. Some polymers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than others. Thus nylons <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than aramids, and nylon 6 <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than nylon-11.|$|R
30|$|The above results {{imply that}} {{sensitivity}} of some typical forced vibration occur peaks when mesh frequency coincides with natural frequency. To stiffness parameters, the vibration <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> as stiffness <b>is</b> low.

25|$|In {{terms of}} medical {{management}} of the symptoms associated with Chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1 Duplication Syndrome, families {{should be aware that}} individuals with chromosome 15 duplications may tolerate medications differently and may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to side effects for some classes of medications, such as the serotonin reuptake inhibitor type medications (SSRI).|$|E
25|$|The {{shift of}} {{benzodiazepine}} receptors to an inverse agonist state after chronic treatment leads {{the brain to}} <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to excitatory drugs or stimuli. Excessive glutamate activity can result in excitotoxicity, which may result in neurodegeneration. The glutamate receptor subtype NMDA {{is well known for}} its role in causing excito-neurotoxicity. The glutamate receptor subtype AMPA is believed {{to play an important role}} in neuronal kindling as well as excitotoxicity during withdrawal from alcohol as well as benzodiazepines. It is highly possible that NMDA receptors are involved in the tolerance to some effects of benzodiazepines.|$|E

25|$|An {{ionization}} {{smoke detector}} uses a radioisotope, typically americium-241, to ionize air; a difference due to smoke is detected and an alarm is generated. Ionization detectors <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to the flaming stage of fires than optical detectors, while optical detectors <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to {{fires in the}} early smouldering stage.|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} factor {{to consider is}} the individual differences {{in the experience of}} pleasurable effects brought on by the substance or behaviour. It is reasoned that certain individuals may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to the pleasurable effects and thus experience them with greater intensity, resulting in addiction. For example, over-responsiveness to substance affects has been found in cocaine addicts – an increased response to methylphenidate in the brain regions associated with emotional reactivity and mood. Thus, strong emotional responses that addicted individuals show in response to substances or behaviours might be results of enhanced sensitivity to their effects.|$|E
25|$|Neurophysiological methods rely on {{utilizing}} information {{stemming from}} more direct {{and not necessarily}} conscious (pre-attentative) processes. Subjects are presented with speech stimuli in different types of tasks and {{the responses of the}} brain are measured. The brain itself can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> than it appears to be through behavioral responses. For example, the subject may not show sensitivity to the difference between two speech sounds in a discrimination test, but brain responses may reveal sensitivity to these differences. Methods used to measure neural responses to speech include event-related potentials, magnetoencephalography, and near infrared spectroscopy. One important response used with event-related potentials is the mismatch negativity, which occurs when speech stimuli are acoustically different from a stimulus that the subject heard previously.|$|E
25|$|Several {{epidemiological}} studies have observed {{a correlation between}} high levels of dioxins and PCBs in humans and {{a wide variety of}} adverse health effects e.g. chloracne, lowering of IQ, dysfunction of the thyroid gland and reduction of thyroid hormone levels, elevated rates of endometriosis in women, higher levels of diabetes in women, precocious puberty in females and subtle developmental delay in children, as evidenced by altered play activity. Males appear to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to poisoning by high levels of dioxins & dioxin-like PCBs {{and are more likely to}} develop severe symptoms e.g. young men poisoned by TCDD (the most toxic dioxin) are less likely to father boys. See Geusau et al. (2001) who describe the clinical manifestations of two extremely severe (and probably criminal) dioxin poisoning cases.|$|E

25|$|Generally {{there are}} three types of rods used today graphite, fiberglass, and bamboo rods. Bamboo rods are the {{heaviest}} of the three, but people still use it for its feel. Fiberglass rods are the heaviest of the new chemically-made material rods. They are mostly popular with the new and young anglers, as well as anglers who cannot afford the generally more expensive graphite rods. They are more commonly found among those anglers that fish in rugged areas such as on rocks or piers where potentially knocking the rod on hard objects is a greater possibility. This may potentially cause breakage, making a fiberglass rod more preferable for some anglers due to its higher durability and affordability compared to graphite rods. Today's most popular rod tends to be graphite for its light weight characteristics {{and its ability to}} allow for further and more accurate cast. Graphite rods tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive,</b> allowing the user to feel bites from fish easier.|$|E
25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|E
500|$|Aspects of the Movementarians were {{inspired}} by different cults and religions, including Scientology, Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple, the Heaven's Gate group, the Unification Church, the Oneida Society, and Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. In particular, the leader driving through the fields in a Rolls Royce was partly inspired by the Bhagwans, {{and the notion of}} holding people inside the camp against their will was a reference to Jim Jones. The name [...] "Movementarians" [...] itself was simply chosen for its awkward sound. The scene during the six-hour orientation video where those who get up to leave are induced to stay through peer pressure and groupthink was a reference to the Unification Church and EST Training. The show's producers acknowledged that the ending scene of the episode was a poke at Fox as [...] "being the evil mind controlling network". The episode's script was written in 1997, at roughly {{the same time that the}} members of the Heaven's Gate cult committed mass suicide. The writers noticed strange parallels between Mirkin's first draft and Heaven's Gate, including the belief in the arrival of a spaceship and the group's members wearing matching clothes and odd sneakers. Because of these coincidences, several elements of the episode were changed so that it would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>sensitive</b> in the wake of the suicides.|$|E
