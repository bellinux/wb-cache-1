5000|$|The United Holy Church of America {{holds the}} {{distinct}} honor {{of being the}} oldest African American Holiness-Pentecostal body in the world. As a result, many organizations {{have been influenced by}} the UHCA. Mount Calvary Holy Church of America split from the United Holy Church in 1929 to form their own holiness Pentecostal <b>body.</b> <b>Mount</b> Sinai Holy Church of America separated from the mother church in 1924 to form an organization to create gender equality in episcopal ordination. The Church of God in Christ (COGIC), Fire Baptized Holiness Church of God of the Americas and the United Holy Church consider each other as sister organizations. The United Holy Church {{was one of the first}} churches that ordained women to become pastors and elders and later on bishops. United Holy Church's annual [...] "Holy Convocation" [...] is held every May. District convocations are held at set times within the district. The Holiness Union is the official church organ and magazine of the United Holy Church of America. There is no solid stance on Pentecostal doctrine. The United Holy Church of America has the United Christian College Goldsboro, NC as one of the main educational and training institutions in the body.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design a device to mount a powered arm {{orthosis}} onto {{the body of a}} person using a wheelchair. Mounting the device onto the body is necessary because the individual would be much less constrained than if the orthosis was mounted on the wheelchair. The target users are individuals with Muscular Dystrophy, a degenerative disease that affects the skeletal muscles of the body. These users lack sufficient muscle control in their arms. A mounting system for a powered arm orthosis would help with daily activities. The design team researched shoulder kinematics and met with an orthotist to determine the design specifications of the mounting system. Four prototypes were designed, built, and tested. These prototypes were made of scrap material and were fit to a body-form for testing purposes. Markers and two lasers were placed on each of the prototypes so the motion under loading conditions could be mapped and analyzed. The most important specification was stability. Stability is required of the <b>body</b> <b>mount</b> because it must align the orthosis properly with the user’s shoulder joint in order to function correctly. After testing the four prototypes, the final <b>body</b> <b>mount</b> was designed using the results of the tests. The final prototype was chosen based on optimal results of stability tests and deflection analysis of the prototype with an applied load. Detailed CAD models of the harness were constructed so that another group could analyze the models and build the device. Materials were selected for each of the components and an assembly procedure was developed so that the harness could be manufactured...|$|E
40|$|Emerging {{research}} and growing use of mobile projectors re-veal {{a need for}} {{better understanding of how}} to design inter-action with such devices. This paper examines key aspects affecting the use of mobile projectors during motion. With the help of two prototypes we explore visibility issues of mo-bile projectors, in particular how surface colors and geometry affect the visibility of projected information. We then con-sider the choice of placement of information in the human field of view in the context of peripersonal and extrapersonal spaces. Finally, we raise the issue of <b>body</b> <b>mount</b> location and design implications of long-term use of this type of pervasive display. The paper presents two design explorations using projected displays to address projection on outdoor regular surfaces (snow) and projection on indoor irregular surfaces (indoor and outdoor), in the form of useable prototypes pre-senting map navigation. Use of the prototypes was explored in various contexts, leading to insights into the limitations and possibilities of such displays. These insights are presented in a set of design considerations intended to inform designers of future mobile projector applications...|$|E

40|$|A {{beginning}} of life maximum power point, solar array power output model is developed to comparatively evaluate {{different kind of}} array configurations. To correctly describe temperature effects on power output, various thermal models are compared, selecting the better one with respect to solar panel type. Two different constanttemperature thermal models are selected in order to describe <b>body</b> <b>mounted</b> and sun pointing solar arrays. Various <b>body</b> <b>mounted</b> solar arrays configurations are compared to sun pointing ones for sunsynchronous orbits with ascending node local time ranging from 12 to 6 am. To this end, total solar array area, power time history and satellite volume are considered. Results show that configurations with one or three <b>body</b> <b>mounted</b> panels can adequately replace a sun pointing array depending on the ascending node local time. © 2003 IEE...|$|R
