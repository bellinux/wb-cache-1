5|$|Her frugal {{lifestyle}} {{at first}} {{was due to}} <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> pay for her work; however, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life.

50|$|Man a Machine (French: L'homme Machine) {{is a work}} of materialist {{philosophy}} by the 18th-century French {{physician and}} philosopher Julien Offray de La Mettrie, first published in 1747. In this work, de La Mettrie extends Descartes' argument that animals were mere automatons or machines to human <b>beings,</b> <b>denying</b> the existence of the soul as a substance separate from matter.|$|R

5|$|The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for tracking down and reporting all communicable diseases in the U.S., faced governmental apathy {{in the face of}} mounting crisis.

5|$|Having {{confirmed}} his Lang credentials, Heffron stood as the endorsed Labor party {{candidate for the}} seat of Botany at the 1927 election, which was held by Thomas Mutch, who had split from party after a stoush with Lang and stood as an 'Independent Labor' candidate after <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> preselection. A contest marked by clashes and accusations of rorting, Heffron was ultimately unsuccessful, gaining only 45% of the vote. He was eventually successful at the next election in 1930, defeating Mutch, and would hold Botany until its abolition in 1950.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} {{brought a}} case against the Mobile County School Board for <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> admission to Murphy High School. This was nearly {{a decade after the}} United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Khan, along with famed comedy group All India Bakchod, will be heading up a campaign against the recently reinstated ban on gay sex in India through a satirical video highlighting ignorance around gay issues. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Khan said: “I’ve always been involved with gay rights. The scenario in this country is disheartening and depressing. These are basic human rights that people are <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> of; they’re no minority. The idea of this initiative is to show those who do not support homosexuality, how ridiculous their thinking is.” Other Bollywood stars have spoken out to condemn the reintroduction of the law.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Marshall came {{to believe}} that Eichelberger's talents were wasted at West Point, but he was opposed by Pa Watson, who wanted Eichelberger to remain at West Point. When Marshall told Watson that Eichelberger's chances for {{promotion}} to major general were being adversely affected by <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> the chance to command a division, Watson added Eichelberger's name {{to the top of a}} promotion list and had the President sign it. In this manner, Eichelberger was promoted to major general in July 1941.|$|E

5|$|Taylor apprised President McKinley of the {{situation}} in Kentucky. He stopped short of asking for intervention by federal troops, and McKinley assured a delegation of Kentucky's federal legislators that such intervention would occur only as a last resort. Republican legislators made preparations to heed Taylor's call to convene in London on February 5. Meanwhile, in order to resolve any doubts about the legitimacy of their earlier meeting, Democratic legislators met at the state house—no longer <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> entrance by the state militia—and again voted to adopt the majority report declaring Goebel and Beckham the winners of the election. Both men again took the oath of office.|$|E
5|$|Five {{references}} in Eusebius' Historia Ecclesiastica speak to Philip's Christianity; three directly, two by implication. At 6.34, he describes Philip visiting a church on Easter Eve and <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> entry by the presiding bishop {{because he had}} not yet confessed his sins. The bishop goes unnamed. At 6.36.3, he writes of letters from the Christian theologian Origen to Philip and to Philip's wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa. At 6.39, Eusebius writes that Decius persecuted Christians because he hated Philip. The remaining two references are quotations or paraphrases of Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, a contemporary of Philip (he held the patriarchate from 247 to 265). At 6.41.9, Dionysius contrasts the tolerant Philip's rule with the intolerant Decius'. At 7.10.3, Dionysius implies that Alexander Severus (emperor from 222 to 235) and Philip were both openly Christian.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{characteristics of}} occasional smokers who <b>deny</b> <b>being</b> smokers (ie, deniers). Methods: Data were from 3 {{rounds of the}} Minnesota Adult Tobacco Survey (MATS 2003, 2007, and 2010), a statewide, cross-sectional, and random-digit-dial telephone survey. Results: Nearly half of occasional smokers did not view themselves as smokers. Characteristics that were predictive of <b>being</b> a <b>denier</b> included less perceived harm from secondhand smoke, fewer days smoked, and fewer cigarettes smoked per day. Conclusions: Denial of being a smoker is primarily characterized by very light smoking. Future communication efforts should be tailored for this group...|$|R
5|$|Mathias' {{candidacy}} consideration did not endear him to {{the conservative}} wing of the Maryland Republican Party organization. In June 1976, he lost a vote by state Republicans to determine who would represent Maryland on the platform committee at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Instead, the group chose George Price, a conservative member of the Maryland House of Delegates from Baltimore County. At one point, Mathias was close to <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> attendance to the convention altogether as an at-large delegate, but a last minute compromise ensured all Republican congressional representatives seats as at-large delegates. Mathias maintained a low profile during the convention, and received harsh criticism {{from some of the}} conservative delegates from Maryland who attended.|$|E
5|$|Maurice Richard, {{inducted}} in 1961, and Jean Beliveau, inducted in 1972, {{are two of}} ten {{players for}} whom the selection committee has waived the otherwise-mandatory three-year waiting period before being eligible for induction. Defenceman Doug Harvey was unanimously elected in 1973, one year after <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> entry due to his drinking habits. Angered by the snub, Harvey refused his induction, stating {{that he planned to}} go fishing instead of attending the induction ceremony. Guy Lafleur was one of three players in NHL history (along with Gordie Howe and Mario Lemieux) to return to playing after being elected. Lafleur, who had first retired in 1984 after growing frustrated with the Canadiens' defence-focused system, returned to the league days after his 1988 election, playing for the New York Rangers and Quebec Nordiques before finally retiring in 1991.|$|E
5|$|When the 1864 {{treaty was}} signed, the Klamath Tribes, with much less land, became short on the stream water needed for fishing. Although from the 1950s to the 1970s {{they were not}} federally recognized, the tribes never lost their water rights, and in 2001, when Klamath Basin farmers twice sued the U.S. Department of the Interior for more access to {{irrigation}} water, their rights were upheld. The tribes' water allotments for fishing {{continue to be a}} large factor in Klamath Basin water disputes in the 21stcentury. In 2013, the Tribe's water rights were enforced for the first time, in what is known as a 'Water Call'. The Klamath Tribe called upon their in-stream water right, which was enforced by the Water Master. This resulted in almost all upper-basin irrigation <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> water, except for groundwater irrigators. The Klamath Project, however, was not called upon.|$|E
60|$|Prize-fighting is terrible. This is the dictum {{of the man}} {{who walks}} in his sleep. He prates about it, and writes to the papers about it, and worries the legislators about it. There is nothing of the brute about him. He is a sublimated soul that treads the heights and {{breathes}} refined ether--in self-comparison with the prize-fighter. The man who walks in his sleep ignores the flesh and all its wonderful play of muscle, joint, and nerve. He feels that there is something godlike in the mysterious deeps of his <b>being,</b> <b>denies</b> his relationship with the brute, and proceeds to go forth into the world and express by deeds that something godlike within him.|$|R

5|$|Widespread precautionary {{measures}} took place across Hawaii as forecasts indicated {{the potential for}} a Hawaiian landfall as early as August2. Then-governor Neil Abercrombie signed an emergency proclamation into effect, and numerous government facilities were closed. Several airlines cancelled flights servicing the archipelago. Upon making landfall, Iselle brought torrential rainfall and caused strong winds which resulted in widespread power outages and downed trees. The storm caused heavy crop damage, estimated at $66million (2014USD), including 60% of the state's papaya that was lost. This was enough to be classified as an agriculture disaster, and was eventually declared a disaster by Federal Emergency Management Agency after initially <b>being</b> <b>denied.</b> The storm also killed one person on Kauai as a result of flooding.|$|E
5|$|In early 2003, The Walt Disney Company and Square Enix {{confirmed}} {{the sequel to}} their commercially and critically acclaimed video game, Kingdom Hearts (2002). That July, the games creator Tetsuya Nomura aimed to have the game in stores by 2004, but several legal issues regarding the approval of characters and aesthetics from the Disney franchise obscured this, such as the Tarzan world <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> due {{to a change in}} ownership. Regarding the games theme song, the producer only had Utada in mind as he felt she was part of the franchise's family, and believed her music could break both foreign and international markets. But scheduling time with Nomura proved to be impossible, as the singer started work on her debut English album in her hometown New York City; she had been signed to Island Def Jam the previous year as their headquarters discovered her success in Japan. Though her debut Western release Exodus was a success in Japan, its commercial appeal was lacking in North America; after promoting it, she moved back to Tokyo to start recording her record Ultra Blue (2006).|$|E
5|$|Patton did not {{command a}} force in combat for 11 months. In September, Bradley, who was Patton's junior in both rank and experience, was {{selected}} to command the First United States Army forming in England to prepare for Operation Overlord. This decision had been made before the slapping incidents were made public, but Patton blamed them for his <b>being</b> <b>denied</b> the command. Eisenhower felt the invasion of Europe was too important to risk any uncertainty, and that the slapping incidents had been an example of Patton's inability to exercise discipline and self-control. While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive or prone to making mistakes. On January 26, 1944 Patton was formally given command of the Third United States Army in England, a newly arrived unit, and assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe. This duty kept Patton busy in early 1944 preparing for the pending invasion.|$|E
