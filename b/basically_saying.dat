If you want to pass a law that says one individual is in government, then none of their friends or relatives can work in government, then you should pass that law.|$|E

500|$|So {{this song}} is about me <b>basically</b> <b>saying</b> that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just {{protecting}} me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E

[...] NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel also took issue with the report, saying in May 1995 that [...] "the assumption that the Space Shuttle systems are now 'mature' smacks of a complacency which may lead to serious mishaps." [...] Nonetheless, NASA accepted the recommendations of the report, and in November 1995, responsibility for shuttle operations was turned over to the United Space Alliance.|$|E

I wanted people to understand like Pusha is everything that I really, really am. Actually, there is a line in 'Pain' where I say [...] "My name is my name," [...] that line comes from Marlo Stanfield from the series The Wire. It {{was one of the}} more prominent catch phrases that he said {{at the end of that}} series. He was <b>basically</b> <b>saying,</b> I am who I am, I stand on my name I live this. I really felt that embodied my presence in the rap game." [...] Pusha T announced the new title of his album in November 2012, along with Spin reporting that his album had been pushed back until 2013.

500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its about {{breaking}} a girl's heart, {{but in a}} way that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, when you are in that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those girls can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm <b>basically</b> <b>saying</b> is 'I might just break your heart. But I'm only gonna break your heart if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and guys can get into this character". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cruz elaborated and said the song was partially based on a personal situation, and rather an [...] "exaggeration of an experience".|$|E

500|$|The {{band has}} said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, {{adopting}} the pseudonym [...] "Shawn the Clown". The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, [...] "it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a {{way for us to}} become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it." [...] The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits {{has been described as a}} response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, [...] "Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits...we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves...We were <b>basically</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Hey, we're a product!'".|$|E
500|$|Lefebvre died on 25 March 1991 {{at the age}} of 85 {{from cancer}} in Martigny, Switzerland, less than three years after being excommunicated for {{carrying}} out the episcopal consecrations. Eight days later he was buried in the crypt at the society's international seminary in Écône, Switzerland. Archbishop Edoardo Rovida, Apostolic Nuncio to Switzerland, and Bishop Henri Schwery of Sion, the local diocese, came and prayed at the body of the dead prelate. Later that year, on 18 September 1991, Cardinal Silvio Oddi, who had been Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy from 1979 to 1986, visited Lefebvre's tomb, knelt down at it and prayed, afterwards saying aloud: [...] "Merci, Monseigneur". Thereafter Cardinal Oddi said he held Lefebvre to have been [...] "a holy man" [...] and suggested that the Society of St Pius X could be granted a personal prelature by the Holy See like that of Opus Dei. In January 1992, the then-superior general of the society, Fr. Franz Schmidberger, rejected this hypothetical offer by an unpublished private letter to the Holy See. The letter's content was described by Bishop Richard Williamson (subsequently expelled from the SSPX) as <b>basically</b> <b>saying</b> that, [...] "as long as Rome remains Conciliar, a fruitful and open collaboration between the two [...] does not seem possible." ...|$|E

A replacement was soon forthcoming, although numerous CD booklets had already been printed with the original image. Filth stated in an interview with Metal Hammer that the controversy was over the nakedness of the female figure's legs on the original cover: [...] "When we put the original next to the new version, it was so slightly changed... The nymph's skirt was a little longer. It was like a game of spot the difference". Charles Hedger told Gothtronic.com that the new cover [...] "is practically the same...
