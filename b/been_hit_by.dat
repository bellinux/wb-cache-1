5|$|In September 2012 the Israeli {{government}} set {{up another}} inquiry {{at the request}} of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The team was led by Yossi Kuperwasser, director-general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry. In May 2013 it published a 44-page report concluding that the al-Durrahs had not <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> IDF fire and may not have been shot at all.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{experiences}} {{at least one}} minor earthquake per day on average, and the Zagros region is particularly prone to seismic activity. During the last 100years, Iran has <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> more than 130events stronger than magnitude5, with damaging earthquakes near Qeshm recorded in 1360, 1703, 1884, 1897, 1902, and 1905. The majority of Iranian quakes occur in the upper crust, close to the surface, {{which means that they}} are potentially more destructive.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{took one}} {{life in the}} state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck a parked vehicle, killing a person inside. The exact cause of the tree's uprooting was unknown, although it may have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> lightning or a short-lived tornado. Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> two {{bombs and}} two torpedoes. The crew might have kept her afloat, but {{were ordered to}} abandon ship {{just as they were}} raising power for the pumps. Burning oil from Arizona and [...] drifted down on her, and {{probably}} made the situation look worse than it was. The disarmed target ship [...] was holed twice by torpedoes. West Virginia <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> seven torpedoes, the seventh tearing away her rudder. [...] <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> four torpedoes, the last two above her belt armor, which caused her to capsize. [...] <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> two of the converted 16" [...] shells, but neither caused serious damage.|$|R
50|$|The fiery Jennings {{was also}} {{known as one of}} the most fearless players of his time, {{allowing}} himself to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> pitches more than any other player. In one game, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch three times. In 1896, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> pitches 51 times—a Major League record that still stands. In just five seasons with the Orioles from 1894 to 1898, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> pitches an unprecedented 202 times. During one game, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> in the head by a pitch from Amos Rusie in the 3rd inning, but managed to finish the game. As soon as the game ended, Jennings collapsed and was unconscious for three days.|$|R
5|$|Completing {{his course}} at Upavon, McNamara was posted back to Egypt in August, but was hospitalised on 8 September with orchitis. Discharged on 6 October, he served briefly as a flying {{instructor}} with No.22 Squadron RFC, {{before returning to}} No.1 Squadron. McNamara flew with CFlight, commanded by Captain (later Air Marshal Sir) Richard Williams. On his first sortie, a reconnaissance mission over Sinai, McNamara was unaware that his plane had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> anti-aircraft fire; he returned to base with his engine's oil supply almost exhausted. Flying B.E.2s and Martinsydes, he undertook further scouting and bombing missions in the ensuing months.|$|E
5|$|For the Viet Cong, the Battle of Ap Bac {{marked the}} first time they stood and fought a large South Vietnamese formation—despite being outnumbered by more than five to one. Against {{overwhelming}} odds, the Viet Cong had achieved their first de facto victory; they had successfully held off well-equipped ARVN forces supported by artillery and armored units as well as by American airpower. Viet Cong casualties were limited to 18 soldiers killed and 39 wounded, even though their positions had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> more than 600 rounds of artillery, napalm and other ordnance released by 13 warplanes and five UH-1 gunships.|$|E
5|$|Geißhardt, who {{was flying}} Fw 190 A-4 (Werknummer 7051—factory number) in Priller's Schwarm, was {{severely}} wounded in combat with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-17 Flying Fortress of the 306th Bomb Group on 5 April 1943. He had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the defensive {{fire from the}} bombers. He was bleeding profusely from an abdominal wound but managed to make a smooth landing on the airfield at Sint-Denijs-Westrem, Belgium. He succumbed to his injuries {{early the next morning}} on 6 April 1943.|$|E
50|$|Further {{showing his}} {{toughness}} as a ballplayer, Elberfeld {{was not afraid}} of being <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch. He led the American League in being <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch in 1903 and 1911 and was among the league leaders in the category nine times. In 1911, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch 25 times, setting an American League record that was not broken until 1986 when Don Baylor <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch 35 times. In his career, Elberfeld <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch 165 times - 13th most {{in the history of}} Major League Baseball.|$|R
2500|$|The {{statement}} that New York's Empire State Building <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a B-52 bomber [...] "sometime during the 1950s or 1960s" [...] was corrected; the Empire State Building <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> {{a much smaller}} plane, the twin-propeller B-25 Mitchell, in 1945.|$|R
50|$|Vienna <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> two 500-kiloton bombs, while Vicenza, Verona, Padova {{and several}} bases in Italy <b>were</b> to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> single 500-kiloton bombs.

5|$|In {{order to}} {{recreate}} the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, RSP studied natural phenomena such as volcanoes, instead of relying on archived footage of atomic blasts, and recreated the effects digitally. They also replaced the Sydney cityscape on the horizon with views of Nagasaki. The walking bear featured in the Yukon scenes was created with computer graphics by Weta Digital, while Make-Up Effects Group built a 12 foot tall animatronic bear, that was used for shots of the creature dying after it had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> poisoned arrows fired by hunters.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro {{increased}} {{speed to}} 15 knots {{in an attempt}} to escape the trap, but she had already <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> two to four torpedoes, and after two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room, she was listing 45degrees to port. Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship, but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank, stern first, vanishing from radar between 04:19 and 04:21. Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1,636 officers and crew on board survived.|$|E

5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E
5|$|According to the London Naval Treaty, {{the ship}} was {{to be removed from}} front-line service. To this end, she had her main battery guns removed and she was {{converted}} into a radio-controlled target ship. She was redesignated AG-16, and served in this capacity after 1931. In the mid-1930s, she was rebuilt again, as an anti-aircraft gunnery training ship. In 1941, additional anti-aircraft guns were installed to increase her training capacity. Later in 1941, she was transferred to the US Pacific Fleet and based in Pearl Harbor. She was present in Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941; after having <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> two torpedoes, she capsized and sank. A few years later, the hull was partially righted and towed closer to Ford Island, where the wreck remains today.|$|E
5|$|All of the Links are cleaned twice weekly, with LinkNYC staff {{removing}} vandalism {{and dirt}} from the Links. Each Link has cameras and over 30 vibration sensors to sense if the kiosk has <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> an object. A separate set of sensors also detects if the USB ports are tampered with. If either the vibration sensors or the USB port sensors detect tampering, an alert is displayed at LinkNYC headquarters that the specific {{part of the}} Link has been affected. All of the Links have a backup battery power supply that can last for up to 24 hours if a long-term power outage were to occur. This is {{because of what happened}} in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused power outages citywide, especially to the city's payphones (which were connected to the municipal power supply of New York City).|$|E

50|$|On 27 March 2015, Montenegro had a {{home match}} against Russia. The match was {{abandoned}} after 67 minutes due to crowd violence (during the match, the Russian goalkeeper <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> Dmitri Kombarov, who <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> an object). The original score was 0-0 and Russia missed a penalty moment before the match was abandoned. Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a flare, causing a second 33-minute delay. After that game, barriers were constructed in the upper portions of the stadium to prevent similar incidents in the future.|$|R

5|$|Flight Lieutenants Ben Erwin Plumer and William Warren Hargrove {{received}} the DFC on 15 December 1944 for shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 on 6 October: F/O Dennis George Tongue {{was awarded the}} DFC on 29 December 1944, and a bar to his DFC on 2 March 1945. F/O Tongue {{was a member of}} the RAF, had been commissioned from sergeant and promoted to flying officer. On the night he won the bar to his DFC, on 25 November 1944, his pilot was A. A. Harrington of the United States Army Air Forces. They destroyed three Junkers Ju 88s, their own Mosquito having <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> debris from the second Ju 88, and during the fight that led to the downing of the third, Tongue was also having to keep track of a further Ju 88 which was endeavouring to attack their aircraft.|$|E
5|$|He had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a {{marksman}} {{from the}} Redoutable, firing {{at a range}} of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on {{the handling of the}} tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, {{in conjunction with}} UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires {{that occurred during the}} siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It {{is a testament to the}} resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.|$|E

5|$|In season one, Lex hires Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien), a {{reporter}} for the tabloid newspaper The Inquisitor, to discover how he survived the automobile accident where Clark saved him from drowning. All the evidence points to Clark having <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> Lex's car, but Lex refuses to believe that is what happened so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone. Around the same time, Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton (Joe Morton); Hamilton is commissioned to study the effects of the meteor rocks. Hamilton finds an octagonal disc, with unknown symbols imprinted on the disc's surface that match those on Clark's ship, while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989. The disc is eventually stolen by Nixon in an attempt to open Clark's ship.|$|E
5|$|Jamal {{was taken}} {{at first to}} the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had {{received}} multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and {{the lower part of}} both legs; his femoral artery was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E
5|$|Ten of {{the eleven}} gliders {{transporting}} Group Concrete landed next to the Vroenhoven bridge at 05:15, the eleventh glider having <b>been</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> anti-aircraft fire {{en route to the}} bridge and being forced to land prematurely inside Dutch territory. The gliders were engaged by heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, causing one of the gliders to stall in mid-air. The resulting crash severely wounded three airborne troops. The rest of the gliders landed without damage. One of the gliders landed near to the fortification housing the bridge detonators. This allowed the airborne troops to rapidly assault the position. They killed the occupants and tore out the wires connecting the explosives to the detonator set, ensuring the bridge could not be destroyed. The remaining Belgian defenders resisted fiercely by mounting several counter-attacks in an attempt to recapture the bridge. They were repelled with the aid of several machine-guns dropped by parachute to the airborne troops at 06:15. Constant Belgian attacks meant that Group Concrete were not withdrawn and relieved by an infantry battalion until 21:40. They suffered losses of seven dead and twenty-four wounded.|$|E
