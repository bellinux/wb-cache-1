It prefers warm and moist climates and accordingly is especially common in coastal regions, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> present in arid areas. The female lays her eggs in meat, fish, animal corpses, infected wounds of humans or animals, and excrement. The larvae feed on decomposing tissue. The insect favours species of the genus Ovis, domestic sheep in particular. This can lead to blow fly strike, causing problems for sheep farmers, though L. sericata {{is not a major}} cause of blow fly strike in most regions.|$|E

Warning {{is the sound}} of a band losing its way". Greg Kot of Rolling Stone wrote that Armstrong [...] "can't muster the same excitement for his more mature themes" [...] and stated [...] "Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's biggest-selling band?". Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic gave it three out of five stars and commented that it [...] "consists of instant classics like Minority and Macy's Day Parade, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> filled with garbage songs as well". Spin writer Jesse Berrett stated [...] "these maturity moves buoy muzzy be-yourselfism ... Nor does everything in the stylistic grab bag fit", but concluded by complimenting Armstrong's [...] "earnestly good-hearted" [...] lyrics and wrote that [...] "this album is after... evidence that even the snottiest deserve grace and the chance to age into warmth". Q gave the album three out of five stars and described it as [...] "Hugely likeable, terribly noisy and cute, as well as being jammed with proper pop songs". Neal Weiss of Yahoo! Music called the album [...] "crafty pop-rock" [...] and stated [...] "Some might wish Green Day never decided to grow up like this, but others might consider it a starting point to take the band seriously". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani perceived elements of folk and [...] "pop sensibilities", writing that the album [...] "displays just how well Green Day can construct pop songs".|$|E

2500|$|The film {{became a}} {{critical}} success garnering the best reception for a Disney animated film since Dumbo.

It is enhanced by the sudden, piquant touches of humor and the music which appeal to old and young." [...] However, the characterization of Cinderella received a mixed reception. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, [...] "The beautiful Cinderella has a voluptuous face and form—not to mention an eager disposition—to compare with Al Capp's Daisy Mae." [...] However, criticizing her role and personality, Crowther opined, [...] "As a consequence, the situation in which they are mutually involved have the constraint and immobility of panel-expressed episodes. When Mr. Disney tries to make them behave like human beings, they're banal." [...] Similarly, Variety claimed the film found [...] "more success in projecting the lower animals than in its central character, Cinderella, who is on the colorless, doll-faced side, as is the Prince Charming." ...|$|E
