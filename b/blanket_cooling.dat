50|$|Among {{babies who}} meet the {{criteria}} for hypothermia therapy—full-term with no known pre-existing conditions, having neonatal distress, and an abnormal neurological exam—cooling must begin within six hours of birth and body temperature must be maintained at 33-34 °C (91-93 °F) for 72 hours before being gradually warmed again. An alternative to hypothermia caps involves pumping cold water through a specially adapted <b>blanket,</b> <b>cooling</b> the whole body.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling,</b> alternative methods to induce cooling {{have also been}} studied. These {{include the use of}} peritoneal dialysis with iced-saline dialysate and veno-venous cooling using mechanical extracorporeal support (V–V ECMO) to promote more rapid and homogenous cooling (Hoedemaekers et al. 2007; de Waard et al. 2013; Knapik et al. 2011; Testori et al 2013) Limited data on outcomes associated with these cooling modalities has been published, but {{the extent to which these}} alternative strategies may or may not be incrementally more cost effective over conventional <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> has not been thoroughly explored.|$|E
30|$|Therapeutic {{hypothermia}} following resuscitated sudden {{cardiac arrest}} {{has been shown}} to improve both survival and neurological outcomes (Bernard et al. 2002; Arrich et al. 2012). The target temperature at which these benefits are best achieved is, however, unclear. A recent European study found no differences in survival or neurocognitive outcomes whether patients were cooled to 36 or 33 °C. However, cooling to prevent post-arrest fevers, which increase metabolic demand and can exacerbate underlying neurologic injury, appears to be an important management strategy for these patients (Nielsen et al. 2013). The optimal modality to achieve and maintain a target temperature is difficult to determine. Given rising health-care costs and recent cost-containment efforts, particularly surrounding end-of-life resource use, cost effectiveness must be considered in selecting cooling strategies. Thus, this study used an economic decision-analytic model to examine the societal-based cost effectiveness of three alternative cooling strategies. By comparing costs and QALYs of <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling,</b> peritoneal lavage, V–V ECMO, and conventional supportive care, we found that cooling blankets and iced-saline peritoneal lavage are likely to be cost-effective strategies. We found <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> to be the least expensive, but that peritoneal lavage added additional QALYs at a cost of $ 58, 329 per QALY. The ICER of <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> (vs. conventional care) was ~ 23 K/QALY gained. These results are reasonably consistent with results cited in the only other similarly conducted cost-effectiveness analysis (Merchant et al. 2009). In that study, investigators found cooling blankets to be cost-effective versus conventional care, costing $ 47, 168 /QALY. Our finding that cooling blankets were less costly overall {{may be due to the}} inclusion of additional data on effectiveness, which lowered the likelihood of a good outcome given survival with conventional care. Our finding that PL was cost effective is due to PL having lower mortality than the other therapies and similar neurological outcomes to <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling.</b> Because of the high cost of implementing V–V ECMO and its comparative low benefit and poor survival rate, it was dominated by both <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> and peritoneal lavage.|$|E
50|$|Targeted {{temperature}} {{management is}} thought to prevent brain injury by several methods including decreasing the brain's oxygen demand, reducing the production of neurotransmitters like glutamate, as well as reducing free radicals that might damage the brain. The lowering of body temperature may be accomplished by many means {{including the use of}} <b>cooling</b> <b>blankets,</b> <b>cooling</b> helmets, cooling catheters, ice packs and ice water lavage.|$|R
30|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>blankets</b> {{were the}} least costly and {{associated}} with 1.76 QALYs. Conventional care and VV-ECMO were dominated by <b>cooling</b> <b>blankets</b> as they had higher costs and lower QALYs.

Neutronics and photonics calculations were performed with the one-dimensional discrete ordinates code ANISN.

The tandem mirror fusion reactor lends itself well to one-dimensional cylindrical modeling, because it is basically a long cylinder. As the results of these calculations, the following features are revealed : The <b>blanket</b> <b>cooled</b> by liquid lithium has an adequate tritium breeding ratio, while the <b>blanket</b> <b>cooled</b> by super critical pressurized water does not satisfy the design criterion for the tritium breeding ratio of ～ 1. 1.

30|$|Three cooling {{strategies}} were modeled: standard <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling,</b> peritoneal lavage and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V–V ECMO). <b>Blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> {{is currently the}} method most frequently used in US hospitals, as it requires little training and is easily implemented. This technique requires two blankets, one placed on the anterior {{and one on the}} posterior surface of the patient, while water cooled to 32 – 34 °C is circulated through the blanket. <b>Blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> is generally an effective method to reduce body temperature but takes several hours to accomplish. The alternative strategies are more time intensive and require more complex skill sets to implement. Peritoneal cooling is accomplished by surgically placing a dialysis catheter into the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity and instilling ice-cooled (32 – 34 °C) saline. After 15 – 30  min dwell times, cooled fluid not absorbed into the vascular space through the peritoneal vessels is drained, as would be done during dialysis, and new cooled saline in infused. This process can be repeated until the desired core temperature is achieved. V–V ECMO requires surgical placement of a large-bore cannula into the central venous system. Blood is circulated through an extracorporeal circuit, which allows core temperature to be externally set. This technique requires highly skilled personnel in addition to a bedside nurse. Both of the latter approaches involve direct contact between the blood and cooling interface and, compared with <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling,</b> can induce hypothermia much more evenly and quickly. Once achieved, hypothermia is maintained for 48  h followed by passive rewarming over 8  h; peritoneal dialysis catheter and the ECMO cannula can then be removed.|$|E
30|$|Cost-effectiveness {{analysis}} can help {{determine whether the}} costs of this therapy are justified given the outcomes associated with its use. In the only cost-effectiveness analysis thus far published on this intervention, Merchant and colleagues found that, compared with conventional care, hypothermia induced via <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> improved outcomes with a cost-effectiveness ratio (~$ 47 K/QALY) comparable to other economically acceptable US health-care interventions (Merchant et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|Activated {{corrosion}} products (ACPs) are the dominant radiation hazard in water-cooled fusion reactor under normal operation conditions and directly determine the occupational radiation exposure during operation and maintenance. Recently, the preliminary design of China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) {{has been just}} completed. Evaluation of ACPs is an important work {{for the safety of}} CFETR. In this paper, the ACPs analysis code CATE 2. 1 was used to simulate the spatial distribution of ACPs along the <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> loop of CFETR, in which the influence of adopting different pulse handling methods was researched. At last, the dose rate caused by ACPs around the <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> loop was calculated using the point kernel code ARShield.

30|$|We {{made several}} {{additional}} modeling assumptions that warrant brief discussion. As mentioned above, only two neurologic outcome health states were included. We {{believe this is}} justifiable given the precedent established by previous studies, and that finer granularity of outcome state would unnecessarily increase model complexity without adding substantively to final ICER results. While other outcome criteria exist (i.e. Glasgow coma scale), we assumed, as have previous investigators, that the CPC scale is an adequately valid instrument to assess neurologic health outcomes. Additionally, we assumed that cooled patients experienced no complications. While underestimating {{the significance of these}} complications could increase cost estimates and unfavorably impact ICER estimates, because the HACA trial found no significant differences in the complication rates between those who were and were not <b>blanket</b> <b>cooled,</b> (Bernard et al. 2002) we felt this was a reasonable assumption. Finally, we included {{only a limited number of}} post-hospital discharge follow-up visits and ignored the costs of any potential new SCA-mediated morbidities requiring care or those associated with need for SCA-related hospital readmission.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, to {{the best}} of our {{knowledge}} no studies have investigated the specific effects of isolated accidental hypothermia on haemostasis. At least in part, hypothermia has been induced using <b>cooling</b> <b>blankets,</b> immersion in <b>cool</b> water or evaporation (Additional file 1 : Table S 1). Therefore, the isolated effects of accidental hypothermia as part of the lethal triad are essentially uncharacterized by previous models [38]. While induced hypothermia might be used to propose hypotheses on possible mechanism of the effects on coagulation, the definite major underlying pathomechanisms can only be assessed if hypothermia occurs spontaneously after trauma-haemorrhage, e.g. in the context of systemic hypoperfusion.|$|R

To simulate the environment that materials may be exposed to in a target / <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> loop, samples were irradiated by an 800 MeV proton beam at the A 6 Target Station of the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE).

40|$|Related to {{the first}} wall and <b>blanket</b> <b>cooling</b> for magnetically {{confined}} fusion reactors, heat transfer characteristics of a lithium flow in a conducting rectangular channel {{in the presence of}} a transverse magnetic field was investigated numerically. Special attention was paid to the effect of convective heat transport by jets generated in sidelayers on heat transfer enhancement. The Navier-Stokes equations including the Lorentz force term, the equation for scalar potential and the energy equation were solved numerically to simulate the flow and heat transfer of the lithium flow with a heated wall parallel to the direction of the magnetic field. The jets appeared adjacent to side walls parallel to the applied magnetic field. The ratio of peak velocity in the jets to average velocity reached about six at the Hartmann number of 1, 900. Skin friction coefficient agreed well with the simple analytical model:. 13. 0 with Re, 2 / 2 = = ppf kMkC Temperature was lower in the center of a heating surface due to the cooling effect of the sidelayer jet. The Nusselt number increased by 42 %- 50 % at the Hartmann number of 1, 900 compared with hydrodynamic flow.
