5|$|It prefers basins {{and desert}} areas vegetated with Chinese {{tamarisk}} (Tamarix chinensis), <b>brush,</b> <b>or</b> poplar (Populus), along the peripheries of rivers {{that surround the}} mountains in the Taklamakan Desert. This distribution of the Yarkand hare is ring shaped. It also uses reed vegetation along rivers for shelter, and tends to avoid agricultural fields. About 200,000 individuals are estimated to inhabit the Tarim Basin.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|Dry <b>brushing</b> <b>or</b> {{agitation}} device: Wire <b>brushing</b> <b>or</b> sanding is {{used when}} microbial growth {{can be seen}} on solid wood surfaces such as framing or underlayment (the subfloor).|$|R
25|$|Overly {{vigorous}} <b>or</b> incorrectly performed <b>brushing</b> <b>or</b> flossing {{may cause}} {{injury to the}} gingiva (gums). Improper <b>or</b> over-vigorous <b>brushing</b> may cause sore gums, damage to tooth enamel, gingivitis, and bleeding gums. Dentists and dental hygienists can instruct and demonstrate proper <b>brushing</b> <b>or</b> flossing techniques.|$|R
25|$|The SRM has no <b>brushes</b> <b>or</b> PMs, and {{the rotor}} has no {{electric}} currents.|$|R
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{background}} of the fabric is painted with a wide <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> dipped in a dye bath.|$|E
25|$|This means, for example, that if {{the ball}} hits the wicket {{directly}} from the bowler's delivery, the batsman is only out bowled if a bail falls off, so a ball can actually <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> rest against the stumps without the batsman being dismissed (as long as the bail remains in its groove).|$|E
50|$|Turret type {{punch press}} {{machines}} have a table <b>or</b> bed with <b>brushes</b> <b>or</b> rollers {{to allow the}} sheet metal workpiece to traverse with low friction. Brushes are used where scratches on the workpiece must be minimized, as with <b>brushed</b> aluminium <b>or</b> high polished materials.|$|R
5000|$|Irish born {{inventor}} James Henry Apjohn (1845-1914) patented an [...] "Apparatus for Cleaning Carriage, Motor Car {{and other}} Windows" [...] which was stated to use either <b>brushes</b> <b>or</b> wipers {{and could be}} either motor driven or hand driven. The <b>brushes</b> <b>or</b> wipers were intended to clean either both up and down or in just one direction on a vertical window. Apjohn's invention had a priority date in the UK of 9 October 1903.|$|R

25|$|Tail docking is done {{in modern}} times either for prophylactic, therapeutic, or {{cosmetic}} purposes. For dogs that work in the field, such as some hunting dogs and herding dogs, tails can collect burrs and foxtails, causing pain and infection and, due to the tail's wagging, {{may be subject to}} abrasion or other injury while moving through dense <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> thickets.|$|E
25|$|Prior to contact, pottery {{was usually}} open-air fired or pit fired; precontact Indigenous peoples of Mexico used kilns extensively. Today many Native American ceramic artists use kilns. In pit-firing, the pot {{is placed in}} a shallow pit dug into the earth along with other unfired pottery, covered with wood and <b>brush,</b> <b>or</b> dung, then set on fire whereupon it can harden at {{temperatures}} of 1400 degrees or more. Finally, the ceramics surface is often polished with smooth stones.|$|E
25|$|Western Shar Pei {{comes in}} three {{different}} coat types: horse, brush, and bear coat. The unusual horse coat is rough to the touch, extremely prickly and off-standing and {{is closer to the}} original traditional Shar Pei breed in appearance and coat type than the <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> bear coat. This coat is fairly prickly and can be rough or irritating when petting in the opposite direction of the fur. The horse coat is generally thought to be more active and predisposed to dominant behavior than the brush coat.|$|E
50|$|Bathing {{dramatically}} {{reduces the}} flea population on a badly infested animal, especially when {{in combination with}} a mild detergent <b>or</b> shampoo, and <b>brushing</b> <b>or</b> combing.|$|R
50|$|However, if, after 24 {{hours in}} the oral environment, biofilm remains {{undisturbed}} by <b>brushing</b> <b>or</b> flossing, it begins to absorb the mineral content of saliva. Through this absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the saliva, oral biofilm is transformed from the soft, easily removable form into a hard substance known as calculus. Commonly known as 'tartar', calculus provides a base for new layers of plaque biofilm to settle on and builds up over time. Calculus is harder than bone and cannot be removed by <b>brushing</b> <b>or</b> flossing.|$|R
50|$|Healthy gums {{usually have}} no {{reaction}} to normal disturbance such as <b>brushing</b> <b>or</b> periodontal probing. Unhealthy gums, conversely, will show bleeding on probing (BOP) and/or purulent exudate.|$|R
25|$|In some areas, {{where more}} land is available, sewage is treated in large round or oval ditches {{with one or}} more {{horizontal}} aerators typically called <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> disc aerators which drive the mixed liquor around the ditch and provide aeration. These are oxidation ditches, often referred to by manufacturer's trade names such as Pasveer, Orbal, or Carrousel. They have the advantage that they are relatively easy to maintain and are resilient to shock loads that often occur in smaller communities (i.e. at breakfast time and in the evening).|$|E
25|$|Abrading is {{the process}} in which surface {{deposits}} are removed using abrasives. Abrasives come in both solid and cream forms. Solid forms of abrasives include glass fiber <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> a rubber burr on a dental drill. Cream forms are usually attached to paper or film. Polishing creams are commonly used to remove thin layers of insoluble surface deposits such calcium. These creams can also remove surface dirt and marks made by tools. The best creams of ceramic do not have oil, grease, or bleach as additives and are used only on glazed ceramics.|$|E
25|$|Professional tools used by blacksmiths, carpenters, {{and farmers}} were carried by nearly all. Axes, crow bars, hammers, hatchets, hoes, mallets, mattocks, picks, planes, saws, scythes, and shovels {{were used to}} clear or make a road through <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> trees, cut down the banks to cross a wash or steep banked stream, build a raft or bridge, or repair the wagon. In general, as little road work as {{possible}} was done. Travel was often {{along the top of}} ridges to avoid the brush and washes common in many valleys.|$|E

25|$|Grafting to {{involves}} the strong adsorption or chemical bonding of a polymer molecule to a surface from solution. This process is typically achieved through a coupling agent that links {{a handle on}} the surface to a reactive group on either of the chain termini. Although simple, this approach suffers from the disadvantage of a relatively low grafting density as a result of steric hindrance from the already-attached polymer coils. After coupling, as in all cases, polymers attempt to maximize their entropy typically by assuming a <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> mushroom conformation. Thus, potential binding sites become inaccessible beneath this “mushroom domain”.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{knocking}} down {{a wall in}} order to make space for an extension or repair of the wall would be demolition for a constructive purpose. Combing a wig to set it correctly and pulling out hairs during the procedure with a metal toothed <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> comb would be constructive 'demolition', as each hair that's removed in the process of the wig (a utensil) is progressing its state towards a completion which is desired. Each hair's removal is a partial demolition of the wig (for these legal purposes) and is considered constructive when viewed in context of the desired goal.|$|E
25|$|The Ertebølle {{population}} derived its {{living from}} a variety of means, but chiefly from the sea. They prospered, grew healthy and multiplied on a diet of fish. They were masters of the inland waters, which they traversed in paddled dugouts. Like many peoples known in history, they were able to hunt whales and seals from their dugouts. Their materials were mainly wood, with bone, antler and flint for functions requiring harder surfaces. Homes were constructed of <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> light wood. The materials encourage us to view them as transitory. They were, nevertheless, able to place the dead in longer-used cemeteries. Perhaps the dwelling-places were transitory, but the territories were not.|$|E

50|$|Like most longer-haired cats, {{they require}} <b>brushing</b> <b>or</b> {{are prone to}} matting. Autumn and winter are the seasons when they have the highest risk of tangles because their coat thickens in {{preparation}} for winter.|$|R
25|$|Although {{recommended}} {{and studied}} several times since, further Blue Line extension to Lynn has not moved past the proposal stage. The former {{right of way}} from Revere Street to Point of Pines {{is owned by the}} Massachusetts Electric Company, a National Grid subsidiary, and used as a utility corridor. Most of its length is covered in <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> wetlands, although several residential buildings and parking areas incur on the utility-owned right of way in Point of Pines. The Alternatives Analysis / Draft Environmental Impact Statement, released in 2011, considered two potential routes: one following the Narrow Gauge right of way through Point of Pines, and one sharing the Newburyport/Rockport Line right of way.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{tests are}} {{performed}} on {{a sample of}} blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. For example, a medical procedure called a buccal smear uses a small <b>brush</b> <b>or</b> cotton swab {{to collect a sample}} of cells from the inside surface of the cheek. Alternatively, a small amount of saline mouthwash may be swished in the mouth to collect the cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory where technicians look for specific changes in chromosomes, DNA, or proteins, depending on the suspected disorders, often using DNA sequencing. The laboratory reports the test results in writing to a person's doctor or genetic counselor.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the primary}} graphic {{distinction}} made in classifications {{is that of}} linearity. Linear writing systems are those in which the characters are composed of lines, such as the Latin alphabet and Chinese characters. Chinese characters are considered linear whether they are written with a ball-point pen or a calligraphic <b>brush,</b> <b>or</b> cast in bronze. Similarly, Egyptian hieroglyphs and Maya glyphs were often painted in linear outline form, but in formal contexts they were carved in bas-relief. The earliest examples of writing are linear: the Sumerian script of c. 3300 BC was linear, though its cuneiform descendants were not. Non-linear systems, on the other hand, such as braille, are not composed of lines, no matter what instrument is used to write them.|$|E

Express provides {{much of the same}} functionality as Autodesk SketchBook Pro, but does not include custom <b>brush</b> textures (imported <b>or</b> drawn), layer controls, symmetric <b>brushes</b> <b>or</b> guide lines. Earlier versions of Express could not save layers. Versions 5.5 and later, however, do allow the preservation of layers.|$|R
50|$|Principal {{techniques}} include slip-painting, {{where the}} slip is treated like paint {{and used to}} create a design with <b>brushes</b> <b>or</b> other implements, and slip-trailing, where the slip, usually rather thick, is dripped onto the body.|$|R
