40|$|Norvancomycin-bonded chiral {{stationary}} phase (NVC-CSP) and phenyl carbamate-derivatized norvancomycin-bonded chiral {{stationary phase}} (PC-NVC-CSP) were synthesized, {{and used for}} the enantioseparation of <b>benproperine</b> phosphate in polar organic phase mode using high performance liquid chromatography. Better results were obtained on PC-NVC-CSP, comparing with those on NVC-CSP. The influences of mobile phase composition, the concentraiton of acid/base additives, temperature and flow rate on enantioseparation were also studied on PC-NVC-CSP. Under optimum conditions, baseline separation of <b>benproperine</b> phosphate could be obtained...|$|E
