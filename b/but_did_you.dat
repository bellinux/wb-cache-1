500|$|On April 30, Obama called McRaven {{one more}} time to wish the SEALs well and to thank them for their service. That evening, the President {{attended}} the annual White House Correspondent's Association dinner, which was hosted by comedian and television actor Seth Meyers. At one point, Meyers joked: [...] "People think bin Laden is hiding in the Hindu Kush, <b>but</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> know that every day from 4 to 5 he hosts a show on C-SPAN?" [...] Obama laughed, despite {{his knowledge of the}} operation to come.|$|E
500|$|Bodley {{was educated}} at a Lycée in Paris {{before he was}} sent to Eton College and then to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Bodley showed {{interest}} as a writer; he wrote poetry at Eton and for a cadet magazine at Sandhurst. From Sandhurst he was commissioned in the King's Royal Rifle Corps as a second lieutenant in September 1911. He spent three years serving in a regiment in British India where he began to write and stage plays. His commanding officer once remarked [...] "The plays are amusing. You're a credit to the regiment and all that, <b>but</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> join the army to become a soldier or a comedian?" [...] Shortly thereafter the First World War broke out, and Bodley was sent to the Western Front for four years. He was wounded several times, including by poison gas. At the age of 26 he was given the rank of lieutenant colonel and command of a battalion. He was appointed assistant military attaché to Paris on 15 August 1918, and attended the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. What he heard there reportedly made him feel that he and the millions of other soldiers had fought for nothing; he wrote later that [...] "selfish politicians [...] laying the groundwork for the Second World War – each country grabbing all it could for itself, creating national antagonisms, and reviving the intrigues of secret." [...] Disillusioned with the military, Bodley considered a career in politics on the advice of the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George.|$|E
2500|$|Curiosity {{about the}} victims {{led to the}} re-release of Tate's films, {{achieving}} greater popularity than they had in their initial runs. Some newspapers began to speculate on the motives for the murders. Some of the published photographs of Tate were allegedly taken at a Satanic ritual, but were later proven to have been production photographs from Eye of the Devil. Friends spoke out against the portrayal of Tate by some elements of the media. Mia Farrow said she was as [...] "sweet and pure a human being as I have ever known", while Patty Duke remembered her as [...] "a gentle, gentle creature. I was crazy about her, and I don't know anyone who wasn't." [...] Polanski berated a crowd of journalists at a press conference, saying that many times they had written that Tate [...] "was beautiful. Maybe {{the most beautiful woman}} in the world. <b>But</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever write how good she was?" [...] Peter Evans later quoted the actor Laurence Harvey, who commented on Polanski immediately after the murders, [...] "This could destroy Roman. Marriage vows mean nothing to him but few men have adored a woman as much as he adored Sharon." ...|$|E
