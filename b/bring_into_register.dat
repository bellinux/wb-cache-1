40|$|Five {{polypeptide}} components {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} eggshell (chorion) of a silkmoth. Two are homogeneous on sodium dodecyl sulfate and isoelectric focusing gels, and three contain predominantly two proteins each. Amino acid analyses show that all five components are similar to each other. These proteins have been sequenced from the amino terminus. Homogeneous components yielded single sequences; heterogeneous components yielded two residues at some positions, consistent with their containing two major electrophoretic components. Striking similarities are apparent among all these sequences. These similarities can be increased dramatically by separating {{each of the three}} protein mixtures into two sequences and introducing a small number of gaps or insertions. This {{is due in part to}} <b>bringing</b> <b>into</b> <b>register</b> a portion that contains short repeating subunits found in all sequences. All proteins are also characterized by a region of high cysteine content near the amino terminus followed by a longer low-cysteine region. The data suggest that these proteins share a common evolutionary origin and are encoded by a multigene family...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSingle-molecule force {{spectroscopy}} {{has become}} a versatile tool for investigating the (un) folding of proteins and other polymeric molecules. Like other single-molecule techniques, single-molecule force spectroscopy requires recording and analysis of large data sets to extract statistically meaningful conclusions. Here, we present a data analysis tool that provides efficient filtering of heterogeneous data sets, <b>brings</b> spectra <b>into</b> <b>register</b> based on a reference-free alignment algorithm, and determines automatically the location of unfolding barriers. Furthermore, it groups spectra according {{to the number of}} unfolding events, subclassifies the spectra using cross correlation-based sorting, and extracts unfolding pathways by principal component analysis and clustering methods to extracted peak positions. Our approach has been tested on a data set obtained through mechanical unfolding of bacteriorhodopsin (bR), which contained a significant number of spectra that did not show the well-known bR fingerprint. In addition, we have tested the performance of the data analysis tool on unfolding data of the soluble multidomain (Ig 27) 8 protein...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of algorithms for the spatial transformation and registration of tomographic brain images {{is a key}} issue in several clinical and basic science medical applications, including computer aided neurosurgery, functional image analysis, and morphometrics. This paper describes a technique for the spatial transformation of brain images, {{which is based on}} elastically deformable models. A deformable surface algorithm is used to find a parametric representation of the outer cortical surface and then and then to define a map between corresponding cortical regions in two brain images. Based on the resulting map, a three-dimensional elastic warping transformation is then determined, which <b>brings</b> two images <b>into</b> <b>register.</b> This transformation models images as inhomogeneous elastic objects which are deformed into registration with each other by external force fields. The elastic properties of the images can vary from one region to the other, allowing more variable brain regions, such as [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Stem loop 1 (SL 1) is {{a highly}} conserved hairpin in the 5 ′-leader of the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type I that forms a metastable kissing dimer that is converted during viral maturation into a stable duplex {{with the aid of}} the nucleocapsid (NC) protein. SL 1 contains a highly conserved internal loop that promotes the kissing–duplex transition by a mechanism that remains poorly understood. Using NMR, we characterized internal motions induced by the internal loop in an SL 1 monomer that may promote the kissing–duplex transition. This includes micro-to-millisecond secondary structural transitions that cause partial melting of three base-pairs above the internal loop making them key nucleation sites for exchanging strands and nanosecond rigid-body stem motions that can help <b>bring</b> strands <b>into</b> spatial <b>register.</b> We show that while Mg 2 + binds to the internal loop and arrests these internal motions, it preserves and/or activates local mobility at internal loop residues G 272 and G 273 which are implicated in NC binding. By stabilizing SL 1 without compromising the accessibility of G 272 and G 273 for NC binding, Mg 2 + may increase the dependence of the kissing–duplex transition on NC binding thus preventing spontaneous transitions from taking place and ensuring that viral RNA and protein maturation occur in concert...|$|R
40|$|When {{estimating}} {{the position of}} one hand {{for the purpose of}} reaching to it with the other, humans have visual and proprioceptive estimates of the target hand's position. These are thought to be weighted and combined to form an integrated estimate {{in such a way that}} variance is minimized. If visual and proprioceptive estimates are in disagreement, it may be advantageous for the nervous system to <b>bring</b> them back <b>into</b> <b>register</b> by spatially realigning one or both. It is possible that realignment is determined by weights, in which case the lower-weighted modality should always realign more than the higher-weighted modality. An alternative possibility is that realignment and weighting processes are controlled independently, and either can be used to compensate for a sensory misalignment. Here, we imposed a misalignment between visual and proprioceptive estimates of target hand position in a reaching task designed to allow simultaneous, independent measurement of weights and realignment. In experiment 1, we used endpoint visual feedback to create a situation where task success could theoretically be achieved with either a weighting or realignment strategy, but vision had to be regarded as the correctly aligned modality to achieve success. In experiment 2, no endpoint visual feedback was given. We found that realignment operates independently of weights in the former case but not in the latter case, suggesting that while weighting and realignment may operate in conjunction in some circumstances, they are biologically independent processes that give humans behavioral flexibility in compensating for sensory perturbations...|$|R
