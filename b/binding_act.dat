40|$|Collective redress is a {{procedural}} mechanism {{that allows for}} reasons of procedural economy and efficiency of enforcement many similar legal claims to be combined into a single court action. Consumers and investors encounter problems with the enforcement of their rights through the individual redress, especially in times of the financial crisis. If {{a substantial number of}} harmed individuals decide not to pursue their, usually low, claims, the unduly gained profits of the opposite party can be extremely high. Thus, collective redress mechanisms can represent better option for consumers and investors, as their claims tend to be much less burdensome in case of the collective action. However, such mechanisms can trigger the abuse of the procedures, with the most commonly quoted threat being the example of American regulation of class actions. Negative characteristics of American model are the reasons that EU decided to shape its own concept of collective redress mechanisms. The <b>binding</b> <b>act</b> in this field in the EU is directive on injunctions for the protection of consumers’ interests; however, there is no <b>binding</b> <b>act</b> yet regarding compensatory actions. In June 2013, the European Commission published the Recommendation on common principles for injunctive and compensatory collective redress mechanisms in the Member States concerning violations of rights granted under Union Law. It is not binding on Member States, however, it can serve as a guideline to improve their existing legislations, especially the regulation of collective compensatory actions. In so doing, consumers and investors might be given the possibility to use more efficient mechanism to compensate the harm suffered...|$|E

40|$|There {{are four}} members of the myocyte {{enhancer}} factor 2 (MEF 2) family of transcription factors in vertebrates, MEF 2 A, -B, -C, and -D, which have homology within a MADS box at their amino termini and an adjacent motif known as the MEF 2 domain. These factors activate muscle gene expression by binding as homo- and heterodimers to an A/T-rich DNA sequence in the control regions of muscle-specific genes. To understand the mechanisms of muscle gene activation of MEF 2 factors, we generated a series of deletion and site-directed mutants of MEF 2 C. These mutants demonstrated that the MADS and MEF 2 domains mediate DNA binding and dimerization, whereas the carboxyl terminus is required for transcriptional activation. Amino acids that are essential for MEF 2 site-dependent transcription but which do not affect DNA binding were also identified in the MEF 2 domain.

40|$|Steroid hormones {{are derived}} from a {{cholesterol}} precursor. They are secreted directly into the blood where they are bound to carrier proteins, which transport them to target cells. Due to their lipophilic nature they traverse cell membranes by simple diffusion and bind to Steroid Hormone Receptors (SHR’s). The mechanism of action of SHR’s can be either genomic or non-genomic; this summary will hone in on how activation of SHR’s regulates gene expression. SHR’s are ligand-activated proteins that function as transcription factors, which direct and facilitate the transcription of DNA by RNA Polymerase II. They are located predominantly within the cytosol or nucleus of target cells. SHR’s have a central DNA binding domain (DBD), which via zinc finger and ‘P ’ box motifs, targets the receptor to Hormone Response Elements (HRE’s). HRE’s are short sequences of DNA within the promoter region that conveys direct transcriptional responsiveness to genes. SHR’s also have a ligand binding domain (LBD), which acts as a molecular switch to turn on transcriptional activity when a hormonal ligand induces a conformational change in the receptor. Transactivation domains 1 and 2 (AF- 1 and AF- 2) are located close to the DBD and LBD respectively and upon hormone <b>binding</b> <b>act</b> synergistically to activate the SHR.

40|$|The {{assembly}} of the Gal repressosome, a higher order nucleoprotein complex that represses transcription of the gal operon in Escherichia coli, involves {{the formation of a}} DNA loop encompassing the promoter segment. GalR dimers bound to two spatially separated operators, OE and OI, specifically interact with the histone-like protein HU and close the loop in supercoiled DNA. We isolated and characterized a GalR mutant containing an amino acid substitution (R 282 L) that can repress transcription in the absence of HU and supercoiled DNA both in vivo and in vitro. Repression involves the same DNA looping; deletion of either OE or OI makes the mutant GalR ineffective in repression. This and other results suggest that the R 282 L substitution increases the normal affinity between two DNA-bound GalR dimers, allowing looping. We conclude that GalR dimers interact directly and do not use HU as an adaptor in loop closure; HU and DNA supercoiling act in concert to stabilize the GalR tetramer. The stronger GalR–GalR interaction also made the gal transcription non-inducible, suggesting that the inducer <b>binding</b> <b>acts</b> by modulating tetramerization...|$|R
40|$|The {{binding problem}} in {{perception}} {{is concerned with}} answering the question how information from millions of sensory receptors, processed by millions of neurons working in parallel, can be merged into a unified percept. Binding in perception reaches from the lowest levels of feature binding up to the levels of multimodal binding of information coming from the different sensor modalities and also from other functional systems. The last 40 years of research {{have shown that the}} binding problem cannot be solved easily. Today, it is considered as one of the key questions to brain understanding. To date, various solutions have been suggested to the binding problem including: (1) combination coding, (2) binding by synchrony, (3) population coding, (4) binding by attention, (5) binding by knowledge, expectation, and memory, (6) hardwired versus on-demand binding, (7) bundling and binding of features, (8) the feature-integration theory of attention, (9) synchronization through top-down processes. Each of those hypotheses addresses important aspects of binding. However, each of them also suffers from certain weak points and can never give a complete explanation. This article gives a brief overview of the so far suggested solutions of perceptual binding and then shows that those are actually not mutually exclusive but can complement each other. A computationally verified model is presented which shows that, most likely, the different described mechanisms of <b>binding</b> <b>act</b> (1) at different hierarchical levels and (2) in different stages of perceptual knowledge acquisition.

When RNA synthesis was inhibited more than 90 % by either actinomycin D (Act D) or rifampin, germination was prevented. The data {{were consistent with}} the interpretation that rifampin did not interfere with protein synthesis in any way other than by inhibition of messenger RNA formation. Act D concentrations as high as 20 μg/ml did not totally inhibit RNA synthesis. In the presence of 8 μg of Act D/ml, germinating myxospores synthesized transfer RNA, 16 S RNA, and 23 S RNA. Evidence was presented which indicated that messenger RNA was also synthesized early in the germination period both in the presence and absence of 8 μg of Act D/ml. One explanation for the escape synthesis of RNA in germinating myxospores is that Act D exerts a differential effect on the transcription of larger versus smaller cistrons, the latter having a lower probability of <b>binding</b> <b>Act</b> D. We have found that in the presence of 8 μg of Act D/ml, escape RNA synthesis in myxospores was 25 % for 23 S RNA, 55 % for 16 S RNA, and more than 90 % for 4 S RNA. We have shown that germination of myxospores requires both RNA and protein synthesis during the first 25 to 35 min in germination medium.

40|$|Lipids {{are best}} known as energy storing {{molecules}} and core-components of cellular membranes, but can also act as mediators of cellular signaling. This is most prominently illustrated by the paramount importance of the phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) signaling pathways in many cells, including T cells and cancer cells. Both of these enzymes use the lipid phosphatidylinositol(4, 5) bisphosphate (PIP 2) as their substrate. PLCs produce the lipid product diacylglycerol (DAG) and soluble inositol(1, 4, 5) trisphosphate (IP 3). DAG acts as a membrane tether for protein kinase C and RasGRP proteins. IP 3 is released into the cytosol and controls calcium release from internal stores. The PI 3 K lipid product phosphatidylinositol(3, 4, 5) trisphosphate (PIP 3) controls signaling by binding and recruiting effector proteins such as Akt and Itk to cellular membranes. Recent research has unveiled important signaling roles for many additional phosphoinositides and other lipids. The articles in this volume highlight how multiple different lipids govern T cell development and function through diverse mechanisms and effectors. In T cells, lipids can orchestrate signaling by organizing membrane topology in rafts or microdomains, direct protein function through covalent lipid-modification or non-covalent lipid <b>binding,</b> <b>act</b> as intracellular or extracellular messenger molecules, or govern T cell function {{at the level of}} metabolic regulation.

40|$|A new all-atom {{force field}} for the {{simulation}} of phospholipid bilayers using the AMBER molecular dynamics package has been developed, which is compatible with other AMBER protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate and small molecule force fields. The force field has been validated by simulating bilayers of six different lipid types, finding favourable comparison to experiment for properties such as area per lipid, volume per lipid, bilayer thickness, NMR order parameters, scattering data, and lipid lateral diffusion. The modular nature of this force field allows numerous combinations of head and tail groups to create different lipid types, enabling the easy insertion of new lipid species. The lipid bilayer model has then been applied {{to the study of}} the interaction between radioimaging agents and membranes in an effort to understand the phenomena of non-specific binding, which remains poorly understood yet of serious detrimental consequence to the development of new imaging tracers. The effect of different concentrations of imaging agent on a homogeneous membrane has been examined using unbiased simulations, whilst the permeability coefficient of each imaging agent through a membrane has been calculated using biased simulations. It is found that radiotracers with low non-specific binding must adopt a certain orientation to cross the head group region of a membrane – this requirement may act as a barrier to membrane entry. Furthermore, once partitioned into the membrane, simulations predict that those radiotracers displaying a high degree of non-specific <b>binding</b> <b>act</b> to order lipid tail groups to a greater extent than those with low non-specific binding, reducing the permeability of the membrane and possibly acting to ‘trap’ radiotracer in the membrane.

Cryptic NAb as described in mammals need an in vitro physical or biochemical treatment to be detected, which may reflect their biochemical modification in situ during inflammation or infection. We studied the effect of concurrent primary, secondary, and tertiary intratracheal (i. t.) challenges with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and human serum albumin on levels of 2 cryptic NAb [i. e., NAb binding actin (ACT), or thyroglobulin (THYRO) ] and levels of an overt NAb binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). In addition, effect of aging of the birds on levels of NAb was taken into account. Presence and changes {{on the level of}} the cryptic antibodies directed to ACT and THYRO were expected after the i. t. challenges with LPS (and human serum albumin). However, levels of NAb <b>binding</b> <b>ACT</b> were only significantly enhanced by LPS after primary challenge, whereas levels of NAb binding THYRO were not affected by primary nor secondary challenges but were significantly decreased by LPS after the third immunization.

Levels of all three NAb increased with aging, but the different challenges performed at 3 moments during aging did not significantly or consistently affect levels of the overt nor cryptic NAb.

40|$|The defi nition of “economic activity” {{formulated}} {{pursuant to}} {{the provisions of the}} Act on freedom of economic activity has been a subject of research and deliberations presented in literature. Thus it seems justifi ed to analyse the same against relevant judicial decisions.

In some cases, it was deemed reasonable to include opinions delivered by the Supreme Administrative Court in Warszawa and its branches before the reform of administrative judiciary. The basic deliberations are focused on the practical understanding of individual determinants of economic activity. The research was conducted with a view of establishing whether the understanding of particular characteristics of actual economic activity is clear, or whether their interpretation has posed or poses certain diffi culties or doubts. The existence of some common features has justifi ed the references to judicial decisions that were made pursuant to two statutory acts currently no longer binding, i. e. the Act of 23 December 1988 on economic activity and the Act of 19 November 1999 : Law on economic activity.

Here we present data suggesting both a role for CBTF 122 prior to its nuclear translocation and the mechanism that retains it in the cytoplasm before the midblastula transition (MBT). CBTF 122 and its variant CBTF 98 are associated with translationally quiescent mRNP complexes. We show that CBTF 122 RNA binding activity is both necessary and sufficient for its cytoplasmic retention during early development. The introduction of an additional nuclear localization signal to CBTF 122 is insufficient to overcome this retention, suggesting that RNA <b>binding</b> <b>acts</b> as a cytoplasmic anchor for CBTF 122. Destruction of endogenous RNA by microinjection of RNase promotes premature nuclear translocation of CBTF 122. Thus, the nuclear translocation of CBTF 122 at the MBT {{is likely to be}} coupled to the degradation of maternal mRNA that occurs at that stage...|$|R
5000|$|... eIF2 {{activity}} is regulated by a mechanism involving both guanine nucleotide exchange and phosphorylation. Phosphorylation {{takes place at}} the α-sub-unit, which is a target for a number of serine kinases that phosphorylate serine 51. Those kinases act as a result of stress such as amino acid deprivation (GCN2), ER stress (PERK), the presence of dsRNA (PKR) heme deficiency (HRI), or interferon. Once phosphorylated, eIF2 shows increased affinity for its Guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. However, eIF2B is able to exchange GDP for GTP only if eIF2 is in its unphosphorylated state. Phosphorylated eIF2, however, due to its stronger <b>binding,</b> <b>acts</b> as an inhibitor of its own GEF (eIF2B). Since the cellular concentration of eIF2B is much lower than that of eIF2, even a small amount of phosphorylated eIF2 can completely abolish eIF2B activity by sequestration. Without the GEF, eIF2 can no longer be returned to its active (GTP-bound) state. As a consequence, translation comes to a halt since initiation is no longer possible without any available ternary complex. Furthermore, low concentration of ternary complex allows the expression of GCN4 (starved condition), which, in turn, results in increased activation of amino acid synthesis genes ...|$|R
