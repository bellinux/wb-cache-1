5|$|Green Archaeoastronomy {{is named}} after {{the cover of the}} book Archaeoastronomy in the Old World. It is based {{primarily}} on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period. The <b>basic</b> <b>methods</b> were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.|$|E

25|$|Deep {{inspiration}} breath-hold (DIBH) is {{a method}} of delivering radiotherapy while limiting radiation exposure to the heart and lungs. It is used primarily for treating left-sided breast cancer. The technique involves a patient holding their breath during treatment. There are two <b>basic</b> <b>methods</b> of performing DIBH: free-breathing breath-hold and spirometry-monitored deep inspiration breath hold.|$|E
25|$|There are two <b>basic</b> <b>methods</b> {{of using}} stirrups, a shorter stirrup {{to allow more}} {{mobility}} and a longer stirrup to allow greater control. The stirrup itself is similar, but {{the length of the}} stirrup leather is different. In each case, the stirrup length allows the rider to remain over the center of balance of the horse for the average speed characteristic of the discipline; the faster the horse travels, the more forward the rider must be positioned, and hence the shorter the stirrup.|$|E
25|$|The space-based portion {{will not}} need to support itself against gravity (other than {{relatively}} weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will {{have to cope with}} space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. Two <b>basic</b> <b>methods</b> of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. Wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.|$|E

500|$|To {{understand}} how organisations operate, Russell explains, {{we must first}} understand the <b>basic</b> <b>methods</b> by which they can exercise power at all — that is, we must understand {{the manner in which}} individuals are persuaded to follow some authority. Russell breaks the forms of influence down into three very general categories: [...] "the power of force and coercion"; the [...] "power of inducements", such as operant conditioning and group conformity; and [...] "the power of propaganda and/or habit" [...] (Russell 1938:24).|$|E
500|$|... "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] {{was created}} and mixed at guitarist the Edge's newly-bought home, Melbeach, which U2 {{used as a}} {{recording}} studio. Bono wrote the song on his mother-in-law's Spanish guitar; the melody came from a song that Bono wrote in Ethiopia in 1985 to teach children about <b>basic</b> <b>methods</b> of hygiene. The drums, played by Larry Mullen Jr., were sampled and looped from another song by producer Brian Eno and subsequently slowed down and treated with [...] "a canyon load of reverb". The Edge added a guitar part using a Bond Electraglide guitar, which he abused to produce a sound that he liked. Producer Daniel Lanois was the principal mixer of the song. Bono, likening the studio itself to an instrument, described Lanois's mix as a [...] "performance".|$|E

500|$|Zinc is {{the fourth}} most common metal in use, {{trailing}} only iron, aluminium, and copper with an annual production of about 10 million tonnes. Worldwide, 95% of the zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron. Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy. Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate produced during processing to zinc oxide: For further processing two <b>basic</b> <b>methods</b> are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy processing reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at [...] into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor. The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser. Electrowinning processing leaches zinc from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid: After this step electrolysis is used to produce zinc metal.|$|E
2500|$|When {{observing the}} evolvement of S. aureus {{and its ability}} to adapt to each {{modified}} antibiotic, two <b>basic</b> <b>methods</b> known as “band-based” or “sequence-based” are employed. Keeping these two methods in mind, other methods such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), bacteriophage typing, spa locus typing, and SCCmec typing are often conducted more than others. With these methods, it can be determined where strains of MRSA originated and also where they are currently.|$|E

5000|$|For {{this second}} step, the <b>Basic</b> <b>Method</b> adopted the {{traditional}} liability coverage test {{that had long}} been imposed by the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and other [...] "self regulatory" [...] exchanges on their members and by the SEC on broker-dealers that were not members of such an exchange. Using that approach, the SEC required that a broker-dealer subject to the <b>Basic</b> <b>Method</b> maintain [...] "net capital" [...] equal to at least 6-2/3% of its [...] "aggregate indebtedness." [...] This is {{commonly referred to as}} a 15 to 1 leverage limit, because it meant [...] "aggregate indebtedness" [...] could not be more than 15 times the amount of [...] "net capital." [...] "Aggregate indebtedness", however, excluded [...] "adequately secured debt", subordinated debt and other specified liabilities, so that even the <b>Basic</b> <b>Method</b> did not limit to 15 to 1 a broker-dealer's overall leverage computed from a GAAP financial statement.|$|R
