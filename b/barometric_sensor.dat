50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, air temperature sensor, coolant temperature sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, <b>barometric</b> <b>sensor</b> and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E

In the other side, <b>barometric</b> <b>sensor</b> can measure any altitude, but an outputs have a random noise for one measurement in QuadRotor applications. As a data information to the controller, that random noise will be having a big effect if processed by simple controller, so the QuadRotor cannot steady in one of desired altitude. For that reason, this paper proposes the method to reducing the effect of random noise of MS 5611 - 01 BA 03 outputs for altitude stabilization using a complex controller Type 2 Fuzzy. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} work {{presents the}} study of fall detection using inertial and <b>barometric</b> pressure <b>sensors.</b> Technological advances {{have made it possible}} to develop inertial sensors of very small size that allow, among other things, to monitor human movement, and in this case, more specifically, detect falls. These sensors are used in so-called inertial measuring units, which are small devices that are placed on a specific part of the body and are able to measure motion. The thesis focuses on reducing the number of false positives generated with this type of systems by adding an extra measurement component, height, to the inertial system to detect falls, using a <b>barometric</b> pressure <b>sensor.</b> A number of steps have been taken to achieve this goal. First of all, a <b>barometric</b> pressure <b>sensor</b> has been chosen from the current sensors on the market. This sensor has been chosen by performing a series of tests to determine the best sensor among 3 possible candidates. Once selected, the sensor configuration parameters have been optimized for our task. Secondly, a heterogeneous database of 14 volunteers of different heights, ages and sexes has been compiled using the inertial measurement unit and the <b>barometric</b> pressure <b>sensor.</b> Thirdly, signal processing techniques and methods of extracting features have been applied to the database to obtain 4 different sets of data that include signals obtained by combining inertial measurements with barometric and signals obtained only from inertial measurements, to then make a comparison between the two and see if better results are obtained by combining the different sensors. Finally, 5 supervised learning algorithms have been trained with the data obtained.

40|$|The {{altitude}} of a moving vehicle {{as reported by}} GPS suffers from intermittent errors caused by temporary obstruction of the satellites by buildings, mountains, etc. Additionally, it is affected by systematic errors caused by multipath effects, ionospheric and tropospheric effects, and other hardware design limitations and natural factors. Atmospheric pressure, measured by a portable <b>barometric</b> <b>sensor,</b> {{could also be used}} to determine altitude, is not susceptible to problems caused by obstruction of satellites, and can provide reliable measurements outdoors even in urban and mountainous regions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which improves accuracy and provides tighter confidence bounds of altitude measurements from a mobile phone (or any device equipped with GPS and barometric sensors) by means of sensor fusion techniques without the need for calibration.

40|$|For {{surgeons}} performing open procedures, {{the sense}} of touch is a valuable tool to directly access buried structures and organs, to identify their margins, detect tumors, and prevent undesired cuts. Minimally invasive surgical procedures provide great benefits for patients; however, they hinder the surgeon's ability to directly manipulate the tissue. In our previous work, we developed a Wireless Palpation Probe (WPP) to restore tissue palpation in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) by creating a real-time stiffness distribution map of the target tissue.

Benchtop trials showed that this method can effectively reduce error in sensor pressure measurements up to 5 % with respect to the reference sensor.

40|$|Dust devils {{are likely}} the {{dominant}} source of dust for the martian atmosphere, {{but the amount}} and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the statistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust devils exhibit pressure perturbations and, if they pass near a <b>barometric</b> <b>sensor,</b> they may register as a discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several surveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil structures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such surveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil properties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with the widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be distorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such surveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure time series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series cannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical and geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of the duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a distribution of likely translation velocities, and {{the recovery of the}} underlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a scheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey using data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil occurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our results to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five low-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.

40|$|In {{the age of}} {{information}} the ability to navigate persons and equipment has become increasingly important. A rising number of applications and services depend on the precise positioning that is provided by global satellite positioning systems such as the GPS. However, most people using satellite-based positioning services {{are living in the}} most challenging surroundings for the satellite positioning systems - densely populated cities. Fundamentally, satellite navigation is based on distance measurements from the receiver to satellite vehicles in orbit of the Earth. The receiver determines its location - latitude, longitude, and elevation - and the system time using the satellite positioning system. The determined location is only an estimate: residual errors induce inaccuracies to the determination process. At worst, the receiver {{may not be able to}} determine its position if not enough signals could be acquired. The performance of the receiver could be greatly improved if one or more of the geographic coordinates or the precise time could be obtained from another source with smaller error. One such source is Earth's atmospheric pressure which is relative to the altitude and from which a receiver can deduce its altitude if a reference pressure level is known. To address the problem of unavailability and inaccuracy of positioning in urban environment, a barometric assistance service was designed and a respective software application was implemented. The implemented assistance service generates continuously time and location-dependent reference pressure data from high resolution weather forecasts that are calculated by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Receivers with the <b>barometric</b> <b>sensor</b> can download the assistance data from the service and utilize it to determine the current barometric altitude consistently and more accurately than a conventional receiver.

Flight tests {{are an important part of}} the process of developing new types of the aircraft. According to the results, the accuracy of the selected parameters of the aircraft and the congruence of the real machine parameters to the mathematical model calculation were checked. To verify the flight characteristics of the results of the tests it was necessary to obtain the true values of flight parameters, but their measurement was complicated by the presence of errors and other factors that affect to results. In this article the method of processing the objective data was considered to determine the aerodynamic flight characteristics of the aircraft, the magnitude of errors of onboard measuring devices, the direction and the speed of the wind at the altitude. The barometric altitude and speed sensors and GPS sensor were used for noting the flight parameters. The accuracy of data sensors was unknown. The barometric altimeter data and GPS altitude were compared and analyzed to determine the true altitude. Despite the specific of characteristics of GPS sensor, some data were excluded from proceedings. The schedule of the difference between barometric and GPS altitude depending on the barometric relative altitude was constructed and totally analyzed. From these data specifying factor to determine the true relative altitude according to <b>barometric</b> <b>sensor</b> was derived. The next step was to define the true speed. This analysis was consisted on the dependence of the difference between the barometric and GPS speed according to the course of flight. The schedule had the sinusoidal dependence. Midline shift corresponded the accuracy level of the barometric speed sensor. The dimension of half amplitude of the schedule corresponded to the force of wind and the position of the largest difference corresponded to the rate of wind. Therefore, using this schedule the direction and the speed of the wind and accuracy of barometric airspeed sensor were quickly determined. In real example there were defined the true flight options and derived qualifying ratios.

40|$|What {{country was}} {{responsible}} {{for much of the}} early work in laser altimetry, who was the first scientist to look at a vegetation profile generated by a laser, who first related laser ranges to forest structure? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to look back 3 + decades ago when forestry lidar was in its formative years and to give credit to those who first thought to employ a laser to measure the Earth's surface. As with much scientific research, advances were often made independently and concurrently in a number of countries. Functioning lasers were first demonstrated in 1960 in the USA and in 1961 in the USSR, but research into the use of lasers as forest measurement tools did not begin for another IS years. Initially, with respect to Earth resources, lasers were employed to measure sea ice surface roughness, to make near-shore bathymetric measurements, to penetrate forests to make detailed topographic measurements, and to fluoresce oceanic phytoplankton for surface current studies. Some of these early studies noted that forest profiles were evident but in fact added noise to topographic retrievals. Trees became the signal rather than noise in 1976 when researchers in the Canadian Forest Service went to an IUFRO conference in Oslo and reported on efforts to better estimate timber volume in tropical forests. They employed large-scale airphotos (1 : 500 up to 1 : 4000) to measure the top of the tropical canopy, an avionic radar to measure the location of the ground beneath the canopy, and a <b>barometric</b> <b>sensor</b> to record aircraft/radar height above a datum (e. g., sea level). Their radar did not work well in dense vegetation and mentioned in passing that a laser altimeter had worked well in Canadian forests. But in a report 2 years later they reported that, on a study area in Costa Rica, the radar ground line was much improved and no mention is made of a lidar altimeter. In the USSR in 1977, Russian researchers felled a birch and a spruce, aimed a helium-neon, 0. 63 micron laser with a spot size of approx 25 mm, at the horizontal trees, produced a profilograph, compared it to tape measurements, and concluded that, with increased power, such a laser could be mounted on an aircraft to remotely measure forest canopies. In 1979, they mounted their He-Ne laser on an AN- 2 biplane and acquired their fIrSt airborne profiles. Scientists with TRANARG, a mapping/surveying company in Caracas, Venezuela, reported on 1976 flights employing a helium-neon lidar to collect over 11, 000 km of lidar profiles spaced 1. 5 km apart in order to construct a topographic map to help site a new reservoir. They noted 35 - 40 m median canopy heights with emergents up to 55 m in their profiles.
