Due to the lack of information in the literature, the aim {{of this study was to}} develop a cost effective procedure for the synthesis of <b>basic</b> magnesium <b>carbonate</b> from Mg(OH) 2, not hampered by the above mentioned drawbacks. Following an extensive investigation into various parameters that influenced the final product, a simple procedure, based on sparging CO 2 through a slurry of magnesium hydroxide in water until the pH reached 7. 5 - 8. 5, was developed. The solid portion of the slurry is dried at 80 or 120 °C to deliver an unidentified <b>basic</b> magnesium <b>carbonate</b> and hydromagnesite respectively. The products were characterised by XRD, TG-DTA, surface area determination, SEM and FT-IR. The rehydration characteristics of the products were also investigated. By combining the information obtained by each technique, valuable information could be obtained. The synthesised products were evaluated for flame retardant application, due to the demand of mineral flame retardants which could compete with Mg(OH) 2 and AI(OH) 3. Compared to the traditionally used halogenated flame retardants, the mineral flame retardants deliver non-toxic, non-corrosive decomposition products and contributes in suppressing the emission of smoke in a fire.

40|$|Lead oxide is {{a general}} term and can be either lead {{monoxide}} or "litharge " (PbO); lead tetroxide or "red lead " (Pb 3 O 4); or black or "gray " oxide which {{is a mixture of}} 70 percent lead monoxide and 30 percent metallic lead. Black lead is made for specific use in the manufacture of lead acid storage batteries. Because {{of the size of the}} lead acid battery industry, lead monoxide is the most important commercial compound of lead, based on volume. Total oxide production in 1989 was 57, 984 megagrams (64, 000 tons). Litharge is used primarily in the manufacture of various ceramic products. Because of its electrical and electronic properties, litharge is also used in capacitors, Vidicon ® tubes, and electrophotographic plates, as well as in ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials. It is also used as an activator in rubber, a curing agent in elastomers, a sulfur removal agent in the production of thioles and in oil refining, and an oxidation catalyst in several organic chemical processes. It also has important markets in the production of many lead chemicals, dry colors, soaps (i. e., lead stearate), and driers for paint. Another important use of litharge is the production of lead salts, particularly those used as stabilizers for plastics, notably polyvinyl chloride materials. The major lead pigment is red lead (Pb 3 O 4), which is used principally in ferrous metal protective paints. Other lead pigments include white lead and lead chromates. There are several commercial varieties of white lead including leaded zinc oxide, <b>basic</b> <b>carbonate</b> white lead, basic sulfate white lead, and basic lead silicates. Of these, the most important is leaded zinc oxide, which is used almost entirely as white pigment for exterior oil-based paints. 12. 16. 2 Process Description 8 Black oxide is usually produced by a Barton Pot process. <b>Basic</b> <b>carbonate</b> white lead production is based on the reaction of litharge with acetic acid or acetate ions. This product, when reacted with carbon dioxide, will form lead carbonate. White leads (other than carbonates) are made either by chemical, fuming, or mechanical blending processes.

Its deeper colour is obtained by coarse grinding, and as a consequence of having relatively low refractive index, it shows better performances in tempera than in oil [50, 126]. Due to its chemical composition, malachite is subject to interactions with acids, bases, humidity, temperature and circulating ions. In presence of humidity, malachite stains can be observed, which are actually caused by proteinaceous binders degradation [64].
