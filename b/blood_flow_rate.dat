The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart.

The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Conventional extracorporeal CO 2 removal systems require <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of 1 to 2. 5 L/min in the extracorporeal circuit. We {{hypothesized}} that standard hemofiltration equipment {{can be combined}} with a high-performance extracorporeal lung to achieve high rates of CO 2 removal at lower <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> To test this hypothesis, we performed experiments on nine sheep to examine {{the extent to which}} CO 2 elimination can be achieved at <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> less than 600 mL/min using a 5 -m 2 hollow fiber membrane lung with countercurrent gas flow, combined with a hemofiltration blood pump, and connected to femoral arterial and venous hemodialysis catheters. RESULTS: CO 2 eliminations of 130 to 180 mL/min at standard temperature and pressure were achieved with <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in the range 470 to 600 mL/min. With a pumpless artery-to-vein shunt, up to 90 mL/min of CO 2 at standard temperature and pressure was eliminated. However, in this mode, the resistance of the access catheters and tubing was the main factor limiting CO 2 elimination. CONCLUSIONS: Standard hemofiltration equipment may be combined with a hollow fiber membrane lung to remove the equivalent of a high proportion of the basal metabolic CO 2 production of an adult human at low <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Use of this technology would bring extracorporeal CO 2 removal within the budget and capability of more ICUs...|$|R

In addition, the current study adds to these findings as it has shown that an increase of the surface area of the membrane lung is not sufficient to compensate for impaired CO 2 elimination when low <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> are maintained.

50|$|Contrast-enhanced {{ultrasound}} (CEUS) is {{the application}} of ultrasound contrast medium to traditional medical sonography. Ultrasound contrast agents rely on the {{different ways in which}} sound waves are reflected from interfaces between substances. This may be the surface of a small air bubble or a more complex structure. Commercially available contrast media are gas-filled microbubbles that are administered intravenously to the systemic circulation. Microbubbles have a high degree of echogenicity (the ability of an object to reflect ultrasound waves). There is a great difference in echogenicity between the gas in the microbubbles and the soft tissue surroundings of the body. Thus, ultrasonic imaging using microbubble contrast agents enhances the ultrasound backscatter, (reflection) of the ultrasound waves, to produce a sonogram with increased contrast due to the high echogenicity difference. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be used to image blood perfusion in organs, measure <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> in the heart and other organs, and for other applications.|$|E

This improved efficiency may {{reflect the fact that}} most CO 2 is transported as bicarbonate ions (> 90 %), and the greater effectiveness of bicarbonate dialysate is due to bicarbonate rather than dissolved CO 2 being targeted for removal. During ECCO 2 R using hollow fiber membranes, the CO 2 held as bicarbonate must be converted to dissolved CO 2 before it can be removed. This conversion limiting CO 2 removal rates was demonstrated in a study using hollow fibers immobilized with carbonic anhydrase, to catalyze the conversion of bicarbonate to dissolved CO 2, resulting in a 37 % enhancement of the CO 2 removal rate [27, 28]. Respiratory hemodialysis, by directly removing bicarbonate, is not limited by the conversion of bicarbonate to dissolved CO 2 permitting lower <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> yet still able to attain therapeutic results.|$|R

Added to this pressure is that required to move the blood through the circulatory system. It was pointed out in 1976 that, because of their height, many dinosaurs had minimum blood pressures within the endothermic range, and that they must have had four-chambered hearts to separate the high pressure circuit to the body from the low pressure circuit to the lungs. It was not clear whether these dinosaurs had high blood pressure simply to support the blood column or to support the high blood flow rates required by endothermy or both.However, recent analysis of the tiny holes in fossil leg bones of dinosaurs provides a gauge for <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and hence metabolic rate.
