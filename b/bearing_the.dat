40|$|In {{order to}} improve the radial load {{capacity}} and wear loss of <b>the</b> PPS-PTFE hybrid <b>bearings,</b> <b>the</b> groove shape of the PPS inner ring in <b>the</b> PPS-PTFE hybrid <b>bearing</b> was designed based on ceramic bearing’s ball radius (r). The rolling contact fatigue tests were performed by using <b>the</b> PPS-PTFE hybrid <b>bearings</b> with <b>the</b> original (r* 1. 0) and modified (r* 1. 1) inner rings. The radial load capacity of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> using <b>the</b> rl. 1 inner ring was improved 150 % over the capacity of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> using <b>the</b> r 1. 0 inner ring. While the operation temperature of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> with <b>the</b> r 1. 1 inner ring was stable at 40 °C, that of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> with <b>the</b> r 1. 0 inner ring incresed rapidly over 100 °C and thermal failure occurred. Moreover, the wear loss of <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> with <b>the</b> r 1. 1 inner ring was {{lower than that of}} the r 1. 0. Thus the groove shape influenced the tribology performance of <b>the</b> PPS-PTFE hybrid <b>bearings...</b>|$|R

As the gap thickness increased, the gap pressure, the load carrying capacity and the stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> decreased. <b>The</b> more the porous inserts, the higher the gap pressure and the load carrying capacity, but <b>the</b> less <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> stiffness would be...|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> properties of <b>the</b> differently oriented glulam using digital image correlation (DIC).

50|$|Two {{bearings}} {{are used}} per wheel. <b>The</b> <b>bearings</b> slip into openings molded into {{each side of}} the wheel hub, and a flange molded into the wheel hub holds <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> <b>the</b> correct distance apart.

Since the outer race of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> contacts <b>the</b> wheel spacer and the inner race of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> contacts <b>the</b> axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>bearing</b> {{chamber of}} an {{aeroengine}} houses roller bearings and other structural parts. The spatial limitation, high operational speeds of the HP shaft and the {{proximity to the}} combustion chamber can make the operating conditions of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber challenging. A roller bearing consists of an inner race, an outer race and a cage constraining a number of rolling elements. In the aeroengine application, oil is introduced into <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber via <b>the</b> inner race regions of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> into <b>the</b> rolling elements interstices. This provides lubrication for <b>the</b> roller <b>bearings.</b> <b>The</b> source of heat in <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber is mainly from rolling contact friction and the high temperature of combustion. Cooling results from the oil transport within <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber and thus an efficient transport of oil is critical to maintaining {{the integrity of the}} entire structure. <b>The</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber contains <b>the</b> oil which is eventually scavenged and recycled for recirculation. Experiments have been conducted over <b>the</b> years on <b>bearing</b> chamber flows but often simplified to create the best emulation of the real aeroengine. The complexity of <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber structure is also challenging for experimental measurements of the oil characteristic in <b>the</b> roller <b>bearing</b> elements and <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber compartment. Previous experiments have shown that the oil continuum breaks up in <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber compartment but it is not quantitatively clear how and what parameters affect these.
