The levels of inclusion of the benzoic acid was based on treatment 1 (control) 0 %, treatment 2 = 0. 4 % and treatment 3 = 0. 8 %. Results showed that, feeding benzoic acid to broilers had no significant on body weight, weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion at the two tested levels.

40|$|The {{intoxication}} which develops as {{the result}} of a simple obstruction or a closed intestinal loop is accompanied by definite changes in the coagulable proteins of the blood serum. These changes consist essentially in an alteration in the normal albumin-globulin ratio; the globulin fraction is greatly increased and at times the normal relation of the two fractions may show a complete inversion. The increase in the globulin content of the blood serum is most marked in the animals which show some of the complications met with in loop animals,—rupture of the loop and peritonitis. In the latter conditions especially, the globulin increase is rapid and large. We believe this reaction to be of diagnostic value in acute infections attended by the sudden liberation and absorption of a toxic exudate. Infections and intoxications produced by inflammatory irritants are also accompanied by a rise in the <b>blood</b> <b>globulins.</b> This observation suggests that tissue disintegration with absorption of toxic products is responsible for the changes noted, and that bacterial invasion is important only in as far as it gives rise to toxic substances. Animals which have developed a tolerance to proteose intoxication following the periodic injection of small doses of proteose do not show a globulin increase. These experiments do not support the view that the rise in globulins observed in these experimental conditions is an expression of a resistance or tolerance developed by the animal. From the experimental evidence it seems more probable that the alteration in the partition of the blood protein fractions is one of the results of the metabolic disturbance which has been shown to occur in these conditions...|$|R

40|$|From {{the time}} of the early Greek {{physicians}} many observers noted a relationship between the sedimentation rate of the red cells and the concen-tration of fibrinogen or " phlegma " in the blood. However, no detailed studies were made until 1918 when Fahraeus (5) studied the sedimentation rate in pregnancy and concluded that the increase in the rate was due to a lowering of the electric charge on the red cells. Since that time interest in the subject has been renewed. Numerous in-vestigators have studied the variations in sedi-mentation rate that occur in disease and a few workers have attempted to determine also the fac-tors underlying these variations. As a result of these investigations of the past twenty years, the sedimentation rate has become of definite clinical value, but there is no general agreement as to the factors involved in the aggregation and sedimen-tation of the red cells. The majority of investigators have corroborated the long-standing impression that there is a sug-gestive relationship between the concentration of fibrinogen and the sedimentation rate. In fact, despite occasional marked exceptions to an exact linear relationship between the fibrinogen and the sedimentation rate, the majority of recent workers have concluded that the concentration of fibrinogen determines the sedimentation rate (1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16).

Presence of parasite association among ticks, haemosporidea and Borrelia within the bird-host was also tested. We found that infestation by ticks significantly increased heterophyl/lymphocyte ratio in Turdus merula suggesting increased stress.

We showed that ticks have detrimental effects on their avian hosts even under natural infestation conditions and that confirmed Borrelia reservoir hosts may also present symptoms of infection, though these may be subtle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInvasive {{adenovirus}} (AdV) {{disease is}} fatal in > 50 % of allogeneic {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant (SCT) recipients. Treatment with cidofovir may improve outcomes based on in vitro susceptibility data and case reports. Six consecutive cases of invasive AdV disease treated with cidofovir were reviewed among 84 allogeneic adult SCT recipients (incidence, 7. 1 %). Cidofovir was administered intravenously at 5 mg/kg per dose (1 - 7 doses). All patients received intravenous immune <b>globulin.</b> <b>Blood</b> AdV DNA levels (viral loads, VLs) were monitored with a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Published reports of cidofovir treatment of AdV disease in SCT recipients were critically reviewed. The primary manifestations of AdV disease were hepatitis (n = 3), colitis (n = 2), and nephritis (n = 1). All patients had detectable AdV VLs, with peak values from 5 × 105 to 2 × 108 copies/mL. All patients received CD 34 + selected grafts (n = 3) and/or had graft-versus-host disease (n = 4) and had CD 4 counts < 100 cells/mm 3. Only 1 of 5 patients (20 %) who received ≥ 2 doses of cidofovir died with active AdV disease. Four patients exhibited improvement within days of treatment with cidofovir as documented by clinical criteria and declines in AdV VLs (without a change in immunosuppression). In contrast, 1 patient treated late after onset of AdV disease died after 1 dose of cidofovir. In our review of 70 published cases treated with ≥ 2 doses of cidofovir, 13 (19 %) died from AdV disease. In conclusion, early treatment of AdV disease with cidofovir inhibits viral replication in vivo and reduces mortality in allogeneic SCT recipients compared with historical data...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{when many}} parents seem {{reluctant}} {{to have their}} children vaccinated, even with long proven medications, the Salk vaccine trial, which enrolled millions of healthy children to test an unproven medical intervention, seems nothing short of astonishing. In Selling Science, medical historian Stephen E. Mawdsley recounts the untold story of the first large clinical trial to control polio using healthy children— 55, 000 healthy children—revealing how this long-forgotten incident cleared the path for Salk’s later trial. Mawdsley describes how, in the early 1950 s, Dr. William Hammon and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis launched a pioneering medical experiment on a previously untried scale. Conducted on over 55, 000 healthy children in Texas, Utah, Iowa, and Nebraska, this landmark study assessed the safety and effectiveness of a <b>blood</b> component, gamma <b>globulin,</b> to prevent paralytic polio. The value of the proposed experiment was questioned by many prominent health professionals as it harbored potential health risks, but as Mawdsley points out, compromise and coercion moved it forward. And though the trial returned dubious results, it {{was presented to the}} public as a triumph and used to justify a federally sanctioned mass immunization study on thousands of families between 1953 and 1954. Indeed, the concept, conduct, and outcome of the GG study were sold to health professionals, medical researchers, and the public at each stage. At a time when most Americans trusted scientists, their mutual encounter under the auspices of conquering disease was shaped by politics, marketing, and at times, deception. Drawing on oral history interviews, medical journals, newspapers, meeting minutes, and private institutional records, Selling Science sheds light on the ethics of scientific conduct, and on the power of marketing to shape public opinion about medical experimentation...|$|R
40|$|Trichloroacetonitrile {{is used as}} an {{intermediate}} in insecticides, pesticides, and dyes. In Korea alone, over 10 tons are used annually. Its oral and dermal toxicity is classified as category 3 according to the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals, and it is designated a toxic substance by the Ministry of Environment in Korea. There are no available inhalation toxicity data on trichloroacetoni-trile. Thus, the present study performed inhalation tests to provide data for hazard and risk assessments. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to trichloroacetonitrile at concentrations of 4, 16, or 64 ppm for 6 hour per day 5 days per week for 13 weeks in a repeated study. As a result, salivation, shortness of breath, and wheezing were observed, and their body weights decreased significantly (p < 0. 05) in the 16 and 64 ppm groups. All the rats in 64 ppm group were dead or moribund within 4 weeks of the exposure. Some signifi-cant changes were observed in blood hematology and serum biochemistry (e. g., prothrombin time, ratio of albumin and <b>globulin,</b> <b>blood</b> urea nitrogen, and triglycerides), but the values were within normal physio-logical ranges. The major target organs of trichloroacetonitrile were the nasal cavity, trachea, and lungs. The rats exposed to 16 ppm showed moderate histopathological changes in the transitional epithelium and olfactory epithelium of the nasal cavity. Nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and respiratory epithe-lium were also changed. Respiratory lesions were common in the dead rats that {{had been exposed to}} the 64 ppm concentration. The dead animals also showed loss of cilia in the trachea, pneumonitis in the lung, and epithelial hyperplasia in the bronchi and bronchioles. In conclusion, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was estimated to be 4 ppm. The main target organs of trichloroacetonitrile were the nasal cavity, trachea, and lungs...|$|R
40|$|Objective] Ba-Duan-Jin, {{formed in}} the 12 th century, is an {{excellent}} traditional Chinese health exercises. Ancients likened it to “brocade (Jin) ”, meaning its action is as elegant as brocade. The total movements are divided into 8 sections, so it is called “ Ba-Duan-Jin (8 -section-action) ”. Because of its simple action and significantly healthy effect, Ba-Duan-Jin is widely used to enhance physical fitness and prevent diseases. This study was aimed to evaluate the immunological effect of Ba-Duan-Jin in ageing people and analyze its autonomic nervous mechanism. [Methods] 60 healthy women (64. 06 ± 2. 53 years old) were divided into exercising group and sedentary group. Exercising group trained Ba-Duan-Jin 12 weeks（ 5 day/week, 3 repetition/day）. Record electrocardiosignal to analyze heart rate variability (HRV), and then take blood sample to measure <b>blood</b> routine, immune <b>globulin,</b> complement, sub-T lymphocyte, catecholamines and acetylcholine. These measurements were performed {{before and after the}} 8 -week’s intervening duration. [Results] The plasma immune globulin, complement, catecholamines and acetylcholine have no significant difference between two groups. But when it came to lymphocyte in peripheral blood, the women in exercising group have less CD 8 + T-lymphocyte and higher rate of CD 4 +/CD 8 + than sedentary group. The analysis of HRV showed an increasing total HRV (TF), a enhanced activity of parasympathetic nerve (RRmean, SDNN, RMSSD, HFnorm) and an attenuated activity of sympathetic nerve (LFnorm) in Ba-Duan-Jin exercising group. Correlation analysis confirmed that there is a close relationship between immune function and autonomic nervous activities. [Conclusion] Ba-Duan-Jin can transfer the autonomic nervous balance to parasympathetic dominance, which may partially explain the increasing immunity function (especially in cell immunity) in ageing people.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of xylazine alone (0. 05 mg/kg), lignocaine alone (2. 0 mg/kg) and a combination of xylazine and lignocaine (0. 05 mg/kg and 2. 0 mg/kg, respectively) after lumbar epidural administration in water buffalo calves. Fifteen nondescript, male water buffalo calves of 6 - 8 months of age and weighing between 55 and 75 kg were randomly placed in 3 groups (A, B and C). The agents were administered at the 1 st lumbar epidural space. Clinico-physiological parameters such as analgesia, ataxia, sedation, salivation, heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature were studied. Other haematological and biochemical parameters monitored were haemoglobin, packed cell volume, total leukocyte count, plasma glucose, cortisol, protein albumin, <b>globulin,</b> <b>blood</b> urea nitrogen, creatinine, ALT, sodium, potassium and chloride. The onset of analgesia was faster in groupC(3. 0 + 0. 44 min) compared with that of group B (4. 4 + 0. 40 min) and group A (34. 0 + 1. 86 min). Analgesia of the thorax, flank, inguinal region, hind limbs, perineum and tail was complete in group C, but mild to moderate in groupsAand B. Ataxia was severe in groups B and C and mild in group A. Mild to deep sedation were produced by groups A and C animals. Longer duration and greater depth of analgesia was produced in animals in group C. Heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature decreased in groups A and C. The haematological parameters decreased in all the groups. The biochemical parameters like glucose, cortisol, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, ALTincreased in all the animals. However, total proteins and albumin decreased in the 3 groups. The plasma electrolytes sodium, potassium and chloride did not show any significant change. The results of this study indicated a possible additive analgesic interaction between epidurally administered xylazine and lignocaine, without causing any marked systemic effects in water buffalo calves...|$|R
