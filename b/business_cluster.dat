40|$|Abstract. This paper reports {{preliminary}} {{results from a}} study that examines factors influencing knowledge sharing among members of <b>business</b> <b>clusters</b> based in Wellington, New Zealand. <b>Business</b> <b>clusters</b> are local concentrations of competitive firms in related industries that do business with each other. Earthquake Engineering, Creative Capital, Natural Hazards, Optics and Software are examples of clusters studied in this paper. However, some of the companies in many <b>business</b> <b>clusters</b> are direct competitors in the local arena and they are often expected to co-operate and share business knowledge with each other when they are considering bidding for international projects or contracts. This knowledge may be considered to have provided each company with a competitive advantage. Therefore, trying to successfully operate in this mixed environment of “co-operation ” and “competition” can pose a dilemma for many members of <b>business</b> <b>clusters.</b> For this study, a three-stage data collection strategy was used: a focus group, online voting exercise and individual interviews. Representatives from seven <b>business</b> <b>clusters</b> in the Wellington region took part in this study. Analysis of the data revealed that several factors do influence knowledge sharing in <b>business</b> <b>clusters,</b> such as: sharing a common understanding {{and commitment to the}} cluster idea; initial respect and trust between cluster members; and having strong, charismatic cluster champions/leaders. These factors will be explored and the implications for practice and research will also be discussed.

40|$|<b>Business</b> <b>Clusters</b> became {{foreground}} {{of economic}} {{thought in the}} 90 s due to Michael Porter’s research work, who argued that the most successful export companies belong to group of enterprises of the same industry that are geographically close to one another. This issue became even more acute because of the globalisation {{of the economy and}} the need to plan and implement policies aiming mainly at strengthening the competitiveness of small and medium sized enterprises. Tourism, as an economic activity, includes a wide range of small and medium enterprises engaging in various sectors of it. It is argued that <b>business</b> <b>clusters</b> within the field of tourism economics define de facto the competitiveness of a tourist destination. <b>Business</b> <b>clusters</b> of small and medium enterprises which operate in a tourism destination are a prerequisite contributing to its competitiveness.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{characterize}} the process of knowledge management in <b>business</b> <b>clusters</b> in terms of the benefi ts for the cluster members. The paper examines which mechanisms within the clusters promote knowledge creation between companies and other institutions. Methodology: The literature review is based on databases of books and scientifi c articles, such as EBSCO, Else- vier, JSTOR, Springer, and the Oxford Library and Kingston University London Library. The analysis of the lite- rature is focused around the concepts of <b>business</b> <b>clusters,</b> knowledge management in organizations, knowledge management in clusters. Findings: The literature presented in this paper shows that network forms of organization such as clusters are conducive to inter-fi rm knowledge and skill development. Clusters as a type of network turn out to be a highly structured model of knowledge development, transfer and diffusion, produced by the interaction of social and economic relations within cluster institutions. Research implications: The article constitutes a combination of two theoretical aspects – knowledge manage- ment and <b>business</b> <b>clusters.</b> The theoretical conclusions of the literature review, mostly foreign literature, pro- vide a basis for research in that area. Practical implications: In the Polish literature on the subject the aspect of knowledge management in <b>business</b> <b>clusters</b> has not yet been discussed. The conclusions of the presented literature analysis provide a basis for research and the development of practical recommendations for cluster managers. Knowledge-based clusters can serve as an example for developing clusters in the world. They are often clustered around research centers, making it possible to improve the exchange of knowledge between the cluster members and also providing the opportunity to better connect the world of science and business. Originality: The author has presented a unique mix of theory, knowledge management and <b>business</b> <b>clusters</b> and has demonstrated that one of the benefi ts of <b>business</b> <b>clusters</b> is their ability to generate knowledge by combining existing information and data from internal databases of <b>businesses</b> within <b>clusters</b> with the infl ux of new infor- mation. Formal contacts between the employees of the cooperating institutions provide general knowledge and best practices based on collective knowledge. While informal contacts are important channels for the transfer of tacit knowledge, the so-called operational know-how. Małgorzata Bara...|$|R
