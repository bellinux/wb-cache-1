In contrast, when <b>bisecting</b> <b>lines</b> under tactile-proprioceptive guidance, subjects err towards near peripersonal space, suggesting that normally attention is preferentially distributed {{away from the}} body during visual exploration but distributed towards the body during tactile exploration. A patient with ischaemic lesions, however, involving both inferior temporal lobes neglected far peripersonal and upper vertical space. He also demonstrated a motor bias away from the neglected space. These findings suggest that in man attention is spatially directed in three orthogonal axes (horizontal, vertical and radial), that attention may normally be unequally distributed in each of these axes, and that neglect may occur in not only the horizontal axis but also in the radial and vertical axes...|$|R

50|$|The dispute {{primarily}} concerned an area at sea between the parallel that crosses the end {{point of the}} land border between Chile and Peru, and the <b>bisecting</b> <b>line</b> perpendicular to the coasts of Chile and Peru. This line was formed by the overlapping of the baselines of both countries, forming a trapezoid of 67139.4 km2. Peru requested an equitable division of the maritime territory, but Chile demanded sovereignty over approximately 38000 km2 of the territory.

5000|$|Also {{called an}} apex, corner fences {{are in a}} {{triangular}} shape with the horse jumping over {{one corner of the}} triangle. They are similar to the [...] "fan" [...] jump seen in show-jumping. As the name suggests, the fence makes a [...] "V" [...] shape, that can have an angle up to 90 degrees. At novice levels, the fence is formed by two angled fences, open in the center while more advanced designs have a solid triangular cover. The corner is meant to be jumped on a line perpendicular to an imaginary <b>bisecting</b> <b>line</b> of the angle, and as close to the narrow apex as possible while still far enough in on the jump that the horse knows he is supposed to go over it. If the rider aims too far toward the wider section of the obstacle, it may be too wide for the horse to clear it. This usually results in a stop or run out, although some of the braver horses might [...] "bank" [...] a solid corner fence (touching down on it before quickly jumping off). This is not desirable, as the horse is more likely to slip, catch a leg, or fall. If the rider aims too far toward the apex, it is very easy for the horse to run right past, especially if is unsure as to whether he is to jump the obstacle. Due to their relative difficulty, the corner is not seen at the lowest levels. The corner is a precision fence, requiring accurate riding and good training, with the horse straight and between the rider's aids. Due to the build of the fence, an uncommitted horse and rider pair may have a run-out at this type of obstacle. It is best that the rider use their aids to [...] "block" [...] the horse from running out to the side, with a strong contact to prevent the shoulders from popping, and a supporting leg.|$|E
40|$|Neglect {{patients}} <b>bisect</b> <b>lines</b> far rightward {{of center}} whereas normal subjects typically <b>bisect</b> <b>lines</b> {{with a slight}} leftward bias supporting a right hemisphere bias for attention allocation. We used fMRI to assess the brain regions related to this function in normals, using two complementary tasks. In the Landmark task subjects were required to judge {{whether or not a}} presented <b>line</b> was <b>bisected</b> correctly. During the line bisection task, subjects moved a cursor and indicated when it reached the center of the line. The conjunction of BOLD activity for both tasks showed right lateralized intraparietal sulcus and lateral peristriate cortex activity. The results provide evidence that predominantly right hemisphere lateralized processes are engaged in normal subjects during tasks that are failed in patients with unilateral neglect and highlight the importance of a right fronto-parietal network in attention allocation...|$|R

For both negative binomial regression models, the randomized quantile residuals lay on the <b>bisecting</b> <b>line,</b> indicating that they follow approximately a standard normal distribution, and hence they represent an almost optimal fit to the data. The distribution of quantile residuals of model 8.5 was caused only marginally by the linear approximations adopted (Eq.  8.51). The qqplots for the Poisson and zero-inflated regression models displayed major deviations from the <b>bisecting</b> <b>line.</b> Hence, neither the assumption that larva density follows a Poisson distribution nor the assumption that larva density follows a zero-inflated distribution could be validated in this case.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To clarify how the {{disconnected}} hemispheres {{perceive a}} <b>line</b> and <b>bisect</b> it with successful or unsuccessful integration of spatial attention.  METHODS—Eye movements were recorded {{when a patient}} with an extensive callosa infarction <b>bisected</b> horizontal <b>lines.</b> The lesion extended into the left cingulate gyrus.  RESULTS—When the patient <b>bisected</b> <b>lines</b> with the right hand, the gaze was initially directed rightward and shifted further {{to the right side}} with the execution of manual response, which resulted in rightward errors. Shortly after bisection, rapid ocular searches occurred to the left side, whereas the rightward errors did not decrease throughout the trials. When using the left hand, there was no deviation of the gaze before presentation of lines. In the first few trials, the patient <b>bisected</b> the <b>line</b> with a leftward error and then searched rapidly to the right side. The subsequent bisections were almost accurate, as the subjective midpoint was placed near the point of the initial fixation that fell around the true centre. Ocular searching was mostly absent during and after line bisection.  CONCLUSIONS—In callosa disconnection, left unilateral spatial neglect may appear when use of the right hand induces a rightward bias in the attentional control of the left hemisphere and damage to its cingulate gyrus inhibits interhemispheric integration of attention. Resultant rightward errors of line bisection often cause interhemispheric conflict of attention, as the right hemisphere perceives the longer extent on the left side. By contrast, the disconnected but intact right hemisphere may <b>bisect</b> a <b>line</b> accurately by integrating attention to the extents perceived in the left and right visual fields. ...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives The line bisection error to {{the left}} of the true center has been {{interpreted}} as a relative right hemisphere activation, which might relate to the subject's emotional state. Considering that patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or treatment-resistant depression (TRD) often have negative emotions, we hypothesized that these patients would <b>bisect</b> <b>lines</b> significantly leftward. Methods We tried the line bisection task in the right-handed healthy volunteers (n = 56), GAD (n = 47) and TRD outpatients (n = 52). Subjects also completed the Zuckerman - Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire, the Zuckerman Sensation Seeking Scales, and the Plutchik-van Praag Depression Inventory. Results GAD patients scored highest on the Neuroticism-Anxiety trait, TRD patients scored highest on depression, and both patients scored lower on the Sociability trait. Patients with GAD also <b>bisected</b> <b>lines</b> significantly leftward compared to the healthy subjects. The Frequency of the bisection error was negatively correlated with Disinhibition-Seeking in the healthy subjects, and with Total sensation-seeking and Experience-Seeking in GAD patients, while the Magnitude of the line bisection error was negatively correlated with depression in TRD patients. Conclusions The study suggests a stronger right hemispheric activation, a weaker left activation, or both in the GAD, instead of TRD patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimenter}} {{is often}} required to view flows {{through a window}} with a different index of refraction than either the medium being observed or the medium that the laser anemometer is immersed in. The refraction that occurs at the window surfaces may lead to undesirable changes in probe volume position or beam crossing angle {{and can lead to}} partial or complete beam uncrossing. This report describes the results of a parametric study of this problem using a ray tracing technique to predict these changes. The windows studied were a flat plate and a simple cyclinder. For the flat-plate study: (1) surface thickness, (2) beam crossing angle, (3) <b>bisecting</b> <b>line</b> - surface normal angle, and (4) incoming beam plane surface orientation were varied. For the cylindrical window additional parameters were also varied: (1) probe volume immersion, (2) probe volume off-radial position, and (3) probe volume position out of the R-theta plane of the lens. A number of empirical correlations were deduced to aid the interested reader in determining the movement, uncrossing, and change in crossing angle for a particular situation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAnalysis of {{structural}} rift architecture {{shows that the}} graben formation is commonly controlled by the contemporaneous activity of two fault trends with an angular obliquity of approximately 408. Inspection of the crustal basement and geophysical data reveals that these faults are parallel to inherited oblique crustal and lithospheric discrete fabrics, which are reactivated during the extension event. We conducted experiments at crustal scale to determine {{the role of the}} coeval reactivation of such oblique inherited fabrics in the graben and depocentre development. Experimentally the oblique inherited lithospheric faults were simulated by a basal discrete velocity discontinuity (VD) characterised by two different angles (a) with respect to the extension direction at the intersection of the VDs. Our models show that besides the extension direction which induces the formation of linear or independent en-echelon grabens, the intersection of the two oblique VD segments controls the location of the depocentre and concentrates subsidence. For different stretching direction values, the depocentre geometry varies from strongly asymmetric to symmetric when the stretching direction corresponds to the <b>bisecting</b> <b>line</b> of the two VD segments. Applied to the Upper Rhine graben (central segment of the West European rift), our models allow interpretation of the development of the Late Eocene–Oligocene depocentres at the intersection of two main oblique inherited structures, {{as the result of a}} constant NW–SE extension direction. Concerning the southern East African rift, the graben geometries and the evolution of the subsidence during the Mio-Pliocene period may be explained by the reactivation of two main Pan-African inherited shear zones with an E–W direction of extension.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{formulate}} the offense and defense model in a tennis match by adopting mathemetical methods to locate tennis placements and the defense space. A four-phase study was designed. First, the flying algorithm was established with the application of physics theory. Next, with the use of Spline function, the algorithm for 3 D defense space of the receiver was formualted. Then two male students in a college tennis team (Age: 21 ± 1. 9 years; Height: 175. 5 ± 3. 5 cm;weight: 70. 0 ± 1. 4 Kg) were asked to move from the preparatory position to hit each of the 100 balls evenly distributed in the space. The data on each returning time were collected through the high-speed video camera (200 Hz). In the fourth phase, based on the established algorithm, a computer program was editted to simulate serving and service returning in an attempt to locate the optimal tennis placement and the best defense space. The result showed that:(1) Whether in singles or doubles, a better placement by the striker would be achieved if the service was farther away from {{the two sides of the}} receiver (V effect), (2) In singles, if the initial position of the receiver and the contact position of the striker form a disgonal line or a <b>bisecting</b> <b>line,</b> it would lead to the optimal defense space (area bisecting effect), (3) In doubles, if the contact position of the striker and the preparatory positions of two receivers formed an isosceles triangle, it would be the best defense space for the receivers (isosceles triangle effect). When the above three effects are further verified through real-life tennis matches, the designed algorithm can be used to establish an offense and defense model of multiballs; moreover, the simulation model can assist tennis players in effective training...|$|E
40|$|The {{distinction}} between near {{space and the}} space farther away has been well established, as has the relation of this distinction to arm length. Recent studies provide evidence for the plasticity of near space, showing {{that it is possible}} to expand its extent ("size") through tool-use. In the present study, we examine the converse effect, whether contraction of near space results from increasing the effort involved on a line bisection task. Adult participants <b>bisected</b> <b>lines</b> at different distances, while, in some cases, wearing weights. In Experiment 1, the arms, specifically, were weighted (wrist weights), and in Experiment 2, more general body weights were used (heavy backpack). As in previous studies, unencumbered participants showed leftward bias when <b>bisecting</b> <b>lines</b> at the closest distances and a rightward shift in bias with increasingly farther distances. With wrist weights, but not a heavy backpack, participants showed more rightward bias at the closest distances, and a more gradual rightward shift with increasing distance, as if the nearest locations were represented as being farther away. These results suggest that increased effort, when specifically related to the arm, can serve to reduce the size of near space, providing support for the generally symmetrical plasticity of near space representations...|$|R

The present study focuses on the mechanisms underlying the processing of dangerous objects. In two experiments, we adopted a paradigm that has never been employed in this context, a bisection task. The line was flanked by objects belonging to different categories. We explored the sensitivity to the distinction between neutral and dangerous objects, by measuring whether the performance was biased toward a specific object category. In Experiment 1 both teenagers and adults <b>bisected</b> <b>lines</b> flanked by dangerous and neutral graspable objects, and they misperceived the line midpoint toward the neutral graspable object or, stated differently, {{on the opposite side of}} the dangerous graspable object. In Experiment 2 adults <b>bisected</b> <b>lines</b> flanked by dangerous and neutral objects matched on graspability (both graspable and ungraspable, Experiment 2 a), or by graspable and ungraspable objects matched on dangerousness (both neutral and dangerous, Experiment 2 b). Results confirmed the finding of Experiment 1, but also indicated that participants misperceived the line midpoint toward the ungraspable object when it was presented, being it dangerous or not. This evidence demonstrated sensitivity to object dangerousness maintained across lifespan. The emergence of aversive affordances evoked by dangerous graspable objects strenghtens the importance to consider graspability in the investigation of dangerous objects.
