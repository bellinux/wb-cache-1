5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} of {{horizontal}} gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from cells with less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second concern is to what extent such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E

5|$|Candide {{contains}} thirty episodic chapters, {{which may}} <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> into two main schemes: one {{consists of two}} divisions, separated by the protagonist's hiatus in El Dorado; the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, {{the first half of}} Candide constitutes the rising action and the last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels, which tend to employ such a dramatic structure. By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I–X are set in Europe, XI–XX are set in the Americas, and XXI–XXX are set in Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.|$|E

5|$|Amanita abrupta {{was first}} {{described}} by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1897, {{based on a}} specimen he found in Auburn, Alabama. Because {{the remains of the}} volva are not present on the bulb in dried, mature, specimens, Peck thought that the species should <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> with Amanita rubescens and A.spissa. Synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers by Jean-Edouard Gilbert to Lepidella in 1928, and to Aspidella in 1940. Both of these genera have since been subsumed into Amanita.|$|E
5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
5|$|S.iniae has {{occasionally}} produced {{infection in}} humans, especially fish handlers of Asian descent.

It cannot <b>be</b> <b>grouped</b> by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococcus species. The two known serotypes can be distinguished biochemically by differences in enzyme activity. Several antibiotics {{have been used to}} treat S.iniae infections.|$|E
