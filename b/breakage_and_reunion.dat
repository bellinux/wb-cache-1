50|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} in females {{in which there is}} partial or complete loss of one X chromosome. This causes symptoms such as growth and sexual development problems. In 15% of Turner syndrome patients, the structural abnormality is isochromosome X, which is composed of two copies of the q arm (i(Xq)). A majority of i(Xq) are created by U-type strand exchange. A <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>reunion</b> in the pericentric region of the p arm results in a dicentric isochromosome. Some of the p arm can be found in this formation of i(Xq), but a majority of the genetic material on the p arm is lost so it is considered absent. Since the p-arm of the X chromosome contains genes that are necessary for normal sexual development, Turner's syndrome patients experience phenotypic effects. Alternatively, the increase in dosage of genes on the q arm may be involved in a 10-fold increase in risk of i(Xq) Turner's patients developing autoimmune thyroiditis, a disease in which the body creates antibodies to target and destroy thyroid cells.|$|E

40|$|Modeling of <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> {{coalescence}} of dispersed phases such as bubbles or droplets in multiphase {{systems is}} {{of paramount importance}} to the control of the dispersed phase size distribution in process industry. Population balance model (PBM) has become a rountine tool to simulate the <b>breakage,</b> coalescence <b>and</b> size distribuiton of dispersed phase. However, the current kernel functions for <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> coalescence in PBM are either derived from statistical models or based on some phenomenological models, empirical correlations or semi theoretical methods, since the physics of <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> coalescence in multi-phase systems is complex.

40|$|DNA double-strand-break repair (DSBR) is, in many organisms, {{accomplished}} by homologous recombination. In Escherichia coli DSBR {{was thought to}} result from <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>reunion</b> of parental DNA molecules, assisted by known endonucleases, the Holliday junction resolvases. Under special circumstances, for example, SOS induction, recombination forks were proposed to initiate replication. We provide physical evidence {{that this is a}} major alternative mechanism in which replication copies information from one chromosome to another generating recombinant chromosomes in normal cells in vivo. This alternative mechanism can occur independently of known Holliday junction cleaving proteins, requires DNA polymerase III, and produces recombined DNA molecules that carry newly replicated DNA. The replicational mechanism underlies about half the recombination of linear DNA in E. coli; the other half occurs by <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>reunion,</b> which we show requires resolvases, and is replication-independent.

The copy number of chromosome 21 sequences in the rings of these patients was determined by quantitative dosage analyses for 13 loci on 21 q. Nine of 11 r(21) s, including the 5 familial r(21) s, showed no evidence for duplication of 21 q sequences but did show molecular evidence of partial deletion of 21 q. These data {{were consistent with the}} <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>reunion</b> of short- and long-arm regions to form the r(21), resulting in deletion of varying amounts of 21 q 22. 1 to 21 qter.

Another patient, who also exhibited Down syndrome, showed evidence of a third mechanism of ring formation. The likely initial event was <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>reunion</b> of the short and long arms, resulting in a small r(21), followed by a sister-chromatid exchange resulting in a double-sized and symmetrically dicentric r(21). The phenotype of patients correlated well with the extent of deletion or duplication of chromosome 21 sequences.

40|$|During {{site-specific}} recombination by the gamma delta resolvase, four DNA strands are broken, exchanged, and religated. This exchange {{is carried out}} within a DNA-protein complex, the synaptosome, in which the recombination sites, res, are aligned. The domain of resolvase that binds to a res site is distinct from the domain that breaks and rejoins the DNA. We tested whether the catalytic domain acts on the res site to which its binding domain is bound (in cis) or on the opposing res site in the synaptic complex (in trans). We constructed a hybrid synaptosome in which one res site is bound to wild-type resolvase {{and the other is}} bound to a mutant resolvase that binds normally but is unable to break DNA. From the pattern of strand breakage in the reaction intermediate containing resolvase covalently attached to DNA, we conclude that resolvase attacks predominantly, if not exclusively, in cis. Because cis <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>reunion</b> per se cannot lead to recombination, our results support a model in which DNA exchange is guided by an exchange of resolvase subunits between the <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>reunion</b> events...|$|E

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described in}} this paper {{were part of an}} attempt to determine the mechanisms involved in the isomerization of the pseudorabies virus genome. To this end, [14 C]thymidine-labeled parental virus DNA that was transferred to progeny virions produced by cells incubated in medium containing bromodeoxy-uridine was analyzed in neutral and alkaline CsCl density gradients. The buoyant density of the 14 C-labeled DNA indicated that the parental DNA strands had retained their integrity and had not undergone <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>reunion</b> with progeny DNA strands; neither massive intermolecular nor intramolecular recombination had occurred after replication of the DNA. Whereas <b>breakage</b> <b>and</b> <b>reunion</b> between parental and progeny virus DNA strands were not detectable, these processes were observed between differentially density-labeled parental DNAs. Furthermore, the frequency of recombination between progeny DNAs accumulating in the cells was low. These results indicate that in pseudorabies virus-infected rabbit kidney cells recombination occurs mainly between parental genomes and precedes DNA replication. An analysis of the kinetics of appearance of recombinants between pairwise combinations of temperature-sensitive mutants also indicated that recombination is an early event. The ratio between the number of recombinant virions and the number of temperature-sensitive mutant virions produced by the cells remained the same throughout infection. Since the relative amounts of viral DNAs synthesized early and late during the infective process that were integrated into virions were approximately the same, it appears that late viral DNA did not experience an increased number of recombinational events compared with early viral DNA. These results, which reinforce the conclusion reached from the results of the analysis of the behavior of the parental DNA molecules in density shift experiments, indicate that recombination is an early event...|$|E
40|$|Many hematologic and mesenchymal malignancies, {{as well as}} some solid tumors, harbor {{recurrent}} reciprocal chromosomal transloca-tions (1 – 3).

Pathways for the faithful repair of DSBs have been characterized in mammalian cells and are broadly defined as nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) (4, 5). In NHEJ, DNA ends are rejoined after processing without the use of extensive sequence homology (6, 7).
