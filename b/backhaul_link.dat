40|$|A cloud {{radio access}} network (C-RAN) is {{considered}} as a candidate {{to meet the expectations}} of higher data rate de- mands in wireless networks. In C-RAN, low energy base stations (BSs) are deployed over a small geography and are allowed to connect to the cloud via finite capacity <b>backhaul</b> <b>links</b> where the information is processed. A conventional C-RAN, however, requires high capacity <b>backhaul</b> <b>links,</b> since the requested files need to be transferred first from the cloud to the BS before conveying them to the users. One approach to overcome the limitations of the <b>backhaul</b> <b>links</b> is to introduce local storage caches at the BSs, in which the popular files are stored locally {{in order to reduce the}} load of the <b>backhaul</b> <b>links.</b> Furthermore, we utilize coded caching with the goal to minimize the total network cost, i. e., the transmit power and the cost associated with the <b>backhaul</b> <b>links.</b> The initial formulation of the optimization problem for this model is non-convex. We first reformulate and then convexify the problem through some relaxation techniques. In comparison to the uncoded caching at the BSs, our results highlight the benefits associated with coded caching and show that it decreases the backhaul cost.

The term backhaul may be used to describe the entire wired part of a network, although some networks have wireless instead of wired backhaul, in whole or in part, for example using microwave bands and mesh network and edge network topologies that may use a high-capacity wireless channel to get packets to the microwave or fiber links.|$|E

50|$|Before {{satellites}} {{were widely}} used in U.S. broadcast television, network affiliates in many smaller markets had to arrange their own network connections. KELP-TV leased mountain tops between Phoenix and El Paso to create these relays. It picked up Phoenix ABC affiliate KTVK (now an independent station) and the network's Tucson affiliate KGUN-TV off-air, and fed them over several microwave relay towers, which landed back at the mountain top transmitter of KELP-TV. For a time, this required the transmitter operator at the site to switch between the studio feed {{and that of the}} incoming network feed. Later, the station added a <b>backhaul</b> <b>link</b> to allow the network feed to be transmitted directly to the studios, allowing the studio operator to preview network shows before broadcasting them on the station.|$|E

40|$|Capacity {{scaling of}} a large hybrid network with unit node density, {{consisting}} of $n$ wireless ad hoc nodes, base stations (BSs) equipped with multiple antennas, and one remote central processor (RCP), is analyzed when wired backhaul links between the BSs and the RCP are rate-limited. We deal with a general scenario where the number of BSs, the number of antennas at each BS, and the <b>backhaul</b> <b>link</b> rate can scale at arbitrary rates relative to $n$ (i. e., we introduce three scaling parameters). We first derive the minimum <b>backhaul</b> <b>link</b> rate required {{to achieve the same}} capacity scaling law as in the infinite-capacity <b>backhaul</b> <b>link</b> case. Assuming an arbitrary rate scaling of each <b>backhaul</b> <b>link,</b> a generalized achievable throughput scaling law is then analyzed in the network based on using one of pure multihop, hierarchical cooperation, and two infrastructure-supported routing protocols, and moreover, three-dimensional information-theoretic operating regimes are explicitly identified according to the three scaling parameters. In particular, we show the case where our network having a power limitation is also fundamentally in the degrees-of-freedom- or infrastructure-limited regime, or both. In addition, a generalized cut-set upper bound under the network model is derived by cutting not only the wireless connections but also the wired connections. It is shown that our upper bound matches the achievable throughput scaling even under realistic network conditions such that each <b>backhaul</b> <b>link</b> rate scales slower than the aforementioned minimum-required <b>backhaul</b> <b>link</b> rate.

30|$|In {{spite of}} the {{significant}} performance gain that CoMP can provide, the use of CoMP in real systems results in a substantial control signaling overhead.

Despite the importance of backhaul unreliability, its impact on multi-node cooperative systems has only been partially investigated in relaying networks[13 – 15].
