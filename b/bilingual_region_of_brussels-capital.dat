5000|$|The Flemish {{saw these}} {{facilities}} {{as a measure}} of integration to another language, as opposed to viewing it as a recognition of a permanent linguistic minority. The French-speaking people, however, saw these language facilities as an acquired right, and a step for an eventual addition to the <b>bilingual</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> Brussels, even though that would be unconstitutional. As a result, the amount of French-speaking people in these regions (mostly around Brussels) did not decline, and contain a growing majority of French-speaking Belgians, even though they reside in the officially monolingual Flanders.

This construction takes place at several levels and materializes incrementally, particularly through the management contract. In this regulatory system, the process organizing the dialogue between the company and the authority produces the desired beneficial effects, more than the legal value of the contract does. The interdependence between the actions <b>of</b> the <b>Region</b> and those <b>of</b> the STIB implies practices that can be described as a partnership. Finally, the analysis shows that the contractualization is not inconsistent with an evolution of the roles of each actor. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective. - To {{point out}} the {{proportion}} of intellectually disabled women (IDW) who are sterilised, and the medical and social factors {{associated with an increased}} probability to be sterilised. Study design. - A population-based study among 97 % of IDW aged 18 - 46, attending government-accredited institutions in the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brussels-Capital</b> and the province of Walloon Brabant (Belgium). Results. - Among the IDW included in this study, 22. 2 % are sterilised, which is superior to the 7 % in the general Belgian population. Factors associated with an increased probability to be sterilised are: living in an institution, having a higher intellectual quotient (IQ), being enrolled in an institution where sexual intercourse is authorised and attending an institution where contraception is required. The last three factors are significant only among women living in institutions and the last two, only in women with severe disability. Among IDW using contraception, no factor was associated with a greater probability to be sterilised. Conclusion. - The prevalence of sterilisation among IDW is three times higher than that in the Belgian population and it is mainly correlated with factors related to the institution where these women live, especially the severely disabled.

40|$|Stereotype threat theory {{suggests}} that a negative stereotype about a social group can undermine the performance of group members in a stereotype-relevant domain. The present research examines this {{in the domain of}} second language (L 2) competence. Two studies were conducted to test the effects of stereotype threat on L 2 performance in a group of Italian-speaking people living in alto adige/Südtirol (aa/ST), a <b>bilingual</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> Italy. Participants were members of the Italian-speaking community who are generally not very proficient in L 2 (i. e., german). When reminded of the negative stereotype, participants who highly identified with the domain (i. e., german language; Study 1) and those who believed that their linguistic group was in a disadvantaged position in aa/ST (Study 2) underperformed in a german language test. These findings are discussed in relation with people’s mastery of L 2 in bilingual contexts and their consequences for the study of stereotype threat...|$|R
40|$|The {{interconnection}} between {{globalization and}} multilingualism {{in the evolution}} of European societies has become an undeniable fact. On the one hand, {{there seems to be a}} greater need for lingua francas that can facilitate understanding among individuals from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds and, ultimately, allow them to increase their chances of geographical and socio-economic mobility. On the other hand, in a world that tends to be perceived as increasingly homogeneous, speakers of minority languages may see their identities threatened by the dominance of those lingua francas and stand up for the right to use their languages. This tension is especially felt in the university context. This article discusses some of the tensions and ambiguities related to the management of multilingualism which may arise in bilingual universities in the process of designing and implementing internationalization policies. The study focuses on three universities which are located in the European <b>bilingual</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> Catalonia (University of Lleida), the Basque Country (University of the Basque Country) and Wales (Cardiff University) respectively.

5000|$|In a {{proposal}} dated 23 August 2007, Professor Philippe Van Parijs explains that, {{while it would}} be foolish to think that Brussels could be coherently managed separately from his immediate hinterland (Flemish and Walloon Brabant), French speakers should be realistic and abandon such claims for the expansion <b>of</b> the Brussels <b>Region</b> to its entire economic hinterland since such expansion would put the Dutch language at risk. He suggests that the facilities would be maintained for the French speakers who presently live in the 2 largest municipalities among the 6 municipalities with facilities around Brussels, whereas they would no longer apply to their children and new comers. The four smaller municipalities (covering less than 40% of the combined territory of the six communes) would be included into the <b>bilingual</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> Brussels; and the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde district would be split along this new border. In 2010 in a publication titled [...] "The linguistic territoriality principle: Right violation or parity of esteem" [...] he reiterated his belief in “territorial linguistic federalism” as opposed to “non-territorial linguistic federalism”. Indeed, the latter implies that people living in the same place would access services that may be of greatly different quality depending on the linguistic community they depend upon whereas the first, while avoiding this drawback, also addresses irreducibly special nature of any coherent, comprehensive project for a political community.|$|R
40|$|Multilingualism in European Bilingual Contexts is {{a timely}} {{publication}} {{in light of}} the European Union’s continuous and forceful promotion of multilingualism. The authors describe the research they present in the book as an “attempt to break some ground” (p. 249) in understanding the challenges of multilingualism in Europe, and through the book they advance the argument that language awareness will {{play a key role in}} overcoming those challenges. The book is based on a transnational research study that was conducted in nine different <b>bilingual</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> Europe. The same research design and instrument were employed across all of the contexts that were studied to survey the language use and language attitudes of pre-service teachers. The scope of languages was broadened in this study to include not only minority and majority languages but also the foreign languages often used in the regions. Therefore, as the authors state, the book “goes beyond bilingualism and into multilingualism” (p. 4). The respective cases and the research report as a whole will help readers compare different language situations, identify common patterns, and also gain an understanding of how language education policies and sociolinguistic conditions exert influence on the ground in various European contexts. Although each case represents its own unique situation, the rather contradictory juxtaposition of efforts toward minority language revitalization and the continued emphasis on English was identified across all cases. The editors had particularly chosen pre-service teachers to be the principal informants of the study under the belief that teachers have a profound impact on students’ language use and attitudes. Accordingly, a central argument of the book is that explicit language awareness education will lead to linguistic tolerance and acceptance, and reduce parochialism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the text-to-speech {{system that has}} been developed in the Speech Group of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). The system is composed of a core and different interfaces {{so that it is}} compatible for research, for telephone applications (either CTI boards or standard ISDN PC cards supporting CAPI), and Windows applications developed using Microsoft SAPI. The paper reviews the system making emphasis in the parts of the system which are language dependent and which allow the reading of bilingual text (Spanish and Catalan). The paper also presents new approaches in prosodic modeling (segmental duration modeling) and generation of the database of speech segments, which have been introduced last year. 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW The UPC Text to Speech System (UPCTTS) is a bilingual system able to read text in Spanish and Catalan. Catalonia is a <b>bilingual</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> Spain, where Catalan and Spanish are spoken almost equally by {{a large part of the}} population. These two languages are similar in their set of phonemes. The system has been developed sharing as many resources as possible between the two languages, with the minimum differences in the language-dependent modules. The user can choose the desired language or, using a mark-up language, parts of text can be read in one or the other language, for instance for proper names. The system is being used in several platforms (UNIX, MacOs and Windows 32) with different objectives (research, broad applications, and specific applications). To do that, the system is composed of a core, which implement the TTS system and several interfaces. The UPCTTS system can be tried via Internet [1]. 1. 1. The Core of the System The core of the TTS system is composed of four modules: text normalisation, phonetic transcription, prosody generation, and speech synthesis. Text normalisation module.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} Hungarian-Romanian language contact in Northwest Romania. In the <b>bilingual</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> Crişana, a major ethnographic change has occurred since 1920. This {{has resulted in}} Hungarians becoming the minority. Migration of ethnic Romanians from the countryside into the cities caused a significant sociolinguistic split between modern urban and traditional rural populations. There has been no sociolinguistic study of the Romanian language in this region up to now. Prior dialect research in the 1960 s and 1970 s limited itself to contact-induced language change. It contains conflicting views {{of a number of}} features of the old, rural Crişana subdialect: mid-open vowels, quantity variation of all vowels, and palatal stops and nasals. Since these features appear in Hungarian too, some scholars consider them to be loans from the contact language, while others do not. An analysis of folk-linguistic beliefs may help explain these inconsistencies. Prior research has not considered this metalinguistic view of the speakers. This dissertation fills this gap. It starts methodologically from a model developed by Krefeld and Pustka (2010), that speakers’ knowledge is manifested both in discourse about language and in actual behavior. A survey was carried out, comprising thirty six hour of interviews with a sample of local people of all linguistic backgrounds and ages. The goal was to collect spontaneous folk linguistic discourse (a method suggested by Niedzielski/Preston 2000). In addition there was a questionnaire with open-ended questions. The present dissertation shows conclusively that phonetic borrowing is not the case but, on the contrary, a folk belief about language. It is argued that the Hungarian contact language effects as a negative model for the development of an urban variety that draws from both the Romanian standard and from eliminating similarities with Hungarian. Another major contribution of the dissertation is a taxonomy of speakers which goes beyond the established dichotomy of „Hungarians” vs. „Romanians”. A distinction between practicing bilinguals („communicators”) and practicing monolinguals („segregators”) turns out to be more convincing. In the field of variational linguistics, {{the results of this study}} imply that consideration of folk beliefs can be an important factor for determining the value of older research. Furthermore, in this study it proved to be indispensable for establishing a taxonomy of speakers to take into account not only their linguistic competence but their actual performance...|$|R
