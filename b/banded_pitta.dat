The checklists of Sclater and Elliot {{at the end of the}} 19th century contained 48 and 47 species each. More recent checklists have had fewer than this, one listing just 24 species. Since the 1990s the figure has been between 30 and 32 species; the 2003 Handbook of the Birds of the World recognises 30. One species not recognised by the Handbook is the black-crowned pitta, which is treated as a subspecies of either the garnet pitta or the graceful pitta. Since the puplication of the handbook more splits have occurred; in 2010 the <b>banded</b> <b>pitta</b> was split into three species, one endemic to Java and Bali, one endemic to Borneo and one found in Sumatra and the Thai-Malay Peninsula. A 2013 study found that the red-bellied pitta, a widespread species found from Sulawesi to Australia, was actually a species complex. The study divided the species into 17 new species, although authorities like the IOC have recognised only 10.|$|E

"Nowhere in the Kingdom of Thailand can one {{find a more}} {{spectacular}} setting for karst topography than the flooded reservoir of Cheow Lan."Apart from the fascinating limestone cliffs and evergreen rain forest jungle, the national park area is inhabited by a large range of mammals such as tigers, elephants, tapirs and many monkey species. Birds such as hornbills, <b>banded</b> <b>pittas</b> and great argus are as well forest residents. Less commonly seen reptiles include the king cobra, reticulated python, and flying lizards. The reservoir area includes the Khlong Saeng, Khlong Nakha and Kaeng Krung wildlife sanctuaries where rare animals can be found. West of Khao Sok National Park lies Sri Phang Nga National Park which extends the preservation area to 4,000 square kilometers.|$|R
