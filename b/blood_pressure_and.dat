5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>and</b> constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{this study}} {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the association between abdominal obesity ultrasound measurements, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), metabolic syndrome (MS) components and subclinical atherosclerosis. Methods: sixty patients were recruited and divided equally into two groups, {{according to the presence}} of MS. All sub-jects had an ultrasound examination for measurement of visceral and subcutaneous fat thickness and carotid IMT. Re-sults: the values of visceral fat thickness, preperitoneal circumference and carotid IMT were higher in patients with MS than in control subjects. Visceral fat thickness showed significant correlations with many cardiovascular risk factors (waist circumference, BMI, fasting plasma glucose, HDL and LDL cholesterol). All abdominal obesity measurements were correlated with BMI. Carotid IMT showed correlations with age, visceral fat and preperitoneal circumference. Visceral fat was independently associated with systolic <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> fasting plasma glucose. Sys-tolic <b>and</b> diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>and</b> BMI were independent determinants of carotid IMT. Conclusion: visceral fat thickness showed the best correlation with MS components, suggesting that it could be a useful parameter in cardio-vascular risk assessment.

It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
