2500|$|The new-generation AU Falcon was {{released}} in 1998 with its range comprising the following models: Forté (previously GLi), S, Futura, Fairmont, Fairmont Ghia, XR6, XR6 VCT and XR8. External model differentiation was achieved via the use of different grilles and bonnets (low bonnet and vertical [...] "waterfall" [...] grille on Forté, horizontal single bar on Futura, integrated quad-lamp <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> and grille on the XR sports range; high bonnet and large grille on Fairmont range) and more basic fittings such as different alloy wheel design, rear light clusters (clear turn signals on Fairmont), body colour-coordination and chrome fittings.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, the 86xstyle Cb {{was officially}} {{launched}} after its presentations at the 2013 and 2014 Tokyo Auto Salon. It is characterised by a drastically different front end design with revised lights and <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> but standard bonnet. Available in 6-speed manual or automatic transmission, it has revised interior trimmings including a red Cb logo embroidered leather steering wheel, white (instead of red) backlit instruments {{and a dark}} woodgrain-style panel across the dashboard. The most peculiar features are {{the replacement of the}} front side gills with a set of LED-illuminated fins and optional contrasting colour for the car’s upper body section. Another option is different alloy wheels than those fitted as standard on the GT86. On sale from April, this Japan-only model is listed for , which is a [...] premium over the regular 86 GT on which this variant is based.|$|E

50|$|New {{emissions}} regulations heralded the mildly facelifted HX Monaro GTS sedan, {{announced in}} July 1976. The HX was quite distinguishable, with liberal splashes of black paintouts contrasted against {{a range of}} bold body colours, and a choice of traditional chrome or body painted <b>bumper</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The 1971 GTO {{had another}} modest facelift, {{this time with}} {{wire-mesh}} grilles, horizontal <b>bumper</b> <b>bars</b> {{on either side of}} the grille opening, more closely spaced headlamps, and a new hood with the dual scoops relocated to the leading edge, not far above the grille.

50|$|The Highline grade {{has over}} the Trendline part chrome mirror housings, chrome strips on {{radiator}} grille {{and around the}} fog lights, chrome rear <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> 18-inch aluminium wheels, automatic climate control (Climatronic), leatherette/leather fabric on the interior.|$|E
5000|$|... "Nudge bars", {{another kind}} of bullbar, are {{generally}} fitted to sedans and small SUVs, and consist of light aluminium or polycarbonate tubing that protects only the radiator grille and areas without replacing the <b>bumper</b> <b>bar.</b> Bullbars typically replace the front bumper or fender, so most require indicator light housings.|$|E
2500|$|The 86 [...] "boxer" [...] side badge {{appears on}} all Toyota and Scion {{versions}} of the car, but not the Subaru BRZ. Aside from badging, the main differences between the 86/GT86 and the BRZ are the front grilles and <b>bumper</b> <b>bars.</b> The rest, including the 17inch alloy wheels, are shared.|$|R
50|$|The first FTE {{followed}} {{the launch of}} the brand-new AU series Falcon a month later, in October 1998. The controversial looks of the donor car were lessened courtesy of better designed <b>bumper</b> <b>bars</b> and larger wheels, as well as more luxurious interiors, at least on the TS50 and TL50 models.|$|R
50|$|The 1971 GTO {{had another}} modest facelift, {{this time with}} {{wire-mesh}} grilles, horizontal <b>bumper</b> <b>bars</b> {{on either side of}} the grille opening, more closely spaced headlamps, and a new hood with the dual scoops relocated to the leading edge, not far above the grille. Overall length grew slightly to 203.3 in.|$|R
50|$|The XR {{series was}} the high {{performance}} end of the range. It originally comprised the XR6 HP, XR6 VCT, and XR8 models all sharing a unique quad-lamp front <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> and non-high end bonnet. All series I XR's could {{have the option of}} a full Tickford bodykit and unique bi-wing rear spoiler.|$|E
50|$|On 8 July 1972, Kanafani, age 36 at the time, {{was assassinated}} in Beirut when {{he turned on the}} {{ignition}} of his Austin 1100, detonating a grenade which in turn detonated a 3 kilo plastic bomb planted behind the <b>bumper</b> <b>bar.</b> Kanafani was incinerated, together with his seventeen-year-old niece Lamees Najim. Mossad eventually claimed responsibility.|$|E
50|$|Aesthetically, the X300 {{received}} several updates {{in the design}} refresh led by Geoff Lawson in 1991. The mostly flat bonnet of the XJ40 was replaced with a fluted, curvaceous design that accentuated the four separate round headlamps. Rear wings were reshaped to accommodate the new wrap-around rear light clusters. Also, the separate black-rubber <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> of the XJ40 is gone and replaced with a fully integrated body-coloured bumper.|$|E

50|$|Featuring special badging, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Calais, which featured unique limited edition parts, the rest of these special editions were base Commodores sold with extra equipment (e.g. full body-coloured <b>bumper</b> <b>bars,</b> standard alloy wheels—from Berlina for the 50th Anniversary—but without the luxury interior features such as climate control and full trip computer).|$|R
5000|$|The 1983 {{model year}} {{facelift}} (produced from September 1982) included styling {{changes to the}} front of the car: the 'kidney' grilles, valance/spoiler, <b>bumper</b> <b>bars,</b> etc. Inside the car, the dashboard and instrument panels were also updated. The rear suspension was updated and the 735i engine changed from the M90 to the M30B34.|$|R
5000|$|Further changes {{included}} the updating to electric windshield wipers (the previous model FB used vacuum wipers). The other changes were more cosmetic. Holden implemented stronger seat material [...] "ElastoFab" [...] {{due to the}} FB trim splitting at the seams quite easily, with the horizontal mid seat seam trim join. Holden also added a new grille, plenum chamber (Wiper Vent) cover, larger <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> over-riders, wider rear-view mirror, different badging and side trim style.|$|E
5000|$|Thanks to the {{positive}} reaction to the CD prototype, Opel considered developing a production models. The doors would adopt a conventional opening system and the <b>bumper</b> <b>bar,</b> windshield wipers and other parts would be derived from the Opel Diplomat {{in order to facilitate}} production and maintain costs. Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Lutz, who was the Head of Opel at the time and was keen to produce the car, commissioned Pietro Frua to advance the concept and produce two road-going prototypes.|$|E
50|$|Although {{mechanically}} the new TL and KL series {{remained the}} same as the preceding TJ, stylistically, it had been radically facelifted by French designer Olivier Boulay. Gone were the somewhat angular lines featured since the first TE series, which were instead replaced by what Mitsubishi's new global head of design envisioned as the new Mitsubishi corporate face (a style that would eventually be grafted onto other Mitsubishi vehicles, beginning with the Lancer Evolution and Colt/Mirage). The frontal appearance of the TL/KL series had a distinctive grille, which was again divided in the middle like on the TJ series, but this time by an extension of the <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> and not the bonnet. Larger chrome Mitsubishi triple diamonds logo adorned the front bumper, whereas the front guards now had a swoopy appearance with triangular headlamp assemblies. On its sides, new design, colour-coded plastic door handles, rocker panels and skirts were introduced. At the rear, a rounded boot lid and <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> were fitted to continue the swoopy front theme, but the rear tail lights remained effectively unchanged from those of the TJ series (except for VR-X and Verada Xi AWD which featured darkened lenses). The new car's styling was controversial and not well received by Australian buyers; sales slowed dramatically.|$|E
50|$|Apart from minor running {{production}} upgrades, {{the range}} was revamped and {{became known as}} the 164 Super in 1993. Key differences on the outside consisted of chrome trimmings added to the upper edge of the <b>bumpers</b> <b>bars</b> and revised headlights now with a slimmer profile. Inside, there were revised instruments and a centre console that featured more delineated switchgear.|$|R
2500|$|Ford {{attempted}} {{to address the}} AUs issues with its Series II (April 2000) and Series III (November 2001) updates, which brought styling and interior improvements such as a raised bonnet across the non-XR range (from the Fairmont range), scrapping of the unpopular [...] "waterfall" [...] grill on the base model Forté, revised bigger profile <b>bumper</b> <b>bars,</b> bigger wheels and improved interior trims.|$|R
5000|$|Codenamed [...] "8VK19 A9W", it {{was based}} on a Commodore Executive but {{upgraded}} to the S pack. In addition to body coloured wheel covers, <b>bumper</b> <b>bars</b> and bonnet garnish the car also featured the HSV 8 Plus grille, SV3800 red and silver pin stripes and Challenger decal pack on driver's side of the bootlid and trailing edges of rear doors below the body mouldings. It was only available in Alpine White and the interior featured a black Calais steering wheel, rear headrests and Challenger badge in dash pad.|$|R
5000|$|The Datsun DS-6 Convar was {{released}} in 1954 and was more modern and attractive compared to the DS-4 and DS-5. The DS-6 {{was based on the}} DS-5 and used its drivetrain. The front-end was unique with a flat panel (with [...] "DATSUN" [...] in individual letters) between the hood opening and the grille, which was oval-shaped that was split by the <b>bumper</b> <b>bar.</b> The trunk lid lifted up rather than folded down. The DS-6 was in production until December 1954, when it was replaced by the all new Datsun 110.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{wanting to}} protect {{all of the}} {{interior}} of the boot (floor, sides and back of seats including the roof lining and <b>bumper</b> <b>bar)</b> can use a heavy duty polyester boot liner. These are designed to be fitted when needed [...] and stored under the seat or in the spare tyre area when not. This type of liner can withstand heavy domestic use and are water resistant (not waterproof). They are not tailored to a specific vehicle and are available in small and large sizes to suit most hatches, wagons, SUVs and 4WD vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious {{radiator}} grill and <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> changes, {{there were other}} less obvious changes that {{took place during the}} Midgets production run. The first cars assembled in 1967 were wired positive earth, had thinly cast engine blocks requiring nitrated crank shafts to provide extra rigidity. Later engines blocks were cast with thicker walls. Other changes were to negative earth wiring and alternator, chunckier boot lock handle, internal door latch handles, and quarter light window handles. Plastic window winder and internal door pull handles. Crossflow radiators running at higher pressures. The differential ratio was also changed to 3.9 some time during 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Technologically, {{the biggest}} {{innovation}} of the Ritmo {{was not the}} car itself (since it was mechanically based on its predecessor, the Fiat 128) but {{the way in which}} it was manufactured at the Cassino plant. Fiat, in conjunction with its subsidiary Comau, developed the pioneering [...] "Robogate" [...] system which automated the entire bodyshell assembly and welding process using robots, earning the car the advertising slogan [...] "Handbuilt by robots", immortalised in a television advertising campaign showing the robots assembling the Ritmo bodyshells to the strains of Rossini's The Barber of Seville. The avant-garde nature of its exterior design is highlighted by large plastic <b>bumper</b> <b>bars</b> integrated into the styling (a trend that became an industry standard, thanks to this plastic's ability to absorb small impacts without damage, unlike the then more prevalent metal <b>bumper</b> <b>bars),</b> the manner in which these intersected the front round headlights and incorporated the rear taillights plus licence plates, and how round shapes (such as the headlights, door handles and the rear edge of the roof ending in an upward sweep) were combined within overall sharp lines (e.g. from those of the sloping rear hatch and slanted rear window corners to the badges and shape of the side indicators and rear view mirrors). Its aerodynamic design resulted in an excellent — for its era — , ...|$|R
50|$|ABS's {{light weight}} {{and ability to}} be {{injection}} molded and extruded make it useful in manufacturing products such as drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe systems, musical instruments (recorders, plastic clarinets, and piano movements), golf club heads (because of its good shock absorbance), automotive trim components, automotive <b>bumper</b> <b>bars,</b> medical devices for blood access, enclosures for electrical and electronic assemblies, protective headgear, whitewater canoes, buffer edging for furniture and joinery panels, luggage and protective carrying cases, small kitchen appliances, and toys, including Lego and Kre-O bricks. Household and consumer goods are the major applications of ABS. Keyboard keycaps are commonly made out of ABS.|$|R
5000|$|Six-side window sedan: a more {{conventional}} variant built and introduced in Japan {{five months after the}} Diamante. It was called the Sigma and differed by having a slightly taller roofline, a six-window glasshouse, window sashes, revised front fascia and rear styling. It was exported to Europe from Japan and formed the basis of the second generation Magna/Verada sedan, which was independently built in Adelaide, South Australia. Its luxury derivative, the Verada was intended for the domestic consumption and primary export to North America (hence the longer <b>bumper</b> <b>bars</b> to meet the latter's more onerous crash standards).|$|R

50|$|The Ralliart {{concept in}} sedan form only, was a further {{development}} of the VR-X and the most powerful Magna ever designed to leverage off Mitsubishi's World Rally Championship exploits. In fact, its overall styling {{was based on the}} legendary Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution range, in particular the front <b>bumper</b> <b>bar</b> (void of any fog lights) and its bi-plane deck lid spoiler inspired by the limited edition Lancer Evolution VI TME (the rest of the body kit included carry-over VR-X wheel arch extensions plus unique side skirts and squared-off chrome exhaust tip). Among other things, in prototype form, Magna Ralliart was said to feature AWD, Recaro front seats, MOMO steering wheel and gear levers as part of a loud black and bright red interior. 500 individually numbered Ralliart models had been planned.|$|E

50|$|Bitter {{based his}} {{original}} CD designs on those of Frua, before making alterations closer to production. The basic design changes to Frua's CD design vis-à-vis the 1969 Opel CD {{consisted of a}} truncated read end, modified windshield and less chrome application. Dave Holls and Opel's design team supplemented the design with a small front spoiler, larger grille, higher <b>bumper</b> <b>bars</b> and by prolonging upwards the lower edge of the rear side windows across the C pillar to the rear hatch. Final prototype testing was conducted at the Opel Test Facility in Duden, in addition to load duration tests by Bitter at the Hydropulseur facility of Baur.|$|R
50|$|The John Goss Special {{cars were}} {{available}} in a choice of two accent colours, Apollo Blue metallic or Emerald Fire (green) metallic, offset against the predominant body colour of Polar White. The metallic paint (specified on the cars' compliance plates) covered the bonnet, engine bay, chassis, and feature sections on the 'A' pillar and waistline, {{as well as the}} lower sill sections and the rear feature panel between the tail-lights. Unlike other GS Rally Pack cars, the road wheels were painted in complementary Polar White, as were the <b>bumper</b> <b>bars</b> and the front grille assembly. Interior trim was mandatory white vinyl, contrasted against a black dashboard and mandatory black floor carpet.|$|R
50|$|New for 1941 was the Windsor Six Town and Country, {{a station}} wagon type vehicle {{designed}} by David A. Wallace, who {{was the president of}} Chrysler at the time. Fog lights and <b>bumper</b> crash <b>bars</b> were optional.|$|R
