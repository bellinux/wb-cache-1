5|$|After {{the end of}} the Battle of France and the {{evacuation}} of British troops from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo, much of Britain's war production and effort was channeled into RAF Bomber Command and the strategic bombing offensive against Germany. However, bomber losses on each raid began to increase during 1941, which <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> concluded was due to German use of advanced radar equipment.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{developed}} large {{intelligence services}} during the war. Prior {{the outbreak of}} war the Australian military possessed almost no intelligence gathering facilities and was reliant on information passed on by the <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> services. Several small signals intelligence units were established in 1939 and 1940, which had some success intercepting and deciphering Japanese transmissions before {{the outbreak of the}} Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|By September 1949, {{information}} from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> services were wary of indicating {{the source of their}} information. The Soviets had broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. In October 1949, Fuchs approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news that his father had been given a chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany.|$|E
5|$|By early December 1916, {{construction}} of the railway had reached the wells at Bir el Mazar, the last water sources available to the EEF before El Arish. Bir el Mazar was about half way between Kantara on the Suez Canal and the Egyptian-Ottoman territorial border. <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> had reported Ottoman Army plans to strengthen the garrison at Magdhaba, by extending the railway (or light rail) south east from Beersheba (and Hafir el Auja) towards Magdhaba.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} of Poland and subsequent outbreak of war in September 1939, the Yugoslav Intelligence Service was cooperating with <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> agencies on a large scale across the country. This cooperation, which had existed to a lesser extent during the early 1930s, intensified after the Anschluss in 1938. These combined intelligence operations were aimed at strengthening Yugoslavia and keeping her neutral while encouraging covert activities. In mid to late 1940, <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> became aware of coup plotting, but managed to side-track the plans, preferring to continue working through Prince Paul. The SOE office in Belgrade went to significant lengths to support the opposition to the anti-Axis Cvetković government, which undermined the hard-won balance in Yugoslav politics that government represented. SOE Belgrade was entangled with pro-Serb policies and interests, and disregarded or underestimated warnings from SOE and British diplomats in Zagreb, who better understood the situation in Yugoslavia as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Camp commandant Rudolf Höss was {{pursued by}} the <b>British</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Corps, who arrested him at a farm near Flensburg, Germany, on 11 March 1946. Höss confessed to {{his role in the}} mass killings at Auschwitz in his memoirs and in his trial before the Supreme National Tribunal in Warsaw, Poland. He was convicted of murder, {{returned}} to Auschwitz and hanged at the site of his crimes on 16 April 1947.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{conspiracy}} was successfully infiltrated by <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> through Irish and Indian channels. The activities of Ghadar on the Pacific coast were noted by W. C. Hopkinson, {{who was born}} and raised in India and spoke fluent Hindi. Initially Hopkinson had been despatched from Calcutta to keep the Indian Police informed about the doings of Taraknath Das.|$|E

René would die at age 62 in 1944 in the German concentration camp at Sonnenburg (in East Brandenburg, Germany), {{where he had been}} imprisoned by the Gestapo because of his work for the French Resistance and British Intelligence; the body was never recovered.|$|E
5|$|Strangways, the <b>British</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (SIS) Station Chief in Jamaica, is killed. In response, British agent James Bond—also {{known as}} 007—is sent to Jamaica to {{investigate}} the circumstances. During his investigation Bond meets Quarrel, a Cayman fisherman, {{who had been working}} with Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. One of the islands was Crab Key, home to the reclusive Dr. No.|$|E
5|$|The Indo-German {{alliance}} and the conspiracy were {{the target of}} a worldwide <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> effort, which was successful in preventing further attempts. American intelligence agencies arrested key figures {{in the aftermath of the}} Annie Larsen affair in 1917. The conspiracy resulted in the Lahore conspiracy case trials in India as well as the Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial—at the time the longest and most expensive trial ever held in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The sagging {{popularity}} of the Republic did not escape {{the attention of the}} <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> services. However, because this intelligence was filtered through the eyes of Orangist agents in the Republic and émigrés in England, it was erroneously interpreted as possible support for an Orangist restoration. This caused the miscalculation that led to the ill-fated Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in the peninsula of North Holland in 1799.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> with the anti-Axis {{government}} of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the spring}} and early summer of 1921, the rebels {{experienced}} a series of defeats. In July 1921, Hananu's stronghold in Jabal Zawiya was captured by French forces. By this time, French forces proceeded to burn down villages where support for the rebels was high. A number of these villages' inhabitants were arrested or executed, prompting some rebels to ultimately surrender. On 11 or 12 July, Hananu fled to British-held Transjordan, seeking refuge with nationalists from Syria, to avoid arrest by the French authorities. <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> officers arrested Hananu while he was visiting Jerusalem and extradited him to Syria in August.|$|E

5|$|For the operation, the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. The {{operation was}} launched on 3 June 1940. <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> had warned the French {{of the impending}} attack, and the operation failed to achieve the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force). Fortunately for the Luftwaffe, {{the plight of the}} French ground and air forces at this stage meant that the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France.|$|E
5|$|French {{hopes of}} regaining {{supremacy}} in the Adriatic now {{rested on the}} Rivoli, a ship of the line under construction at Venice. Although her completion had been delayed by almost two years, <b>British</b> <b>intelligence</b> was aware of her condition and had periodically supplied ships of the line to observe her movements and engage her if the opportunity should arise. In February 1812, Rivoli departed Venice for the first time, destined for Pola on her maiden voyage. Waiting for Rivoli was the British HMS Victorious, commanded by John Talbot, who chased Rivoli and captured her in a four-hour battle in which both sides suffered heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Italian gun {{positions}} were located using sound ranging by the British 6th Survey Regiment, Royal Artillery. These positions disclosed themselves by firing at Australian patrols, which now went out nightly, mapping the antitank ditch and {{the barbed wire}} obstacles. Aerial photographs of the {{positions were}} taken by Westland Lysander aircraft of No. 208 Squadron RAF, escorted by Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters of No. 3 Squadron RAAF. <b>British</b> <b>Intelligence</b> estimated {{the strength of the}} Italian garrison at 20 to 23,000 with 100 guns, and discounted reports of six medium and seventy light tanks as exaggerated—a serious intelligence failure.|$|E
