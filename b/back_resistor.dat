40|$|In the {{framework}} of the GERDA-Experiment at th e Gran Sasso National-Laboratory in Italy, noise measurements at the GERDA preampl ifier were performed during this Bachelor thesis. The aim of these measurements was the characterization of the ci rcuit and the investiga tion of possible improve- ments. The preamplifier consists of an initial field-effect transistor (FET) and an operational amplifier. The noise should depend on the characteristics of the tran sistor as well as on other influences like the feed- <b>back</b> <b>resistor</b> or the operational point of the FET. These conditions were varied during the measure- ments to analyze their influence on the different noise components. Actually, the FET BF 862 is used in the GERDA-Experi ment. This transistor is only available in a package, whose material causes radioactive backgr ound and therefore brings additional background to the measurement. Because of this, a second FET, th e LSK 170 C, which is also available without pack- age, was tested. However, no improvements could be achieved. The measured noise parameters for serial and parallel noise were considerably higher than expected. With in this Bachelor thesis no satisfactory reason for these high values could be state...|$|E

50|$|The circuit is {{basically}} a delay element with the output connected back to the input through a relatively high impedance. This is usually achieved with two inverters connected back to <b>back.</b> The <b>resistor</b> drives the bus weakly; therefore other circuits can override {{the value of the}} bus when they are not in tri-state mode.|$|R
40|$|The {{wideband}} high-linearity mixers for {{a double}} conversion cable TV tuner is presented. The up-conversion mixer converts the input signal from 100 MHz to 1000 MHz to the intermediate frequency (IF) of I GHz above. And the down-conversion mixer converts the frequency <b>back.</b> The degeneration <b>resistors</b> are used to Improve the linearity. The tuner is implemented in a 0. 35 mu m SiGe technology. Input power at 1 dB compression point can reach + 14. 23 dBm. The lowest noise figure is 17. 5 dB. The two mixers consume 103 mW under a supply voltage of 5 V...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new outphasing energy recovery amplifier (OPERA) which replaces the isolation resistor {{in the conventional}} matched combiner with a resistance-compressed rectifier for improved efficiency. The rectifier recovers the power normally wasted in the isolation <b>resistor</b> <b>back</b> to the power supply, while a resistance compression network (RCN) reduces the impedance variation of the rectifier as the output power varies. Because the combiner requires a fixed resistance at the isolation port to ensure matching and isolation between the two outphased power amplifiers (PAs), the RCN serves to maintain high linearity as well as high efficiency in the switching-mode PAs. For demonstration, a prototype OPERA system is designed and implemented with discrete components at an operating frequency of 48 MHz, delivering 20. 8 W peak power with 82. 9 % PAE. The measurement results show an efficiency improvement from 17. 9 % to 42. 0 % for a 50 -kHz 16 -QAM signal with a peak-to-average power ratio of 6. 5 dB. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

40|$|The MICE {{coupling}} coil is fabricated from Nb-Ti, {{which has}} high quench propagation velocities within the coil {{in all directions}} compared to coils fabricated with other superconductors such as niobium tin. The time for the MICE coupling coil to become fully normal through normal region propagation in the coil is shorter than the time needed for a safe quench (as defined by a hot-spot temperature that is less than 300 K). A MICE coupling coil quench was simulated using a code written at the Institute of Cryogenics and Superconductive Technology (ICST) at the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). This code simulates quench back from the mandrel as well as normal region propagation within the coil. The simulations included sub-division of the coil. Each sub-division has a back to <b>back</b> diodes and <b>resistor</b> across the coil. Current flows in the resistor when there is enough voltage across the coil to cause current to flow through the diodes in the forward direction. The effects {{of the number of}} coil sub-divisions and the value of the resistor across the sub-division on the quench were calculated with and without quench back. Sub-division of the coupling coil reduces the peak voltage to ground, the layer-to-layer voltage and the magnet hot-spot temperature. Quench back reduces the magnet hot-spot temperature, but the peak voltage to ground and layer-to-layer voltage are increased, because the magnet quenches faster. The resistance across the coil sub-division affects both the hot-spot temperature and the peak voltage to ground...|$|R
