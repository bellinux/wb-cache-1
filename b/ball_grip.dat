40|$|Experiments {{are done}} by colliding a {{swinging}} bat with a stationary baseball or softball. Each collision was recorded with high-speed cameras, {{from which the}} post-impact speed, launch angle, and spin of the ball could be determined. Initial bat speeds were in the range 63 - 88 mph, producing launch angles in the range 0 ^∘- 30 ^∘ and spins in the range 0 - 3500 rpm. The results are analyzed {{in the context of}} a ball-bat collision model and the parameters of that model are determined. For both baseballs and softballs, the data are consistent with a mechanism whereby the <b>ball</b> <b>grips</b> the surface of the bat, stretching the ball in the transverse direction and resulting in a spin that was up to 40 % greater than would be obtained by rolling contact of rigid bodies. Using a lumped parameter contact model, baseballs are shown to be less compliant tangentially than softballs. Implications of our results for batted balls in game situations are presented.

40|$|Background Assessing hand {{injury is}} of great {{interest}} given the level of involvement of the hand with the environment. Knowing different assessment systems and their limitations generates new perspectives. The integration of digital systems (accelerometry and electromyography) {{as a tool to}} supplement functional assessment allows the clinician {{to know more about the}} motor component and its relation to movement. Therefore, the purpose of this study was the kinematic and electromyography analysis during functional hand movements. Method Ten subjects carried out six functional movements (terminal pinch, termino-lateral pinch, tripod pinch, power grip, extension grip and <b>ball</b> <b>grip).</b> Muscle activity (hand and forearm) was measured in real time using electromyograms, acquired with the Mega ME 6000, whilst acceleration was measured using the AcceleGlove. Results Electrical activity and acceleration variables were recorded simultaneously during the carrying out of the functional movements. The acceleration outcome variables were the modular vectors of each finger of the hand and the palm. In the electromyography, the main variables were normalized by the mean and by the maximum muscle activity of the thenar region, hypothenar, first interosseous dorsal, wrist flexors, carpal flexors and wrist extensors. Conclusions Knowing muscle behavior allows the clinician to take a more direct approach in the treatment. Based on the results, the tripod grip shows greater kinetic activity and the middle finger is the most relevant in this regard. <b>Ball</b> <b>grip</b> involves most muscle activity, with the thenar region playing a fundamental role in hand activity. Clinical relevance Relating muscle activation, movements, individual load and displacement offers the possibility to proceed with rehabilitation by individual component...|$|E
40|$|The {{perception}} of reachability (i. e., whether an object is within reach) relies on body representations and action simulation. Similarly, egocentric distance estimation (i. e., the {{perception of}} the distance an object is from the self) is thought to be partly derived from embodied action simulation. Although motor simulation is important for both, it is unclear whether the cognitive processes underlying these behaviors rely on the same motor processes. To investigate this, we measured the impact of a motor interference dual-task paradigm on reachability judgment and egocentric distance estimation, while allocentric length estimation (i. e., how distant two stimuli are from each other independent from the self) was used as a control task. Participants were required to make concurrent actions with either hand actions of foam <b>ball</b> <b>grip</b> squeezing or arm actions of weight lifting, or no concurrent actions. Results showed that concurrent squeeze actions significantly slowed response speed in the reachability judgment and egocentric distance estimation tasks, but that there was no impact of the concurrent actions on allocentric length estimation. Together, these results suggest that reachability and distance perception, both egocentric perspective tasks, and in contrast to the allocentric perspective task, involve action simulation cognitive processes. The results are discussed in terms of the implication of action simulation when evaluating the position of a target relative to the observer's body, supporting an embodied view of spatial cognition...|$|E

50|$|Regardless {{of how the}} <b>ball</b> is <b>gripped,</b> {{the purpose}} of the knuckleball is to have the least amount of {{rotational}} spin as possible.

The asymmetric drag that results tends to deflect the trajectory toward the side with the stitches.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{findings}} show that the sensory-motor areas underlying finger movement {{play a critical role}} in numerical cognition. Given these links between embodied action perspectives and numerical concepts, we suggest that observing certain types of actions should have an effect on the selection and the production of numerical responses. Therefore, the present study assessed whether observing finger, hand or mouth movements were able to influence a random number generation task, and how the influence effect moderated for the different kinds of movements. The experimental task required that participants randomly produced a number between 1 and 10 after they first perceived an action stimulus of either closing or an opening finger, hand and mouth grip movement, or they perceived stimuli color changes (a control comparison condition). The results revealed that random number production was influenced by the prior presentation of the finger movements, whereby observing a closing finger grip movement led participants to produce more small than large numbers than in the baseline condition, while observing an opening finger grip movement led participants to produce more large than small numbers. For one of the hand movement (i. e., rope grip) conditions, the number production was not influenced. For the other hand movement (i. e., tennis <b>ball</b> <b>grip)</b> conditions, the closing movement induced participants to produce more small than large numbers. Finally, in the mouth movement condition, the observation of the mouth opening movement led participants to produce more large than small numbers. Taken together, these results showed that some of the characteristics of the observed finger, hand and mouth grip movements appeared to automatically prime the number generation task. The findings are discussed in terms of the functional and neural mechanisms that might explain the effect, and support the view that number semantics might be grounded on sensory-motor mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of the human hand {{in terms of the}} discrete movement of the joints and the action of individual muscles is well enough understood. Little is known, however, of the movements of the hand as a whole. It is possible to talk loosely of closing, opening or cupping the hand; of selected postures such as the pinch or hook or of prehensile functions such as grasping and gripping. These terms are not only unscientific but have little or no universal connotation. The need for a system of disability evaluation of the hand in connection with industrial and insurance work has resulted in the development of several methods of analysing the {{function of}} the hand as a unit. Griffiths (1943 and personal communications) has for many years divided the functions of the hand into cylinder grip, <b>ball</b> <b>grip,</b> ring grip, pincer grip and pliers grip. These terms, although expressive and useful are somewhat selective in that they represent a series of functional end-results rather than a fundamental analysis of the potential of the hand as a whole. The units of function devised by Slocum and Pratt (1946) namely, grasp, pinch and hook-are not clearly defined nor are they comprehensive, for no allowance appears to be made, for instance, for the numerous functions of the hand in which the thumb is not in opposition. The classification proposed by McB ride (1942) divides the functions of the hand into three types: grasping by the hand as a whole, grasping between the thumb and fingers and grasping by the combined use of the palm and the digits. These three types of movement are somewhat arbitrarily conceived and do not appear to have any particular functional or anatomical basis. A terminology, {{if it is to be}} effective and generally acceptable, must develop out of a fundamental approach to the problem of the {{function of the}} hand as a whole and it seems that little has been done in this respect. The purpose of this paper is to present a method of classifying prehensile movements based on such an approach. The two discrete patterns of movement that have emerged through this study are analysed from both the anatomical and functional points of view and are termed precision grip and power grip...|$|E

40|$|Many robots {{excel at}} precise {{positioning}} and trajectory tracking using software control, and most successful robotic applications utilize this ability—examples include CNC machining, robotic welding, painting, and pick-and-place circuit board assembly. The mechanical design of these robots focuses on rigid transmissions and minimizing compliance in the structure, so the software controller can accurately track a desired {{position as a}} function of time, regardless of any disturbance forces. However, there is a class of tasks for which rigid actuation is not ideal: physical interaction with the world, especially interaction that involves an impact or kinetic energy transfer. Animals tend to excel at these tasks, and far outperform the best robots. Examples include walking, running, catching a <b>ball,</b> <b>gripping</b> a piece of fruit firmly but without causing damage, and many types of assembly tasks. For dynamic behaviors such as running, the performance limitations of a robot are often due to limitations of the mechanical design. A robot is an integrated system of electronics, software, and mechanism, and each part of the system limits or enables the behavior of the whole. While some behaviors can easily be implemented through simple actuators and direct software control, a running machine requires mechanical design that is specialized for the task.

3000|$|Use of {{the hand}} is vital in working life due to the {{grabbing}} and pinching it performs. Spherical grip is the most commonly used, due to similarity to the gripping of a computer mouse. Knowledge of its execution and the involved elements is essential. Analysis of this exertion with surface electromyography devices (to register muscular activity) and accelerometer devices (to register movement values [...]) can provide multiple variables. Six subjects performed <b>ball</b> <b>gripping</b> and registered real-time electromyography (thenar region, hypothenar region, first dorsal interosseous, flexors of the wrist, flexor carpi ulnaris and extensors of the wrist muscles) and accelerometer (thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky and palm) values. The obtained data was resampled “R software” and processed “Matlab Script” based on an automatic numerical sequence recognition program. Electromyography values were normalized {{on the basis of}} maximum voluntary contraction, whilst modular values were calculated for the acceleration vector. After processing and analysing the obtained data and signal, it was possible to identify five stages of movement in accordance with the module vector from the palm. The statistical analysis of the variables was descriptive: average and standard deviations. The outcome variables focus on the variations of the modules of the vector (between the maximum and minimum values of each module and phase) and the maximum values of the standardized electromyography of each muscle. Analysis of movement through accelerometer and electromyography variables can give us an insight into the operation of spherical grip.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Prospective control cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To {{develop a}} new test to analyse qualitatively {{grasping}} strategies in C 6 /C 7 tetraplegic patients, and to quantify the effect of musculo-tendinous transfers. SETTING: France. METHODS: Twelve C 6 /C 7 tetraplegic adults (17 arms; 31. 3 +/- 7. 9 years) and 17 healthy subjects (30. 9 +/- 9. 4 years) completed the study. We assessed participants' ability to grasp, move and release standardized balls of variable sizes and weights. OUTCOME MEASURES: Failures, movement duration (MD), grip patterns, forearm orientation during transport. RESULTS: In patients {{as well as in}} controls, the number of digits involved in prehension increased proportionally to the size and weight of the ball. C 6 non-operated tetraplegic patients failed 38. 2 % of the tasks. They frequently used supine transport (51. 4 % of successful tasks). MD was longer, with a large distribution of values. The presence of active elbow extension poorly influenced the amount of failure nor grip configuration, but significantly reduced MD and supine transport (34 %). Patients who were evaluated after hand surgery showed a trend towards improved MD and more frequent completion (failure 30 %), especially for middle-sized and middle-weighted <b>balls.</b> <b>Grip</b> patterns were deeply modified, and all transports were made in pronation. CONCLUSION: The 'Tetra Ball Test' evidences the characteristics of grasping in tetraplegic patients and those influenced by surgery. It may be useful in understanding effects of surgical procedures.

The forkball is a similar pitch, though it is slower and gripped with a more exaggerated split of the fingers. A pitcher generally needs long, flexible fingers to effectively throw this pitch.
