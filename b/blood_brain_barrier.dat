40|$|The present {{studies were}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} possibility that hexosaminidase A, the enzyme deficient in Tay [...] Sachs disease, could be effectively delivered to brain. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that hypertonic mannitol {{can be used to}} osmotically produce reversible disruption of the <b>blood</b> [...] <b>brain</b> <b>barrier</b> in animals (rat and dog) and man without significant neurotoxicity and that such barrier modification significantly increases the delivery of cytoreductive chemotherapy agents to selected areas of brain. By using the rat model of <b>blood</b> [...] <b>brain</b> <b>barrier</b> modification and radiolabeled enzyme, increased hexosaminidase A delivery to brain has been demonstrated in more than 85 animals. The time of injection of hexosaminidase A after <b>blood</b> [...] <b>brain</b> <b>barrier</b> disruption is critical for maximum delivery. Rapid (over 30 sec) intra-arterial administration of hexosaminidase A immediately after <b>blood</b> [...] <b>brain</b> <b>barrier</b> disruption resulted in a marked increase in enzyme delivery to the brain when compared with controls without prior barrier disruption. When the enzyme was administered 15 - 20 min after barrier disruption, approximately 50 % less hexosaminidase A was delivered; when given 60 - 120 min after barrier modification, the amount delivered was the same as in control animals. This critical time course is very different than that seen in trials of low molecular weight chemotherapeutic agents (methotrexate and adriamycin). These preliminary studies suggest that hexosaminidase A can be delivered to the <b>brain</b> by <b>blood</b> [...] <b>brain</b> <b>barrier</b> modification and may be indicative of the potential for enzyme replacement in patients who hae Tay [...] Sachs disease...|$|R

To test whether the putative noradrenergic innervation of cerebral microvessels from the nucleus locus ceruleus contributes to the regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase activity of the <b>blood</b> [...] <b>brain</b> <b>barrier,</b> specific [3 H]ouabain-binding studies were performed on cerebral microvessels and crude cortical membranes obtained from Wistar rats with unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine lesion of the nucleus locus ceruleus. Such lesion depleted norepinephrine by about 90 % in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex without affecting the contralateral cortex. [3 H]Ouabain binding to membranes of cerebral cortex and the cerebral microvessels was specific and saturable. The maximal ouabain-binding capacity in microvessels of the ipsilateral, norepinephrine-depleted, cerebral cortex was reduced by about 40 %, without change in the affinity of binding. [3 H]Ouabain binding to crude membrane fractions of the cerebral cortex was not significantly affected by locus ceruleus lesion. The results suggest that Na+/K+-ATPase activity of cerebral microvessels, and the consequent transport of Na+ and K+ across the <b>blood</b> [...] <b>brain</b> <b>barrier,</b> is modulated by noradrenergic innervation from the locus ceruleus...|$|R

40|$|Perturbations in the {{integrity}} of the <b>blood</b> – <b>brain</b> <b>barrier</b> have been reported in both humans and animals under numerous pathological conditions. Although the <b>blood</b> – <b>brain</b> <b>barrier</b> prevents the penetration of many blood constituents into the brain extracellular space, the effect of such perturbations on the brain function and their roles in the pathogenesis of cortical diseases are unknown. In this study we established a model for focal disruption of the <b>blood</b> – <b>brain</b> <b>barrier</b> in the rat cortex by direct application of bile salts. Exposure of the cerebral cortex in vivo to bile salts resulted in long-lasting extravasation of serum albumin to the brain extracellular space and was associated with a prominent activation of astrocytes with no inflammatory response or marked cell loss. Using electrophysiological recordings in brain slices we found that a focus of epileptiform discharges developed within 4 – 7 d after treatment and could be recorded up to 49 d postoperatively in� 60 % of slices from treated animals but only rarely (10 %) in sham-operated controls. Epileptiform activity involved both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Epileptiform activity was also induced by direct cortical application of native serum, denatured serum, or albumin-containing solution. In contrast, perfusion with serum-adapted electrolyte solution did not induce abnormal activity, thereby suggesting that the exposure of the serum-devoid brain environment to serum proteins underlies epileptogenesis in the <b>blood</b> – <b>brain</b> barrier-disrupted cortex.

40|$|Osmotic {{demyelination}} {{syndrome is}} a devastating neurologic condition that occurs after rapid correction of serum sodium {{in patients with}} hyponatremia. Pathologic features of this injury include a well-demarcated region of myelin loss, {{a breakdown of the}} <b>blood</b> - <b>brain</b> <b>barrier,</b> and infiltration of microglia. The semisynthetic tetracycline minocycline is protective in some animal models of central nervous system injury, including demyelination, suggesting that it may also protect against demyelination resulting from rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. Using a rat model of osmotic demyelination syndrome, we found that treatment with minocycline significantly decreases brain demyelination, alleviates neurologic manifestations, and reduces mortality associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia. Mechanistically, minocycline decreased the permeability of the <b>blood</b> - <b>brain</b> <b>barrier,</b> inhibited microglial activation, decreased both the expression of IL 1 α and protein nitrosylation, and reduced the loss of GFAP immunoreactivity. In conclusion, minocycline modifies the course of osmotic demyelination in rats, suggesting its possible therapeutic use in the setting of inadvertent rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia in humans.

As with all lipid-soluble anaesthetic drugs, the short duration of action of sodium thiopental is due almost entirely to its redistribution away from central circulation towards muscle and fat tissue, due to its very high fat:water partition coefficient (aprx 10), leading to sequestration in fat tissue. Once redistributed, the free fraction in the blood is metabolized in the liver. Sodium thiopental is mainly metabolized to pentobarbital, 5-ethyl-5-(1'-methyl-3'-hydroxybutyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid, and 5-ethyl-5-(1'-methyl-3'-carboxypropyl)-2-thiobarbituric acid.|$|E

Through the analysis of Golgi staining, In situ hybridization, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunofluorescence staining we were able to distinguish glial-like cells in the metazoans Nematostella vectensis, Dugesia tigrina, Dugesia dorotocephala and Carybdea species. These glial-like cells appear to have an equivalent relationship with neuronal cells as the glial cells do in the nervous system of vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{fluorescent}} calcium indicating dyes {{over the}} past decade have identified calcium signaling as the tool by which astrocytes communicate among themselves and with neighboring neurons. Studies of astrocyte–neuron interactions have shown that calcium signaling is a potent modulator of the strength of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The concept that astrocytes possess a mechanism for rapid cell communication has not been incorporated, however, into the supportive functions of astrocytes. Because many of the classical tasks of astrocytes are linked to the <b>blood</b> – <b>brain</b> <b>barrier,</b> we have here examined the expression of proteins required for calcium signaling in their vascular end-foot processes. The gap junction protein, Cx 43, was expressed intensively around the vessels interconnecting astrocytic end-foot processes. These gap junctions permitted diffusion of Lucifer yellow, specifically along the path of glial end feet apposed to the vessel wall. The purinergic receptors, P 2 Y(2) and P 2 Y(4), were also strongly expressed at the gliovascular interface and colocalized with GFAP around larger vessels in cortex. Multiphoton imaging of freshly prepared brain slices loaded with Fluo- 4 /AM revealed that ATP mobilized cytosolic calcium in astrocytic end feet, whereas electrical stimulation triggered calcium waves propagating along the vessel wall. Brain endothelial cells and pericytes were physically separated from astrocytes by the basal lamina and responded only weakly to ATP. These observations identify astrocytic end-foot processes plastered at the vessel wall as a center for purinergic signaling. It is speculated that calcium signaling {{may play a role in}} astrocytic functions related to the <b>blood</b> – <b>brain</b> <b>barrier,</b> including <b>blood</b> flow regulation, metabolic trafficking, and water homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|The {{aging process}} {{correlates}} with a progressive {{failure in the}} normal cellular and organ functioning; these alterations are aggravated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In both aging and AD {{there is a general}} decrease in the capacity of the body to eliminate toxic compounds and, simultaneously, to supply the brain with relevant growth and nutritional factors. The <b>barriers</b> of the <b>brain</b> are targets of this age related dysfunction; both the endothelial cells of the <b>blood</b> [...] <b>brain</b> <b>barrier</b> and the choroid plexus epithelial cells of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier decrease their secretory capacity towards the brain and their ability to remove toxic compounds from the brain. Additionally, during normal aging and in AD, the permeability of the <b>brain</b> <b>barriers</b> increase. As such, a greater contact of the brain parenchyma with the blood content alters the highly controlled neural environment, which impacts on neural function. Of interest, the <b>brain</b> <b>barriers</b> are more than mere obstacles to the passage of molecules and cells, and therefore active players in brain homeostasis, which is still to be further recognized and investigated in the context of health and disease.
