500|$|J. W. Buchanan, {{reviewing}} {{the second edition}} in Physiological Zoology in 1943, described it as [...] "an imposing extension of his earlier attempt to formulate a geometry of Growth and Form" [...] and [...] "beautifully written", but warned that [...] "the reading will not be easy" [...] and that [...] "A vast store of literature has here been assembled and assimilated". Buchanan summarizes the book, and notes that Chapter 17 [...] "seems to the reviewer to contain {{the essence of the}} long and more or less leisurely thesis... The chapter is devoted to comparison of related forms, largely by the method of co-ordinates. Fundamental differences in these forms are thus revealed", and Buchanan concludes that the large [...] "gaps" [...] indicate that Darwin's endless series of continuous variations is not substantiated. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> some criticisms: Thompson should have referenced the effects of hormones on growth; and the relation of molecular configuration and form; genetics is barely mentioned, and experimental embryology and regeneration [...] are overlooked. The mathematics used consists of statistics and geometry, while thermodynamics is [...] "largely absent".|$|E
2500|$|Border was {{a capable}} bowler, but, as captain, he underused himself, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a {{tendency}} to bowl around the wicket, aiming outside off stump and bowling short. [...] He also distinguished himself as a fielder, especially in his early days as a catcher at what Knox rated [...] "the hardest position, the wide third-to-fifth slips." ...|$|E
2500|$|Can White {{stop the}} h-pawn from queening? The {{position}} looks lost for White <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a defence {{which seems to}} defy the rules of logic. White will calmly construct a [...] "fortress" [...] which will hide his pieces from attack. The only weakness in White's [...] "fortress" [...] is the g-pawn. This pawn has to be defended by the bishop and the only square where {{this can be done}} safely is from h6.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, Ukrainian {{prisoner}} Nikolai Getman {{who spent}} the years 1945–1953 in Kolyma, records his testimony in pictures rather than words. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a plea: [...] "Some may say that the Gulag is a forgotten part of history {{and that we do}} not need to be reminded. But I have witnessed monstrous crimes. It is not too late to talk about them and reveal them. It is essential to do so. Some have expressed fear on seeing some of my paintings that I might end up in Kolyma again— this time for good. But the people must be reminded... of one of the harshest acts of political repression in the Soviet Union. My paintings may help achieve this." [...] The Jamestown Foundation provides access to all 50 of Getman's paintings together with explanations of their significance.|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{has stated}} that Harry's {{character}} flaws include anger and impulsiveness; however, Harry is also innately honourable. [...] "He's not a cruel boy. He's competitive, and he's a fighter. He doesn't just lie down and take abuse. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> native integrity, which makes him a hero to me. He's a normal boy but with those qualities most of us really admire." [...] For the most part, Harry shows humility and modesty, often downplaying his achievements; though he uses a litany of his adventures as examples of his maturity early in the fifth book. However, these very same accomplishments are later employed {{to explain why he}} should lead Dumbledore's Army, at which point he asserts them as having just been luck, and denies that they make him worthy of authority. After the seventh book, Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength, which not even Voldemort possesses: the acceptance of the inevitability of death.|$|E

Who {{in the real world}} of serious {{diplomacy}} shows up in Geneva with a red plastic toy reset button, complete with a mistranslated Russian label? When Putin soon sized up the Obama administration's appeasement around the globe—from fake red lines for Syria, to a scramble out of Iraq, to chaos in Libya—he moved into Crimea...As he swallows Eastern Ukraine, he now eyes the Baltic States. He does not quite have a map on his wall of a new czarist Orthodox state the size of the Soviet Union, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>have</b> a general sense {{that there are a lot}} more former Soviet republics to be had—and he is eager to poke here and there to find out which will be the easiest to grab next." [...] In another 2015 column, Hanson wrote about he sees as Putin's mindset that: [...] "Obama's false step-over, red, and deadlines confirmed Putin's impressions of the continued weak leadership of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry. He probably believes that he can do to Estonia what he has done to Crimea or Ukraine—and without too many more consequences. Putin is not greatly worried that the U.S. will re-energize NATO, rebuild its own nuclear deterrent, work with the Eastern Europeans on missile defense, or start exporting its plentiful natural gas to a Russia-dependent Europe. Right now Putin is digesting Eastern Ukraine and sizing up Obama's responses to others' aggressions. But next year, in the last twelve months of the Obama administration, we should expect him to move on another former Soviet republic, as well as to emphasize new partnerships with China, a few Eastern European or Balkan nations, or an ascendant Iran." ...|$|E
