50|$|The driving figure {{behind the}} {{formation}} of the Bank was James Lumsden, a stationer by business, a councillor, police commissioner and, later, Lord Provost of Glasgow. Another member of the founding committee, Henry Brock, became the Bank's first manager. Brock came of a merchant family, was an accountant and {{one of the founders of}} the Glasgow Savings <b>Bank.</b> Despite the <b>declaration</b> in the advertisement, in the year after formation the Bank opened three Glasgow branches as well as its first country branches in Campbeltown and Falkirk; a further seven had been opened by 1844. These were supplemented by the acquisition of the Greenock Union Bank; formed in 1840, it had four branches in the Glasgow hinterland.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{specific features}} of establishment of new regulatory standards of systemically important banks {{as one of}} the most priority directions of post-crisis improvement of supranational financial regulation. The essense of active and prearranged initiatives to secure constant activity of global and domestic powerful super-big banking institutions is investigated as well as some approaches as to recovery measures implementation without involvement of taxpayers' funds in case of their financial failure are considered. In particular, the main points are focused on introduction of additional requirements to the sufficiency of capital of global systemically important banks, development of the regulatory mechanisms of domestic systemically important banks by domestic authorities taking into account the specific peculiarities of certain national economies, structural reforms as to separation of traditional banking from the securities transactions for the depositors protection (Volcker rule, USA; Vickers rule, UK), establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism for the Eurozone <b>banks,</b> and <b>declaration</b> of necessity to form the Single mechanism for bank bankruptcy resolution etc. Some proposals concerning transformation of domestic system of financial regulation and supervision in Ukraine, like strengthening control of systemically important banks activity and introduction of mega-regulator model are characterized...|$|R
2500|$|In August 1914 {{the gold}} {{reserves}} of the Bank of England, and effectively of all banking institutions in Great Britain, amounted to £ (equivalent to £ in 2015). The <b>banks</b> feared the <b>declaration</b> of war would trigger {{a run on}} the banks, so the Chancellor David Lloyd George extended the August bank holiday for three days to allow time for {{the passing of the}} Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914, by which Britain left the gold standard. Under this Act the Treasury issued £ (equivalent to £ in 2013) of paper banknotes, without the backing of gold, with which the banks could repay their obligations. Leading banker Walter Leaf described these Treasury notes as [...] "essentially a War Loan free of interest, for an unlimited period, and as such was a highly profitable expedient {{from the point of view}} of the Government".|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} and {{they were on the}} <b>bank,</b> and Leonard's <b>declaration</b> {{remained}} unspoken. Nor did he make any attempt to renew it. It seemed to him that Juanna had built a wall between them which he could not climb. From that evening forward her whole attitude towards him changed. She no longer angered him by bitter words; indeed, she was gentleness itself, and nothing could be kindlier or more friendly and open than her manner, but there it began and ended. Once or twice, indeed, he attempted some small advance, with the result that instantly she seemed to freeze--to become cold and hard as marble. He could not understand her, he feared her somewhat, and his pride took alarm. At the least he could keep his feelings to himself, he need not expose them to be trampled upon by this incomprehensible girl.|$|R
50|$|On {{abandoning the}} gold {{standard}} in 1931, the Scandinavian countries took steps to maintain for the consumer a constant buying power for their respective currencies. Finland’s central <b>bank</b> made a <b>declaration</b> to this effect. The Riksbank of Sweden has done the same, and its action was officially confirmed by the Swedish Government. As a result, since then people of those fortunate lands have never lost confidence in their money. The buying power of their monetary units have been maintained constant within a few per cent since 1931. At the same time, these countries have made conscious use of monetary policy as {{an essential part of}} their efforts to promote domestic prosperity. They have been so successful as to have practically eliminated unemployment to have raised their production figures to new peaks and to have improved steadily the scale of living of their people.|$|R

60|$|Let us go {{a little}} further. You {{remember}} we once had a National Bank. Some one owed the bank a debt; he was sued, and sought to avoid payment {{on the ground that}} the bank was unconstitutional. The case went to the Supreme Court, and therein it was decided that the bank was constitutional. The whole Democratic party revolted against that decision. General Jackson himself asserted that he, as President, would not be bound to hold a National Bank to be constitutional, even though the court had decided it to be so. He fell in precisely with the view of Mr. Jefferson, and acted upon it under his official oath, in vetoing a charter for a National <b>Bank.</b> The <b>declaration</b> that Congress does not possess this constitutional power to charter a bank has gone into the Democratic platform, at their National Conventions, and was brought forward and reaffirmed in their last Convention at Cincinnati. They have contended for that declaration, in the very teeth of the Supreme Court, for {{more than a quarter of}} a century. In fact, they have reduced the decision to an absolute nullity. That decision, I repeat, is repudiated in the Cincinnati platform; and still, as if to show that effrontery can go no further, Judge Douglas vaunts in the very speeches in which he denounces me for opposing the Dred Scott decision that he stands on the Cincinnati platform.|$|R
