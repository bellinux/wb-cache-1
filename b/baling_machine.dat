40|$|Straw bale {{construction}} has recently gained more confidence {{to be used}} as structural elements. A number of laboratory tests worldwide, show this system to be capable of supporting substantial service loads in case of proper baling, stacking, and plastering. In Egypt, growing attention is focused on examining this new trend of construction in order to solve the environmental pollution caused by burning millions of tons of straw every year. Two types of mobile straw baling mechanical powered press machines are commonly used in Egypt, private local small sized iron <b>baling</b> <b>machines</b> and Cicoria straw <b>baling</b> <b>machines.</b> These two <b>baling</b> systems have major differences in their end product physical properties, baling, and mainly their compressing techniques. Rare information is available about the mechanical characteristics of local bales. This paper is part of a pioneer national project aiming to use rice straw bales in building. The research aims to identify the specifications and characteristics of locally produced rice straw bales used for building. The bales are compressed under various compressibility conditions to identify the settlement that is expected to happen in most of the types of bales available in the market. Experimental studies are carried out on the effect of compressibility and baling on the quality of single un-rendered straw bales in general, and particularly it's displacement under vertical load. These experiments are conducted on single un-rendered bales from different sources, by applying incremental vertical load, reaching 50 tons. Results of corresponding displacements of different types of bales from different sources are recorde...|$|R

5000|$|Typically [...] "field bales" [...] (bales {{created on}} farms with <b>baling</b> <b>machines)</b> have been used, but {{recently}} higher-density [...] "precompressed" [...] bales (or [...] "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads {{that may be}} supported. Oryzatech out of Goleta, California has been developing rice straw compressed block. [...] Field bales might support around 900 kg per linear meter of wall (600 lb./ lin. ft.), but the high density bales bear up to 6000 kg per linear meter of wall (4,000 lb./lin.ft.), and more. The basic bale-building method is now increasingly being extended to bound modules of other oft-recycled materials, including tire-bales, cardboard, paper, plastic, and used carpeting.

50|$|The Homestead Act of 1862 brought {{property}} ownership within reach {{for millions of}} citizens, displaced native peoples, and changed the character of settlement patterns across the Great Plains and Southwest. The law offered a modest farm free of charge to any adult male who cultivated the land {{for five years and}} built a residence on the property. This established a rural pattern of isolated farmsteads in the Midwest and West instead of the European and eastern U.S. states' villages and towns. Settlers built homes from local materials, such as rustic sod, semi-cut stone, mortared cobble, adobe bricks, and rough logs. They erected log cabins in forested areas and sod houses, such as the Sod House (Cleo Springs, Oklahoma), in treeless prairies. The present day sustainable architecture method of Straw-bale construction was pioneered in late-19th-century Nebraska with <b>baling</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

A combination component of auger and toss machine is adopted in the feeding system. The sliding block of compressor is driven by rod-crank mechanism.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} of mechanical properties and accelerated aging of monoaxially stretched polyethylene strips coming from three types of polymeric mesh, which serves to pack hay on <b>baling</b> <b>machines.</b> The strength of the strips is evaluated from two points of view. The first one is static tensile strength measured before and after accelerated aging at 23 °C and 40 °C, the second one determines the strength as the weight that causes the strip failure on a simple machine at 23, 40, 60 and 80 ° C. The {{results show that the}} smallest static strength has the least stabilized strip, which, on the other hand, revealed the highest strength in a dynamic loading. The change of supermolecular structure was evaluated by calorimetric measurements. The data shown only very little change of inner structure due to the average response of the whole crystalline phase comprising relatively wide distribution of crystallites. It is more than probable that supermolecular structure had been changed but the method is not sensitive to see the change of orientation of lamellae and macromolecular chains in them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the combine harvested paddy (variety-Kranti) and wheat (HI- 8498) field. The crop gatherer cum baler was used for collection and baling of crop residues left in the field. Collection and gathering losses were determined for given condition and quantity of straw in the field. Moisture content of loose paddy and wheat straw was 15 % and 8 % respectively. Field operation was conducted at forward speed of 2. 7 km/h and with collecting width of 1240 mm. The number of twine tied bales obtained per h was 181 and 87 with bale density of 200 and 102 kg/m 3 and bale mass of 22 and 10 kg respectively for rice and wheat crop. The collection and gathering losses were 18. 40 % for rice and 41. 12 % for wheat. The cost of producing one twine tied bale was Rs. 2. 75 and Rs. 5. 00 for rice and wheat respectively. At nominal price of rice straw (Rs. 0. 25 /kg) and wheat straw (Rs. 0. 75 /kg) the net income from straw collection and <b>baling</b> using the <b>machine</b> was Rs. 607. 00 per ha and Rs. 235. 00 per ha for rice straw and wheat straw respectively.
