500|$|The lyrical {{and musical}} content of Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too was {{compared}} {{to a variety of}} artists. The Encyclopedia of Popular Music likened the New Radicals' politically oriented lyrics to British rock band Chumbawamba. In Entertainment Weeklys review of the album, critic Tom Sinclair compared the album's music to that of Hanson. The Los Angeles Times compared the New Radicals to the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. Alexander's vocal performance drew frequent comparisons to Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins, while a review by AllMusic suggested his vocals were similar to Mick Jagger's. In Consequence of Sound, critic Justin Gerber commented that the album [...] "made Gregg Alexander the 90's answer to Phil Spector, without the <b>bad</b> <b>rap</b> of murdering people." ...|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} almost universally negative reviews from music critics, for its songwriting, instrumentation, Black's singing voice, and the video choreography. Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music {{asked if it}} could be [...] "the worst song ever." [...] On March 29, 2011, it surpassed Justin Bieber's [...] "Baby" [...] as the most disliked YouTube video, with 1.17 million dislikes, and once had over 3 million [...] "dislikes", accounting for 88% of the total ratings of the video. The video was later removed, although it has since been officially re-uploaded. The co-writer and producer of [...] "Friday", Clarence Jey, said about the song that [...] "the concept we feel seems to have crossed a lot of boundaries, for the better or worse." [...] Observers have called it [...] "bizarre," [...] "inept," [...] and [...] "hilariously dreadful." [...] The song and Black herself were [...] "savaged" [...] on social networks across the Internet, while being seen as a [...] "YouTube laughing stock." [...] On YouTube, the video was met with negative comments and video responses, including comments interpreted as [...] "violent". Kevin Rutherford, a columnist for Billboard magazine, wrote, [...] "Black's video for 'Friday' is one of those rare occurrences where even the most seasoned critics of Internet culture don't know where to begin. From the singing straight out of Auto-Tuned hell to lyrics such as 'Tomorrow is Saturday / And Sunday comes afterwards / I don't want this weekend to end' and a hilariously <b>bad</b> <b>rap</b> about passing school buses, 'Friday' is something that simply must be seen and heard to be fully appreciated." [...] Many other reviewers also singled out the lyrics in particular for criticism, which were described as [...] "overly simple and repetitive" [...] by TNT Magazine. Jim Edwards of BNET and Doug Gross of CNN both noted that the rap break from the considerably older rapper was [...] "creepy." [...] Time ranked it number two on a list of [...] "Top 10 Songs with Silly Lyrics."' ...|$|E

[...] In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 55th best hero in video games while UGO Networks ranked him as the 57th best hero in entertainment in 2010.

2500|$|Dom Sinacola of Slant Magazine said, [...] "More than that, it furthers {{the general}} {{message of the}} whole album, which is that for all his posturing and charm, Glover may not have it in him to {{participate}} in the kind of bacchanalia required of his position as a young, burgeoning, multi-talented rap star. Halfway between throwaway wordplay and trenchant comment about fame, the lyric says a lot about where Glover's head is at: As a former sketch comedian, writer on 30 Rock, and star of the sitcom Community, he leans on his wit as his most formidable weapon." [...] Philip Cosores of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "Yes, the dedication that Glover has seemingly displayed in the project is admirable. But he just doesn't seem to get music on this album. Maybe it's because of his taste, or because he is trying too hard to stand out, or because of his hubris, or because he has lost touch with reality, or maybe it is because of the internet." [...] Phillip Mlynar of Spin said, [...] "The only reaction that Because the Internet elicits is the uncontrollable urge to skip to the next song, in hopes that things couldn't possibly get any sloppier. But they do, beginning with the cod-wailing that blights [...] "Crawl" [...] and volleying with the psychedelic muzak of [...] "The Worst Guys" [...] (co-starring Chance the Rapper) and [...] "Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)," [...] which sounds like Glover has inadvertently locked himself in his practice space and is attempting to muster up a loud enough mess so that some kindly passerby will hear his cries for help. As the album collapses into itself with the closing cut, [...] "Life: The Biggest Troll (Andrew Auernheimer)," [...] we're resigned to existence as a gloopy mess of random thoughts. [...] "Where's the line between Donny G and Gambino?" [...] the rapper muses, but it's unclear whether this is meant as a genuine identity crisis or an all-knowing middle finger to critics. Maybe the entire album is a meme itself, a grand existential joke critiquing the all-conquering rise of Internet culture by parodying its overwhelming randomness. Whatever it is, though, it's a <b>bad</b> <b>rap</b> record." ...|$|E

It was decided that we would hone our comedy skills instead of our rapping skills and turned the BR website into a blog.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Hanson gave {{a mostly}} {{favorable}} review {{to the book}} Colossus by the British historian Niall Ferguson, where Ferguson argued that the United States should be an imperial power {{in the sense of}} preserving the post war order of global free trade, communications, and commerce, and the principal problem with Americans was that they were unwilling to embrace global leadership {{in the same way that}} people in 19th century Britain did. Hanson found much to approve of in Ferguson's book, writing: [...] "In reality, we should be natural imperialists, given our wealth and expertise. Americans are also endowed with an exceptional moral sense. We are a generous people, whose checkered imperial interventions in the past rarely proved profitable or exploitive." [...] Hanson agreed with Ferguson that the principle problem with Americans was an unease at playing the role of an imperialistic power, argued that post-1945 histories of Germany and Japan proved the beneficial results of American occupation and predicted that Iraq under American occupation would become just as much a prosperous and democratic society as Germany and Japan are. Hanson praised Ferguson for his defense of the British Empire as a benevolent force and his thesis that the United States should play the same role in the world as the British Empire, writing: [...] "Does Ferguson propose a new American liberal empire? In fact, he does almost, but not before noting that the British Victorians themselves got a <b>bad</b> <b>rap</b> as exploitive colonialists. In fact, the record of the 18th and 19th centuries prove exactly the opposite: Former and once-prosperous colonies, following autonomy, quickly turned into self-induced miseries, while Britain itself thrived as never before once free of these costly obligations. Empire turns out not to be a means of making money, but instead an idealist pursuit to keep sea lanes open, bullies at bay and nations trading rather than fighting. The world has been lucky to have the Americans fill this vacuum, inasmuch as the British once did a pretty good job of it as well." [...] Hanson, well before the immigration and financial crises of the EU, also praised Ferguson for his very negative picture of the European Union as being both [...] "busy triangulating with our enemies" [...] and [...] "running huge trade deficits with us as we supply their own security needs." [...] He cites appears to agree with Ferguson that Europe is undemocratic, and statist, but that with a population in decline and even worse entitlement overspending than the US, a more broken melting pot, and socialist response to these issues ensuring Europe will be unable generate the unity or idealism required to supplant the US.|$|E
