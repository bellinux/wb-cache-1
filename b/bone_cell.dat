To our knowledge, there is no description of human primary fetal <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> treated with differentiation factors. The characterization of fetal <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> is particularly important as the pattern of secreted proteins from osteoblasts {{has been shown to}} change during aging.

Cell proliferation, gene expression of bone markers, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and mineralization were analyzed during a time-course study. In the second part of this paper, <b>bone</b> fetal <b>cells</b> behavior exposed to osteogenic factors is further detailed. The doubling time of fetal <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> was comparable to mesenchymal stem cells but significantly shorter than for adult <b>bone</b> <b>cells.</b> Gene expression of cbfa- 1, ALP, alpha 1 chain of type I collagen, and osteocalcin were upregulated in fetal <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> after 12 days of treatment, with higher inductions than for adult and mesenchymal stem cells. The increase of ALP enzymatic activity was stronger for fetal than for adult <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> reaching a maximum at day 10, but lower than for mesenchymal stem cells.

40|$|Numerous {{experiments}} have shown fluid flow to be a potent stimulator of <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro, suggesting that fluid flow {{is an important}} physical signal in bone mechanotransduction. In fluid flow experiments, <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> are exposed to both time-dependent (e. g. oscillating or pulsing) and time-independent (e. g. steady) flow profiles. Interestingly, the signaling response of <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> shows dependence on loading frequency and/or rate that has been postulated {{to be due to}} viscoelastic behavior. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the time-dependent deformations of <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to fluid flow in vitro. Specifically, our goal was to characterize the mechanical response of <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to oscillatory flow from 0. 5 - 2. 0 Hz and steady flow, since these flow profiles have previously been shown to induce different morphological and biochemical responses in vitro. By tracking cell-bound sulfate and collagen coated fluorescent beads of varying sizes, we quantified the normalized peak deformation (peak displacement normalized by the maximum peak displacement observed for all frequencies) and phase lag in <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to 1. 0 Pa oscillating flow at frequencies of 0. 5 - 2. 0 Hz. The phase lag was small (3 ~ 10 °) and frequency dependent, while the normalized peak displacements decreased as a weak power law of frequency (~f- 0. 2). During steady flow, the cells exhibited a nearly instantaneous deformation, followed by creep. Our results suggest that while substantial viscous deformation may occur during steady flow (compared to oscillating flow at ~ 1 Hz), <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> behave primarily as elastic bodies when exposed to flow at frequencies associated with habitual loading...|$|R

40|$|Bone {{implants}} {{infected with}} Staphylococcus epidermidis often require surgical intervention {{because of the}} failure of antibiotic treatment.

In this study we have investigated the hypothesis that S. epidermidis can also invade <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> and may therefore explain the difficulties of treating infections with this organism. We found that S. epidermidis was capable of invading <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> but that there were significant strain dependent differences in this capacity. A recombinant protein encompassing the D 1 -D 4 repeat region of S. aureus fibronectin-binding protein B completely, inhibited internalization of S. aureus but failed to block internalization of S. epidermidis. Similarly a blocking antibody to alpha 5 ss 1 integrin inhibited internalization of S. aureus by <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> but had no effect on the uptake of S. epidermidis. Therefore unlike S. aureus, S. epidermidis does not gain entrance into <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> through a fibronectin bridge between the alpha 5 ss 1 integrin and a bacterial adhesin.

40|$|Bone {{tissue is}} {{continuously}} remodeled through the concerted actions of <b>bone</b> <b>cells,</b> which include <b>bone</b> resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts, whereas osteocytes act as mechanosensors and orchestrators {{of the bone}} remodeling process.

40|$|Alterations in bone tissue {{composition}} during osteoporosis likely {{disrupt the}} mechanical environment of <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> and may thereby initiate a mechanobiological response. It has proved challenging {{to characterize the}} mechanical environment of <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo, and the mechanical environment of osteoporotic <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> is not known. The objective {{of this research is}} to characterize the local mechanical environment of osteocytes and osteoblasts from healthy and osteoporotic bone in a rat model of osteoporosis. Using a custom-designed micromechanical loading device, we apply strains representative of a range of physical activity (up to 3000 mu epsilon) to fluorescently stained femur samples from normal and ovariectomized rats. Confocal imaging was simultaneously performed, and digital image correlation techniques were applied to characterize cellular strains. In healthy bone tissue, osteocytes experience higher maximum strains (31, 028 +/- 4213 mu epsilon) than osteoblasts (24, 921 +/- 3, 832 mu epsilon), whereas a larger proportion of the osteoblast experiences strains > 10, 000 mu epsilon. Most interestingly, we show that osteoporotic <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> experience similar or higher maximum strains than healthy <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> after short durations of estrogen deficiency (5 weeks), and exceeded the osteogenic strain threshold (10, 000 mu epsilon) in a similar or significantly larger proportion of the cell (osteoblast, 12. 68 % vs. 13. 68 %; osteocyte, 15. 74 % vs. 5. 37 %). However, in long-term estrogen deficiency (34 weeks), {{there was no significant difference}} between <b>bone</b> <b>cells</b> in healthy and osteoporotic bone.
