5|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} state commission includes {{officials from}} the Bulgarian ministries of defence, economy and finance and, according to the caretaker government's deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, {{the main reason for}} choosing the Swedish contestant is the favourable financial terms offered by Saab, including a lease option and offset agreements. In his words, the Swedish offer accounts for about one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese one accounts a price of about one and a half billion BGN for the aircraft alone. The decision is pending the approval of the next regular Bulgarian government and, more importantly, of the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Parliament.</b> The second-place offer is to be retained as a back-up option, should the negotiations with Saab not be concluded successfully, as the financial resources for this program are budgeted until the end of 2017. The new fighters are to replace both the MiG-29 fighters of Graf Ignatievo Air Base and the Su-25 attack aircraft of Bezmer Air Base, as well as to fill the gap left by the retirement of the country's dedicated Su-22 reconnaissance airplanes.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of a corpus study of parliamentary discourse in English and Bulgarian. The key word lists in corpora from the <b>Bulgarian</b> and British <b>Parliaments</b> are compared in terms of the conceptual categories they present. The analysis reveals which parliamentary specifics can be established from observing linguistic features. The corpora compiled {{for the purposes of the}} study are from the parliamentary Hansards of the British and <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Parliaments</b> for January 2009, of about 3 million running words each. The Word Smith is used for deriving key word lists, collocates and 3 - 7 -word clusters. The key- word lists in both corpora are classified into semantic classes and the comparison establishes what features of the social practice stand behind the keyness. The conclusions reveal differences between parliamentary practices in both Parliaments, direct towards tendencies signalled by the keyness of specific entries and suggest methodological issues connected with the application of critical discourse analysis combined with corpus linguistics...|$|R
