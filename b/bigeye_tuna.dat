5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the night shark globally as Vulnerable, citing its slow reproductive rate and historical declines under fishing pressure. It {{has also been}} listed as Vulnerable by the American Fisheries Society (AFS). This species was once {{a significant part of}} the Cuban artisanal shark fishery, comprising 6075% of the catch from 1937 to 1941, before its numbers dropped substantially in the 1970s. Similarly, the proportion of night sharks in the shark catch of the southeastern U.S. pelagic longline fishery fell from 26.1% from 1981 to 1983 to 0.33.3% in 1993 and 1994; a comparable decline was observed in catches by south Florida marlin tournaments since the 1970s. Currently, the intense Brazilian targeted fishery is of particular concern, although fishing pressure on the night shark may be relaxing as the fishery is beginning to shift towards swordfish and <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus obesus). No fishery information on the night shark is available for the eastern Atlantic, leading to an IUCN assessment of Data Deficient for that region.|$|E

Analysis of over 14, 000 tuna stomachs, using a modified classification tree approach, revealed {{for the first time}} the global expanse of pelagic predatory fish diet and global patterns of micronekton diversity. Ommastrephid squids were consistently one of the top prey groups by weight across all tuna species and in most ocean bodies. Interspecific differences in prey were apparent, with epipelagic scombrid and mesopelagic paralepidid fishes globally important for yellowfin and <b>bigeye</b> <b>tunas,</b> respectively, while vertically-migrating euphausiid crustaceans were important for albacore tuna in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Diet diversity showed global and regional patterns among tuna species. In the central and western Pacific Ocean, characterized by low productivity, a high diversity of micronekton prey was detected while low prey diversity was evident in highly productive coastal waters where upwelling occurs. Spatial patterns of diet diversity were most variable in yellowfin and <b>bigeye</b> <b>tunas</b> while a latitudinal diversity gradient was observed with lower diversity in temperate regions for albacore tuna. Sea-surface temperature was a reasonable predictor of the diets of yellowfin and <b>bigeye</b> <b>tunas,</b> whereas chlorophyll-a was the best environmental predictor of albacore diet. These results suggest that the ongoing expansion of warmer, less productive waters in the world's oceans may alter foraging opportunities for tunas due to regional changes in prey abundances and compositions...|$|R

In this paper, we investigated the spatial distribution of C. pauciradiatus in the Indian Ocean using pelagic trawl catches carried out between 20 degrees N and 45 degrees S, and the importance of bigeye cigarfish in the diet of 9 piscivorous fishes sampled by different fishing gears in the western part of the Indian Ocean. The highest densities were observed along the eastern coast of Africa and in the Arabian Sea (87 000 individuals per square nautical mile) during the South-West Monsoon and in the eastern part of the Seychelles archipelago (62 200 ind. square nmi) during the North-East Monsoon. Small sized bigeye cigarfish (20 - 80 mm SL) was a regular and abundant prey (20 to 200 ind. per stomach) for schooling predators exploited by purse seine fishery such as large yellowfin and <b>bigeye</b> <b>tunas</b> chasing prey near the sea surface. Large sized bigeye cigarfish (61 - 150 mm SL) occurred in small numbers (3 to 20 ind. per stomach) in the stomach contents of swordfish and of large yellowfin and <b>bigeye</b> <b>tunas</b> caught by longline sets at great depths.

The tuna fishery has been the mainstay of the economy eversince the introduction of longlining to the industry in the early 1990 ’s.

We will further examine market structure and degree of concentration of world sashimi market. Other two species, Yellowfin and Albacore, are consumed both as canned product and Sashimi. Export price of Sashimi tuna is more than twice as high as that for canned material. Nevertheless, the supply of tuna to canning sector has not been ended off nor had the resource been depleted yet as a result of competitive catch. It is expected that the difference of fishing / distribution costs, demanded size, and the risk-return composition influenced the behavior of world tuna fishers and allowed some diversity in fishing methods and distribution.

Individuals undertake thermoregulatory behaviour whilst at depth, periodically returning from deeper, cooler waters to shallower, warmer waters to re-warm. Across the Pacific Ocean the depths at which <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> spend {{the majority of their}} time during the day vary: in the eastern Pacific the majority of time is spent at 200-350 m; around Hawaii the majority of time is spent at 300-400 m and in the Coral Sea the majority of time is spent at 300-500 m. These suggest that <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> (or their prey) are tracking an optimum temperature (10-15 °C) which is shallower in the eastern Pacific Ocean than in the western Pacific Ocean.

Current approaches to managing bigeye {{in both the}} Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) and the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) entail permanently closed areas, such as the “correlito” in the EPO, temporary time-area closures such as shutting down fishing {{on the high seas}} in the WCPO, and closing the entire FAD fishery for extended periods of time (one or more months), such as in both the EPO and WCPO. Such effort management can reduce bigeye bycatch through reducing all FAD catches, but suffers from several inefficiencies: (1) fishing spills over to other modes of fishing, notably setting on dolphins or on free schools with subsequent impact upon biodiversity, notably bycatch, and creating ecological-biodiversity trade-offs; (2) with growing overcapacity, closed periods must become increasingly extended to reduce bigeye bycatch, lowering target catch and profits and even making some vessels unprofitable. By  not pricing bycatch at the margin, incentives are not created: (1) to efficiently reduce the proportion of bycatch in total catch as well as all catch; (2) change behavior throughout the supply chain and consumers as the internalized bycatch external cost is passed through the supply chain; (3) to generate dynamic incentives to induce or direct bycatch reducing technological change. Transferable bycatch credit systems and risk pools are proposed to reduce bycatch to incentivize real-time spatial management and induce directed, bycatch-reducing technological change...|$|R

40|$|Background: Seamounts {{have been}} {{identified}} as aggregating locations for pelagic biodiversity including tuna; however the topography and prevailing oceanography differ between seamounts and not all are important for tuna. Although a relatively common feature in oceanic ecosystems, little information is available that identifies those that are biologically important. Improved knowledge offers opportunities for unique management of these areas, which may advance the sustainable management of oceanic resources. In this study, we evaluate the existence of an association between seamounts and tuna longline fisheries at the ocean basin scale, identify significant seamounts for tuna in the western and central Pacific Ocean, and quantify the seamount contribution to the tuna longline catch. Methodology/Principal Findings: We use data collected for the Western and Central Pacific Ocean for bigeye, yellowfin, and albacore tuna at the ocean basin scale. GLMs were applied to a coupled dataset of longline fisheries catch and effort, and seamount location information. The analyses show that seamounts may be associated with an annual longline combined catch of 35 thousand tonnes, with higher catch apparent for yellowfin, <b>bigeye,</b> and albacore <b>tuna</b> on 17 %, 14 %, and 14 % of seamounts respectively. In contrast 14 %, 18 %, and 20 % of seamounts had significantly lower catches for yellowfin, <b>bigeye</b> and albacore <b>tuna</b> respectively.
