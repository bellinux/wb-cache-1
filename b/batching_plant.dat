5000|$|A {{concrete}} plant, {{also known}} as a batch plant or <b>batching</b> <b>plant</b> or a concrete <b>batching</b> <b>plant,</b> is equipment that combines various ingredients to form concrete. Some of these inputs include water, air, admixtures, sand, aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.), fly ash, silica fume, slag, and cement. There are two main types of concrete plants: Dry mix plants and Wet mix plants, and also plants that contain both a transit mix side and a central mix side while utilizing common material storage points. A concrete plant can have a variety of parts and accessories, including: mixers (either tilt drum or horizontal or in some cases both), cement batchers, aggregate batchers, conveyors, radial stackers, aggregate bins, cement bins, heaters, chillers, cement silos, batch plant controls, and dust collectors.|$|E

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to centralized <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> system is the volumetric mobile mixers. Often referred to as On Site Concrete, Site Mixed Concrete or Mobile Mix Concrete. This is a mobile miniaturized version of the large stationary <b>batch</b> <b>plant.</b> They are used to provide Ready Mix Concrete utilizing a continuous batching process or metered concrete system. The volumetric mobile mixer is a truck that holds sand, rock, cement, water, fiber, and some add mixtures and color {{depending on how the}} <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> is outfitted. These trucks mix or batch the ready mix on the job site it's self. This type of truck can mix as much or as little amount of concrete as needed. The on site mixing eliminates the travel time hydration that can cause the transit mixed concrete to become unusable, These trucks are just as precise as the centralized <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> system, since the trucks are scaled and tested using the same ASTM (American standard test method) like all other ready mix manufactures. This is a hybrid approach between centralized <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> and traditional on-site mixing. Each type of system has it's advantages and disadvantages, depending on the location, size of the job, and mix design set forth by the engineer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} {{computer-aided}} methodology to automatically generate production schemes for chemical <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> operating in multi-batch mode. Our approach {{is based on}} the following principles: (1) the plant is modeled at the level of process operations whose behavior is specified by timed automata, (2) the production schemes are generated using algorithms for reachability analysis of timed automata implemented in OpenKronos [3], (3) the output of the verification tool is post-processed to derive a dispatcher. Our method works for non-cyclic and cyclic production. We apply our methodology to the <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> at the University of Dortmund. The automatically computed operation schemes turn out to be more efficient than the previously used handwritten ones. 1 Introduction A chemical <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> consists of a collection of containers, reactors, pipes, valves, pumps, etc., for storing, transporting, processing and transforming raw materials to obtain a final chemical product.

50|$|These {{categories}} typically {{differ in}} the ease of startup and teardown {{and the presence of}} portable features such as axles, brakes, and lights. Mobile batching plants are typically a single unit, made up of a cement silo, an aggregate bin, an aggregate conveyor and the cement and aggregate batchers, but at higher hourly production capacities may require numerous loads for a single plant. Typically, a mobile <b>batching</b> <b>plant</b> can be dismantled and reassembled in a few days time. As a result, they can be used at multiple construction sites to reduce transportation costs.|$|E

In order to reduce the search space, we propose a heuristic method that relies on the use of pre-ordering constraints. Application of the pre-ordering constraints to the proposed MILP model reduced the computational time required by more than 40 %.

40|$|The {{design of}} <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> {{necessary}} involves how equipment may be utilized, {{which means that}} plant scheduling and production must form {{an integral part of}} the design problem. The market demand for such products is usually changeable, and at the stage of conceptual design of a <b>batch</b> <b>plant,</b> it is almost impossible to obtain the precise information on the future product demand over the lifetime of the plant. This paper addresses the problem of the optimal design of <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> with imprecise demands and proposes an alternative treatment of the imprecision by using concepts of fuzzy logic.
