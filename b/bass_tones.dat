500|$|... "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] is {{the first}} ballad {{recorded}} by the Experience; Hendrix wrote the lyrics after an argument with his girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, whose middle name is Mary. She explained: [...] "I smashed plates on the floor, [...] he swept them up. He locked me in the bathroom for absolutely ages and... eventually Chas's girlfriend Lotta let me out... I ran out to get a taxi and was standing under the traffic lights, and I had red hair and a red dress. I went back after I'd cooled down and he'd already written it." [...] The song featured a chord progression inspired by Curtis Mayfield and lyrics that reflected Hendrix's admiration of Bob Dylan. [...] "Stone Free" [...] expressed Hendrix's desire to preserve his personal freedom, demurring the concepts of conformity and long-term relationships. He revisited this theme in [...] "51st Anniversary" [...] and [...] "Highway Chile". Omitted from the American version of the album, [...] "Red House" [...] would not see an official release in US until the 1969 compilation Smash Hits. An unusual feature of the recording {{is that it does}} not include a bass guitar track; Redding instead played rhythm guitar with his equalization set strongly in favor of <b>bass</b> <b>tones.</b> It is Hendrix's only original twelve-bar blues.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid 90´s, Californian nu metal band Motograter {{invented the}} eponymous {{instrument}} {{in place of a}} bass guitar. The Motograter is made out of 2 large industrial springs mounted on a metal platform, producing unique chunky guitar and <b>bass</b> <b>tones</b> with a strong [...] "RRRRRR" [...] sound. The Motograter´s sound is loosely comparable with a slow running cutting/drilling device.|$|E
2500|$|The organ {{was greatly}} {{enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} three electronic 32’ ranks by the Allen Organ Company in January 1989 under the supervision of Dr. Lord made possible {{by a grant from the}} Heinz endowments. [...] This permitted the organ to produce deep, resonant <b>bass</b> <b>tones.</b> It was one of the first uses of electronic sounds to enhance an existing pipe organ.|$|E

2500|$|White owns three Gretsch Rancher Falcons {{because he}} says that its <b>bass</b> <b>tones</b> make it his {{favorite}} acoustic to play live. They are collectively referred to as his [...] "girlfriends," [...] as each one has {{an image of a}} classic movie star on the back. Claudette Colbert is the brunette he used while with the Stripes, Rita Hayworth is the redhead he acquired with the Raconteurs, and Veronica Lake is the blonde he added in 2010 while with the Dead Weather.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sounds that}} Tatum {{produced}} with the piano were also distinctive. [...] Billy Taylor {{has said that}} he could make a bad piano sound good. Generally playing at mezzoforte volume, he employed the entire keyboard from deep <b>bass</b> <b>tones</b> to sonorous mid-register chords to sparkling upper register runs. [...] He used the sustain pedal sparingly so that each note was clearly articulated, chords were cleanly sounded and the melodic line would not be blurred. He played with boundless energy and occasionally his speedy and precise delivery produced an almost mechanical effect, compared by jazz critic Ted Gioia to [...] "a player piano on steroids." ...|$|E

60|$|Such {{were the}} words, uttered {{in the most}} terrifically violent <b>bass</b> <b>tones,</b> that awoke me on the first morning after I went to sea. Instantly all the men around me leaped out of their hammocks. They were all half-dressed, and I noticed that {{the greater part of}} them {{completed}} their toilet in the short interval between quitting their hammocks and gaining the deck. Jack and I had lain down in our clothes, so we were on deck almost as soon as the others.|$|E
60|$|When {{he arrived}} at the house he went around to the back door and slipped off his boots and crept up-stairs and arrived at the room of those elderly ladies without having wakened any sleepers. He undressed in the dark and got into bed and snuggled up against somebody. He was a little surprised, but not much--for he thought it was our brother Ben. It was winter, and the bed was comfortable, and the {{supposed}} Ben added to the comfort--and so he was dropping off to sleep very well satisfied with his progress so far and full of happy dreams of {{what was going to happen}} in the morning. But something else was going to happen sooner than that, and it happened now. The maid that was being crowded fumed and fretted and struggled and presently came to a half-waking condition and protested against the crowding. That voice paralyzed Orion. He couldn't move a limb; he couldn't get his breath; and the crowded one discovered his new whiskers and began to scream. This removed the paralysis, and Orion was out of bed and clawing round in the dark for his clothes in a fraction of a second. Both maids began to scream then, so Orion did not wait to get his whole wardrobe. He started with such parts of it as he could grab. He flew to the head of the stairs and started down, and was paralyzed again at that point, because he saw the faint yellow flame of a candle soaring up the stairs from below and he judged that Dr. G. was behind it, and he was. He had no clothes on to speak of, but no matter, he was well enough fixed for an occasion like this, because he had a butcher-knife in his hand. Orion shouted to him, and this saved his life, for the Doctor recognized his voice. Then in those deep-sea-going <b>bass</b> <b>tones</b> of his that I used to admire so much when I was a little boy, he explained to Orion the change that had been made, told him where to find the Clemens family, and closed with some quite unnecessary advice about posting himself before he undertook another adventure like that--advice which Orion probably never needed again as long as he lived.|$|E

5000|$|In most genres, a [...] "clean" [...] <b>bass</b> <b>tone</b> (without any amplifier-induced [...] "overdrive" [...] or [...] "distortion") is {{desirable}}, and {{so while}} guitarists often prefer the more desirable distorted tones of tube-transistor amplifiers, bassists commonly use solid-state amplifier circuitry {{to achieve the}} necessary high output wattages with less weight than tubes (though smaller tubes can often still {{be found in the}} low-power [...] "preamplifier" [...] sections of the system, where they provide a warmer, smoother character to the <b>bass</b> <b>tone</b> for relatively little additional weight). A few all-tube bass amplifiers are still available, notably from the Ampeg brand.|$|R
50|$|Besides its title, which {{alludes to}} the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, the {{introduction}} to the song is a barely audible instrumental build-up that is analogous to the deep <b>bass</b> <b>tone</b> in Also sprach Zarathustra that is prominently used in the film.|$|R
50|$|In an {{inverted}} chord, the root {{is not in}} the bass (i.e., is not the lowest note). The inversions are numbered in the order their <b>bass</b> <b>tones</b> would appear in a closed root position chord (from bottom to top).|$|E
50|$|The {{signature}} sonic elements {{on their}} early recordings were simple, pulverizing electronic <b>bass</b> <b>tones</b> twinned with needling high frequencies, sometimes combined with ferocious washes of white noise, {{with or without}} vocals (usually barked orders, sinister whispers, and high-pitched screams).|$|E
50|$|Many bass players, notably Stanley Clarke, Flea, Victor Wooten, Abraham Laboriel and Doug Wimbish used active bass pickups {{to produce}} their {{characteristic}} <b>bass</b> <b>tones.</b> Players who use active pickups for electric guitar include Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac), Mick Thomson (Slipknot), James Hetfield (Metallica), Dino Cazares (Fear Factory) and Dave Mustaine (Megadeth).|$|E
50|$|While {{electric}} bass {{players have}} used regular guitar amplifiers in large concerts since the 1960s, {{this is usually}} just for the higher register; a bass amp is still typically used for the low register, because regular guitar amps are only designed {{to go down to}} about 80 Hz. One of the reasons bassists split their signal into a bass amp and an electric guitar amp is because this arrangement enables them to overdrive the higher-register sound from the electric guitar amp, while retaining the deep <b>bass</b> <b>tone</b> from the <b>bass</b> amp. Naturally-produced overdrive on bass obtained by cranking a tube amplifier or solid-state preamplifier typically results in a loss of <b>bass</b> <b>tone,</b> because when pushed into overdrive, a note goes to the upper octave second harmonic.|$|R
50|$|Erlend Caspersen is a Norwegian bassist who {{currently}} plays in Spawn of Possession and Abhorrent. He also played for Deeds of Flesh.
