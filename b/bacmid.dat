30|$|The {{baculovirus}} infected insect {{cell system}} is undoubtedly the dominant heterologous expression system for obtaining eukaryotic IMPs (Contreras-Gomez et al., 2014). The most common method for generating recombinant baculovirus {{is based on}} the site-specific transposition of an expression cassette into a baculovirus shuttle vector (<b>bacmid)</b> that is amplified in E. coli (Ciccarone et al., 1998). The process is very convenient: clone the target gene into the pFastBac vector which uses the strong AcMNPV polyhedron (PH) as the promoter for high level protein expression, then transform the pFastBac vector into DH 10 Bac E. coli competent cells. DH 10 Bac cells possess a baculovirus shuttle vector (<b>bacmid)</b> with a transposon site and a helper plasmid, thus can help the pFastBac vector to have a transposition on the <b>bacmid.</b> Once the transposition occurs and the recombinant <b>bacmid</b> is generated, the <b>bacmid</b> could be isolated and purified for transfection. After the insect cells are cultured into a desired confluence, they are transfected by the purified <b>bacmid</b> DNA to generate a recombinant baculovirus that used for preliminary expression test (Contreras-Gomez et al., 2014). The pFastBac is ampicillin resistance and <b>Bacmid</b> is kanamycin resistance, and these selective markers provide expedience for this baculovirus expression system.

40|$|The {{establishment}} {{and maintenance of}} Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) latent infection requires distinct viral gene expression programs. These gene expression programs, termed latency types, are determined largely by promoter selection, and controlled through the interplay between cell-type specific transcription factors, chromatin structure, and epigenetic modifications. We used a genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to identify epigenetic modifications that correlate with different latency types. We found that the chromatin insulator protein CTCF binds at several key regulatory nodes in the EBV genome and may compartmentalize epigenetic modifications across the viral genome. Highly enriched CTCF binding sites were identified at the promoter regions upstream of Cp, Wp, EBERs, and Qp. Since Qp is essential for long-term maintenance of viral genomes in type I latency and epithelial cell infections, we focused {{on the role of}} CTCF in regulating Qp. Purified CTCF bound ∼ 40 bp upstream of the EBNA 1 binding sites located at + 10 bp relative to the transcriptional initiation site at Qp.

In the next step, Real-Time PCR was used to analyze the transcriptional phases of dbp gene in BmN cells, which had been infected with BmNPV. The results of the latter experiment revealed that the transcript of dbp gene was first detected at 3 h post-infection. Furthermore, the replication level of virus genome and the transcriptional level of virus early, late, and very late genes in BmN cells, which had been transfected with 3 kinds of <b>Bacmids,</b> were analyzed by Real-Time PCR.

In this study, the possible effects of TCl 4. 7 transposon insertion on the genome function of its insertion site has been analysed.

The mutant CpBACCp 15 KO was not able to replicate in CM larvae suggesting that Cp 15 was essential for virus replication. In contrast, the mutant CpBACCp 16 KO infected CM larvae and produced viable occlusion bodies (OBs) demonstrating that Cp 16 is a non-essential gene for virus in vivo infection of C. pomonella. The temporal transcription of Cp 15 and Cp 16, as well as of Cp 31 (F protein) as a control, was analysed using RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. It suggested a general delay or reduction of gene transcription of MCp 5 compared to the parental CpGV-M. Western blot analyses using anti-Cp 15 and anti-Cp 16 polyclonal antibodies, however, did not show any immuno-reactive response. Thus, a direct influence of TCl 4. 7 on the expression of Cp 15 and Cp 16 could not be substantiated. To investigate whether the interruption of hr 3 and hr 4 palindromes affects the virus replication, two mutant <b>bacmids</b> with a deletion of hr 3 and hr 4 (CpBAChr 3 /hr 4 -KO) and another with an insertion of a Kanamycin resistance cassette between hr 3 and hr 4 (CpBAChr 3 -kan-hr 4) were generated.

BcRF 1 is one of seven EBV genes with homologs found in other β- and γ-, but not in α-herpesviruses. Using EBV <b>BACmids,</b> we systematically disrupted each of these "βγ" genes. We found that six of them, including BcRF 1, exhibited an identical phenotype: intact viral DNA replication with loss of late gene expression. The proteins encoded by these six genes have been found by other investigators to form a viral protein complex that is essential for activation of TATT-containing reporters in EBV-negative 293 cells. Unexpectedly, in EBV infected 293 cells, we found that TATT reporter activation was weak and non-specific unless an EBV origin of lytic replication (OriLyt) was present in cis. Using two different replication-defective EBV genomes, we demonstrated that OriLyt-mediated DNA replication is required in cis for TATT reporter activation and for late gene expression from the EBV genome. We further demonstrate by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} that the late BcLF 1 mRNA localizes to EBV DNA replication factories. These findings support a model in which EBV true late genes are only transcribed from newly replicated viral genomes...|$|R
40|$|A Nicaraguan {{population}} of Spodoptera frugiperda multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus, SfMNPV-NIC, includes fast-killing genotypes with deletions in the egt region. Four <b>bacmid</b> based recombinants were constructed {{to determine the}} role of egt in this phenotype. SfdelF <b>bacmid</b> encompassed the deletion found in the NIC-F genotype. Sfdel 3 AP 2 <b>bacmid</b> was constructed using the deletion reported in SfMNPV- 3 AP 2 (Missouri, fast-killing isolate), whereas Sfdelegt and Sfdel 27 bacmids lacked the single genes egt and the adjacent sf 27 gene, respectively. No significant differences were observed in occlusion body (OB) concentration-mortality metrics (LC 50 values) among the viruses. Larvae infected by NIC-B (a natural genotype with the largest genome), Sfbac (a <b>bacmid</b> with NIC-B genome) and Sfdel 27 survived significantly longer than insects infected by NIC-F, SfdelF, SfMNPV- 3 AP 2, Sfdel 3 AP 2 or Sfdelegt. Fast-killing viruses produced ~ 6 - 13 -fold fewer OBs/larva compared to other viruses tested. We conclude that deletion/disruption of egt {{is responsible for the}} fast-killing phenotypes of naturally-occurring genotypes in SfMNPV populations from Missouri and Nicaragua. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|AbstractDNA {{replication}} of bacmid-derived constructs of the Autographa californica multiple nucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) was analyzed by field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) {{in combination with}} digestion at a unique Eco 81 I restriction enzyme site. Three constructs were characterized: a parental <b>bacmid,</b> a <b>bacmid</b> deleted for the alkaline nuclease gene, and a <b>bacmid</b> from which the gp 64 gene had been deleted. The latter was employed as a control for comparison with the alkaline nuclease knockout because neither yields infectious virus and their replication {{is limited to the}} initially transfected cells. The major difference between DNA replicated by the different constructs was the presence in the alkaline nuclease knockout of high concentrations of relatively small, subgenome length DNA in preparations not treated with Eco 81 I. Furthermore, upon Eco 81 I digestion, the alkaline nuclease knockout <b>bacmid</b> also yielded substantially more subgenome size DNA than the other constructs. Electron microscopic examination of cells transfected with the alkaline nuclease knockout indicated that, in addition to a limited number of normal-appearing electron-dense nucleocapsids, numerous aberrant capsid-like structures were observed indicating a defect in nucleocapsid maturation or in a DNA processing step that is necessary for encapsidation. Because of the documented role of the baculovirus alkaline nuclease and its homologs from other viruses in homologous recombination, these data suggest that DNA recombination may {{play a major role in}} the production of baculovirus genomes...|$|E
40|$|Very late {{expression}} factor 1 (VLF- 1) of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus is a putative tyrosine recombinase and {{is required}} for both very late gene expression and budded virus production. In this report, we show that a vlf- 1 knockout <b>bacmid</b> was able to synthesize viral DNA at levels similar to that detected for a gp 64 knockout <b>bacmid</b> {{that served as a}} noninfectious control virus. Additionally, analysis of replicated <b>bacmid</b> DNA by field-inversion gel electrophoresis indicated that VLF- 1 is not required for synthesizing high-molecular-weight intermediates that could be resolved into unit-length genomes when cut at a unique restriction site. However, immunoelectron microscopic analysis revealed that in cells transfected with a vlf- 1 knockout <b>bacmid,</b> aberrant tubular structures containing the capsid protein vp 39 were observed, suggesting that this virus construct was defective in producing mature capsids. In contrast, rescuing the vlf- 1 knockout <b>bacmid</b> construct with a copy of VLF- 1 that carries a mutation of a highly conserved tyrosine (Y 355 F) was sufficient to restore the production of nucleocapsids with a normal appearance, but not infectious virus production. Furthermore, the results of a DNase I protection assay indicated that the DNA packaging efficiency of the VLF- 1 (Y 355 F) virus construct was {{similar to that of the}} gp 64 knockout control. Finally, a recombinant virus containing a functional hemagglutinin epitope-tagged version of VLF- 1 was constructed to investigate the association of VLF- 1 with the nucleocapsid. Analysis by immunoelectron microscopy of Sf- 9 cells infected with this virus showed that VLF- 1 localized to an end region of the nucleocapsid. Collectively, these results indicate that VLF- 1 {{is required for}} normal capsid assembly and serves an essential function during the final stages of the DNA packaging process...|$|E
40|$|Membrane budding is {{essential}} for the egress of many enveloped viruses, and this process shares similarities with the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In eukaryotic cells, the budding of intraluminal vesicles (IVLs) is mediated by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and some viruses require ESCRT machinery components or functions to bud from host cells. Baculoviruses, such as Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), enter host cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Viral DNA replication and nucleocapsid assembly occur within the nucleus. Some progeny nucleocapsids are subsequently trafficked to, and bud from, the plasma membrane, forming budded virions (BV). To determine whether the host ESCRT machinery is important or necessary for AcMNPV replication, we cloned a cDNA of Spodoptera frugiperda VPS 4, a key regulator for disassembly and recycling of ESCRT III. We then examined viral infection and budding in the presence of wild-type (WT) or dominant negative (DN) forms of VPS 4. First, we used a viral complementation system, in combination with fluorescent tags, {{to examine the effects of}} transiently expressed WT or DN VPS 4 on viral entry. We found that dominant negative VPS 4 substantially inhibited virus entry. Entering virus was observed within aberrant compartments containing the DN VPS 4 protein. We next used recombinant <b>bacmids</b> expressing WT or DN VPS 4 proteins to examine virus egress. We found that production of infectious AcMNPV BV was substantially reduced by expression of DN VPS 4 but not by WT VPS 4. Together, these results indicate that a functional VPS 4 is necessary for efficient AcMNPV BV entry into, and egress from, insect cells...|$|R
40|$|Scaffolding {{proteins}} of spherical prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses have critical {{roles in}} capsid assembly. The primary scaffolding components of cytomegalovirus, called the assembly protein precursor (pAP, pUL 80. 5) and the maturational protease precursor (pPR, pUL 80 a), contain two nuclear localization sequences (NLS 1 and NLS 2), {{at least one}} of which is required in coexpression experiments to translocate the major capsid protein (MCP, pUL 85) into the nucleus. In the work reported here, we have mutated NLS 1 and NLS 2, individually or together, in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, strain AD 169) bacmid-derived viruses to test their effects on virus replication. Consistent with results from earlier transfection/coexpression experiments, both single-mutant <b>bacmids</b> gave rise to infectious virus but the double mutant did not. In comparisons with the wild-type virus, both mutants showed slower cell-to-cell spread; decreased yields of infectious virus (3 -fold lower for NLS 1 − and 140 -fold lower for NLS 2 −); reduced efficiency of pAP, pPR, and MCP nuclear translocation (sixfold lower for NLS 1 − and eightfold lower for NLS 2 −); increased amounts of a 120 -kDa MCP fragment; and reduced numbers of intranuclear capsids. All effects were more severe for the NLS 2 − mutant than the NLS 1 − mutant, and a distinguishing feature of cells infected with the NLS 2 − mutant was the accumulation of large, UL 80 protein-containing structures within the nucleus. We conclude that these NLS assist in the nuclear translocation of MCP during HCMV replication and that NLS 2, which is unique to the betaherpesvirus UL 80 homologs, may have additional involvements during replication...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BKRF 3 shares {{sequence}} homology {{with members of}} the uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) protein family and has DNA glycosylase activity. Here, we explored how BKRF 3 participates in the DNA replication complex and contributes to viral DNA replication. Exogenously expressed Flag-BKRF 3 was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm, whereas BKRF 3 was translo-cated into the nucleus and colocalized with the EBVDNA polymerase BALF 5 in the replication compartment during EBV lytic replication. The expression level of BKRF 3 increased gradually during viral replication, coupled with a decrease of cellular UNG 2, suggesting BKRF 3 enzyme activity compensates for UNG 2 and ensures the fidelity of viral DNA replication. In immuno-precipitation-Western blotting, BKRF 3 was coimmunoprecipitated with BALF 5, the polymerase processivity factor BMRF 1, and the immediate-early transactivator Rta. Coexpression of BMRF 1 appeared to facilitate the nuclear targeting of BKRF 3 in immu-nofluorescence staining. Residues 164 to 255 of BKRF 3 were required for interaction with Rta and BALF 5, whereas residues 81 to 166 of BKRF 3 were critical for BMRF 1 interaction in glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown experiments. Viral DNA replica-tion was defective in cells harboring BKRF 3 knockout EBV <b>bacmids.</b> In complementation assays, the catalytic mutant BKRF 3 (Q 90 L,D 91 N) restored viral DNA replication, whereas the leucine loopmutant BKRF 3 (H 213 L) only partially rescued vi-ral DNA replication, coupled with a reduced ability to interact with the viral DNA polymerase and Rta. Our data suggest that BKRF 3 plays a critical role in viral DNA synthesis predominantly through its interactions with viral proteins in the DNA replica-tion compartment, while its enzymatic activity may be supplementary for uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) function during virus replication...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{population}} genetics of the baculovirus infection {{process and the}} consequences for virus evolution. Using Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and lepidopteran insect larvae as a model system, we attempt to characterize (1) elemental virus-host and virus-virus interactions pertinent to virus invasion and disease of the host, focussing largely {{on the number of}} virus individuals invading a host insect and including the first strong experimental evidence that a single virion can cause disease in a host animal, and (2) the interactions that can occur between virus genotypes during the process of diseasing the host, specifically competition. The development of two technologies was necessary to address these questions. First, a method for generating clonal baculovirus populations containing molecular tag sequences was devised: insect larvae were transfected with full-length baculovirus genomic DNA modified to allow replication in Escherichia coli (<b>bacmids).</b> Second, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) based assay was developed to measure the frequency of a baculovirus genotype in a mixed population. In order to estimate the number of pathogen individuals invading the host and causing death, a basic probabilistic model that links this number to host survival was developed and experimentally tested. This model is based on the independent action hypothesis (IAH) : the notion that (1) every pathogen individual has a fixed probability of invading the host, (2) if a pathogen individual invades the host this will irrevocably lead to host death, and (3) that pathogen individuals act independently. Here the model was specifically developed to predict how often hosts are invaded by two pathogen genotypes, when being challenged by a pathogen population consisting of two genotypes. Model predictions were tested using two near-identical bacmid-derived virus genotypes, larvae of three host species, and the qPCR assay. IAH model predictions were confirmed in early instar (L 3) larvae of permissive host species (Spodoptera exigua and Trichoplusia ni). This strongly suggests that in these instances it is the action of one invading virion which leads to host death. Model predictions did not hold for late instar larvae (L 5) of permissive host species and both early and late larvae of a semi-permissive species (Mamestra brassicae), which show greater resistance to AcMNPV. In these instances there was a too high frequency of invasions with both genotypes, suggesting that more virions had invaded these larvae to cause disease than predicted by IAH...|$|R
40|$|Biologically active {{recombinant}} bovine gonadotropins {{were produced}} using the baculovirus expression system. Bovine gonadotropins subunit cDNAs for alpha, {{follicle stimulating hormone}} (FSH) β and luteinizing hormone (LH) β were subcloned into the baculovirus transfer plasmid pFastBac 1 for generation of recombinant baculoviruses as <b>bacmids</b> (Bac-to-Bac Expression System, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Recombinant baculoviruses were amplified and titered using Sf 9 cells while proteins were expressed in High Five cells. Monomeric alpha and FSHβ were produced at rates of 6 - 8 μg/million cells under optimal expression conditions. Co-infection of alpha and FSHβ baculoviruses yielded a production rate of 1 - 2. 5 μg/million cells for heterodimeric FSH. Recombinant bovine FSH bound to human receptors expressed on CHO cells with a potency approximately 7 -fold higher and induced signal transduction in a Y 1 cell bioassay with a potency approximately 2. 5 -fold higher, than pituitary derived bovine FSH. ^ Only {{a small percentage of}} monomeric LHβ appeared in the medium when expressed under optimal conditions. Recombinant LHβ released in the medium generated a curve parallel to the standard in the radioimmunoassay, while the dose-response curve for LHβ in cell extracts was non-monotonic suggesting intracellular retention and degradation. Co-expression of recombinant alpha and LHβ baculoviruses resulted in much higher (3 ̆e 10 fold) secretion rates suggesting that subunit assembly stabilizes recombinant LHβ. Thus, a significant percentage of monomeric bovine LHβ appears to be retained in High Five insect cells and degraded unless rescued by combination with an alpha subunit. Heterodimeric LH expressed in insect cells was bioactive as judged by its ability to stimulate progesterone secretion in cultured MA- 10 Leydig tumor cells. ^ A bovine LHβ analog with the equine LH/CGβ carboxyl terminal peptide (CTP) domain was constructed creating a chorionic gonadotropin (CG) -like molecule to determine if addition of a CTP domain could enhance secretion. The CTP fragment of an equine LH/CGβ cDNA was subcloned into pFastBac 1. bLHβ generating a DNA sequence that encodes a bovine LHβ 1 - 110 -equine LW/CGβ 111 - 149 fusion protein (bLHβeqCTP). Under optimal infection conditions, the secretion rate of bovine LHβeqCTP was 0. 4 μg/million cells. Like monomeric bovine LHβ, bovine LHβeqCTP appeared to be retained inside the cells unless rescued by combination with an alpha subunit. The bovine LHβeqCTP fusion protein was able to bind to LH receptors and induce signal transduction in cultured MA- 10 Leydig tumor cells. Thus, adding a CTP sequence to bovine LHβ does not markedly enhance secretion of the monomeric form. Therefore, the determinants of LHβ which encode for intracellular retention are likely upstream from the carboxy-terminal. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of deletion mutants, including defective interfering viruses, upon serial passage of Spodoptera exigua multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) in insect cell {{culture has been}} studied. Sequences containing the non-homologous region origin of DNA replication (non-hr ori) became hypermolar in intracellular viral DNA within 10 passages in Se 301 insect cells, concurrent with a dramatic drop in budded virus and polyhedron production. These predominant non-hr ori-containing sequences accumulated in larger concatenated forms and were generated de novo as demonstrated by their appearance and accumulation upon infection with a genetically homogenous bacterial clone of SeMNPV (<b>bacmid).</b> Sequences were identified at the junctions of the non-hr on units within the concatemers, which may be potentially involved in recombination events. Deletion of the SeMNPV non-hr on using RecE/RecT-mediated homologous ET recombination in Escherichia coli resulted in a recombinant <b>bacmid</b> with strongly enhanced stability of virus and polyhedron production upon serial passage in insect cells.
