Series star Kyle Chandler said: [...] "When I look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> life, I'm going to say, 'Wow, [...] Peter Berg really changed my life.'" [...] Executive producer and head writer Jason Katims echoed this sentiment, saying: [...] "When I first came on [...] set, I thought, it’s interesting – this is what I imagined filmmaking would be, before I saw what filmmaking was." ...|$|E
500|$|Interest in {{adapting}} Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? developed {{shortly after}} its 1968 publication. Director Martin Scorsese {{was interested in}} filming the novel, but never optioned it. Producer Herb Jaffe optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: [...] "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said {{to him when he}} got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> apartment? ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilder later confessed, [...] "The picture didn't {{come out}} what I wanted ... I was looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{childhood}} in Austria—waltzes, Tyrolean hats, cream puffs—shutting out what came later," [...] {{a reference to}} the war-torn Vienna he visited prior to the film's start. [...] "I would like to have done the picture as a tribute to Lubitsch. A tribute to Lubitsch, it was not." ...|$|E

Now the only emerged volcanoes which may be considered still active are Stromboli, Vulcano and Lipari.|$|R

2500|$|In July 2007, rumors {{circulated}} that Griffin {{was dating}} Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. They attended the 2007 Emmy Awards together, and speculation arose {{when the two}} were interviewed together on the red carpet. On Tom Green's House Tonight on February 6, 2008, Griffin confirmed her relationship with Wozniak. When asked if she actually targeted Wozniak to make her ex-husband jealous, Griffin stated: [...] "What better way to get <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> ex, who was a tech, than to marry the biggest techno-nerd in the Universe?" [...] Wozniak and Griffin served as King and Queen of the Humane Society of Silicon Valley Fur Ball on April 5, 2008, in Santa Clara, California, and scenes for the fourth season of My Life on the D-List were taped. However, in June 2008, {{it was confirmed that}} Griffin and Wozniak were no longer dating.|$|E
6000|$|I smiled <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{companion}} as we drew near. [...] "This, Mrs Bowater," [...] said I, [...] "is Mr Anon. Would {{you please}} present him to Miss Thomasina of Bedlam?" ...|$|E

60|$|I wonder, when I look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it, <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own obstinacy. I am almost {{ashamed to}} relate that I made Mr. Playmore no reply. He waited, {{still looking at}} me. I felt irritated by that fixed look. I arose, and stood before him with {{my eyes on the}} floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "So, I {{just looked}} at him--coolly, you know, and looked at her. Then I looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> him again--taking <b>my</b> time, you know. 'I don't think that that's a fair {{question}} to put to me,' says I." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said yes, and {{got away}} from him at last. In {{a quarter of an}} hour more I was <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> lodgings, and was {{informed}} by the servant that 'the elderly gentleman' was still waiting for me.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} blacker and more silent than ever. The same feeling of {{apprehension}} which had lain heavily upon {{me at the}} beginning of the séance was <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> heart once more. The roots of my hair were tingling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mad is {{the right}} word! I look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own infatuation--and I can't account for it; I can't {{understand}} myself. What was there in you," [...] she asked, with an outbreak of contemptuous surprise, [...] "to attract such a woman as I am?" ...|$|E
25|$|GONZALES: Senator, I went <b>back</b> {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{calendar}} for that week. I traveled to Mexico for {{the inauguration of}} the new president. We had National Meth Awareness Day. We were working on a very complicated issue relating to CFIUS.|$|R
5000|$|... "But I'm really {{grateful}} to be <b>back</b> and competing <b>at</b> <b>my</b> third SEA Games. A lot of credit {{has to go to}} my family and coach for these two medals.

6000|$|... "It {{gives me}} {{pleasure}} to drink your health, Mr. Middleton," [...] said the host. [...] "We might well meet as friends in England, for I am hardly more an Englishman than yourself; bred up, as I have been, in Italy, and coming <b>back</b> hither <b>at</b> <b>my</b> age, unaccustomed to the manners of the country, with few friends, and insulated from society by a faith which makes most people regard {{me as an}} enemy. I seldom welcome people here, Mr. Middleton; but you are welcome." ...|$|R
6000|$|A little after, I {{observed}} a worm upon the ground, and told, in a whisper, that its touch was death. Presently a great green serpent, vivid as {{the grass in}} spring, wound rapidly across the path; and once again I paused and looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion, with a horror in my eyes. ‘The coffin snake,’ said I, ‘the snake that dogs its victim like a hound.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> letter, {{describing}} what passed between Miss Minerva and me, when I {{went to her}} room; and you will know what I felt on hearing her spoken of as 'a rival.' My sense of justice refused to believe it. But, oh, my dear old nurse, there was some deeper sense in me that said, as if in words, It is true! ...|$|E

60|$|But it did me good--that visit. It {{was as if}} I {{had been}} looking <b>back</b> and up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own small skull on a high shelf in some {{tranquil}} and dingy old laboratory--a few bottles, a spider's web, and an occasional glint of moonlight. How very brief the animation for so protracted a peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is small, {{but she is}} fast," [...] {{the latter}} answered. [...] "She would sail round and round {{the best part of}} the fleet. I had her built {{according}} to my own fancy. Small though she be, I warrant you she will be one of the first to arrive at Hennebon, and the sooner the better say I, since I am but paid by the trip, and would fain be <b>back</b> again <b>at</b> <b>my</b> regular work. It pays better carrying merchants' goods between London and Holland than taking his majesty's troops over to France." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{propose a}} {{collection}} of conceptually-oriented interactive installations, called the Eye Contact Systems, which explore the potential of gaze as a primary new mode of human-machine communication. The project addresses the questions: What if artworks could know how {{we were looking at}} them? And, given this knowledge, what if they could look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> us? <b>My</b> proposed artworks investigate the aesthetics of interactive systems endowed with new perceptive capacities - the ability to know where we are looking - and new expressive means, through mechanical eyes that can return and address our gaze...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have tried}} to pour out my heart to you in writing--and I have torn up the letters. The fewest words are the best. Look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> confession--and you will know why I have left you. You shall hear from me, when I am more worthy of you than I am now. In the meantime, wear my ring.

60|$|My old {{nurse was}} to go to London with me next day, on the {{business}} of the will. Little Emily was passing that day at Mr. Omer's. We were all to meet in the old boathouse that night. Ham would bring Emily at the usual hour. I would walk <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> leisure. The brother and sister would return as they had come, and be expecting us, when the day closed in, at the fireside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Making my peace," [...] the old {{man said}} solemnly. [...] "My faith is now indeed a staff and a comfort. I look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> long life, and though I humbly confess that I have erred, and erred grievously, still in the main I have walked straight. From my youth I have been frugal and industrious. Oh, my boy, look with candid eyes into your own heart, and see if you are fit to be called away." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gibb {{married in}} the late 1980s, just after the second run of All Creatures Great and Small had started, and gave birth {{towards the end of}} the series. [...] "By then I'd been {{contracted}} to come back for series six, and getting pregnant was a complete shock. My baby was due a month before my start date to be <b>back</b> <b>at</b> work. <b>My</b> baby was very late, and in the end I had to have him induced. I was literally back on set for this series when he was just ten days old." ...|$|R
2500|$|Fry {{struggled}} to keep his homosexuality secret during his teenage years at public school, and by his own account did not engage in sexual activity for 16 years from 1979 until 1995. When asked when he first acknowledged his sexuality, Fry quipped: [...] "I suppose it all began when I {{came out of the}} womb. I looked <b>back</b> up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mother and thought to myself, 'That's the last time I'm going up one of those'." [...] Fry was in a 15-year relationship with Daniel Cohen, which ended in 2010. In 2016, Fry was listed number 2 on the World Pride Power list.|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} him into the street watching his thick square form, of which even the back seemed to express sullen anger and determination. At a distance of a few yards stood the brother of the dead man, Mr. Selby, talking to Dr. Jeffries, one of whom made some remark that caught Sir John's ear. He stopped as though to answer, then, changing his mind, turned his head and looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> me. <b>My</b> sight is good and I could see his face clearly; on it was a look of malignity that was not pleasant to behold.|$|R
6000|$|I do not {{remember}} that we ever lifted our criticism to the dons and the organisation of the University. I think we took them for granted. When I look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> youth I am always astonished by the multitude {{of things that we}} took for granted. It seemed to us that Cambridge was in the order of things, {{for all the world like}} having eyebrows or a vermiform appendix. Now with the larger scepticism of middle age I can entertain very fundamental doubts about these old universities. Indeed I had a scheme-- ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{entered the}} room, Mr. Finch {{was on his}} legs, highly excited; haranguing Mrs. Finch and the baby, ensconced as usual in a corner. My {{appearance}} on the scene diverted his flow of language, for the moment, so that it all poured itself out on my unlucky self. (If you recollect that the rector and Lucilla's aunt had been, from time immemorial, on the worst of terms--you will be prepared for what is coming. If you have forgotten this, look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> sixth chapter and refresh your memory.) ...|$|E
60|$|To confess plainly, I had {{intended}} to spend my life (or any leisure I might have from Piracy upon the high seas) {{as the leader of}} a great horde of irregular cavalry, devastating whole valleys. I can still, looking back, see myself in many favourite attitudes; signalling for a boat from my pirate ship with a pocket- handkerchief, I at the jetty end, and one or two of my bold blades keeping the crowd at bay; or else turning in the saddle to look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> whole command (some five thousand strong) following me at the hand-gallop up the road out of the burning valley: this last by moonlight.|$|E
6000|$|... 30. I was {{not able}} to go to church or Court to-day for my shoulder. The pain has left my shoulder, and crept to my neck and collar-bone. It makes me think of poo Ppt's bladebone. Urge, urge, urge; dogs gnawing. I went in a chair at two, and dined with Mrs. Van, where I could be easy, and came <b>back</b> <b>at</b> seven. <b>My</b> Hungary water is gone; and to-night I use spirits of wine, which my landlady tells me is very good. It has rained terribly all day long, and is {{extremely}} cold. I am very uneasy, and such cruel twinges every moment! Nite deelest MD.|$|R
40|$|Liberty Elementary school {{looks like}} any other typical red brick, 2 -story {{elementary}} school. With windows spanning {{the length of the}} building, a fenced-in playground, and the blacktop basketball courts that every elementary school seems to have, I gazed at it and felt like I was <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Point Harmony, <b>my</b> old elementary school, {{on the first day of}} classes. The only difference this time was that my mom wasn 2 ̆ 7 t there to hold my hand...|$|R
40|$|Looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> over <b>my</b> {{years of}} {{teaching}} English at university, I noticed that despite the many changes, two things have remained the same in my classroom practice: the first day questionnaire and end of term reflective report. Out of the 14 questions on the first class inquiry, my favorite question is ‘What {{do you want to}} learn in this class?’ I find the most interesting answers are located here in terms of revealing students’ initial expectations of the course. Near the end of the term, I assign a reflective report on what they learned in this class. What makes the initial responses even more memorable is placing them into a learning opportunity perspective with their final self-perceived notion of what they achieved...|$|R
