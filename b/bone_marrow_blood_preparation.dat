40|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> flow {{has been}} {{assessed}} using {{positron emission tomography}} and the 15 O-labelled carbon dioxide steady-state technique. The measurements were performed {{at the site of}} the posterior iliac crest. The <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> flow was 10. 0 ml/min/ 100 cm 3 +/- 3. 0 (SD) in normal volunteers. It was markedly increased in patients with polycythaemia vera (26. 9 +/- 4. 6), chronic granulocytic leukaemia (25. 2 +/- 3. 9) and myelofibrosis (35. 1 +/- 7. 3). However, <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> flow did not differ from normal in patients with aplastic anaemia, chronic haemolysis or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. There was no relationship between <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cellularity and <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> flow. The data show that <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> flow is markedly elevated in polycythaemia vera, myelofibrosis and chronic granulocytic leukaemia and suggest that <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> cellularity is not a major factor in regulating <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> flow.

40|$|It {{is readily}} assumed that acute {{bleeding}} would cause {{changes in the}} speed of general circulation and in the circulation of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood,</b> and that such a change of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> circulation would largely effect the mobilization of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> depot <b>blood</b> cells. INOUE and Prof. HIRAKI {{have pointed out that}} the acceleration or inhibition of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> circulation accompanied by the contraction or dilation on the nutricia vessels constitutes an important factor in accelerating or inhibiting the mobilization of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> cells. From this account, the results obtained through the experiments described in Part 1 have been reviewed, and the effect of bleeding upon the blood circulation in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> and the general circulation time has been re-examined through the thiasin method and the STEWART's method. The results are as follows: 1) The blood flow curve in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> taken by means of the thiasin method reached its peak within an hour after the bleeding. The curve taken at the 30 miuutes period before and after reaching its peak showed a shift to the left, indicating an acceleration of the blood flow. 2) The circulation time in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> was shortened, with its peak an hour after the bleeding, the values at 30 minutes before and after the peak showing various degrees of shortened time. 3) The pulmonary and systemic circulation time was shortened with its peak an hour after the bleeding, the values at 30 minutes before and after the peak showing various degrees of shortened time. 4) These observations suggest the events which take place in the marrow in the course of one to two hours after hemorrhage. The increase of blood cells in V. nutricia femoris was caused by mobilization of depot blood cells in the sinusoid. This mobilization was brought about by the shortening of the intramedullary circulation time associated with that of the general circulation time. Dilation and contraction of nutricia vessels following bleeding is only of secondary significance...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{experiments}} stated in Part 1, {{in order to}} examine the blood cell mobilization function of the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> from the viewpoints of central nervous system control and peripheral nervous system control, the blood picture of the V. nutricia was observed after transecting the spinal cord at a higher level, as did KOMIYA, and also after extirpating the abdominal sympathetic nerve, as did MORIKAWA. The results are as follows: 1) The marked mobilization of the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> depot <b>blood</b> cells, which is seen 1 to 2 hours after the bleeding, was not hindered by the transection of the higher-level spinal cord. Therefore, the mobilization is little effected by the central blood cell control nerves. 2) Mobilization of the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> depot <b>blood</b> cells is not much effected by the extirpation of the abdominal sympathetic trunk. Therefore, its control by the peripheral nerves is negligible. 3) The dilation or contraction of the nutricia vessels do not have a primary significance in the mobilization of the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> cells after bleeding...|$|R

40|$|The polycythemia {{observed}} at high altitudes and in {{certain forms of}} pulmonary and congenital heart disease {{has led to the}} acceptance of the view that anoxia is an erythropoietic stimulus. In polycy-themia vera, however, the oxygen saturation of the arterial blood {{has been found to be}} normal. Ob-servers have, therefore, sought in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> itself for evidence of anoxia in this disease. Rezni-koff et al. (1) demonstrated changes in the capil-laries and arterioles in the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> of patients with polycythemia vera and postulated decreased blood flow with subsequent anoxia as the erythro-poietic stimulus. Chemical evidence of such an-oxia has as yet not been obtained. It has likewise been maintained that marrow anoxia is the stimulus to red cell production in anemia, as for example, after hemorrhage. Re-cently, however, Grant and Root (2, 3) have de-termined the percentage saturation and oxygen tension of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> in dogs made anemic by bleeding and found no significant difference from the control animals. These considerations led us to a study of the oxygen content in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> in various diseases in man, adapting the method of Grant and Root. After the studies to be reported in this paper had been completed, the work of Berk, Burchenal, Wood, and Castle (4) on the same subject was published.

40|$|An {{increase}} in <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> flow {{has been previously}} described in anaemic rabbits and dogs. We examined the effect of haemorrhage and haemolysis in female Sprague-Dawley rats, with the hypothesis that high blood flow was related to hyperplasia of <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> tissue and that the increase would affect bone as well. Blood flow was measured in tibia and femur by the microspheres trapping method. Chronic anaemia was accompanied at day 32 by a marked increase (factor of 1. 7 - 1. 9) in <b>blood</b> flow to <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> and to <b>bone.</b> On the other hand, no {{increase in}} blood flow was observed in chronic compensated anaemia, showing that anaemia per se and no stimulation of erythropoiesis {{was responsible for the}} increase. We then explored the effect on blood flow of two factors associated with anaemia. Erythropoietin 4 U/d for 4 d failed to induce any increase in <b>bone</b> and <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> flow. Systemic hypoxia (76 mmHg for 3 d) reduced the fraction of cardiac output conveyed to <b>bone</b> and <b>marrow</b> by 40 - 50 %, but this decrease was more than compensated by an increase in cardiac output. We conclude that neither erythropoietin nor low tissue pO 2 is the direct cause for the increase in <b>bone</b> and <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> flow observed in anaemia.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{technique}} {{for the collection}} of rabbit <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> stem cells from different regions {{to be used as}} an experimental model in regenerative medicine. METHODS: Thirty rabbits were allocated into 2 groups: GROUP A, n= 8, animals that underwent <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> (BMB) harvesting from the iliac crest; and GROUP B: including 22 rabbits that underwent BMB harvesting from the femur epiphysis. After harvesting, mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll - Histopaque). The number of mononuclear cells per ml was counted in a Neubauer chamber and cell viability was checked through Tripan Blue method. RESULTS: Harvesting from the iliac crest yielded an average of 1 ml of BMB and 3, 6. 10 (6) cells/ml over 1 hour of surgery, whereas an average of 3 ml of BMB and 11, 79. 10 (6) cells. /ml were obtained in 30 min from the femur epiphysis with a reduced animal death rate.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is characterised by intrathecal {{synthesis of}} IgG, less frequently of IgA and IgM.

LF contents in neutrophils and <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>blood</b> were also examined in relation to serum LF levels. In addition, LF concentration was determined in maternal milk and stool collected from newborns. Findings obtained are summarized as follows: 1) Serum LF levels gradually increased during early infancy and became stable later. A decreased production of LF in neutrophils seemed {{to be responsible for}} the lower level of serum LF in the neonatal period. 2) Fecal concentrations of LF in breast fed babies peaked at 5 days of age reflecting the intake of LF-rich maternal milk. 3) Serum LF levels seemed to depend mainly on the neutrophils of total blood granulocyte pool than those of the <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> reserve. 4) There {{was no significant difference in}} serum LF levels between controls and patients with bacterial infections in spite of a significant increase of neutrophil counts in the latter group.
