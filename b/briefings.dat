The paper synthesises and summarises a rapidly burgeoning literature on BF which, presently, is not as accessible as that concerned with modern finance theory. Attention is first given to what is meant by the rationality of financial agents, and the possibility is introduced that financial agents in an uncertain real world may be less than strictly rational. Thereafter, the various heuristics and cognitive biases that may characterise financial decision-making in an uncertain real world are catalogued and explained. The paper finishes with an assessment of the potential for BF to transform scholarship in finance. The economist may attempt to ignore psychology, but it is sheer impossibility for him to ignore human nature [...] If the economist borrows his conception of man from the psychologist, his constructive work may have some chance of remaining purely economic in character. But if he does not, he will not thereby avoid psychology. Rather, he will force himself to make his own, and it will be bad psychology. Clark (1918, p. 4...|$|R

40|$|I {{would like}} to comment on the Briefing of 22 November (p. 1113) {{concerning}} the outlook for geothermal energy in California. The <b>Briefing's</b> somewhat gloomy outlook is due largely to a confusion of the geothermal resource estimates made by the U. S. Geolog-ical Survey (USGS) in 1979 (contrary to the assertion in the Briefing, the 1979 inventory is the most recent USGS inventory) with the geothermal reserve estimates made by Ebasco Services in 1991. By definition, re-serves represent only that fraction of the resource that can be exploited profitably with current technology. With an under-standing of this difference, one can see that there is no actual conflict between the 1979 USGS study and the 1991 Ebasco report. Although production at The Geysers has dropped significantly [to 1380 megawatts-electric (MWe) from the installed capacity of 2000 MWe], much of this drop can be attributed to overoptimism and overexploi-tation by the field developers. (The 1979 USGS study estimated a 1610 MWe capac-ity for The Geysers.) With new technologi-cal developments such as fluid injection, jointly researched by industry and govern-ment, {{it should be possible to}} recapture some of the lost generating capacity. California's geology (and that in neigh-boring states) still promises an abundance of economical, environmentally acceptable geo-thermal energy. Supporting studies for the National Energy Strategy indicate that un-der reasonable assumptions approximately 11, 000 MWe from hydrothermal resources can be on-line nationally by 2010, and 22, 000 MWe by 2030. In addition, more advanced geothermal resources (hot dry rock, geopressured geothermal systems, and magma) can potentially play a significant role in satisfying America's long-term ener-gy needs. Geothermal energy truly has a bright future in helping to satisfy America's energy needs...|$|R

Consequently, the fi rst objecƟ ve of the NaƟ onal Development Plan (2010 / 11 - 2014 / 15) is “Increasing household incomes and promoƟ ng equity”.

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>BRIEFING</b> The {{availability}} of specific soft option products for other pests such as Lepidoptera species control in vegetables {{has increased the}} importance of sucking pests in the modern day pest spectrum. Current vegetable sucking pest management practices are still heavily reliant on older broad spectrum pesticides. These non selective products prevent further adoption of an integrated pest management (IPM) system, and their frequent, multiple crop use pattern {{has the potential to}} enhance resistance development in the pest population. A limited number of more recently developed, pest specific or “softer” products for example spinosad (Success®) and pymetrozine (Chess®) are registered in some specific vegetable crops. The management of sucking pests is also {{complicated by the fact that}} virus transmission and product contamination are as, if not more important than the physical damage they can cause to vegetable crops. To modernise sucking pest control in the vegetable sector, work in a range of overlapping multifaceted areas needs to occur. A team of entomologist in consultation with crop consultants, growers and specialist reviewers conducted a scoping study of the impact of at least 5 sucking pests commonly found across vegetable crops. Literature reviews, an industry workshop, interstate producer interviews and farm visits were employed to collate information on current best 'fit' management options within an IPM system, relevant to the particular vegetable and potential future management options. Ideas for future research, development, and extension activities highlighted in the workshop process included; biopesticides, improved beneficial insect management in current cropping systems, monitoring and early warning, improved knowledge of pest ecology, resistance issues, improved soft option products, increased grower awareness and information, extension and publications. Developing and testing fungal biopesticides against sucking pests, managing insecticide resistance and field testing biocontrol agents against thrips were considered the top three topics for further research of 28 topics listed and prioritised by the workshop participants...|$|R

40|$|Television {{has been}} a social medium since its {{introduction}} in households all over the world. Although televisions main aim is entertaining and informing its viewers, people often watch television together with close relatives or good friends, talk about whats going on while watching te levision or even structure their social activities around a television s how. But television programs {{are also part of}} social interactions away f rom the television set, when discussing favourite television programs ar ound the water cooler at work or recommending shows to watch to good fri ends. As television becomes digital and interactive, new possibilities f or enhancing television programs and creating new services arise. Howeve r, current interactive television programs and services often ignore the social nature of traditional television and as a result are not adapted to the way people actually use and watch (interactive) television. Alth ough usability heuristics exist to make interactive television easier to use, there were no sociability heuristics which could ensure that inter active television programs and services support the social uses of telev ision, a gap this PhD intends to fill. In order to create sociability heuristics, five social interactive telev ision systems were tested in a lab environment with in total 149 users. The systems that were tested are AmigoTV, Windows Media Center, Social T V, Communication Systems on Interactive TV (CoSe) and Ambulant Annotator. The results of these user tests were analysed using a grounded theory approach, and were complemented with reports from other lab and field st udies of similar systems. This resulted in a list of twelve sociability heuristics that can guide the design as well as the evaluation of social television systems. The list of sociability heuristics presented in this PhD includes import ant aspects to take into account then designing social interactive television systems, such as offering different options for communicatin g, guaranteeing personal as well as group privacy, or adapting the progr ams and services to specific television genres. Although the heuristics are aimed at social interactive television in particular, they {{can also be used to}} make traditional interactive television services such as Elec tronic Programme Guides (EPG) more social.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is ready to start up for its second three-year run. The 27 km LHC is the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world operating at a temperature of - 217 degrees Centigrade and powered to a current of 11, 000 amps. Run 2 of the LHC follows a two-year technical stop that prepared the machine for running at almost double the energy of the first run. After substantial consolidation and improvements the LHC will restart at an energy of 6. 5 TeV per beam, which will open up a new window for discovery - collisions at a total energy of 13 TeV expected late Spring. CERN General Director Rolf Heuer, the Director of Accelerators Frédérick Bordry, and the LHC experiment representatives will take questions regarding the LHC second three-year run, focussing on the technical challenges in preparing for Run 2, and on the new discovery potential. LHC experimental physicists and theorists will be at your disposal for interviews {{at the end of the}} briefing. The highlight of the machine’s successful first run was the discovery by the ATLAS and CMS experiments of the long-sought Higgs boson. You can find here material prepared on the LHC restart. We hope to see you there, or you can follow the briefing by webcast on the day.  </p...|$|R
