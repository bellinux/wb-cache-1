5|$|Shipping {{is another}} import sector with Maersk, the world's largest {{shipping}} company, having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, Copenhagen Port. Following decades of stagnation, it {{has experienced a}} resurgence since 1990 following a merger with Malmö harbour. <b>Both</b> <b>ports</b> are operated by Copenhagen Malmö Port (CMP).

CMP annually receives about 8,000 ships and handled some 148,000 TEU in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} serial port, {{designed for}} use with a printer or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external modem port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud modem for communications. As a result, {{for the first time}} a user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster external modem simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces could not be used because they required the dedicated use of <b>both</b> <b>ports.</b> A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the internal modem slot for consumers who needed traditional functions.|$|E

5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early as the morning after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at <b>both</b> <b>ports</b> over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the disembarked French units {{started to}} head for Marseille and Toulon. The initial plan was to capture the ports in succession, but the {{unexpected}} Allied advance allowed the French commander de Lattre de Tassigny to attack <b>both</b> <b>ports</b> almost simultaneously. He split his forces into two units, with Joseph de Goislard de Monsabert tasked to take Toulon from the east while Edgard de Larminat drove north to encircle the city at the flanks. The Germans had a significant force stationed in both cities, but they lacked the {{time to prepare for}} a determined defense. After heavy fighting around Hyères, which temporarily stopped the advance, French forces approached Toulon on 19August. At the same time, Monsabert swung around the city, enveloped it, and cut off the highway between Toulon and Marseille. On 21August, the French pressed into Toulon, and heavy fighting ensued. The heavy German resistance led to an argument between Larminat and deTassigny, after which deTassigny took over direct command of the operation, dismissing Larminat. By 26August the remaining German units had surrendered. The battle for Toulon cost the French 2,700 casualties, but they captured all remaining German forces who lost their entire garrison of 18,000 men.|$|E

25|$|By 1600, trading colonies {{had grown}} up {{on either side of}} the well-travelled {{shipping}} routes: the Dutch settled along the eastern seaboard of Scotland; the Scots congregating first in Campvere—where they were allowed to land their goods duty-free and run their own affairs—and then in Rotterdam, where Scottish and Dutch Calvinism coexisted comfortably. Besides the thousands (or, according to one estimate, over 1 million) of local descendants with Scots ancestry, <b>both</b> <b>ports</b> still show signs of these early alliances. Now a museum, 'The Scots House' in the town of Veere was the only place outwith Scotland where Scots Law was practised. In Rotterdam, meanwhile, the doors of the Scots International Church have remained open since 1643.|$|E
25|$|The {{brushless}} wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) {{machine is}} the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., <b>both</b> <b>ports</b> independently excited with no short-circuited port). The dual ported transformer circuit topology {{is known to be}} unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.|$|E
25|$|Rajasinha's son {{ascended to}} the throne as Vimaladharmasuriya II, and his twenty-year reign (1687–1707) proved {{relatively}} peaceable. A trade war broke out in 1701, when the Kandyans closed their borders with Dutch territories in order to stimulate trade through the ports of Puttalam and Kottiyar. As a result, the Dutch {{lost control of the}} areca nut trade and retaliated; by 1707 Kandyan borders had reopened and <b>both</b> <b>ports</b> were closed. Upon his death Vimaladharmasurya was succeeded by his son, who ruled as Vira Narendra Sinha. Several anti-Dutch uprisings occurred in the lowlands {{during the course of the}} 1720s and 1730s; the Kandyans in turn declared war in the Dutch in 1736 and seized some territory. Hostilities subsided with the appointment of Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff as Governor, and by 1737 the Dutch and Kandyans were once again at peace.|$|E

25|$|The port to the Qt4 {{series was}} {{expected}} to enable KDE 4 to use less memory and be noticeably faster than KDE 3. The KDE libraries themselves have also been made more efficient. However, tests reveal that KDE 4.4 has the highest memory utilization on default Ubuntu installations when compared to GNOME 2.29, Xfce 4.6, and LXDE 0.5. Qt4 is available under the LGPL for Mac OS X and Windows, which allows KDE 4 to run on those platforms. The ports to both platforms are in an early state. , KDE Software compilation 4 on Mac OS X is considered beta, while on Windows {{it is not in}} the final state, so applications can be unsuitable for day to day use yet. <b>Both</b> <b>ports</b> are trying to use as little divergent code as possible to make the applications function almost identically on all platforms. During Summer of Code 2007 an icon cache was created to decrease application start-up times for use in KDE 4. Improvements were varied – Kfind, an application which used several hundred icons, started up in {{about a quarter of the}} time it took previously. Other applications and a full KDE session started up a little over a second faster.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May the stalemated Phoney War {{ended with}} a {{sweeping}} German invasion of the Benelux. German troops entered France through the Ardennes on 13 May. Most Allied forces were in Flanders, anticipating a re-run of the World War I Schlieffen Plan. The push by the German Army Group A towards the coast combined with the approach of Army Group B from the northeast left the BEF surrounded on three sides and cut off from their supply depots by 21 May. The British forces attempted to stop the offensive and launched counter-attacks including at Arras on 21 May. The BEF was unable to repel the Germans and {{it became clear that}} the Channel ports were threatened. Fresh troops were rushed from England to defend Bolougne and Calais, but after hard fighting, <b>both</b> <b>ports</b> were in German hands by 26 May (see Battle of Boulogne (1940) and Siege of Calais (1940)). Gort ordered that the BEF should withdraw to Dunkirk, the only viable port remaining, to facilitate evacuation. In total, 338,226 troops were pulled off the beaches, of which 230,000 were British. However, almost all the army's equipment had been abandoned in France — many soldiers were unable to bring even their rifles.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} of the war in 1939 until VE Day, several of Canada's Atlantic coast ports became {{important}} to the resupply effort for the United Kingdom and later for the Allied land offensive on the Western Front. Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia, became the primary convoy assembly ports, with Halifax being assigned the fast or priority convoys (largely troops and essential material) with the more modern merchant ships, while Sydney was given slow convoys which conveyed bulkier material on older and more vulnerable merchant ships. <b>Both</b> <b>ports</b> were heavily fortified with shore radar emplacements, search light batteries, and extensive coastal artillery stations all manned by RCN and Canadian Army regular and reserve personnel. Military intelligence agents enforced strict blackouts throughout the areas and anti-torpedo nets were in place at the harbor entrances, making a direct attack on those facilities unfeasible due to the impossibility for Germany to provide air support. Even though no landings of German personnel took place near these ports, there were frequent attacks by U-boats on convoys departing for Europe once these had reached the mouth of the St. Lawrence. Less extensively used, but no less important, was the port of Saint John which also saw matériel funneled through the port, largely after the United States entered the war in December 1941. The port's location within the protected waters of the Bay of Fundy made it a difficult target for attack. The Canadian Pacific Railway mainline from central Canada (which crossed the state of Maine) could be used to transport in aid of the war effort.|$|E
