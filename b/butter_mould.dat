50|$|A butter stamp, is {{a device}} for {{stamping}} a design onto {{a block of}} warm butter. They were sometimes commercial but usually purely decorative and applied in homes. The stamps are typically made of wood, and feature simple designs, of cows, flowers or geometric designs and, if commercial, {{the name of the}} retailer. Often they form part of a box-like mould for forming the whole block. Other designs achieved the same effect by carving the design {{at the bottom of a}} <b>butter</b> <b>mould.</b> Part of the intent for commercial moulds and stamps was to demonstrate consistency in the quantity of butter sold. Both moulds and stamps are now normally inexpensive antiques.|$|E

25|$|In Poland, {{the butter}} lamb (Baranek wielkanocny) is a {{traditional}} addition to the Easter Meal for many Polish Catholics. Butter is shaped into a lamb either by hand or in a lamb-shaped <b>mould.</b> <b>Butter</b> {{is also used to}} make edible decorations to garnish other dishes.|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{examination}} of 50 samples of both packed and unpacked butter was carried out. The samples were examined for total viable count, mould and yeast count, spore formers and coliform. The microbial load in the unpacked sample of butter was highest i. e., 3. 8 x 106 /gm - 6. 6 x l 06 /gm. The coliform count was found maximum in unpacked sample {{and one of}} the packed sample of butter (Kausar brand) i. e., 39 /ml. The unpacked sample of butter contained highest number of aerobic spore formers i. e., 280 /gm. The anaerobic spore-formers were found absent in 20 samples of butter and the rest contained in the range of 0 - 170 /gm. The yeast cultures were found only in the sample of Lyallpur and Kausar <b>butter.</b> The <b>mould</b> count of these samples ranged from 0 - 280 /gm...|$|R

The smoke point of butterfat is around 200 °C (400 °F), so clarified butter or ghee is better suited to frying. Ghee has always been a common frying medium in India, where many avoid other animal fats for cultural or religious reasons.|$|R
6000|$|A Lama {{accompanied}} this {{colony of}} Tibetans, a festival {{in honour of}} Kinchinjhow being annually held at a large chait hard by, which is painted red, ornamented with banners, and surmounted by an enormous yak's skull, that faces the mountain. The Lama invited me into his tent, where I found a wife and family. An extempore altar was at one end, covered with wafers and other pretty ornaments, made of <b>butter,</b> stamped or <b>moulded</b> with the fingers.* [The extensive use of these ornaments throughout Tibet, {{on the occasion of}} religious festivals, is alluded to by MM. Huc and Gabet.] The tents being insupportably noisome, I preferred partaking of the buttered brick-tea in the open air; after which, I went to see the shawl-wool goats sheared in a pen close by. There are two varieties: one is a large animal, with great horns, called [...] "Rappoo;"* [This is the [...] "Changra;" [...] and the smaller the [...] "Chyapu" [...] of Mr. Hodgson's catalogue. (See [...] "British Museum Catalogue.")] the other smaller, and with slender horns, is called [...] "Tsilloo." [...] The latter yields the finest wool, but they are mixed for ordinary purposes. I was assured that the sheep (of which large flocks were grazing near) afford the finest wool of any. The animals were caught by the tail, their legs tied, the long winter's hair pulled out, and the remainder cut away with a broad flat knife, which was sharpened with a scythe-stone. The operation was clumsily performed, and the skin much cut.|$|R
40|$|Sixty {{samples of}} butter were {{randomly}} collected from different retail sales in Khartoum state. The objectives were: 1. Evaluate {{the level of}} yeasts and moulds with total aerobic counts, total coliform bacteria in the imported and locally manufactured butter; 2. Relating these levels to the standard values and comparing between the imported and the locally manufactured product in this respect. 3. To study the association between the source of butter (imported / locally manufactured) and presence / absence of yeasts and moulds. 4. To investigate the incidence (%) of yeasts and different moulds genera in locally manufactured and imported butter. The overall mean counts of yeasts and moulds was 86855. 25 ± 38144. 31 c. f. u/g. This level was exceeding far than the standard values. The overall mean of the total aerobic counts 1952758. 33 ± 431788 c. f. u/g. Similarly this value {{was far from the}} standards. The mean of the total coliform was 348. 13 ± 74. 82 MPN/g. This value was also above the standard one. Highly significant differences were recorded in the levels of yeast and moulds between the locally manufactured and imported butter. The mean of yeasts and moulds counted in the locally manufactured butter was greater than the standards (133446. 15 ± 57552. 20 c. f. u/g), whereas in the imported was in conformity with the (SMS) standard value (329. 29 ± 193. 32 c. f. u/g). The total coliforms in the locally manufactured butter (535. 10 ± 103. 65 MPN/g) was very highly significantly different from the imported one (0. 90 ± 0. 90 MPN/g). The locally manufactured butter was far from all the standard values. There was no significant association between the source of butter (locally manufactured / imported) and presence and absence of yeast and mould genera. There was very highly significant difference between the incidence of Aspergillus in locally manufactured and imported butter. There {{were no significant differences between}} the locally manufactured and imported butter in the incidence of Rhizopus, Penicillium, Fusarium and Alternaria. The results indicate that the contamination of locally manufactured <b>butter</b> by yeasts, <b>moulds,</b> aerobic bacteria and coliform bacteria is serious and need to be managed. The present study recommended several precautionary measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{shea tree}} Vitellaria paradoxa L. {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} tree crops in northern Ghana with the shea butter fat {{as the most important}} product from the tree. Difference in the shea butter fat quality is mainly attributed to bioclimatic variations in temperature and rainfall. The {{purpose of this study was}} to apply near infrared, wet chemistry and gas chromatography to characterize the fat and free fatty acid profiles of shea butter fat from three locations (Paga, Nyankpala and Kawampe) in Ghana. The shea nuts from the tree locations in Ghana conformed to the West Africa shea nuts on the global data base on shea nuts compiled at CIRAD. Samples from Paga recorded the highest moisture content ranging between 5. 63 % and 12. 04 % (dry matter) with a mean content of 6. 83 % and a standard deviation of 1. 30 % whilst from Kawampe recorded the lowest moisture content with a mean of 5. 23 %. Samples from Kawampe recorded the highest fat content ranging from 47. 07 % to 57. 39 % (dry matter) with a mean content of 52. 69 % and a standard deviation of 2. 55 % with samples from Paga recording the lowest fat content with a mean of 48. 84 %. Stearic acid content of the samples was higher than oleic acid content from the three locations with virtually the same ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Correlation between wet chemistry values and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) predicted values for moisture content (calibration set) with regression of 0. 974 indicating the ability of NIRS to differentiate between nuts from different regions. The nature of the dried shea nuts before processing affected the quality of the shea <b>butter</b> fat as <b>moulded</b> samples recorded higher free fatty acids reducing the quality of the shea butter fat. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) analyses indicated that the samples from the three locations in Ghana were mostly saturated with stearic and oleic acids and less of palmitic, vaccenic, linoleic and arachidic acids in the fatty acid profiles of shea butter fats.
