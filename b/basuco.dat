5000|$|<b>Basuco</b> ("bazooka") is {{the term}} used for cocaine paste in Colombia, the world's second biggest cocaine {{producer}} after Peru. <b>Basuco</b> {{is derived from the}} Spanish word for trash (basura), literally meaning [...] "little dirty trash" [...] (of cocaine), referring to the paste left {{at the bottom of a}} barrel after cocaine production. <b>Basuco</b> is mostly smoked, either rolled like a cigarette with tobacco or cannabis, or more commonly from selfmade pipes. These are often improvised from PVC so users will inhale toxic plastic components. <b>Basuco</b> is said to be [...] "more potent than the crack cocaine found across European and American cities". <b>Basuco</b> users may take other psychoactive agents, like industrial alcohol and MDMA to manage the drug effects, the high and the paranoia.|$|E

5000|$|One {{of those}} [...] "friends" [...] was Rafael Cardona Salazar, a.k.a. [...] "Rafa"; a five-foot three {{sociopath}} {{with a taste}} for <b>basuco</b> cigarettes; an amalgamation of tobacco and cocaine byproducts stuffed back into cigarette shells. After Max returned to Miami with his family to work as chief engineer of the Aventura Country Club, he was awakened by a drug-fueled Rafa on Christmas morning 1978. Rafa insisted that Max drive him and his roommate back home after a cocaine-filled afterparty. Max agreed, and on the trip, Rafa and the roommate argued after Rafa accused the roommate of stealing. In a rage, Rafa shot him to death at close range. Fearing for his own life, Max continued to drive until they stopped to dispose of the body at a road shoulder. They then returned to Rafa's apartment where Rafa told Max, [...] "You work for me now".|$|E
50|$|Coca paste (paco, <b>basuco,</b> oxi) is a crude extract of the {{coca leaf}} which {{contains}} 40% to 91% cocaine sulfate along with companion coca alkaloids and varying quantities of benzoic acid, methanol, and kerosene. In South America, coca paste, {{also known as}} cocaine base and, therefore, often confused with cocaine freebase in North America, is relatively inexpensive and is widely used by low-income populations. The coca paste is smoked in tobacco or cannabis cigarettes and use has become widespread in several Latin American countries. Traditionally, coca paste has been relatively abundant in South American countries such as Colombia where it is processed into cocaine hydrochloride ("street cocaine") for distribution {{to the rest of}} the world. The caustic reactions associated with the local application of coca paste prevents its use by oral, intranasal, mucosal, intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous routes. Coca paste can only be smoked when combined with a very inflammable material such as tobacco or cannabis.|$|E
