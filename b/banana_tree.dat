5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer is incredible. A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, plantain, broad beans, okra, <b>banana</b> <b>tree</b> stems and flowers, green jackfruit, and red pumpkins {{are to be found in}} the markets popularly known as anaj bazaar. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E

The {{north of the}} island produced various master craftsman who created distinctive balconies, celosias, doors, and windows, as well as furniture consisting of pieces made in fine wood. Basketmaking using palm-leaves was also an important industry. Other materials are chestnut tree branches stripped of their leaves and <b>banana</b> <b>tree</b> fibre (known locally as la badana).|$|E
25|$|Thursday fasting {{is common}} among the Hindus of {{northern}} India. On Thursdays, devotees {{listen to a}} story before opening their fast.

Food items are made with yellow-coloured ghee. Thursday is also dedicated to Guru and many Hindus who follow a guru will fast on this day.|$|E

500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm sure my ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. But I always like to think {{that there is only one}} race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung Pisang – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the <b>banana</b> <b>tree.</b> He was inspired by the fact that the banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a <b>banana</b> <b>tree.</b> We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{source of}} the virus is {{revealed}} to viewers. A bulldozer (coincidently, operating for the company Emhoff worked for) knocks down a palm tree disturbing some bats, with one finding shelter and food in a <b>banana</b> <b>tree.</b> That bat then flies over a pig pen, dropping a chunk of banana from its mouth, which is then eaten by a piglet. Chinese chefs later collect pigs from the pen {{and take them to}} a Hong Kong casino. A chef is called away from his preparations of a piglet, and casually wipes his hands on his apron. [...] The chef then shakes hands with Beth Emhoff, giving her the mix of bat and pig viruses that makes her patient zero and the origin of the MEV-1 virus.|$|E
500|$|The {{marital status}} of Ganesha varies widely in mythological stories {{and the issue}} {{has been the subject}} of {{considerable}} scholarly review. Several patterns of associations with different consorts are identifiable. One pattern of myths identifies Ganesha as an unmarried brahmacārin with no consorts. Another pattern associates him with the concepts of Buddhi (intellect), Siddhi (spiritual power), and Riddhi (prosperity); these qualities are sometimes personified as goddesses who are considered to be Ganesha's wives. [...] Another pattern connects Ganesha with the goddess of culture and the arts, Sarasvati. In the Bengal region he is linked with the <b>banana</b> <b>tree,</b> Kala Bo (or Kola Bou).

500|$|As an art critic, Shen {{criticized the}} {{paintings}} of Li Cheng (919–967) for failing to observe the principle of [...] "seeing the small {{from the viewpoint of}} the large" [...] in portraying buildings and the like. He praised the works of Dong Yuan (c. 934–c. 962); he noted that although a close-up view of Dong's work would create the impression that his brush techniques were cursory, seen from afar his landscape paintings would give the impression of grand, resplendent, and realistic scenery. In addition, Shen's writing on Dong's artworks represents the earliest known reference to the Jiangnan style of painting. In his [...] "Song on Painting" [...] and in his Dream Pool Essays, Shen praised the creative artworks of the Tang painter Wang Wei (701–761); Shen noted that Wang was unique in that he [...] "penetrated into the mysterious reason and depth of creative activity," [...] but was criticized by others for not conforming his paintings to reality, such as his painting with a <b>banana</b> <b>tree</b> growing in a snowy, wintry landscape.|$|E

2500|$|George Loddiges' {{tropical}} hothouse range {{made use}} of recently invented curvilinear iron glazing bars and central heating systems, which together with his own inventions, enabled many new species of tropical plant to be introduced into cultivation, or flower {{for the first time}} in Europe. Visiting the hothouses on 30 March 1822, the Quaker pharmacist William Allen, his Cousin Emily Birkbeck and Anna Hanbury noted: We all went to Loddiges Nursery to see the camellias which are now in full bloom and very beautiful ! There is quite a forest of them: his hot-houses are, perhaps, the most capricious in the world: one off them is forty feet high: in this there is a <b>banana</b> <b>tree</b> which nearly reaches the top. A few years later, in 1829, Jacob Rinz (a visitor from a Frankfurt nursery) commented: never shall I forget the sensation produced by this establishment. I cannot describe the raptures I experienced on seeing that immense palm house. All that I had seen before of the kind appeared nothing to me compared with this. I fancied myself in the and especially at that moment when Mr Loddiges had the kindness to produce, in my presence, a shower of artificial rain. Such conditions were ideal for tropical orchids, several of which were named in honour of George Loddiges, including Loddiges' dendrobium.|$|E

60|$|But he {{was reading}} the full report which many men had written on the ground. A white man had been there, he learned, {{and a number of}} blacks. Here a black had climbed a coconut tree and cast down the nuts. There a <b>banana</b> <b>tree</b> had been despoiled of its {{clustered}} fruit; and, beyond, it was evident that a similar event had happened to a breadfruit tree. One thing, however, puzzled him--a scent new to him that was neither black man's nor white man's. Had he had the necessary knowledge and the wit of eye-observance, he would have noted that the footprint was smaller than a man's and that the toeprints were different from a Mary's in that they were close together and did not press deeply into the earth. What bothered him in his smelling was his ignorance of talcum powder. Pungent it was in his nostrils, but never, since first he had smelled out the footprints of man, had he encountered such a scent. And with this were combined other and fainter scents that were equally strange to him.|$|E
60|$|Schemmer {{had made}} the {{guillotine}} himself. He was a handy man, and though {{he had never seen}} a guillotine, the French officials had explained the principle to him. It was on his suggestion that they had ordered the execution to take place at Atimaono instead of at Papeete. The scene of the crime, Schemmer had argued, was the best possible place for the punishment, and, in addition, it would have a salutary influence upon the half-thousand Chinagos on the plantation. Schemmer had also volunteered to act as executioner, and in that capacity he was now on the scaffold, experimenting with the instrument he had made. A <b>banana</b> <b>tree,</b> of the size and consistency of a man's neck, lay under the guillotine. Ah Cho watched with fascinated eyes.
