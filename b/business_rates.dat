25|$|On 1 April 2013 a {{new system}} of <b>business</b> <b>rates</b> {{retention}} began in England. Before April 2013 all business rate income collected by councils formed a single, national pot, which was then distributed by government in the form of formula grant. Through the Local Government Finance Act 2012, and regulations that followed, the Government gave local authorities the power to keep up to half of business rate income and transfer half of it centrally, to central government. The central share is then distributed to councils in the form of Revenue Support Grant. The other half kept by local authorities are then subjected to tariff, levy, top up and safety payments depending on the financial position of the council. According to the government the change gives financial incentives to councils to grow their local economies and increase their income from <b>business</b> <b>rates.</b> At the same time the new scheme has resulted in more risk and uncertainty.|$|E
25|$|Taxation in the United Kingdom {{may involve}} {{payments}} {{to at least}} two different levels of government: local government and central government (HM Revenue & Customs). Local government is financed by grants from central government funds, <b>business</b> <b>rates,</b> council tax, and, increasingly, fees and charges such as those from on-street parking. Central government revenues are mainly from income tax, national insurance contributions, value added tax, corporation tax and fuel duty.|$|E

50|$|Councils are {{expected}} {{by the government}} to be largely self-financing. The government has steadily removed hypothecated funding for child social care, and for safeguarding children from abuse or neglect. Historically, councils had to send <b>Business</b> <b>Rate</b> revenue to the government, while the government provided a large grant to councils based on need. Under the Cameron Ministry, the <b>Business</b> <b>rate</b> system was changed, so that councils keep 50% of the revenue; the central government grant was correspondingly reduced, and hypothecated streams merged into the general grant. The central grant has continued to fall, and shortly councils will retain 100% of <b>Business</b> <b>Rate</b> revenue. The grant has also fallen due to school funding being transferred directly to new Academy schools, and Housing Benefit (paid via the council) being replaced by centrally paid Universal Credit.|$|R

25|$|During the {{introduction}} of <b>business</b> <b>rates,</b> criticism focused {{on the level of}} the multiplier to be chosen, and on the transitional relief scheme, with organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry calling for a lower multiplier and a relief scheme more to the benefit of its members. In 2007, the Lyons Inquiry into Local Government said there was no significant opposition to the principles of the tax, but that the level was a concern to property-intensive businesses. Due to the overall yield being linked to the Retail Prices Index as a measure of inflation, the contribution of <b>business</b> <b>rates</b> to local government finance has decreased compared to Council Tax and government grants. Many local authorities have called for the rate to be increased, and for the power to set the multiplier to be returned to local control; both suggestions have been opposed by business organisations such as the British Retail Consortium. The Lyons Inquiry rejected the return to local control, and instead proposed giving local authorities the power to levy a local supplement, in consultation with affected businesses; responses from the business sector have ranged from caution to opposition.|$|E
25|$|In Wales, small <b>business</b> <b>rates</b> {{relief was}} not {{introduced}} until 2007. It replaced rural property relief, but included similar provisions, with 50% relief for most properties with a rateable value below £2,000, and 25% relief for rateable values between £2,000 and £5,000. Post offices with rateable values {{of up to}} £9,000 are eligible for 100% relief; while those over £9,000 and up to £12,000 receive 50%. It also authorises local authorities to set up local schemes of relief for properties up to a limit of £12,000 rateable value.|$|E
25|$|To give {{relief to}} {{properties}} considered vital to rural communities, {{a combination of}} compulsory and discretionary reliefs exist in England. The Welsh scheme was incorporated into small <b>business</b> <b>rates</b> relief from 1 April 2007.

25|$|<b>Business</b> <b>rates</b> are {{the latest}} {{incarnation}} {{of a series of}} taxes for funding local services known as rates, based on property values. The first rate was part of the Elizabethan Poor Law Act 1572, which established relief for the poor at the local parish level, paid for by inhabitants of the parish. A system of rates to fund local government and services evolved over the next three centuries, including a separate system for London from 1869 to 1963. Changes included a stricter definition of how to value for a rate; the introduction of a valuation list containing the assessed values; the ability to object to the assessed value; and the introduction of the valuation officer, appointed by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue (now Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs), as the assessor.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Government has {{the power}} to raise or lower the rate of income tax in Scotland by up to 3p in the pound. It is also able to vary <b>business</b> <b>rates</b> and can {{regulate}} the application of local taxes such as the council tax levied by local authorities in Scotland. The Scottish Government has full control over how Scotland's annual block grant is divided between government departments, such as healthcare and education and on state-owned enterprises, e.g. Scottish Water and Caledonian MacBrayne. The Scottish Government does however have control over Economic Development policy, and controls, funds and regulates the national Economic development Agency – Scottish Enterprise. In 2016, for example, the budget of the Scottish Government was around £37bn, which the Scottish Government can spend on the areas under its jurisdiction such as education, healthcare, transport, the environment and justice.|$|E
25|$|The new {{non-domestic}} {{rating system}} {{became known as}} <b>business</b> <b>rates,</b> or sometimes the universal business rate. It retained from its predecessors {{the concept of a}} series of local rating lists, with each property being assessed for a rateable value based on rental values. Rating lists were prepared and maintained by the Valuation Office (reconstituted in 1991 as an UK Government Executive Agency, the Valuation Office Agency), while billing and collection was the responsibility of local authorities. Previously, local authorities had decided what proportion of rateable values to charge; the new system featured a centrally set multiplier, {{often referred to as the}} Uniform Business Rate, by which the basic bill was calculated. The bill could be further modified by various reliefs, including the newly introduced transitional relief, which was designed to smooth large changes in liability due to revaluations. The multiplier was calculated to ensure that, on average, bills rose by no more than the rate of inflation.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Business</b> <b>rates</b> is the {{commonly}} used name in England of non-domestic rates, {{a tax on}} the occupation of non-domestic property (National Non-Domestic Rates – NNDR).
