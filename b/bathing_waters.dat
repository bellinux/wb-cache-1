40|$|Birds of {{most species}} {{regularly}} bathe in water, but {{the function of}} this behaviour is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that <b>water</b> <b>bathing</b> is important in feather maintenance, and hence should enhance flight performance. We manipulated European starlings', Sturnus vulgaris, access to <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> in a 2 × 2 design: birds were housed in aviaries either with or without water baths {{for a minimum of}} 3 days (long-term access) before being caught and placed in individual cages either with or without water baths for a further 24 h (short-term access). We subsequently assessed the speed and accuracy of escape flights through an obstacle course of vertical strings. Birds that had bathed in the short-term flew more slowly and hit fewer strings than birds that were deprived of <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> in the short term, whereas long-term access to <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> had no significant effect on flight performance. Thus recent access to <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> alters flight performance by altering the trade-off between escape flight speed and accuracy. We hypothesize that lack of <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> provision could increase anxiety in captive starlings because of an increase in their perceived vulnerability to predation. This study therefore potentially provides an important functional link between the expression of natural behaviours in captivity and welfare considerations. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Quality of <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> is of key {{importance}} for bathers’ health, mainly {{due to the}} fact, that each year millions of people use bathing sites as places for recreation and sport activities. Most of the bathing sites are of adequate quality of water, but still there are cases of health risk because <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> is polluted. One of the main health risk factor in <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> are cyanobacteria and their blooms. Cyanobacteria are microorganisms of morphological features of bacteria and algae. They live in colonies, which in large quantities show up as streaks, dense foam on the water surface. The aim {{of this paper was}} {{to assess the impact of}} cyanobacteria blooms on health regarding <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> quality in Poland. Materials and methods: Assessment covered all bathing sites in Poland supervised by Polish National Sanitary Inspection (PIS) in the period from 2007 to 2009. The base was data collected during <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> monitoring conducted by PIS and their formal decisions of bathing bans introduced in response to revealed <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> pollution. Results and discussion: The results of assessment indicate, that about one-fourth of all bathing bans in Poland was due to cyanobacteria blooms. Conclusions: Every fifth bathing sites located on artificial lake or water reservoir and every tenth on the sea bathing sites were polluted. Average period of bathing ban due to cyanobacteria blooms in Poland varies. Relatively the shortest bathing bans were observed on the sea bathing sites (no longer than one week on average). Much longer were bathing bans on lakes and artificial lakes (one month on average) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of bird taxa perform <b>water</b> <b>bathing,</b> but {{little is known}} about the adaptive value of this behaviour. If bathing is important for feather maintenance then birds that have not bathed should have poorer feather condition, compromised escape ability and therefore increased responsiveness to cues of predation. We conducted two experiments examining the behaviour of captive starlings responding to conspecific alarm calls. Birds that had no access to <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> showed a decreased willingness to feed and increased their vigilance behaviour following an alarm call. We argue that birds denied access to <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> interpreted an ambiguous cue of threat as requiring more caution than birds that had access, consistent with higher levels of anxiety.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model {{is used to}} assess the <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> quality of Bray and Killiney bathing sites in Ireland following changes to the sewage management system. The model, firstly calibrated to hydrodynamic and water quality data from the period prior to the upgrade of the Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW), was then used to simulate Escherichia coli (E. coli) distributions for discharge scenarios of the periods prior to and following the upgrade of the WwTW under dry and wet weather conditions. E. coli distributions under dry weather conditions demonstrate that the upgrade in the WwTW has remarkably improved the <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> quality to a Blue Flag status. The new discharge strategy is expected to drastically reduce the rainfall-related incidents in which environmental limits of the <b>Bathing</b> <b>Water</b> Directive are breached.

The Colilert method was found to be more sensitive than Swedish standard methods for detecting coliform bacteria and of equal sensitivity for detecting Escherichia coli when all drinking water samples were grouped together. Based on these results, Swedac, the Swedish laboratory accreditation body, approved for the first time in Sweden use of the Colilert method at this laboratory for the analysis of all water sources not falling under public water regulations (A-krav). The coliform detection study of <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> yielded anomalous results due to confirmation difficulties.

5000|$|The council {{additionally}} {{monitor the}} quality of the water which surrounds the Neath Port Talbot area. High quality <b>bathing</b> <b>waters</b> are important {{for a wide variety of}} interests and to support the local tourism industry. The beaches in the area are exceptionally popular during the summer months which generates a vast amount of economic benefits for the area. By monitoring the water quality it safeguards the environment and the tourism industry. Which in the long run makes it environmentally sustainable and economically sustainable. Additionally the council identifies and keeps a register of the contaminated land use in the area. They do this to protect the people that currently live there and also to protect those that live there in the future. Once these contaminated areas have been identified the council then carry out a clean-up operation of that specific area, this ensures that the region stays as environmentally friendly as possible, this will warrant their environmental sustainability. Another step in ensuring environmental sustainability is the new and improved recycling service implemented in July 2014. They aim to make it easier for households to recycle more materials at the kerbside more often. They implemented colour coded boxes for different materials known as recycle plus (+). The council drives to increase recycling by encouraging local communities to get involved. They have also introduced another sustainable scheme across small villages within the borough known as [...] "The Big Bin Swap" [...] which encourages more people to make the switch sorting waste into smaller wheelie bins, in places where recycling rates are low. Replacing bins with 140 litre capacity, to guide locals into seeing the benefits to the environment and also the economy in recycling.|$|E

5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust <b>bathing</b> and <b>water</b> <b>bathing.</b> Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust <b>bathing</b> (or <b>water</b> <b>bathing</b> where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. <b>Bathing</b> with <b>water</b> involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|R

However, managing coastal zones solely in terms of public health could have potentially negative consequences on a range of other social and cultural ecosystem services, e. g. recreation. Improving our knowledge of how <b>bathing</b> <b>waters,</b> surrounding beach environments and local economies might respond to shifts in management decisions is critical in order to inform reliable decision-making, and to evaluate future implications for human health.

Morning and afternoon sampling for faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and the pathogen Campylobacter was carried out monthly over the 1996 and 1997 bathing seasons. In the afternoons average faecal coliforms declined by 77 % in 1996 and 87 % in 1997 compared with the mornings, faecal streptococci by 79 % and 83 % and campylobacters by 66 % and 86 %. This decline in bacterial numbers between morning and afternoon was related to variations in water temperature and levels of ultraviolet radiation. All three <b>bathing</b> <b>waters</b> failed the Guideline criteria of the EU Directive on Bathing Water Quality. Using the Imperative criteria, no <b>bathing</b> <b>waters</b> passed in the mornings of either year, some passed in the afternoons of 1996 and all passed in the afternoons of 1997. The increased pass rate in 1997 coincided with improved sewage treatment, high temperatures and increased levels of sunshine.
