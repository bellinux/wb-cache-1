By 1939, large, deeply buried (80 to 110 feet), thawed, <b>bench</b> <b>placer</b> deposits {{on the northwest}} limit of Livengood Creek valley were defined. The pay streak varied from 100 to 1000 ft wide and was at least 6 mi long. Gold reserves of over 1 million ounces were defined by drilling prior to 1940. A dredge operated {{near the town of}} Livengood in 1940, 1946 and probably other years.|$|E

60|$|Like {{daughter}} like father. Tom, too, {{had been}} irresistible. All the world still called to him, and strange men came {{from time to}} time with its messages. Never had there been such visitors to the Travers home. Some came with the reminiscent roll of the sea in their gait. Others were black-browed ruffians; still others were fever-burnt and sallow; and about all of them was something bizarre and outlandish. Their talk was likewise bizarre and outlandish, of things to Frederick unguessed and undreamed, though he recognised the men for what they were--soldiers of fortune, adventurers, free lances of the world. But the big patent thing was the love and loyalty they bore their leader. They named him variously?--Black Tom, Blondine, Husky Travers, Malemute Tom, Swiftwater Tom--but most of all he was Captain Tom. Their projects and propositions were equally various, from the South Sea trader with the discovery of a new guano island and the Latin-American with a nascent revolution on his hands, on through Siberian gold chases and the prospecting of the <b>placer</b> <b>benches</b> of the upper Kuskokeem, to darker things that were mentioned only in whispers. And Captain Tom regretted the temporary indisposition that prevented immediate departure with them, and continued to sit and drowse more and more in the big chair. It was Polly, with a camaraderie distasteful to her uncle, who got these men aside and broke the news that Captain Tom would never go out on the shining ways again. But not all of them came with projects. Many made love-calls on their leader of old and unforgetable days, and Frederick sometimes was a witness to their meeting, and he marvelled anew at the mysterious charm in his brother that drew all men to him.|$|R
