In this paper three different methods, Calcium infusion (Ca), Very Fast Chilling (VFC) and pelvic suspension hanging from aitch bone (PS) or the Achilles tendon (AT) are applied in pre-rigor phase on Maremmana meat. Ca injection has reported the lowest shear force on cooked meat compared to control group (5. 09 vs. 16. 33 kg) instead VFC group has underlined intermediate values. Pelvic hanging has shown significant difference on shear force and sarcomere length on Longissimus thoracis muscle (4. 13 vs. 8. 11 kg and 1. 63 and 2. 04 μm respectively for WBS and sarcomere length in PS and AT); further in <b>Biceps</b> <b>femoralis</b> we have found a lowest collagen content (4. 33 vs. 4. 79 g/ 100 g for PS and AT). In conclusion these methods could influence tenderization processes even if some processes, that could lower the effect of these practices, are still unclear...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to verify the effect induced by the daily {{administration}} of the whole body vibration (WBV) on the mechanical behaviour of the leg muscles of 17 professional soccer players. Methods. One day before and one day after one month of five minutes of WBV treatment, was assessed the explosive power of the leg extensor muscles of the players, with the test introduced by Bosco (1983). This consisted on performing several jumping exercises performed with pre-stretch [Counter movement jump (CMJ), continuos jump (CJ) performed during 5 s and 15 s respectively]. In addition the extensibility of the leg flexor muscles (mm <b>biceps</b> <b>femoralis,</b> semitendinous and semimembranous) was measured using a "seat and reach" test. Results. The effect induced by WBV during thirty days produced, in all jumping test performed (CMJ, 5 s CJ, and 15 s CJ) an enhancement statistical significant of p< 0. 05 for the CMJ and 5 s CJ and p< 0. 01 for 15 CJ. The extensibility of the leg flexor muscles demonstrated dramatically high improvement p< 0. 001. Conclusions. Thus, the results of the present experiment have shown a concomitant enhancement of both leg extensor power and leg flexor extensibility. The improvement of the leg flexor muscles favourite and preserve the integrity of the muscles by decreasing the possibility of the occurrence of injures, which often occur during fast running in soccer players and sprinters. It can be suggested that, the utilisation of vibration may represent a treatment which in addition to prevent the occurrence injures, may improve strongly the explosive power of leg extensor muscles. Such enhancement most probably is determined by the potentiation of the nervous activity...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} test different dietary concentrations and different sources of vitamin E (VE) to reevaluate the dietary requirement of VE for young turkeys, and to determine whether an early high dose of VE given either by subcutaneous injection or added to the drinking water would improve the [alpha]-tocopherol ([alpha]TOC) status of poults. In Experiment 1, turkeys received 12 or 300 IU of VE/kg in the diet (dl-[alpha]-tocopheryl acetate (dl-[alpha]TACT)) or by subcutaneous injection (dl-[alpha]TOC), and were fed 5, 000 or 15, 000 IU of vitamin A/kg of diet. In Experiment 2, six of the treatments resulted from the factorial combination of two dietary sources (dl-[alpha]TACT or d-([alpha]TOC) and three concentrations (12, 80, or 150 IU/kg) of VE. The seventh treatment consisted of a single subcutaneous injection of 25 IU of d-[alpha]TOC at Day 1. In Experiment 3, treatments resulted from the addition to the diet of four equidistant increments of dl-[alpha]TACT (12, 46, 81, and 115 IU/kg of diet), or consisted of a single subcutaneous injection of 50 IU of d-[alpha]TOC at Day 1, or addition of 50 IU of d-[alpha]TOC/poult in the drinking water from Day 3 to Day 10. Increasing dietary concentrations of VE {{did not have a}} consistent effect on rate or efficiency of poult growth, but increased [alpha]TOC concentration in adipose tissue, adrenal glands, breast muscle (Pectoralis superficialis), bursa of Fabricius, small intestine, leg muscle (<b>Biceps</b> <b>femoralis),</b> liver, lung, pancreas, plasma, plasma fractions (VLDL, LDL, HDL), RBC, and uropygial gland. Increasing concentrations of dietary VE decreased RBC susceptibility to hemolysis from 1 to 21 d of age, but did not have an effect on plasma creatine kinase, plasma triglycerides, or liver TBARS. There was no consistent difference between sources of dietary VE (dl-[alpha]TACT, dl-[alpha]TOC, or d-[alpha]TOC) with respect to performance and tissue [alpha]TOC. Also, dietary vitamin A had little effect on performance or [alpha]TOC content of the tissues. Subcutaneous injection of dl-[alpha]TOC had variable effects on the parameters studied in Experiment 1, but injection of d-[alpha]TOC consistently increased [alpha]TOC in tissues and decreased the RBC susceptibility to hemolysis in Experiments 2 and 3. Supplementation of the drinking water with 50 IU of d-[alpha]TOC/poult from Day 3 to Day 10 temporarily increased [alpha]TOC in all tissues studied and decreased RBC hemolysis. There were high correlations between plasma [alpha]TOC and tissue [alpha]TOC, and liver [alpha]TOC and tissue [alpha]TOC after 7 d of age. As indicated by tissue [alpha]TOC and RBC susceptibility to hemolysis, concentrations between 81 and 115 IU of VE/kg of diet are needed to maintain an adequate health status of poults during the first 3 weeks after hatching...|$|E
40|$|O movimento de passar de sentado para em pé é uma habilidade que confere independência a todos os indivíduos e seus déficits podem causar dependência funcional. Conhecer melhor este movimento complexo permite aos profissionais da reabilitação reformular suas terapias e refletir sobre novas possibilidades de intervenção. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a ordem de ativação dos músculos tibial {{anterior}} (TA), gastrocnêmio medial (GM), reto femoral (RF), bíceps femoral (BF) e paravertebral lombar (PL) durante o movimento de passar de sentado para em pé em dois grupos de voluntários e comparar as estratégias musculares utilizadas por eles. Os sujeitos foram divididos em Grupo A: composto de vinte sujeitos com idade entre 20 a 35 anos, saudáveis, sem patologias associadas, sem uso de medicação e que obtiveram mais de 50 pontos no Teste de Berg; e Grupo B: composto de vinte sujeitos com idade entre 60 a 65 anos, sem doenças neurológicas associadas e que obtiveram mais de 50 pontos no Teste de Berg. Os dois grupos foram estudados sob duas condições: com os olhos abertos e com os olhos fechados. O sinal elétrico dos músculos foi mensurado através da eletromiografia de superfície e para indicar o momento do início do movimento um eletrogoniômetro flexível bidimensional foi utilizado nas articulações do quadril e joelho unilateralmente. Os resultados mostraram que o grupo A realizou o movimento num tempo menor que o grupo B, contudo na condição de olhos fechados teve seu tempo de execução do movimento aumentado em relação à primeira condição, enquanto que o grupo B não apresentou aumento significativo da primeira para a segunda condição. Em relação às estratégias musculares os resultados demonstraram, que a ordem de ativação muscular do grupo A foi diferente da ordem de ativação do grupo B na condição de olhos abertos, mas quando comparamos o grupo A na condição de olhos fechados a ordem de ativação muscular utilizada foi semelhante à do grupo B. Já no grupo B não houve diferença estatística nas duas condições. Concluímos que as estratégias musculares se alteram com a falta da visão no grupo A, tornando-se uma importante aferência sensorial na execução deste movimento para este grupo; que a ordem de ativação muscular no grupo B nas duas condições (olhos abertos e fechados) não teve diferença estatística e que o tibial anterior (TA) foi o primeiro músculo recrutado nos dois grupos e nas duas condições. The sit -to-stand {{movement is}} an ability that confers independence to all individuals and its alterations can cause functional dependence. To {{know about this}} complex movement allows the physiotherapists to reformulate its therapies and to reflect on new possibilities of intervention. The aim of this dissertation was study the activation order of the muscles tibialis anterior (TA), rectus femoralis (RF), <b>biceps</b> <b>femoralis</b> (BF), medial gastrocnemius (GM) and paravertebral lumbaris (PL) during the sit-to-stand movement in two groups of volunteers and to compare the muscular strategies used by them. The subjects had been divided in group A: twenty subjects with age between 20 - 35 years, healthful, without pathologies associates, without medication use {{and that they had}} more than gotten 50 points in the Bergs test; and Group B with twenty subjects with age between 60 - 65 years, without neurological diseases and that had more than 50 points in the Bergs test. Both the groups had been studied under two conditions: with the open eyes and the closed eyes. The electrical signal was measured with surface electromyography and to indicate the beginning of the movement, a bidimensional flexible electrogoniometer was used in the joints of the hip and Knee unilaterally. The results had shown that the group A realized the movement in a lesser time that the group B, however in the condition of closed eyes had its time of execution of the task increased in relation to the first condition. The group B did not present significant increase of the first one for the second condition. In relation to the muscular strategies the results had demonstrated that the order of muscular activation of the group A was different of the order of activation of group B in the condition of open eyes, but when we compare the group A in the condition of closed eyes the order of muscular activation was similar to the one of group B. Already in this group did not have difference statistics in the two conditions. We conclude that the muscular strategies if modify with absence of the vision in the group A, becoming an important sensorial reference in the execution of this movement for this group; that the order of muscular activation in group B in the two conditions did not have difference statistics and that the tibialis anterior (TA) was the fisrt muscle enlisted in the two groups in the two condition...|$|E
