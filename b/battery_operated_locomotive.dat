50|$|Whitcomb {{was swept}} into this renaissance and {{continued}} {{the development and}} manufacture of all manner of mining machinery {{as well as other}} kinds of small machinery. With the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, easier quicker and cheaper methods of locating and processing coal were now in great demand. That demand drove the need for more advanced drilling and processing machinery as well as a safer method to transport the coal from the inside of the mines. Men with pickaxes and mules and wagons had long been the means of locating and moving the coal to the surface. Whitcomb recognized the need for more advanced methods and went on to invent a small <b>battery</b> <b>operated</b> <b>locomotive</b> that would pull coal cars safely from the mines. He also developed more precise coal drills and processing machinery that sped up as well as made safer the coal mining process.|$|E
40|$|MPH, Occupational Hygiene, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandIntroduction Locomotive {{operators}} in the mining industry {{are exposed to}} high levels of noise and vibration. There is currently limited information indicating whole-body vibration exposure levels conducted over an 8 -hour time weighted average (TWA) exposure period; most of the available data are based on instantaneous measurements. The 10 -Ton New Era locomotive was specifically designed with the focus on areas such as ergonomics, safety, future automation, productivity and flexibility of use. The locomotive has a single cab and can be driven and controlled with maximum visibility in the direction of travel. Most mining houses are converting from the use of the 10 Ton Goodman <b>battery</b> <b>operated</b> <b>locomotive</b> to the 10 Ton New Era locomotive, hence the focus of noise and vibration measurements on the latter. Objectives This research report documents a project to measure noise and whole-body vibration exposure levels of locomotive operators working in an underground platinum mine. The objectives of the study are: • to describe the eight hour time weighted average occupational noise exposure levels of locomotive operators operating the 10 -Ton New Era locomotive in an underground platinum mine over 2008 and 2009; • to describe personal whole-body vibration exposure levels of locomotive operators operating the 10 -Ton New Era locomotive in an underground platinum mine over 2008 and 2009; and 5 • to determine whether personal noise and whole-body vibration exposure levels of locomotive operators operating the 10 -Ton New Era locomotive in an underground platinum mine over 2008 and 2009 comply with national and international standards. Methods Personal noise and whole-body vibration exposure measurements were obtained from 21 underground locomotive operators. Measurements were conducted in accordance with the procedures described in the SANS 10083 standard for personal noise dosimetry and the ISO 2631 - 1 standard for whole-body vibration. Determination of likely health risks for the operators were based on a comparison of the measured time-weighted noise exposure levels with the South African OEL and the ACGIH threshold limit value; whole-body vibration levels were compared with the HGCZ limits presented in Annex B of the ISO 2631 - 1 standard and the EU directive daily exposure limits. Results The measured noise and whole-body vibration levels taken over an 8 -hour TWA exposure period were higher when compared to national and international standards. The mean LTWA levels for noise was 66. 5 dB(A) with 12. 5...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project sought to find general track formations that allowed <b>battery</b> <b>operated</b> <b>locomotives</b> to traverse the entire train track {{in both directions}} infinitely. These formations allowed {{for any number of}} track pieces from TrackMaster Thomas and Friends sets by Fisher Price. The research looked at start position of the train and presetting of the switches as well as what is necessary to have a complete track with no dead ends. Surprisingly, there was found to be only one track formation that allowed for entire traversal of the track in both directions. This layout was termed a 2 ̆ 2 dog bone 2 ̆ 2 and consisted of two switch pieces connected at the ends with the tips of both switches connecting to themselves on the same switch. A proof that this layout is the only layout that satisfies the conditions is given...|$|R
