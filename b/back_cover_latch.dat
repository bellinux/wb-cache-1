Larger-capacity panniers (left capacity increased from 18 to 24 litres; right capacity increased from 16.7 to 19.5 litres) with more secure <b>cover</b> <b>latches</b> and hinges were fitted. The engine was overhauled with lighter pistons and other engine modifications to reduce vibration. A catalytic converter was fitted to ensure compliance with the stricter EU emissions laws. A combined braking system was fitted and the front brakes were upgraded to 3-piston calipers.|$|R

25|$|The {{inflated}} {{escape slide}} blocked both forward doors from {{being used to}} evacuate the aircraft, and prevented two flight attendants seated on the forward jumpseat from assisting the evacuation. There was no fire, but had there been a fire, this malfunctioning slide would have dramatically affected the survivability of the occupants. As {{a result of this}} occurrence, the NTSB issued a safety recommendation to replace the slide <b>cover</b> <b>latch</b> brackets on forward slide compartments of all older Boeing 737 models with the latch brackets installed on later models.|$|R
