5|$|The AEC commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, was willing to release him. The commissioners then {{selected}} McCormack. The job came with a promotion to brigadier general. The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC. Rather than continue to press for changes in the law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove to make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> working within the existing framework.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{conditions}} supposed, {{there is no}} doubt of the result, if the work of the colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces. On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste their energies in contests with one another, the chances are that the old state of nature will have the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.|$|E
25|$|After the 1930s, Dallas was {{controlled}} {{in all aspects}} by the Dallas Citizens Council, {{a group of about}} two hundred men who had both achieved unusual success in their careers and demonstrated an unusual willingness to work on projects they believed would help build a great city. In 1954 with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end racial segregation in public schools, the Citizens Council soon acknowledged that desegregation was inevitable, and they sought to make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The first step was the formation of the Biracial Committee. For the most part, the Citizens Council had already decided what to do, and the Biracial Committee helped get it done. They decided to prepare for school desegregation by desegregating the community bit by bit.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

25|$|On {{the left}} wing, {{in spite of}} the Royalist counter-strokes, the attack had the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> {{capturing}} field after field, and thus gradually gaining ground to the front. Here, Viscount Falkland was killed. On the Reading road itself Essex did not succeed in deploying on to the open ground on Newbury Wash, but victoriously repelled the royal horse when it charged up to the lanes and hedges held by his foot. On the extreme right of the Parliamentary army, which stood in the open ground of Enborne Heath, took place a famous incident. Here, two of the London regiments, fresh to war as they were, were exposed to a trial as severe as that which broke down the veteran Spanish infantry at Rocroi in this same year. Rupert and the Royalist horse, again and again, charged up to the squares of pikes. Between each charge, his guns tried to disorder the Londoners, {{but it was not until}} the advance of the royal infantry that the trained bands retired, slowly and in magnificent order, to the edge of the heath. The result was that Essex's army had fought its hardest, and failed to break the opposing line. But the Royalists had suffered so heavily, and above all, the valour displayed by the Parliamentarians had so profoundly impressed them, that they were glad to give up the disputed road, and withdraw into Newbury. Essex thereupon pursued his march. Reading was reached on 22 September 1643 after a small rearguard skirmish at Aldermaston, and so ended the First Battle of Newbury, one of the most dramatic episodes of English history.|$|E
500|$|The {{themes of}} the lyrics include contrast, contradictions and urgency. According to Jon Wiederhon of MTV News, [...] "Martin seems to address the {{helplessness}} {{of being in a}} dysfunctional relationship he doesn't necessarily want to escape." [...] The lyrics are cryptic; the ending lines of the second verse emphasize contradicting emotion: [...] "Come out upon my seas/Cursed missed opportunities/Am I a part of the cure/Or am I part of the disease?" [...] The song's title also [...] "metaphorically alludes" [...] to its lyrics, [...] "pushing one to wonder about the world's obsession with time while connecting it to the theory: make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> when we’re here, present and alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Russell {{was ignored}} by college recruiters {{and did not}} receive a single letter of {{interest}} until recruiter Hal DeJulio from the University of San Francisco (USF) watched him {{in a high school}} game. DeJulio was not impressed by Russell's meager scoring and [...] "atrocious fundamentals", but sensed that the young center had an extraordinary instinct for the game, especially in the clutch. When DeJulio offered Russell a scholarship, the latter eagerly accepted. Sports journalist John Taylor described it as a watershed in Russell's life, because Russell realized that basketball was his one chance to escape poverty and racism; as a consequence, Russell swore to make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|Three more 2001 {{releases}} featured Zinta, including Abbas-Mustan's romantic drama Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, {{which was}} released after a one-year delay {{due to the}} trial of producer Bharat Shah. This film {{was one of the}} first Bollywood films to address the controversial issue of surrogate childbirth. Zinta played the role of Madhubala, a golden-hearted prostitute hired as a surrogate mother. Initially reluctant to play the part, she eventually accepted it at the directors' persuasion and, to prepare for it, visited several bars and nightclubs at Mumbai's red-light areas to study the lingo and mannerisms of sex-workers. She received a second Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards for her performance, of which reviewer Sukanya Verma wrote, [...] "Preity Zinta, who clearly has the meatiest part of all, makes the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Her transformation from the cocky and unabashed prostitute to a sensitive and warm person is amazingly believable." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} to Paris he had become acquainted with Étienne Clavière, the Genevese exile, and a banker named Panchaud. From them he learnt about the abuse of stock-jobbing, and seizing their ideas he began to regard stock-jobbing, or {{agiotage}} (known in English as [...] "arbitrage"), {{as the source of}} all evil, and to attack in his usual vehement style the Banque de St-Charles and the Compagnie des Eaux.

He {{had only a}} single modern Hawker Hurricane fighter to use at the front (three others were relegated to training) dubbed [...] "Colly's Battleship". He made the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> by constantly moving it from base to base and letting the Italians see it.
