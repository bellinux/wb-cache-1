On his decision to leave, Mullally said [...] "I've had an absolute ball playing Declan, the guy has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> he needs a rest. I've made so many new friends but it will be my 'daughters' Alia and Gabriella (de Vercelli) I'll really miss, it has been wonderful to watch them grow and develop and be a part of their lives." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 2009, Kariya {{received}} {{the sixth and}} last concussion of his NHL career, an elbow to the head delivered from behind by Buffalo Sabres' forward Patrick Kaleta. During what would become Kariya's last season in the NHL, the League began expanding their efforts to eliminate hits to the head with new rules and stiffer penalties. League officials also began looking to penalize [...] "blindside hits," [...] defined as a bodycheck against a player from the side, where he cannot see the ensuing player coming. At the time, Kariya called the pending rule changes [...] "long overdue," [...] adding that, [...] "hav <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with that...It's something that should've been in place years and years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} healing effect of love. In an article for Bustle, Danielle Jackson presumed it to be love from her fans who had {{supported}} Gaga throughout her career. While performing [...] "The Cure" [...] at 'Coachella', the singer said to the crowd: [...] "I love you guys so much. I have <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{in my life and}} I've seen so much. And you cure me every time with your love." [...] The dedication-like lyrics begins with the singer comparing her music as an escape route for her fans. This is expanded upon in the chorus when Gaga belts [...] "If I can't find the cure, I'll, I'll fix you with my love", thus positioning herself as someone who advocates for the troubling time in anyone's life, evident by the closing line [...] "Promise I'll always be there, Promise I'll be the cure". Ally Hirschalg from Mic also found other explanations from the lyrics: a mother talking to her children and someone who had a recent break-up, the latter alluding to Gaga's break-up with fiancee Taylor Kinney the previous year.|$|E

Your mama has {{to feel this}} record, your daddy has to feel this record, {{everybody}} has to feel this record. That's what good writers do." [...] Of its appeal Garrett {{said that it would}} have the effect of [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an [...] "explosive record". Garrett went on to say, [...] "I definitely feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's {{what a lot of people}} wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost my mama, I done <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> drama/ I done turned into the man I never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|E
500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Coens' {{script was}} mostly {{faithful}} to the source material. On their writing process, Ethan said, [...] "One of us types into the computer while the other holds {{the spine of the}} book open flat." [...] Still, they pruned where necessary. A teenage runaway who appeared late in the book and some backstory related to Bell were both removed. Also changed from the original was Carla Jean Moss's reaction when finally faced with the imposing figure of Chigurh. As explained by Kelly Macdonald, [...] "the ending of the book is different. She reacts more in the way I react. She kind of falls apart. In the film she's <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> and she can't lose any more. It's just she's got this quiet acceptance of it." [...] In the book, there is also some attention paid to the daughter, Deborah, whom the Bells lost and who haunts the protagonist in his thoughts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} to kill Barton's character {{came from the}} producers. Josh Schwartz relays that it was entirely a creative decision: [...] "It had {{as much to do}} with creatively feeling like this was always in the cards for this character and she was an inherently tragic heroine, and part of the Ryan/Marissa story was him trying to save her from a fate that she couldn't be rescued from." [...] Commenting on her character's death, Barton said: [...] "My character has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> and there's really nothing more left for her to do." [...] She added, [...] "I was really excited that I get to die, to be honest. ... It was better than one of those lame farewells." ...|$|R

Throughout {{the series}} Marissa is {{frequently}} battling {{with drugs and}} alcohol, including nearly killing herself on a trip in Mexico with her friends. Marissa's relationships with her parents, boyfriends, and classmates are often tumultuous. She is Summer's best friend and Ryan's on and off love interest. Marissa is portrayed as a [...] "spoiled girl who adjusts to being poor." [...] The casting director referred to Marissa as [...] "a girl stuck in the trappings of her life who seemed older than her actual age." [...] Mischa Barton left the series {{at the end of}} season three when her character was subsequently written off by being killed in a car accident. Commenting on her departure, Barton said, [...] "My character has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> and there's really nothing more left for her to do." ...|$|R

My family said it is something unbelievable. People don't know what to do; they're all crying with happiness. Traffic is everywhere. It's extremely meaningful. I spoke to a young boy this morning who said [...] "if only our prime minister would learn from the team". For the past four years they've <b>been</b> going <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> hardship. The team have actually been living the same hardship as the people do here. They have been riding high on a wave of national support and have made their country's greatest national sporting achievement. Iraq has never been in the final and under these extremely difficult circumstances this is the biggest win this nation has ever had. It's quite incredible to see celebrations like this far away from politics." [...] - Waleed Tabra ...|$|R
2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which StÃ©phane ParÃ© {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I know {{it was a very difficult}} decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel and the fact that we were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. StÃ©phane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's {{hair has}} {{dominated}} her many styles {{and she has}} had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's [...] "crazy" [...] hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': [...] "I had a brown bob forever and I was sick to death of it, so when {{we came out of}} the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They asked me if I wanted to dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was [...] "definitely not a good look". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a [...] "few hair disasters", especially the in between stages when she [...] "went back to black from red and then to blonde". She said that since her character has <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> she no longer feels it necessary to [...] "desperately shock" [...] everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, sheâ€™s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! Itâ€™s a bit Duffy, a bit â€™50s-style, and now Iâ€™ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change my image a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment [...] her slim shape".|$|E

5000|$|After Aiko {{gave birth}} to her daughter, six months later she began to work and develop on the mixtape. Aiko stated that she <b>was</b> going <b>through</b> trouble at this period in her life saying [...] "At the time I <b>was</b> going <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in my life that it was so easy to write the songs. I had just had a baby and I was dealing with baby father issues and I had a boyfriend. The songs were just coming and coming. I just had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to say, and when I was signed, I never really got a chance to write my own music. I always wanted to do a mixtape and before I got {{pregnant}} I was about to get back into it â€˜cause I was working with different producers and things like that.

60|$|I {{confess that}} when I had read her letter I {{was very much}} puzzled what to do. I {{had no idea what}} her plans were, or what were the {{contents}} of the letter. I had not the least hope that she would find the will; and yet she wrote so urgently, that I was sure she believed herself that she had; and as she <b>was</b> going <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> surely I need not mind risking a little. I had a long debate with myself, but at last {{came to the conclusion that}} I could not but do as she asked me, and send the little note, which was merely directed Father Eustace, in a hurried, almost illegible writing--to its destination. However, I determined to run as little risk of being discovered as being connected with it as possible, and I accordingly went down to old Andrew's cottage. I have not mentioned that he was still living in Dr. Hooper's service, and resided as before close to the old house, nor have I told of the delight with which he received me on my return.|$|R
60|$|And as he related how he {{had fallen}} in with the forlorn Lady of Ribaumont, and all that she had dared, done, and left undone {{for the sake of}} her little daughter, good Noemi Laurent wept, and agreed with him that a special {{providence}} must have directed them to his care, and that some good work must await one who had <b>been</b> carried <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> His project <b>was</b> to remain here for a short time, to visit the flock who had lost their pastor {{on the day of the}} massacre, and to recruit his own strength; for he, too, had suffered severely from the long travelling, and the exposure during many nights, especially since all that was warm and sheltered had been devoted to Eustacie. And after this he proposed to go to La Rochelle, and make inquiries for a trusty messenger who could be sent to England to seek out the family of the Baron de Ribaumont, or, mayhap, a sufficient escort with whom the lady could travel; though he had nearly made up his mind that he would not relinquish the care of her until he had safely delivered her to her husband's mother.|$|R

Initially, Lovato {{recorded}} [...] "Skyscraper" [...] in Studio City, Los Angeles in 2010. During recording sessions, Lovato was [...] "doubled over, just in pain." [...] After completing her treatment on January 28, 2011, Lovato re-recorded the song, but decided to keep the original recording because she felt that her voice had changed, although noting about her voice was [...] "weaker" [...] when Lovato originally recorded. Gad also produced [...] "My Love Is Like A Star" [...] and [...] "For The Love Of A Daughter", the second song was originally recorded as a pop rock song and selected to be included in Lovato's second album, Here We Go Again, released in 2009. Although not planning to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song was set to appear on the album, but Lovato and her management felt that the song's subject would be too much for her young audience. After completed the album's recording, Lovato said: [...] "Making the album was a personal journey for me; {{it was kind of like}} a roller coaster, I <b>was</b> going <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> over the past year, but at the end of it I just wanted to inspire people and just give them music to have fun dancing to and listening to, and hopefully I accomplished that." ...|$|R

She had felt from the first that such a request should be made by her in person and not through the medium of writing, but surely it was incredible that a man like George, who had <b>been</b> <b>through</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for her and whose only reason for being in the neighbourhood was to help her, could have coldly refused without even a word.

Of course, the truth was the other way around. They bored him. They knew so little of life that he knew the last word of. And one could scarcely get any word out of him. It was not that he had forgotten how to speak, but that he could not see any reason for speaking when nobody could understand. He was really crusty from too-bitter wise experience. But {{all you had to do}} was look at him in his tremendous repose and know that he had been through the thousand hells, including all the frozen ones. His eyes had the same quietness of Michael's.
