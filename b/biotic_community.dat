2500|$|This metaphysical idea is elucidated in Warwick Fox's {{claim that}} {{humanity}} {{and all other}} beings are [...] "aspects of a single unfolding reality".

2500|$|This native area {{provides}} a unique environment with heavy seasonal rains up to [...] annually. Cool coastal air and fog drip keep this forest consistently damp year round. Several factors, including the heavy rainfall, create a soil with fewer nutrients than the trees need, {{causing them to}} depend heavily on the entire <b>biotic</b> <b>community</b> of the forest, especially complete recycling of the trees when dead.

5000|$|Amos Hawley {{believed}} that organisms are connected {{in a web}} of relationships that interdependent and are enmeshed with the environment. In the web of relationships organisms can have relationships of symbiosis or commensalism. Symboisis is the close bond relationship between the two individuals of two different species. Commensalism is when organisms make similar demands on the environment often resulting in competition. Hawley believed humanity was dominant in the ecosystem due to advances in technology and humanity's control over the habitat. He contended that through culture humanity is able to modify its subsistence to match its needs and desires. Hawley writes [...] "thus the development of human dominance through the agency of culture involves a reconstruction of the <b>biotic</b> <b>community.</b> Instead of accommodating his activities, as do primitive peoples, to the natural life association, civilized man regulates the <b>biotic</b> <b>community</b> in accordance with his needs".|$|E

50|$|This reply led {{to another}} criticism: that Callicott {{provides}} no “second-order principles” to prioritize duties to fellow humans and those to the <b>biotic</b> <b>community</b> when they conflict. In response, Callicott offered two second-order principles as a framework to adjudicate between conflicting first-order duties: 1) “obligations generated by membership in more venerable and intimate communities take precedence over those generated in more recently emerged and impersonal communities”; 2) “stronger interests take precedence over duties generated by weaker interests.” Because our various human community memberships are both more venerable and intimate and because human interests in enjoying rights to life, liberty, {{and the pursuit of}} happiness are very strong, Callicott argues that our traditional obligations to individual fellow human beings trump our obligations to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the <b>biotic</b> <b>community</b> — at least, he believes, when it comes to the prospect of culling members of the overpopulous Homo sapiens species.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to Callicott’s elaboration of the Aldo Leopold land ethic, the land ethic (and, by implication, Callicott’s own non-anthropocentric, holistic environmental ethic {{to the extent}} that it may differ from Leopold’s) has been subject to the charge of “ecofascism,” notably leveled by Tom Regan. If members of overpopulous species, such as deer, ought to be “culled” or “harvested,” in the name of preserving the integrity, stability, and beauty of the <b>biotic</b> <b>community,</b> and if staggeringly overpopulous Homo sapiens is also but “a plain member and citizen” of the <b>biotic</b> <b>community,</b> then why should culling and harvesting humans be any less obligatory? In “The Conceptual Foundations of the Land Ethic,” Callicott replies that Leopold presented the land ethic as an “accretion” to our evolving complex set of ethics. In other words, the land ethic burdens us with additional moral obligations; it does not substitute for or replace our previously evolved moral obligations, among them the duty to respect the rights of our fellow human beings to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.|$|E
