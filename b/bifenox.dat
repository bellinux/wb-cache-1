40|$|The {{transport}} of the herbicides isoproturon, dichlorprop-p and <b>bifenox</b> via surface runoff was investigated on small plots with simulated erosive rainfall. Isoproturon and dichlorporp-p with water solubilities of 65 and 700 mg/l respectively, were transported {{mainly in the}} water phase and <b>bifenox</b> with a water solubility < 1 mg/l was transported by the sediment phase. Isoproturon and dichlorprop-p concentrations in the runoff mainly depended on the preceding cumulative rainfall. Total isoproturon and dichlorprop-p losses in runoff depended {{on the time of}} runoff initiation as well as on water flux and sediment loss. Factors like soil type, vegetation, or rainfall intensity affected total herbicide losses by influencing the time of runoff initiation as well as total water and soil loss. The isoproturon and dichlorprop-p concentrations in runoff water decreased with increasing cumulative rainfall according to a power function at the beginning of rainfall event. However during the experiment the concentrations may increase due to the occurence of interflow. The <b>bifenox</b> concentration in the sediment phase depend on the amount of preceding soil loss. The time of runoff initiation does not influence the <b>bifenox</b> losses. Experiments on large plots with natural rainfall of high intensity showed that the herbicide losses were comparable to the small plots with simulated erosive rainfall. An decisive fact is that runoff starts relative soon after irrigation. (orig.)

40|$|The first {{example of}} the effect of an {{electric}} double layer on the reduction of electrochemically generated radical species is reported. The anion radical of methyl 5 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) - 2 -nitrobenzoate (pesticide <b>bifenox)</b> is electrochemically reduced in acetonitrile to a phenylhydroxylamine derivative in a process involving three electrons. This heterogeneous reaction is strongly influenced by the concentration and nature of the cation of the indifferent electrolyte. Depending on the type of tetraalkylammonium cation, the redox potential changes by 0. 45 V. The kinetic parameters were obtained for five tetraalkylammonium hexafluorophosphate salts. The Frumkin correction, which assumes that the outer Helmholtz plane coincides with the reaction site, was applied to kinetic data of the radical anion reduction. The correction of the apparent rate accounted for the observed effect only in the case of tetramethylammonium salt. The presence of higher tetraalkylammonium homologues causes deviations from the predicted dependence of the electron-transfer rate on the æ 2 potential of the outer Helmholtz plane. Hence, the nature of the cation of the electrolyte exerts a further effect extending beyond the electrostatic repulsion only. The corrected rate of electron transfer decreases exponentially with increasing size of the alkyl chain of the indifferent electrolyte cation in the order methyl > ethyl > propyl > butyl > hexyl. The rate decay is characterized by an exponent â) 0. 83. This confirms that the reaction plane for the reduction of the <b>bifenox</b> radical anion is different for each electrolyte. Due to this fact the Frumkin correction cannot fully account for the observed dependence of the heterogeneous rate on the solution composition. The observed effect is not specific to the <b>bifenox</b> radical.

40|$|The nitropesticide <b>bifenox</b> (methyl 5 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) - 2 -nitrobenzoate) {{is reduced}} in aprotic media in two {{reduction}} steps. The first heterogeneous electron transfer involves {{the acceptance of}} one electron leading {{to the formation of}} a relatively stable nitro anion radical that was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. The electrochemically generated radical anion eventually decomposes to two stable products. Intramolecular electron transfer coupled with chemical steps leads in the first case to the cleavage of the carboxymethyl group and the formation of the nitropesticide nitrofen ((2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) (4 -nitrophenyl) ether) and in the second case to a trans-esterification process, i. e., an exchange of the methyl group for an alkyl of the supporting electrolyte. Both these final products retain pesticidal activity, which explains the high efficiency of <b>bifenox</b> as a pesticide. The electrochemical characteristics show that the radical anion undergoes a further two-electron reduction at more negative potentials. The second reduction step is strongly influenced by the nature and concentration of the tetraalkylammonium cation of the supporting electrolyte. The influence of the electrolyte concentration was accounted for by the effect of the electrode double-layer structure on the electron transfer kinetics (Frumkin effect) due to repulsion of the radical anion from a negatively charged electrode|electrolyte interface...|$|E

The inhibition of algal growth {{is an important}} regulatory endpoint for toxicity assessment of single compounds. However, in the aquatic environment, mixtures of compounds with unknown toxicities and mode of action (MoA) co-exist, making single toxicity assessment inadequate to ensure protection of the aquatic environment. This study aimed to characterize the combined toxicity of five environmentally relevant biocides—aclonifen, <b>bifenox,</b> dichlofluanid, metribuzin, and triclosan—with different MoA on growth and photosystem (PS) II efficiency of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. For growth inhibition, herbicides <b>bifenox</b> and metribuzin were the most toxic, whereas triclosan was least. Only aclonifen and metribuzin exerted {{a significant effect on}} PSII, which was also correlated with reduced algal growth. The combined effect of the five biocides on growth inhibition was predominantly additive and presumed to act by independent MoA with potential antagonism observed only at low concentrations and at shorter duration of exposure.

40|$|The {{diphenyl}} ether acifluorfen enhances the blue light-induced absorbance change in Triton X 100 -solubilized crude membrane preparations from etiolated oat (Avena sativa L. cv. Lodi) coleoptiles. Enhancement of the spectral change is correlated {{with a change}} in rate of dark reoxidation of a b-type cytochrome. Similar, although smaller, enhancement was obtained with oxyfluorfen, nitrofen, and <b>bifenox.</b> Light-minus-dark difference spectra in the presence and absence of acifluorfen, and the dithionite-reduced-minus oxidized difference spectrum indicate that acifluorfen is acting specifically at a blue light-sensitive cytochrome-flavin complex. Sodium azide, a flavin inhibitor, decreases the light-induced absorbance change significantly, but {{does not affect the}} dark reoxidation of the cytochrome. Hence, it is acting on the light reaction, suggesting that the photoreceptor itself is a flavin. Acifluorfen sensitizes phototropism in dark-grown oat seedlings such that the first positive response occurs with blue light fluences as little as one-third of those required to elicit the same response in seedlings grown {{in the absence of the}} herbicide. Both this increase in sensitivity to light and the enhancement of the light-induced cytochrome reduction vary with the applied acifluorfen concentration in a similar manner. The herbicide is without effect either on elongation or on the geotropic response of dark-grown oat seedlings, indicating that acifluorfen is acting specifically close to, or at the photoreceptor end of, the stimulus-response chain. It seems likely that the flavin-cytochrome complex serves to transduce the light signal into curvature in phototropism in oats, with the flavin moiety itself serving as the photoreceptor...|$|E

The procedure combines a solid-phase extraction (SPE) with column liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection utilizing a pneumatically assisted and heat-assisted electrospray interface in negative mode. The extraction of analytes from filtered drainage or river water samples was performed using as sorbent a graphitized carbon. The recovery, for drinking water, ranged from 91 to 98 %, and from 84 to 95 % for river water. Excellent method precision was demonstrated with percent {{relative standard deviation}} of less than 10 % for all analytes at fortification level.

40|$|This report {{collects}} {{information on}} chemical analytical methods {{for the analysis}} of the new proposed priority substances (PS) of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and some existing PS for which the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) have been changed under the first review of the PS list. First, analytical “standard” methods (ISO, CEN, US EPA) were searched. Then, the EU Member States (MS) were asked via the Chemical Monitoring and Emerging Pollutants (CMEP) expert group to provide validated “in-house methods” used as a national reference and to report their limits of detection (LODs) or quantification (LOQs). Finally, published literature articles were searched to get an overview of today’s analytical performance. Compliance monitoring for the WFD requires the achievement of a LOQ equal or below a value of 30 % of the relevant EQS. The achieved method limits of quantification (LOQs) are therefore compared with 30 % of the EQS, which is 0. 3 × EQS. Very low annual average AA-EQS values in the picogram-per-liter (pg/l) concentration range have been set for several of the new proposed PS: For Cypermethrin 80 pg/l (8 pg/l for coastal salt waters), for Dichlorvos 60 pg/l in coastal waters, for Dicofol 32 pg/l in coastal waters, for 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol 35 pg/l (7 pg/l in coastal waters), for 17 -beta-estradiol 80 pg/l in coastal waters, and for Heptachlor/-Heptachlorepoxide 0. 2 pg/l (10 fg/l in coastal waters). Dicofol and Heptachlor/-Heptachlorepoxide, for which biota EQS have been set (biota EQS: 33 µg/kg, and 6. 7 ng/kg, respectively), however, are intended to be analysed in biota. Moreover, a very challenging water EQS has been set for the already existing PS Brominated Diphenylethers (BDEs) (49 femtogram-per-liter (fg/l), and 2. 4 fg/l in coastal waters). However, it is intended that BDEs be analysed in biota (EQS: 8. 5 ng/kg). In addition, the water EQS for Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been lowered to 0. 17 ng/l, and a biota EQS of 2 - 10 µg/kg added, which is more easy to reach. In general, {{it is very difficult to}} reach with currently available analytical instruments LOQs in the low pg/l concentration range. A possibility could be the use of gas chromatography (GC) with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). This technique, however, is not generally available in normal water monitoring laboratories. Also in the field of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), instruments with improved sensitivity have become available in the last years. Moreover, lower LOQs can be achieved by extracting higher volumes of water (10 - 1000 liters). These large-volume techniques, however, are very work and time intensive, and very costly, and are therefore not useful for routine WFD compliance monitoring (analysis of one sample per month). The most challenging substances proposed as new PS are: Cypermethrin (EQS: 80 pg/l, and 8 pg/l for coastal salt waters), Dichlorvos (EQS: 60 pg/l in coastal waters), 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol (EQS: 35 pg/l, and 7 pg/l in coastal waters), and 17 -beta-estradiol (EQS: 0. 4 ng/l, and 80 pg/l in coastal waters). Dicofol, Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, Heptachlor/Heptachlorepoxide, Hexabromo-cyclododecane (HBCDD), Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and the BDEs are intended to be analysed in biota. Minor analytical problems could be encountered for the following substances: Aclonifen (EQS: 0. 12 µg/l, and 12 ng/l for coastal salt waters), <b>Bifenox</b> (EQS: 12 ng/l, and 1. 2 ng/l for coastal waters), Cybutryne (=Irgarol) (EQS: 2. 5 ng/l), Diclofenac (EQS: 0. 10 µg/l, and 10 ng/l for coastal waters), Quinoxyfen (EQS: 0. 15 µg/l, and 15 ng/l for coastal waters), and Terbutryn (EQS: 65 ng/l, and 6. 5 ng/l for coastal waters).
