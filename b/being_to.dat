5|$|After the Series, Ruth and {{teammates}} Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy {{participated in a}} barnstorming tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose <b>being</b> <b>to</b> prevent Series participants from replicating the Series and undermining its value. Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined them their 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the rule was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Landis's permission required.|$|E

The Vicars Choral were assigned annuities from his lands and tenements in Congresbury and Wookey, an annual fee from the vicarage of Chew, and endowed them with lands obtained from the Feoffees of Walter de Hulle.|$|E

Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating {{through the streets of}} the town to the hills just to the south.|$|E

In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option <b>being</b> <b>to</b> return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E

To conform with Swedish standards, the line was built with standard gauge instead of the more common narrow gauge. The Meråker Line opened on 22 July 1882.|$|E

5|$|As {{attention}} {{to the role of}} sleep hygiene in promoting public health has grown, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of resources available in print and on the internet. Organizations running public health initiatives include the National Sleep Foundation and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, both of which have created public websites with sleep hygiene resources, such as tips for sleep hygiene, instructional videos, sleep hygiene self-assessments, poll statistics on sleep hygiene, and tools to find sleep professionals. A cooperative agreement between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project, with one of their aims <b>being</b> <b>to</b> promote sleep hygiene awareness.|$|E
5|$|By 1852, the {{congestion}} at Somerset House {{had increased}} {{thanks to the}} growing number of Fellows. Therefore, the Library Committee asked the Council to petition Her Majesty's Government to find new facilities, with the advice <b>being</b> <b>to</b> bring all the scientific societies, such as the Linnean and Geological societies, under one roof. In August 1866, the government announced their intention to refurbish Burlington House and move the Royal Academy and other societies there. The Academy moved in 1867, while other societies joined when their facilities were built. The Royal Society moved there in 1873, taking up residence in the East Wing. The top floor was used as accommodation for the Assistant Secretary, while the library was scattered over every room and the old caretaker's apartment was converted into offices. One flaw was that there was not enough space for the office staff, which was then approximately eighty. When, for example, the Society organised the British contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1954, additional facilities had to be found for the staff outside Burlington House.|$|E

5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Major General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, {{told him he could}} not attack, that there were too many {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division, at a time he deemed favorable, advised South Korean Brigadier General Kim Suk Won, the division commander, to counterattack, but Kim refused to do so. The next day Kim {{said he was going to}} move his command post out of P'ohang-dong. The KMAG adviser replied that the KMAG group was going to stay in P'ohang-dong. Upon hearing that, Kim became hysterical but decided to stay for the time <b>being</b> <b>to</b> avoid loss of face. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E
5|$|First {{emerging}} in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its primary goal <b>being</b> <b>to</b> make the economic structure and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control {{the world in a}} way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in the mainstream press.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{scarce in}} the 1760s {{but a number}} of {{improvements}} were made to the North Front defences and the sea wall from South Bastion to Europa Point, which was severely damaged by a great storm in 1766. Green spent several years reviewing the state of the fortifications and developing a plan to improve them. He sent a report to the Board of Ordnance in London in 1762 and another in 1768. The following year he travelled to London to present his conclusions to a commission appointed by William Pitt the Elder. He summed up his three principal aims as <b>being</b> <b>to</b> prevent a possible landing by sea; {{to improve the quality of}} the garrison and its provisioning; and to keep the enemy at a distance with artillery.|$|E
