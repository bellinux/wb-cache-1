It later became the Norah Fry mental hospital and is now a housing development. Nearby, on {{the western edge of the}} town, is the modern community hospital. Moving northwards, <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the river valley, are two hamlets: Darshill, once the site of a number of mills, and Bowlish, which contains several grand clothiers' houses. The steeply-sloping fields adjoining the river between Bowlish and the rest of the Shepton Mallet are known locally as The Meadows. To their east is Hillmead, a council housing estate built in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place {{for much of the}} night, often until 05:00.|$|E

They were aided by Sammy Sanchez and two others making a group of five riders, all looking to gain time. Schleck chased hard, but had no other riders to help bridge the gap. By stage's end, he had lost the yellow jersey and 39 seconds to Contador. Contador, who now had an eight-second lead in the race, met with a mixed reception as he received the yellow jersey on the podium {{at the end of the}} stage.|$|E
25|$|Twelve races {{into the}} 1996 season, Wallace was {{released}} from his Cup ride with Donlavey. Despite moving <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the Busch Series full-time, Wallace only posted one top ten {{in the second half}} of the season, forcing Owen's team to close its doors. Wallace began 1997 with high hopes in the No. 91 LJ Racing Chevrolet Monte Carlo owned by Joe Falk and Ron Neal. The team had moved up from the Busch Series and signed Spam as a full-time sponsor but after many DNQ's and a best finish of seventeenth at Texas Motor Speedway, the team lost its sponsor and Wallace found himself without a ride. He also split time in the Busch Series in the No. 7 Chevrolet for Ed Whitaker, making six starts. Midway through the season, he left for the Truck series, driving the No. 52 Purolator-sponsored Chevrolet Silverado for Ken Schrader Racing. Despite only running fifteen races that season, he finished twenty-third in points. He also finished in the top-ten in each of the last four races of the season, including California Speedway, where he finished second.|$|E

25|$|The Commission {{set about}} trying to find an {{alternative}} supply of drinking water for the town and garrison. It sought {{to increase the amount}} of rainwater captured by passing Gibraltar's first Public Health Ordinance in 1869, which ordered that all new dwellings should have underground tanks. At the instigation of the Commission, the British Colonial Office also commissioned the first geological survey of Gibraltar, which was undertaken in 1877 by A.C. Ramsey and J Geikie. Although it produced useful data, it failed to locate any groundwater or aquifers. Borings were carried out on the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain in an unsuccessful attempt to find potable groundwater, but led to an improved supply of brackish water useful for sanitary purposes. The Commission instigated a system, which is still in use today, of pumping the salty water into a reservoir in the Upper Town from where it was distributed <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the town for sanitary use. Fresh attempts were made to sink boreholes in 1892 and 1943 but neither attempt was successful in finding drinking water.|$|E

500|$|The cap is then {{packed with}} a smokable substance, and screwed onto the bottle {{once it is}} {{immersed}} to its neck in liquid. While lighting the bowl with (preferably) a lighter or match, the bottle is gradually lifted until it is about {{to come out of}} the water or when the substance discontinues burning. While the bottle is held in place, the lid is removed, the user's mouth is placed on the bottle opening, and the user inhales as the bottle is pushed <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the water. The cause of the smoke being expelled by the bottle's movement is the rise in internal pressure, created when the water volume increases; the smoke enters the lungs in a [...] "smoother" [...] manner than inhaling from a joint, blunt, or bowl by itself.

500|$|The Swiss came to {{a sudden}} halt as the columns reached the sunken {{road in front of}} the park; the depth of the road and the height of the rampart behind it—together higher than the length of the Swiss pikes—effectively blocked their advance. [...] Moving down into the road, the Swiss {{suffered}} massive casualties from the fire of d'Avalos's arquebusiers. [...] Nevertheless, the Swiss made a series of desperate attempts to breach the Imperial line. [...] Some parties managed to reach the top of the rampart, only to be met by the landsknechts, who had come up from behind the arquebusiers. [...] One of the Swiss captains was apparently killed by Frundsberg in single combat; and the Swiss, unable to form up atop the earthworks, were pushed <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the sunken road. [...] After attempting to move forward for about half an hour, the remnants of the Swiss columns retreated back towards the main French line. [...] In the fields which they had crossed and before the rampart, they left more than 3,000 dead; among these were twenty-two captains, including both Winkelried and Albert von Stein.

From the fact that each was attired in a new, snow-white lava-lava, Sheldon knew that they were recruits. Part way up the steps, one of them was just <b>backing</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the crowd, while another, called out by name, was coming up.

2500|$|The horse's {{circulatory system}} {{includes}} the four-chambered heart, averaging [...] in weight, {{as well as}} the blood and blood vessels. Its main purpose is to circulate blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues, and to remove waste from these tissues. The hoof (including the frog - the V shaped part {{on the bottom of the}} horses hoof) is a very important part of the circulatory system. As the horse puts weight onto the hoof, the hoof wall is pushed outwards and the frog compressed, driving blood out of the frog, the digital pad, and the laminae of the hoof. [...] When weight is removed from the hoof, the release of pressure pulls blood <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the foot again. [...] This effectively creates an auxiliary blood-pumping system at the end of each leg. [...] Some of this effect is lost when a horse is shod (eliminating the expansion and contraction of the hoof wall and raising the frog higher from the ground).|$|E
2500|$|In August 1964, Khánh {{tried to}} give himself more power, but this {{provoked}} strong protests and forced him to <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> a weaker position than before, and his rule became unstable as more concessions were demanded.

Thiệu and Có called for the replacement of Khánh with Minh, but the latter refused. Minh reportedly claimed that Khánh was the only one who would get funding from Washington, so they supported him, prompting angry arguments as to whether Khánh was a puppet. After more arguing between the senior officers, they agreed that Khánh, Minh, and Khiệm would rule as a triumvirate for two months, until a new civilian government could be formed. However, the triumvirate did little due to their disunity. Khánh dominated the decision-making and sidelined Khiệm and Minh.|$|E
2500|$|The grapes are harvested, either {{manually}} or by machine, {{when they}} are fully ripe. Sometimes grapes that have been harvested manually are sorted, either on the vines or at a sorting table on the wine-maker's premises, to ensure that rotten or insufficiently ripe grapes are removed. Grapes that have been harvested manually are usually crushed, then transferred to a tank. Pre-fermentation cold maceration is sometimes carried out. Alcoholic fermentation can then begin, normally after the addition of yeast. The next stage is the extraction of polyphenols (tannins and anthocyanins) and other chemical constituents of the grapes. In the past this {{was carried out by}} a process called pigeage, which involved repeatedly pushing the floating cap of grape solids <b>back</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the fermenting juice. Now, however, extraction is normally brought about by a series of remontages. This involves pumping the juice {{from the bottom of the}} tank, then pouring it over the cap of grape solids to wash out the grapes' distinctive constituents. The temperature for alcoholic fermentation can be varied, but the normal average temperature at the height of fermentation is between 28 and 35 degrees Celsius. If the naturally generated temperature is too low, chaptalization may be carried out. This practice is subject to external regulations. Once alcoholic fermentation has finished, the liquid is removed from the tank and separated into free-run wine and press wine. Malolactic fermentation may take place next, but is dependent on temperature. The wine is drawn off and stored in barrels or vats to be matured. [...] The maturing process takes several months (6 to 24 months), after which the wine is fined, filtered and bottled.|$|E
30|$|Understandably, reintroducing fire to {{riparian}} forests must {{be carefully}} considered when there are threatened and endangered species within the streams or streamside forests. In a synthesis of literature about fire and aquatic ecosystems, Gresswell (1999) concluded that salmonid species have evolved strategies to survive disturbances occurring at the frequency of historical fires, but that local populations may have been ephemeral in time and space. At present, long term detrimental effects of high-severity fires are generally limited to areas where native populations have either declined or become isolated due to human influences. Although fire was common in riparian forests within the study area, {{it may be necessary}} to totally protect some of these streamside forests until more habitat is available. Many historical riparian fires were likely a result of upslope fires <b>backing</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the riparian zone. Subsequently, if upslope forests are treated for fuels reduction, either with prescribed fire or other silvicultural treatments, then perhaps a wildfire ignited within the upslope forests would be less likely to gain the intensity needed to burn within the moister portion of the riparian zone.|$|R
