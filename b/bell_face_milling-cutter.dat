50|$|In a drum kit, china-type cymbals can {{be mounted}} either with the <b>bell</b> <b>facing</b> upward (similar to other cymbals) {{as well as}} with the <b>bell</b> <b>facing</b> downward. When mounted bell-down, the upturned rim becomes a downturned rim, {{allowing}} a normal stick technique to be used for both ride and crash patterns. This assumes that the bell is formed in the typical direction; some china type cymbals (e.g., the Paiste 2002 Novo china) have an inverted bell and an upturned rim, and so must be mounted bell up to achieve this downwards rim orientation.|$|R

5000|$|Bells were vitally {{important}} to daily life at Mission San Buenaventura, which had five bells. The bells were borrowed from Mission Santa Barbara {{because there were}} no bells at the time. They were never returned. The <b>bell</b> <b>facing</b> north is labeled S. San Francisco 1781. The <b>bell</b> <b>facing</b> east has the inscription: San Pedro Alcantra 1781. A small swinging bell hangs in the southern arch with the lettering: Ave Maria S. Joseph. The only bell used daily at San Buenaventura is large and crown topped with a cross on its side. Inscribed on the bell is Ave Maria Pruysyma D Sapoyan Ano D 1825, which means [...] "Hail Mary Most Pure. Mary of Zapopan Year of 1825." [...] This bell was originally cast for the church of Zapopan but was later sent to Mission San Buenaventura. Another bell, which was once the gift of the Spanish Viceroy, is inscribed Marquez de Croix Mexico November 12, 1770. It is currently owned by Senora Isabel del Valle Cram. There are also two wooden bells in the museum that measure about two feet. These were the only wooden bells in the California missions.|$|R
25|$|Players may {{point the}} bells of their {{instruments}} in the direction they are moving, or slide (also called traverse) with all the <b>bells</b> <b>facing</b> in the same direction. They may also point it towards {{the center of the}} field. Bands that march in time with the music typically also synchronize the direction of individuals' turns, and try to maintain even spacing between individuals in formations (called intervals). Sometimes bands specifically have wind players turn their instruments away from the audience to emphasize the dynamics of the music.|$|R

50|$|Husadel {{introduced}} additional instruments: the Cor anglais (English Horn); {{a fuller}} range of Clarinet including A♭ piccolo clarinet, soprano clarinet, basset clarinet, and contrabass clarinet; Trumpet; and alto slide trombone. Tenor and baritone Tuba were modified so their <b>bells</b> <b>faced</b> forward, with {{the mechanics of}} the instruments adjusted to allow better handling while on the march. The traditional rotary valves on bass trumpets were also replaced with pump valves. The openings of the higher pitched brass instruments were narrowed to achieve greater sharpness and clarity of sound. The effect was to give Husadel's Luftwaffe bands a unique timbre with strong and varied middle voices.|$|R
50|$|These {{instruments}} are {{used instead of}} French horns for marching because their <b>bells</b> <b>face</b> forward instead of to the back (or to the side), as dissipation of the sound becomes a concern in the open-air environment of marching. Tuning is done solely by adjusting the tuning slide, unlike the French horn where the pitch {{is affected by the}} hand position in the bell. Fingerings for the mellophone are the same as fingerings for the trumpet, alto (tenor) horn, and most valved brass instruments. Owing to its use primarily outside of concert music, there is little solo literature for the mellophone, other than that used within drum and bugle corps.|$|R

[...] In November 2008 <b>Bell</b> <b>faced</b> another tough contest when for his first defence he took on former Commonwealth champion Lee Haskins at the Robin Park Center in Wigan again in a bout again shown live on Sky. The fight ended with defeat for Bell as Haskins claimed victory in a close fight over 12 rounds.|$|R
50|$|The tenor horn {{has been}} made and is made in various shapes: the most common in the United States and the UK, and in most {{other parts of the}} world, is a sort of mini-tuba shape, with the bell {{pointing}} upward, which may help the voice blend before reaching the audience. In contrast, the solo horn (found mainly in Europe) looks like (and indeed effectively is) an enlarged flugelhorn, with the bell pointing forward, projecting more toward the audience. Another older and lesser known variant has the <b>bell</b> <b>facing</b> backward (for military marching bands that preceded the soldiers, thus helping them hear better and keep better time in marching). Still another variant has a detachable bell easily rotated to point {{in the direction of the}} player's choice.|$|R

25|$|Opposition to German rule {{followed}} the annexation. Prince Lock Priso still favoured the British and staged a rebellion in December 1884. Around this same time, King <b>Bell</b> <b>faced</b> off {{against his own}} people, who were largely opposed to the German rule. Bell then found himself up against the other Duala chiefs in the Duala War, which was fought over {{the killing of a}} Bonaberi Duala and Bell's alleged refusal to share his profits with the other sub-lineages. Germany stopped the conflict when one of its nationals was killed. Bell survived, but his power had diminished significantly. Realising that the Duala would never again follow the rule of a single king, the Germans instead played the competitors against one another. They supported the weaker King Bell to counter the powerful King Akwa.|$|R

50|$|Bell {{made his}} debut for Kilmarnock {{in the final}} game of the 2008-09 season, a 2-1 win over Motherwell. At the end the season, he signed a new one-year {{contract}} with the club.

Bell played {{in the first two games}} of the 2009-10 season for Kilmarnock in place of injured first choice goalkeeper Alan Combe. Mark Brown was then brought in on loan from Celtic to cover for Combe, but when he returned to his parent club in January 2010, Bell then became the established first choice goalkeeper for Kilmarnock. On 2 February 2010, Bell played as Kilmarnock beat Celtic 1-0. After the match, newly appointed Kilmarnock manager Jimmy Calderwood praised Bell, describing his performance as 'fabulous'. At the end of the 2009-10 season, his contract was extended as he had met a clause in his deal signed the previous summer that if he started enough games during the season, it would trigger an automatic renewal.|$|R

5000|$|Some tubas {{are capable}} of being {{converted}} into a marching style, known as [...] "marching tubas". A leadpipe can be manually screwed on next to the valves. The tuba is then usually rested on the left shoulder (although some tubas allow use of the right shoulder), with the <b>bell</b> <b>facing</b> {{directly in front of}} the player. Some marching tubas are made only for marching, and cannot be converted into a concert model. Most marching bands opt for the sousaphone, an instrument that is easier to carry and almost always cheaper than a true marching tuba. The earlier Helicon is still used by bands in Europe and other parts of the world. Drum and bugle corps players, however, generally use marching tubas or Contrabass bugles. Standard tubas can also be played whilst standing, with the use of a strap joined to the tuba with two rings. The strap goes over the shoulder like a sash, so the musician can play the instrument in the same position as when sitting.|$|R

He said, [...] "So when I did my research on Moncton, I found out how much they loved basketball out there." [...] At {{a press conference in}} August 2011, Conville was officially named team owner. He also announced his hiring of Norris [...] "Bo" [...] Bell as the first head coach for the Miracles. Bell ran a basketball academy in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States.
