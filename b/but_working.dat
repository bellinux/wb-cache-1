The cover art was completed by Dean Torrence, known for his teaming with Jan Berry to create {{the rock and roll}} duo Jan and Dean. Since Berry's near-fatal auto accident in 1966, Torrence had become a graphic artist; his sepia tone scene depicted Nilsson driving an old American car through the countryside with Newman in the back seat. The car is a 1938 Graham-Paige four-door sedan, rusty <b>but</b> <b>working.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 1951 the 13th earl died. Dunglass succeeded him, inheriting {{the title}} of Earl of Home {{together}} with the extensive family estates, including The Hirsel, the Douglas-Homes' principal residence. The new Lord Home took his seat in the Lords; a by-election was called to appoint a new MP for Lanark, {{but it was still}} pending when Attlee called another general election in October 1951. The Unionists held Lanark, and the national result gave the Conservatives under Churchill a small <b>but</b> <b>working</b> majority of 17.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams had {{a modest}} private income, which {{in his early}} career he {{supplemented}} {{with a variety of}} musical activities. Although the organ was not his preferred instrument, the only post he ever held for an annual salary was as a church organist and choirmaster. He held the position at St Barnabas, in the inner London district of South Lambeth, from 1895 to 1899 for a salary of £50 a year. He disliked the job, <b>but</b> <b>working</b> closely with a choir was valuable experience for his later undertakings.|$|E

5|$|There {{are still}} working brewery horses in other areas, such as Wadworth Brewery's Shire horses in Devizes, Wiltshire, <b>but</b> <b>working</b> teams are {{becoming}} increasingly rare. In some areas, such as the New Forest, local farmers and commoners use horses to round up thousands of semi-feral ponies grazing on the open Forest during the drift season, and Britain's mounted police use horses in crowd control, but other than such niche areas, the horse in Britain today is kept almost entirely for recreational purposes. They compete in all equestrian disciplines, carry riders from novice to advanced on trekking and trail-riding holidays, work in riding schools, provide therapy for the disabled, and are much-loved companions and hacks. The horses and riders of Great Britain have won numerous medals for eventing in equestrian sports at the Summer Olympic Games.|$|E

25|$|A {{range of}} residents' {{associations}} {{have been established}} over time but many have faded as housing areas have matured.

An umbrella body, the Federation of Raheny Residents, was very active up to the 1980s but has been little seen in recent times, aside from working on a (decorative <b>but</b> <b>working)</b> millennium clock, sited in the village centre.|$|E

Rowan returned to Melbourne in 1877, and for many years travelled in Australia painting the flora of the country, at times {{in the company of}} her painting companion, Margaret Forrest. She published in 1898 A Flower-Hunter in Queensland and New Zealand, largely based on letters to her husband and friends.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, followed by its explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in December 1938, ignited {{a flurry of}} activity, with nearly one hundred articles on the subject published {{by the end of}} 1939. At Columbia, Fermi and Dunning were quick to verify Hahn's and Strassmann's results, and there was a lively debate over whether uranium-235 or its more abundant uranium-238 isotope was primarily responsible. Two groups began working at Columbia on attempting to create a nuclear chain reaction in natural uranium. Both were in the Pupin Physics Laboratories, <b>but</b> <b>working</b> independently, at least initially, and on different floors: Fermi and Anderson in the basement, and Szilard and Zin on the seventh floor.|$|E

25|$|Born in Valencia, Joaquín Sorolla {{had been}} {{familiar}} since his youth with {{life on the}} sea. In his early work, there is the traditional port view Marina, Barcos en el puerto with which he made his debut in the art exhibition Expsoición National in Madrid in 1881. In the 1890s he repeatedly returned {{to the subject of}} fishermen from Valencia. In some very large paintings he showed fishermen bringing their catch ashore or pulling their boat onto the beach with oxen. He also portrayed boatbuilders or fishwives, not a glamorous life of leisure activities, <b>but</b> <b>working</b> people at sea. For this work he received very positive reviews and was awarded prizes. In addition, these works brought international success. The French government bought the painting La vuelta de la presca from 1895 and the Berlin National Gallery acquired Pescadores Valencianos of 1895.|$|E
25|$|Hicks {{had been}} looking for someone to sell partial {{ownership}} of the club to since just prior to when the default on the loan was reported. By the 2009 season, Hicks was possibly forced to find a buyer for the team. Three known bids were put in for the ownership of the Rangers. Former agent Dennis Gilbert, Houston businessman Jim Crane, and a partnership of Chuck Greenberg and Nolan Ryan placed bids believed to be around $500 million for the purchase of the team. Hicks offered exclusive negotiation rights to the Greenburg-Ryan group on December 15 with a purchase expected to be complete prior to or following the start of the 2010 season. During the bidding process, it was discovered that Ryan, as president of the club, was not under contract, <b>but</b> <b>working</b> only on a handshake deal with Hicks, and that he would step down from the front office if another bidder were to win. After talks with Gilbert, Ryan later said he would not step down unless asked by the new owner to do so.|$|E

Initially Hiromichi Tanaka, the main designer of Final Fantasy III, was also involved {{in the development of the}} game. However, Tanaka wanted to create a seamless battle system that had no separate battle screen and was not menu-driven, and since Final Fantasy IV was not going in that direction, he changed development teams to work on the action RPG Secret of Mana instead. The development team of Final Fantasy IV contained 14 people in total, and the game was completed in roughly one year.|$|E

The original 45MHz frequency would remain the IF setting for many following radar systems. On its first test on 17 August, Anson K6260 with Touch and Keith Wood aboard immediately detected shipping in the English Channel at a range of [...] The team later increased the wavelength slightly to 1.5m to improve sensitivity of the receiver, and this 200MHz setting would be common to many radar systems of this era.|$|E
