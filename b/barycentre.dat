25|$|Every {{complex of}} groups on X is {{associated}} with an essentially unique orbihedron structure on X. This key fact follows by noting that the star and link of a vertex i of X ', corresponding to a simplex σ of X, have natural decompositions: the star is isomorphic to the abstract simplicial complex given by the join of σ and the barycentric subdivision σ' of σ; and the link is isomorphic to join of the link of σ in X and the link of the <b>barycentre</b> of σ in σ'. Restricting the complex of groups to the link of σ in X, all the groups Γτ come with injective homomorphisms into Γσ. Since the link of i in X ' is canonically covered by a simplicial complex on which Γσ acts, this defines an orbihedron structure on X.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} for particle-tracking velocimetry {{is proposed}} and tested with both synthetic and real images. It uses nearest-neighbour cluster matching which performs better than fixed area approaches {{in terms of}} spatial adaptivity. The algorithm includes several temporal multi-frame improvements, i. e. extrapolation of the expected particle positions in subsequent frames and the frame-gap technique. To further improve the tracking algorithm performances, the particle identification procedure was modified {{with respect to the}} traditional background subtraction, local thresholding and grey level weighted averaging by using the optical flow equation. The local maximum of grey levels around each feature extracted is identified and the <b>barycentres</b> of the particle associated with it are calculated by using Gaussian fitting. The novel algorithm works well with several seeding densities, both homogeneously and inhomogeneously distributed. The multi-frame approach substantially improves the average trajectory length and the number of long trajectories in images with and without noise. The number of <b>barycentres</b> correctly identified by employing the feature extraction is significantly larger than when traditional techniques are used, which in turn increases the number of velocity vectors, allowing a better characterization of the flow field under investigation...|$|R
2500|$|The {{notional}} tidal bulges {{are carried}} {{ahead of the}} Earth–Moon axis by the continents {{as a result of}} Earth's rotation. The eccentric mass of each bulge exerts a small amount of gravitational attraction on the Moon, with the bulge on the side of Earth closest to the Moon pulling in a direction slightly forward along the Moon's orbit (because Earth's rotation has carried the bulge forward). The bulge on the side furthest from the Moon has the opposite effect, but because the gravitational attraction varies inversely with the square of distance, the effect is stronger for the near-side bulge. As a result, some of Earth's angular (or rotational) momentum is gradually being transferred to the rotation of the Earth–Moon pair around their mutual centre of mass, called the <b>barycentre.</b> This slightly faster rotation causes the Earth–Moon distance to increase at approximately 38 millimetres per year. Conservation of angular momentum means that Earth's axial rotation is gradually slowing, and because of this its day lengthens by approximately 23 microseconds every year (excluding glacial rebound). Both figures are valid only for the current configuration of the continents. Tidal rhythmites from 620 million years ago show that, over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon receded at an average rate of [...] per year and the day lengthened at an average rate of 12 microseconds per year, both about half of their current values. See tidal acceleration for a more detailed description and references.|$|E

The motion is described by a linear system of oscillators, and represented by a matrix. We distinguish between perfect machines in which the bunch parameters and the arc and interaction point parameters are all equal, and machines with errors in which {{at least one of}} these conditions is not satisfied. We determine the regions in tune space where the motion is unstable, analytically for perfect machines, and numerically for machines with errors. We identify these regions as resonances related to the tunes of one of the two beams or to their sum. We establish which resonances are excited under given conditions. We find that more resonances occur in machines with errors than in perfect machines. By multi-particle tracking, we study the instability at finite amplitudes...|$|R

40|$|The {{transverse}} coherent {{motion of}} the two colliding LHC beams is studied by multi-particle tracking, where the beam-beam force is calculated assuming a Gaussian beam distribution with variable <b>barycentres</b> and rms beam sizes. The simulation yields the coherent and incoherent oscillation frequencies, the emittance growth of either beam, and evidence for the existence or lack of Landau damping. The transverse beam sizes change with the fractional part of the tune as expected from the dynamic beta effect. For head-on collisions, {{we find that the}} pi-mode frequency lies outside of the continuum frequency spread if the ratio of the beam-beam parameters exceeds 0. 6, in accordance with predictions [1]. For smaller ratios, the pi-mode is Landau damped. When long range interactions are also included, undamped coherent modes do still exist outside the continuum, both with and without alternating crossing planes at two interaction points. However, the simulation shows that separating the tunes of the two beams can restore the Landau damping...|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{searching for}} {{periodic}} gravitational wave signals from triaxial pulsars using interferometric gravitational wave detectors have been developed. Since the gravitational wave signals from pulsars {{are expected to}} be weak, long stretches of data must be used for any detection. Over the course of a day, and a year, these periodic signals are Doppler shifted due to the motion of the Earth. The response of the interferometers to each polarisation of gravitational waves will also give rise to an amplitude modulation of the periodic signal. These effects are taken into account and an end-to-end Bayesian scheme for making inferences from the data is presented. Several software tests have been performed to validate the core routines, such as <b>barycentring,</b> using independent software.

Here, we show that (Gd 1 -xNdx) (2) O- 3 (x = 0. 009, 0. 024 and 0. 049) nanorods exhibit one of the highest thermal sensitivity and temperature uncertainty reported so far (1. 75 +/- 0. 04 % K- 1 and 0. 14 +/- 0. 05 K, respectively) for a nanothermometer operating in the first transparent near infrared window at temperatures in the physiological range. This sensitivity value is achieved using a common R 928 photomultiplier tube that allows defining the thermometric parameter as the integrated intensity ratio between the F- 4 (5 / 2) -> I- 4 (9 / 2) and F- 4 (3 / 2) -> I- 4 (9 / 2) transitions (with an energy difference between the <b>barycentres</b> of the two transitions > 1000 cm(- 1)).

40|$|An {{enhanced}} {{version of}} the discrete element method (DEM) has been specifically developed {{for the analysis of}} fractured rock masses [Scholtes L, Donze F, 2012]. In addition to the discrete representation of the intact medium which enables the description of the localized stress-induced damage caused by heterogeneities inherent to rocks, structural defects can be explicitly taken into account in the modeling to represent pre-existing fractures or discontinuities of size L typically larger than the discrete element size. From laboratory scale simulations to slope stability case studies, the capability of this approach to simulate the progressive failure mechanisms occurring in jointed rock are presentedis assessed on the basis of referenced experiments and in situ observations. For instance, the challenging wing crack extension, typical of brittle material fracturing, can be successfully reproduced under both compressive and shear loading path, {{as a result of the}} progressive coalescence of micro-cracks induced by stress concentration at the tips of pre-existing fractures. In this study, the dedicated DEM is coupled to a discrete fracture network (DFN) model to assess the in-fluence of DFN properties on the mechanical behavior of fractured rock masses where progressive failure can occur.

40|$|Strong ground-shaking mapping {{soon after}} a moderate-to-large {{earthquake}} {{is crucial to}} recognize the areas that have suffered the largest damage and losses. These maps have a fundamental role for emergency services, loss estimation and planning of emergency actions by the Civil Protection Authorities. This is particularly important for areas with high seismic risk levels, such as the Campania-Lucania Region in southern Italy. Taking advantage of the Irpinia Seismic Network (ISNet), a recently installed dense and wide dynamic seismic network, we have developed a procedure for rapid estimation of ground-shaking maps after moderate-to-large earthquakes (GRSmap). This uses an optimal data gridding scheme designed to account for bi-dimensional features of strong groundmotion fields, such as directivity, radiation patterns and focal mechanisms, to which most damage can be correlated. The basis of the mapping technique is a triangulation procedure to locally correct predicted data at the triangle <b>barycentres</b> where their vertices correspond to seismic stations. The method has been tested off-line using a simulated M 6. 6 earthquake located at the centre of ISNet and applied to data of the 23 November 1980 Irpina M 6. 9 earthquake recorded by a sparse network.
