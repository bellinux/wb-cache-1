5|$|Age of Empires III {{builds on}} and {{introduces}} new features to the Age of Mythology engine, called Bang! Engine.

This means that many events such as building destruction and tree falls will not be pre-created animations, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> calculated according to the physics engine, in an innovation for the series. Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E

5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two types}} of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> negative in new infections.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the corridors, and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS in the secondary control room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} speak to the Doctor again <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E
5|$|Most colonies are monogyne, {{meaning that}} a colony {{only has a}} single queen, but based on observations, some nests contain {{more than a single}} queen. Some nests are known to contain two queens, with some even having as many as four in a single colony, making them polygynous; a high {{proportion}} of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another. Some colonies are oligogynous, which means that multiple queens are present in a colony, but they are tolerated by all workers birthed from different queens and treated equally. Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born, but recognition based on kin from queens and workers is known, hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed; queens will only take care of their own brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens. The queens, on the other hand, will only cooperate with each other during nest founding, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony. Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows, and eventually separate within the nest, resulting in the queen laying more eggs. Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs, or if a queen ant is adopted by a colony, setting up aggressive relationships. Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare.|$|E

5|$|The National League {{franchise}} in Philadelphia {{was established in}} 1883 following the dissolution of Worcester. The team adopted the Philadelphia Phillies name in 1884 and has used the moniker, and been located in the city, since that time. The team's first manager was Bob Ferguson. Charlie Manuel was the manager from 2005 to 2013 until he was fired on August 16, 2013 he {{was replaced by the}} 3rd base coach Ryne Sandberg. Sandberg resigned on June 26, 2015. Pete Mackanin was the replacement. Manuel was the first Phillies manager since Dallas Green in 1980 to win a World Series (2008) and to lead his team to five consecutive playoff appearances since Danny Ozark (1976–1978). Manuel's career managerial record is 867–678, having previously managed the Cleveland Indians; his record with the Phillies was 780-636 surpassing Gene Mauch's previous regular season record of 645 wins (1960–68). The Phillies won five consecutive division championships (2007–2011) and back-to-back National League pennants (2008–2009) during Manuel's tenure. Manuel has the most postseason wins (27) in team history, while Ozark has the most playoff losses (9). Larry Bowa is the only Phillies skipper to capture the Manager of the Year Award, which he won in 2001. Four Phillies managers have been inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame for service to the Phillies: Paul Owens, Bowa, Gavvy Cravath, and Green. Mackanin will not return as manager for 2018 season, <b>but</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a Senior Adviser to the GM. Brad Ausmus, John Farrell, Dusty Baker, Mickey Callaway, and Raul Ibanez are all candidates to replace Mackanin. On October 29, 2017, the Phillies reportedly decided that Gabe Kapler would be their next manager.|$|E
