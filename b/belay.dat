25|$|Tandem or spider rappelling — Involves two climbers {{descending}} on {{the same}} <b>belay</b> device. This is done in some rescue situations {{when one of the}} climbers is incapacitated or the descent needs to be done quickly. The set-up is similar to a regular rappelling set-up with the first climber is girth hitched off a sling into the descender on the carabiner, and has an auto-block from <b>belay</b> loop of the harness to the rope as a backup. The second rappeller is also girth hitched into the <b>belay</b> device on the carabiner and also anchored into the main rappeller's harness as a back-up.|$|E
25|$|Fireman's <b>Belay</b> — A {{method to}} backup an abseil by a partner {{on the ground}} {{who is able to}} pull down on the rope from below to arrest the descent. This is a useful safety technique, {{particularly}} for inexperienced abseilers.|$|E
25|$|A prusik, Klemheist knot, or autoblock knot {{may be used}} as safety back-up, {{commonly}} referred to as an 'autoblock,' and is used as a back-up {{in the case of the}} abseiler losing control of the abseil. One of these friction hitches is wrapped around the rope below the rappel device, using a short loop of smaller diameter cord or webbing, often called a 'prusik loop'. The prusik loop is then attached to the <b>belay</b> loop or leg loop of the harness.|$|E

50|$|Self-belay {{is the use}} of <b>belaying</b> {{equipment}} by {{a single}} person while rock climbing or mountaineering. Typically, <b>belaying</b> involves a two person team: a climber ascends, while a belayer takes in their rope slack, ready to catch and arrest their fall; when self-belaying, the climber plays both roles.|$|R

25|$|Iffat Ara has {{published}} nine titles to her credit. They include novels, {{a collection of}} short stories, a book of knowledge for children and essays. She also edited Bangladesher Jonopriyo Kavita (tr. Popular poems from Bangladesh), a collection of Bengali poems since the late 18th century. Her unique book of knowledge for high school goers Shona achey jana nai was highly acclaimed and has gone through many editions since 1990. Her novel Sukh jakhan shesh <b>belay</b> was published in 2000. Currently she is working on a book of short stories for young readers.|$|E
25|$|The {{route from}} Scafell Pike to Scafell (or its reverse) {{is one of}} the most {{frustrating}} in the Lake District. What seems like a direct route is in fact very hazardous as it has to negotiate Broad Stand crag, which is a dangerous and exposed scramble that has caused many accidents and injuries. It is usually treated as a rock climb, with appropriate ropes and <b>belay</b> protection. Wainwright warns against its dangers to walkers. Its dangers are more obvious travelling from Scafell Pike, but travelling from Scafell, the route loses a lot of height before the danger is seen.|$|E
25|$|As {{an active}} figure in {{well-established}} literary journals from 1902 {{to his death}} in 1918, Apollinaire {{played a crucial role}} in the development of early modernism by founding his own artistic journals, by supporting galleries and exhibitions, as a collector of avant-garde art, and as an impassioned supporter of a divers group of emerging artists. His pervasive influence on these artists is exemplified by a multitude of portraits of Apollinaire painted by artists such as Henri Rousseau, Pablo Picasso, Jean Metzinger, Louis Marcoussis, Amedeo Modigliani, Marie Laurencin, Marcel Duchamp, Maurice de Vlaminck, Giorgio de Chirico, Mikhail Larionov, Robert Delaunay, Marc Chagall, Pierre Savigny de <b>Belay</b> and Henri Matisse.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{commonly}} used method to ascend climbs refers to climbs where the climber's own physical strength and skill are relied on to accomplish the climb. Free climbing may rely on top rope <b>belay</b> systems, or on lead climbing to establish protection and the <b>belay</b> stations. Anchors, ropes and protection are used {{to back up the}} climber and are passive as opposed to active ascending aids. Subtypes of free climbing are trad climbing and sport climbing. Free climbing is generally done as [...] "clean lead" [...] meaning no pitons or pins are used as protection.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "seconding," [...] or {{belaying}} a climber {{from the top}} of a route, bringing them up to walk off or continue on to next pitch. A similarly safe system of climbing a route, except the belayer has set the anchors {{at the top of the}} climb (normally after leading a route) to <b>belay</b> the climber either indirectly (belayer is part of the system and can be vulnerable when exposed to unexpected directions of pull and loading of the rope) or directly (belayer is not part of the system and belaying is done directly from the anchors using either an Italian / Munter Hitch or adapted use of a <b>belay</b> device), up the route from the top. If bolts have been clipped or traditional gear placements have been made, it is the job of the climber to collect and clean the route.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{climbing}} done {{in modern times}} is considered free climbing—climbing using one's own physical strength, with equipment used solely as protection and not as support—as opposed to aid climbing, the gear-dependent form of climbing that was dominant in the sport's earlier days. [...] Free climbing is typically divided into several styles that differ from one another depending on the choice of equipment used and the configurations of their <b>belay,</b> rope and anchor systems.|$|E
2500|$|Aid {{climbing}}, climbing using {{equipment that}} acts as artificial handhold or footholds, became popular during the period 1920-1960, leading to ascents in the Alps and in Yosemite Valley that were considered impossible without such means. However, climbing techniques, equipment and ethical considerations have evolved steadily. [...] Today, free climbing, climbing using holds made entirely of natural rock while using gear solely for protection and not for upward movement, {{is the most popular}} form of the sport. Free climbing has since been divided into several sub-styles of climbing dependent on <b>belay</b> configuration.|$|E
2500|$|Most climbers {{choose to}} wear {{specialized}} rubber climbing shoes {{which are often}} of a smaller size than their normal street shoes {{in order to improve}} sensitivity towards foot placements and use the tightness to their advantage. [...] Climbing chalk (MgCO3) is commonly used as a drying agent to minimize sweating of the hands. Most other equipment is of a protective nature. Rock climbing is inherently dangerous, so to minimize the potential consequences resulting from a fall, climbers use protection. The most basic protective equipment is a climbing rope. Climbing [...] would attach the rope to themselves; {{in the event of a}} fall, the rope would usually cause injury to the climber in the hope that it prevented death. With advances in technology came the development of specialized harnesses, carabiners which are used for clipping into <b>belay</b> and rappel anchors and connecting gear, and <b>belay</b> devices which are used to catch a falling climber, hold or lower a climber and for rappelling. Eventually, the placement of bolts with the use of quickdraws led to the rise of sport climbing. Traditional climbers developed the spring-loaded camming device, which increased safety over chocks, hexes, and pitons. Some climbers choose to wear a specialized climbing helmet to protect them from falling rocks or equipment or head injuries from crashing into rocks.|$|E

30|$|When {{comparing}} the relay-assisted transmissions in Figure  6 (<b>‘relayed</b> network-MIMO’ and <b>‘relayed</b> BDZF-TDMA’), network-MIMO achieves a nearly doubled cellular spectral efficiency. BDZF-TDMA suffers some loses in spectral efficiency {{due to the}} time division associated to coordination. In addition, it achieves an improved cell-edge rate because {{the duration of the}} relay-receive and relay-transmit phases is optimized beforehand (see Table  2) on each transmission scheme to enhance the system spectral efficiency (and they differ from network-MIMO to BDZF-TDMA).|$|R
2500|$|As routes get higher off the ground, the {{increased}} risk of life-threatening injuries necessitates additional safety measures. [...] A variety of specialized climbing techniques and climbing equipment exists to provide that safety. [...] Climbers will usually work in pairs and utilize a system of ropes and anchors designed to catch falls. [...] Ropes and anchors can be configured in different ways to suit many styles of climbing, and roped climbing are thus divided into further sub-types that vary based on how their <b>belay</b> systems are set up. [...] Generally speaking, beginners will start with top roping and/or easy bouldering and work their way up to lead climbing and beyond.|$|E
2500|$|When two climbers move at {{the same}} time. [...] The pseudo-lead climber places gear that the pseudo-follower collects. [...] When the leader runs low on gear they {{construct}} a <b>belay</b> station where the follower can join them to exchange gear. [...] The stronger climber is often the pseudo-follower since a fall by the follower would pull the leader from below towards {{the last piece of}} gear—a potentially devastating fall for the leader. [...] In contrast, a fall from the leader would pull the follower from above, resulting in a less serious fall. [...] Most speed ascents involve some form of simul climbing but may also include sections of standard free climbing and the use of placed gear for advancement (i.e. partial aid or pulling on gear).|$|E
2500|$|Commonly {{known as}} [...] "Top Roping": {{belaying}} a climber {{from the ground}} or {{the base of the}} route. A <b>belay</b> system resembling a pulley in which an anchor has been created {{at the top of a}} climb, through which the rope runs through from the belayer on the ground, to the climber on the ground (position before starting the climb). The rope is [...] "taken-in", to clear up the slack as the climber moves upwards, so in the event of a fall, the climber falls the shortest distance possible. The length of a fall is normally no more than a meter, but can vary depending on the length of the route (the longer the rope, the more stretch the rope will undergo when weighted) and the weight of the climber compared to that of the belayer, among other things.|$|E

2500|$|In 1865, Menelik married Woizero Befana Wolde Michael, whom he {{divorced}} in 1882; the marriage produced no children. Her brother was Dejazmatch Tewende <b>Belay</b> Wolde Michael. Woizero Bafena was implicated in {{a plot to}} overthrow Menelik when he was King of Shewa. She was widely suspected of being secretly in touch with Emperor Yohannes IV in her ambition to replace her husband on the Shewan throne {{with one of her}} sons from a previous marriage. With the failure of her plot, Woizero Befana was separated from Menelik, but Menelik apparently was still deeply attached to her. An attempt at reconciliation failed, but when his relatives and courtiers suggested new young wives to the King, he would sadly say [...] "You ask me to look at these women with the same eyes that once gazed upon Befana?", paying tribute both to his ex-wife's great beauty and his own continuing attachment to her.|$|E
