5|$|Edinburgh Corporation and Lothian <b>Buses</b> have {{historically}} employed {{a high degree}} of standardisation of their service bus fleet, including the use of low-floor <b>buses</b> to facilitate maintenance savings. Lothian have never employed minibuses on their services, although some midibuses were used for a time. As at December 2014 the fleet consisted of 721 <b>buses.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Busing</b> {{integrated}} school age ethnic minorities {{with the larger}} community. The Milliken v. Bradley Supreme Court decision that <b>busing</b> children across districts is unconstitutional limited the extent of <b>busing</b> to within metropolitan areas. This decision made suburbs attractive to those who wished to evade <b>busing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some liberals see <b>busing</b> as a {{strategy}} for equalizing educational opportunity and integrating {{public schools in the}} United States. Many conservatives and working-class whites oppose <b>busing,</b> however, because of the required intrusion of the government and racial minorities into their communities and schools. Some scholars believe <b>busing</b> increases racial conflict. After <b>busing</b> was enforced in Boston, polls showed that, while the majority of Blacks supported <b>busing,</b> many were against it because it evoked racist hostility towards them. Most consider the Boston <b>busing</b> policy a failure, while students in Los Angeles fight for their right to <b>busing,</b> which they say removes limits on their educational resources.|$|R

5|$|Even though Mangalore's {{city bus}} service is {{dominated}} by private operators, with routes covering {{the full extent of}} the city and beyond, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is plying <b>buses</b> in multiple routes. Two distinct sets of routes for the <b>buses</b> exist—city routes are covered by city <b>buses,</b> while intercity routes are covered by service and express <b>buses.</b> KSRTC operates long distance bus services from Mangalore to other parts of the state. The other key players who run bus services from Mangalore are the Dakshina Kannada Bus Operators Association (DKBOA) and the Canara Bus Operators Association (CBOA). There are also KSRTC JnNurm green colour city <b>buses</b> from State Bank bus stand. These <b>buses</b> travel to different parts of the city and its suburbs.|$|E

50|$|In a Gallup {{poll taken}} in the early 1970s, very low {{percentages}} of whites (4 percent) and blacks (9 percent) supported <b>busing</b> outside of local neighborhoods. A 1978 study by the RAND Corporation {{set out to find}} why whites were opposed to <b>busing</b> and concluded that it was not because they held racist attitudes, but because they believed it destroyed neighborhood schools and camaraderie and increased discipline problems. It is said that <b>busing</b> eroded the community pride and support that neighborhoods had for their local schools. After <b>busing,</b> 60 percent of Boston parents, both black and white, reported more discipline problems in schools. In the 1968, 1972, and 1976 presidential elections, candidates opposed to <b>busing</b> were elected each time, and Congress voted repeatedly to end court-mandated <b>busing.</b>|$|R
5|$|In August 2016, the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee branded two {{double-decker}} <b>buses</b> of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism {{to operate}} in the city in the run-up and during the Olympiad. They were officially launched in late August with a ceremony during which members of the Azerbaijani national team were playing chess inside. The <b>buses</b> operated free of charge and took passengers to Baku's main sights. The passengers have the chance to play chess inside the <b>buses</b> and obtain information about the Olympiad.

5|$|In August 2016, the Musselburgh and North Berwick garages of First Scotland East {{were taken}} over by a new {{subsidiary}} of Lothian <b>Buses</b> named East Coast <b>Buses.</b> From 23 April 2017, the two Lothian Country <b>Buses</b> routes were integrated into East Coast <b>Buses.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2011 Lothian <b>Buses</b> {{introduced}} 60 new {{double deck}} <b>buses.</b> These <b>buses</b> continued {{with the same}} madder red and white pattern {{on the outside of}} the bus but Lothian <b>Buses</b> changed the seats to a matching madder red colour. They also changed the entrance to the bus to a more wooden effect. Routes 4, 5, 19, 23 and 27 were the first <b>buses</b> to receive this branding.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, {{a proponent}} of <b>busing,</b> Nancy St. John, studied 100 cases of urban <b>busing</b> from the North and did not find {{what she had been}} looking for; she found no cases in which {{significant}} black academic improvement occurred, but many cases where race relations suffered due to <b>busing,</b> as those in forced-integrated schools had worse relations with those of the opposite race than those in non-integrated schools. Researcher David Armour, also looking for hopeful signs, found that <b>busing</b> [...] "heightens racial identity" [...] and [...] "reduces opportunities for actual contact between the races".A 1992 study led by Harvard University Professor Gary Orfield, who supports <b>busing,</b> found black and Hispanic students lacked [...] "even modest overall improvement" [...] as a result of court-ordered <b>busing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Judge Arthur W. Garrity {{mandated}} and {{oversaw the}} desegregation of Boston Public Schools through <b>busing,</b> {{which began with}} the <b>busing</b> of black students from the Roxbury neighborhood to the white, working-class neighborhood of South Boston and vice-versa. The resulting crisis began {{with the implementation of}} the <b>busing</b> program in the fall of 1974 and lasted for several years. The Boston <b>Busing</b> Crisis ultimately became one of the North’s most notable desegregation battles.|$|R
50|$|Desegregation <b>busing</b> in the United States (also {{known as}} forced <b>busing</b> or simply <b>busing)</b> is the {{practice}} of assigning and transporting students to schools {{in such a manner}} as to redress prior racial segregation of schools, or to overcome the effects of residential segregation on local school demographics.|$|R
5|$|In June 2012 Lothian <b>Buses</b> {{expanded}} into East Lothian {{with a new}} subsidiary Lothian Country <b>Buses,</b> {{with the introduction of}} route 113 from Pencaitland to Edinburgh, replacing First Scotland East's route 44B following it withdrawing from the area. Initially operated by existing Lothian <b>buses,</b> the service was later operated by five Wright Eclipse bodied Volvo B7RLEs and two Plaxton President bodied Dennis Trident 2s painted in a green and cream livery {{similar to that of the}} former Scottish Motor Traction/Eastern Scottish <b>buses.</b> In September 2014, a second service commenced from Haddington to Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai's bus {{services}} {{carried over}} 5.5 million passengers {{per day in}} 2008, which dropped to 2.8 million in 2015. Public <b>buses</b> run by BEST cover almost {{all parts of the}} metropolis, as well as parts of Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayandar and Thane. The BEST operates a total of 4,608 <b>buses</b> with CCTV cameras installed, ferrying 4.5million passengers daily over 390 routes. Its fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker, vestibule, low-floor, disabled-friendly, air-conditioned and Euro III compliant diesel and compressed natural gas powered <b>buses.</b> BEST introduced air-conditioned <b>buses</b> in 1998.

40|$|In {{spite of}} almost 30 years of <b>busing</b> to achieve racial balance, there {{continues}} to be a significant gap between White and African American children in terms of school achievement, and African American students still score below national averages on achievement tests. As the city of Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) considers whether to reduce or maintain <b>busing,</b> a review of the evidence shows that there are no consistent indications of improved academic performance among minority children as a result of <b>busing.</b> Nor is there evidence of improved self-image of minority children as a result of <b>busing.</b> In fact, {{there is no evidence of}} better race relations in cities where <b>busing</b> has been widespread, and there are signs of continued strife and controversy that suggest that forced <b>busing</b> solidifies prejudice and inflames racial tensions, further dividing communities. In Pittsburgh, the financially strapped Board of Education recently backed down from a proposal to reduce <b>busing</b> that would save almost $ 10 million in transportation costs, and instead adopted a plan that would keep <b>busing</b> essentially intact while costing the district an additional $ 10 million. A group of citizens, vowing to end forced <b>busing</b> in the city's schools, has moved to have the issue placed on the spring ballot as a nonbinding referendum. (Contains 83 references.)

5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster <b>buses</b> were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 {{to launch the}} new services in competition with Strathclyde <b>Buses.</b> Kelvin had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles {{did not have to}} spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated <b>buses</b> and were able to offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the <b>buses</b> began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the <b>buses</b> {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem occurred when the ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of <b>buses</b> into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost <b>buses</b> in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining <b>buses</b> to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may {{have played a role in}} the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 95 - 97) Analyzes critically {{the various}} psychological, social, legal, and political {{aspects of the}} <b>busing</b> controversy. An attempt is made to gain an overview {{and understanding of the}} impact <b>busing</b> has had on public education in the United States. This study was made by reviewing and analyzing the literature and research studies on <b>busing.</b> Pupil transportation has long {{played a major role in}} the education of American children. It was the direct outgrowth of the movement toward school consolidation. It offered better education to children who would have been deprived of such opportunities. It is only in the context of school desegregation that <b>busing</b> has become an issue of emotion and controversy. In a review of the legal and political aspects of <b>busing</b> it was noted that the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 set the stage for <b>busing</b> as a tool for desecrating schools. Numerous other court decisions have reinforced the findings in the Brown case. The use of <b>busing</b> has sometimes been deemed necessary to implement these decisions. <b>Busing</b> has become a political issue, with government officials on both sides of the political spectrum becoming immersed in the battle. In reviewing the research on desegregation and <b>busing,</b> several communities have been compared with Berkeley, California and Kalamazoo, Michigan studied in detail. Berkeley, with strong school leadership, succeeded in drawing up a workable plan for <b>Busing</b> of integration, while Kalamazoo did not foresee the need for change of old segregation patterns in their schools until forced to do so by pressures from the black community and orders form the court. It was noted in the discussion of the psychological implications of <b>busing</b> that a pattern of fears and myths had become fixed in the public???s minds. Many social scientists refuted these fears and gave evidence that both majority and minority pupils made achievement gains in integrated schools, and that white pupils??? achievement did not suffer when they were transported to black school. Often, it is white parent???s attitude of racial superiority which made integration difficult. A psychiatrist who studied the problem of <b>busing</b> intensively stated that he never saw children become sick or emotionally disturbed because they were bused; that the experience of <b>busing</b> was physically, psychologically and educationally neutral. Strong leadership in education, politics, law and social sciences is needed if this problem of <b>busing</b> is to be solved constructively...|$|R
