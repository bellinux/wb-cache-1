5|$|Like most Tylopilus species, {{the fruit}} bodies of T.plumbeoviolaceous are not {{recommended}} for consumption because of its <b>bitter</b> <b>taste.</b> The presence of a bitter bolete may spoil a meal, as the <b>bitter</b> <b>taste</b> does not disappear with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very <b>bitter</b> <b>taste,</b> which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The <b>bitter</b> <b>taste</b> {{is largely due to}} the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E

5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to <b>bitter</b> <b>taste,</b> a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the <b>bitter</b> <b>taste</b> has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the <b>bitter</b> <b>taste.</b> In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Human {{cultivation}} {{and use of}} saffron spans {{more than}} 3,500 years and extends across cultures, continents, and civilizations. Saffron, a spice derived from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus (Crocus sativus), has through history remained among the world's most costly substances. With its <b>bitter</b> <b>taste,</b> hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, the apocarotenoid-rich saffron {{has been used as}} a seasoning, fragrance, dye, and medicine.|$|E

5|$|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (FES) is a stout {{produced}} by the Guinness Brewery, an Irish brewing company owned by Diageo, a drinks multinational. First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is more heavily hopped than Guinness Draught and Extra Stout, and typically has a higher alcohol content (at around 7.5% ABV), which gives it a more <b>bitter</b> <b>taste.</b> The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, the {{disconnect}} with local production {{has had an}} adverse effect on quality; for example, in the 1990s, some of the dried porcino mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus Tylopilus, which are rather similar in appearance, and when dried, are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from Boletus. Tylopilus species typically have a very <b>bitter</b> <b>taste,</b> a bitterness that is imparted to the flavour of the porcini {{with which they are}} mixed.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean species Boletus poikilochromus {{somewhat}} resembles I.torosus, but {{can usually}} be distinguished by a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. Also, B.poikilochromus does not feature the colour change of the stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in I.torosus. Imperator luteocupreus and Caloboletus radicans are also similar but the pores of the former are red and the flesh of latter has a <b>bitter</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E

5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely <b>bitter</b> <b>taste</b> that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E
5|$|Sclerocitrin, a pigment {{compound}} originally {{isolated from}} the common earthball (Scleroderma citrinum), is the major contributor to the yellow colour of the mycelium and the stipe base of C.piperatus fruit bodies. Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include norbadioneA, chalciporone, xerocomic acid, variegatic acid, variegatorubin, and another yellow pigment, chalcitrin. Chalciporone {{is responsible for the}} <b>bitter</b> <b>taste</b> of the fruit bodies. The pigments sclerocitrin, chalcitrin, and norbadioneA are derived biosynthetically from xerocomic acid. Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the chalciporone isomers isochalciporone and dehydroisochalciporone.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{congener}} Sutorius australiensis produces somewhat {{smaller and}} darker fruitbodies than S.eximius. The violet-grey bolete, Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus, {{is found in}} eastern North America and Korea. This species is somewhat similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its smoother stipe, less brownish colors, and <b>bitter</b> <b>taste.</b> The Asian and North American black velvet bolete,T.alboater, has a black to grayish-brown cap and grows in deciduous woods. T.violatinctus, found in eastern North America, has whitish pores, a smooth stipe, and a somewhat paler cap than S.eximius.|$|E
40|$|Keywords:Amino acid descriptors; <b>bitter</b> <b>tasting</b> peptide; {{bradykinin}} potentiating peptides; QSAR; multiple linear regression. Abstract. A new {{amino acids}} descriptor E, which (E 1 ~E 5) {{has been introduced}} in bioactive peptides Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Study. It has been proved that correlate good with hydrophobicity, size, preference for amino acids to occur in α-helices, composition and the net charge, respectively. They were then applied to construct characterization and QSAR analysis on 48 <b>bitter</b> <b>tasting</b> dipeptides and 30 bradykinin potentiating (BP) pentapeptides using multiple linear regression (MLR). The leave-one-out cross validation values (Q 2 (CV)) were 0. 888 and 0. 797, the multiple correlation coefficients (R 2) were 0. 940 and 0. 891, respectively for <b>bitter</b> <b>tasting</b> dipeptides and BP pentapeptides. The results showed that, {{in comparison with the}} conventional descriptors, the descriptor (E) is a useful structure characterization method for peptide QSAR analysis. The importance of each property at each position in peptides is estimated by the regression coefficient value of the MLR model. The establishment of such methods will be a very meaningful work to peptide bioactive investigation in peptide drug design...|$|R

5|$|Two eastern North American species, C.inedulis and C.roseipes, {{also have}} an {{appearance}} similar to C.calopus. C.inedulis produces smaller fruit bodies with a white to greyish-white cap, while C.roseipes associates solely with hemlock. C.firmus, found in the eastern United States, eastern Canada, and Costa Rica, has a pallid cap colour, reddish stipe, and <b>bitter</b> <b>taste,</b> but unlike C.calopus, has red pores and lacks stipe reticulation. C.panniformis, a Japanese species described as new to science in 2013, bears a resemblance to C.calopus, but can be distinguished by its rough cap surface, or microscopically by the amyloid-staining cells in {{the flesh of the}} cap, and morphologically distinct cystidia on the stipe.|$|E
5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively <b>bitter</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and the absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very <b>bitter</b> <b>taste.</b> Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E

5|$|In his 1986 infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Boletus, Rolf Singer placed C.calopus as the type species of the section Calopodes, which includes species characterised by having a whitish to yellowish flesh, <b>bitter</b> <b>taste,</b> and a blue staining reaction in the tube walls. Other species in section Calopodes include C.radicans, C.inedulis, B.peckii, and B.pallidus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that C.calopus and many (but not all) red-pored boletes {{were part of a}} dupainii clade (named for Boletus (now Rubroboletus)dupainii), well-removed from the core group of the type species B.edulis and relatives within the Boletineae. This indicated it needed placement in a new genus. This took place in 2014, B. calopus was transferred to (and designated the type species of) the new genus Caloboletus by Italian mycologist Alfredo Vizzini.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus (formerly Boletus plumbeoviolaceus), {{commonly}} known as the violet-grey bolete, is a fungus of the bolete family. First described in 1936, the mushroom has a disjunct distribution, and is distributed in eastern North America and Korea. The fruit bodies of the fungus are violet when young, but fade into a chocolate brown color when mature. They are solid and relatively large—cap diameter up to , with a white pore surface that later turns pink, and a white mycelium {{at the base of the}} stem. Like most boletes of genus Tylopilus, the mushroom is inedible due to its <b>bitter</b> <b>taste.</b> A number of natural products have been identified from the fruit bodies, including unique chemical derivatives of ergosterol, a fungal sterol.|$|E
5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which left her with a <b>bitter</b> <b>taste</b> against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E
