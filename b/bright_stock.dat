Unfortunately, any strengthening of sheet metals generally causes a decrease in their ductility and formability. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to find out the optimum forming conditions. In the present study, the optimum conditions for increasing the critical forming depth in pure stretch forming are clarified, using several punches with an ellipsoidal profile, seven kinds of sheet metals and four kinds of lubricants. The optimum punch profile and the optimum frictional coefficient for increasing the critical forming depth were found by both numerical analysis and experiments. In addition, it was confirmed that the critical forming depth could be increased by applying a low friction lubricant (PTFE and <b>Bright</b> <b>stock)</b> to the central region of the punch and a high friction lubricant (Rosin) at the outer region...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutritional}} quality of feed {{plays an important}} role in determining the health and fitness of smolts. Commercial fish meal, the major source of protein in salmon rations, may be reduced in quality from poor drying techniques during manufacture. Dietary stress in the hatchery may result. This investigation tests the hypothesis that protein quality of fish rations can influence the survival of smolts and the ultimate return of adults. The test involves a comparison between performances of coho and chinook salmon reared on rations containing very high quality protein derived from vacuum dried meals and those of fish reared on commercial rations, with commercial fish meal as a source of protein. Survival and return of several brood years of test and control fish are used to measure the influence of ration on survival. Rearing and release of tagged fish to date include 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985 broods of coho salmon; the 1983 and 1984 broods of fall chinook (tule stock) salmon; and the 1985 and 1986 broods of fall chinook (upriver <b>bright</b> <b>stock)</b> salmon.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{quantify}} the contribution of Priest Rapids Hatchery to the productivity of Upriver <b>Bright</b> <b>stocks</b> in the Hanford Reach natural production. Analysis of coded-wire tag recoveries from approximately 200, 000 Upriver Bright fall chinook reared at Priest Rapids Hatchery (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), marked annually since 1973, indicates a significant contribution to the natural spawning on the Hanford Reach. The population structure of returning runs, escapement estimates, number of hatchery smolts released, number of hatchery smolts marked with coded-wire tags, returning hatchery fish, and coded-wire tag (CWT) recoveries were evaluated to estimate natural production of smolts and the proportion of natural production attributable to hatchery progeny. It was found that on average 29. 83 % of the Priest Rapids Hatchery returns spawn on the Hanford Reach, and that hatchery-reared fish contribute up to 33. 05 % of adult returns to the Hanford Reach spawning grounds in any one year, averaging 8. 63 % over the 20 years surveyed. Our results show that fisheries managers should consider the potential for hatchery- 94 reared fish to contribute to the productivity of natural stocks in the development of recovery goals and management practices, and that the fraction of the returning population from the hatchery must be considered when estimating natural population parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{transient}} heat transfer during the intermittent and linear shaking of tin plate cans containing simulating food was studied {{in order to}} apply this technology in the pasteurization and sterilization processes, achieving energy economy and higher food quality. Transient heat transfer {{was carried out in}} four different simulating media: water, Neutral oil 150 and 500 and <b>Bright</b> <b>stock</b> oil. Five treatment combinations were prepared: simulating media (4 levels), head space (3 levels), agitation frequency (4 levels), length of agitation (2 levels) and can positions (4 levels). Heating and cooling tests were carried out respectively in a boiling water tank at 98 °C and in a cool water tank at 17 - 20 °C. Heat transfer parameters (fh, jh, fc and jc) for each test were calculated and the results expressed using dimensionless numbers relations as Nusselt, Prandtl and Reynolds and trigonometric functions. Two equations were defined: Nu = ReA - 0. 199. Pr - 0. 288. sen(xa/AM) 0. 406. cos(xf/FA) - 1. 039. cos((xf/FA). (EL/H). π) - 4. 556 Heating Nu = 0. 1295. ReA- 0. 047.

40|$|It is {{believed}} that hatchery feed nutritional quality {{plays an important role}} in determining the health and fitness of smolts. Commercial fish meal, the major source of protein in salmon rations, is subject to heat damage during drying and chemical interaction of fat oxidation products with meal proteins. Protein bioavailability is reduced and dietary stress may be introduced into hatchery feeds. The basic hypothesis of this investigation is that ration protein quality can influence the survival of smolts and the ultimate return of adults. Improved hatchery production would be better able to reestablish natural runs of salmon in the Columbia River and its tributaries and maintain and improve the genetic integrity of specific stocks. The general approach being used to prove this hypothesis involves a comparison of the hatchery growth response, survival and return of coho and chinook salmon reared on nutrient dense rations containing a very high quality fish protein complement and commercial ration relying on commercial fish meals as a source of protein. Coded wire tagging experiments are being conducted on replicate brood years of test and control fish to determine the influence of ration protein on survival. Project rearing and release of tagged fish to date include 1982 and 1983 -brood replicates of coho salmon and 1983 and 1984 -brood replicates of fall chinook (tule stock) salmon. The 1984 -brood year replicate of coho salmon is presently being reared and has been tagged for release in April 1986. Planning was completed for rearing a 1985 -brood replicate of fall chinook (upriver <b>bright</b> <b>stock)</b> salmon. This report covers the rearing and release of the 1983 -brood coho and the 1984 -brood fall chinook (tule stock) replicates. Duplicate lots of coho salmon were reared on two test rations containing vacuum dried salmon and hake meals and a control ration composed of the Sandy hatchery supply of Oregon pellet feed system rations from 1 June 1984 to release on 30 April 1985. A computed 57, 981 fish/pond replicate (2. 14 g average fish weight) were reared to a 28. 75 [...] 32. 67 g average fish weight of 56, 272 to 57, 334 fish/pond released, 25, 827 [...] 26, 673 possessed a recognizable coded wire tag. Fall chinook salmon (tule stock) were reared on a test ration containing vacuum dried salmon meal and a control ration composed of the Bonneville Hatchery supply of Oregon feed system rations from 28 December 1984 to 13 May 1985. Fish were initially ponded at 0. 61 and 0. 64 g/fish in two lots of 504, 766 and 564, 113 fish/pond: one pond was supplied the test ration and the other the control. The two lots of fish (1. 43 [...] 1. 58 g/fish) were split into duplicate ponds of 215, 480 to 260, 957 fish each on 31 January 1985 and reared to 5. 98 to 7. 18 g/fish at release. Of the 150, 774 to 213, 251 fish/pond released, 78, 962 to 60, 242 possessed recognizable coded wire tags. The growth response of both coho and fall chinook salmon between mid February of 1985 to release in May was altered from that expected by poor test ration palatability. Palatability problems were traced to one of two lots of herring oil used to prepare rations. One lot of oil was not properly stabilized with antioxidants by the supplier. Although it possessed no chemical characteristics of autoxidation, it did possess a very high potential for oxidation when incorporated into a region which could not be adequately stabilized with antioxidants. Ration preparation and oil evaluation protocol have been initiated to guard against a future occurrence...|$|E

Tule stock fall chinook were caught primarily in British Columbia and Washington ocean, and Columbia Basin fisheries. Up-river <b>bright</b> <b>stock</b> fall chinook contributed primarily to Alaska and British Columbia ocean commercial, Columbia Basin gillnet and freshwater sport fisheries. Contribution of Rogue stock fall chinook released in the lower Columbia River occurred primarily in Oregon ocean commercial, Columbia Basin gillnet and freshwater sport fisheries. Willamette stock spring chinook contributed primarily to Alaska and British Columbia ocean, and Columbia Basin sport fisheries. Willamette stock spring chinook released by CEDC contributed to similar ocean fisheries, but had much higher catch in Columbia Basin gillnet fisheries than the same stocks released in the Willamette Basin. Up-river stocks of spring chinook contributed almost exclusively to Columbia Basin fisheries. The up-river stocks of Columbia River summer steelhead contributed almost exclusively to the Columbia Basin gillnet and freshwater sport fisheries. Coho ocean fisheries from Washington to California were closed or very limited from 1994 through 1999 (1991 through 1996 broods). This {{has resulted in a}} lower percent of catch in Washington, Oregon and California ocean fisheries, and a higher percent of catch in Alaska and British Columbia ocean and Columbia Basin freshwater fisheries. Coho stocks released by ODFW below Bonneville Dam were caught mainly in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia ocean, Columbia Gillnet and freshwater sport fisheries. Coho stocks released in the Klaskanine River and Youngs Bay area had similar ocean catch distributions, but a much higher percent catch in gillnet fisheries than the other coho releases. Ocean catch distribution of coho stocks released above Bonneville Dam was similar to the other coho groups. However, they had a higher percent catch in gillnet fisheries above Bonneville Dam than coho released below the dam. Survival rates of salmon and steelhead are influenced, not only by factors in the hatchery (disease, density, diet, size and time of release) but also by environmental factors in the river and ocean. These environmental factors are influenced by large scale oceanic and weather patterns such as El Nino. Changes in rearing conditions in the hatchery do impact survival, however, these can be offset by impacts caused by environmental factors. Coho salmon released in the Columbia River generally experience better survival rates when released later in the spring. However, for the 1990 brood year June releases of Columbia River coho had much lower survival than May releases, for all ODFW hatcheries. In general survival of ODFW Columbia River hatchery coho has declined to low levels in recent years. Preliminary results from the evaluation of Visual Implant Elastomer (VIE) tags showed tagging rate and pre-release tag retention improved from the first to second years of tagging. Tagging rate remained identical from 1999 to 2000 while pre-release tag retention dropped to 95 %. Returning jack and adult salmon were sampled for CWT and VIE tags in the fall of 2000. Of 606 adults recovered at Sandy Fish Hatchery in 2000, only 1 or 0. 2 %, retained their VIE tag. Of 36 jacks recovered in 2000, 13 or 36. 1 % retained their VIE tag...|$|E

Additionally, we separated trades into two categories: {{those that are}} closest to the latest bid price, {{and those that are}} closest to the latest ask price. Using this information, we created a circle on a graph for each stock, which can be seen on the top two-thirds of the display. The y-value of the circle represents the stock 2 ̆ 7 s current trade price. The radius of the circle represents the current volume.

For every two hours, a 6 information variables (average bid price, average ask price, average trading price, trading volume, buyer/seller initiated ratio, and volatility) have been extracted from the stock data, then fed to 1 D Self-Organizing Map. The Kohonen Self-Organizing Map is a clustering and data visualization technique based on a neural network viewpoint. It is best suitable for clustering and presenting high-dimensional data set onto screen. Using the data from this process, we have grouped the stocks into six clusters where each cluster contains stocks with the most similar attributes. The stocks change position on the X-axis as they change clusters. The bottom third of the display contains more detailed information about a specific stock.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The {{average size}} {{and age of}} chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) caught in {{commercial}} fisheries along the Pacific Coast of North America have decreased substantially in this century. These declines might be caused in part by changes in size and age at maturity within the stocks contributing to those fisheries. Upriver Brights (Brights), a stock of fall chinook salmon in the Columbia River, are one of those stocks. The {{purposes of this study}} were to (1) determine if average size and age at maturity of Brights have declined, (2) {{gain a better understanding of}} the factors that may contribute to such declines, and (3) describe potential consequences of these changes. Data from in-river fisheries suggest that the average weight of mature Brights returning to the Columbia River has decreased approximately 2. 7 kg since the 1910 s, an average rate of about 0. 1 lb·yr⁻¹ (45 g·yr⁻¹). Most of the potential biases in these data tend to make this estimate conservative. Insufficient data were available to describe changes in average age at maturity. There are many potential causes for the decline in average size of mature Brights, including factors that affect very early life stages. Other researchers have determined that size at maturity appears to be highly influenced by inheritance, gender, and growth rate. I describe how maternal size can influence [...] through time of spawning, choice of spawning site, and egg size [...] the viability of the young, which carry the dam's genes for size. The size-related ability to produce viable offspring may have been changed by modifications in the environment. Very little is known about how changes in the natural environment for spawning, incubation, and rearing may have contributed to a decline in average size at maturity. Artificial propagation and rearing, such as at Priest Rapids Hatchery, seems to produce adult Brights that are smaller, younger, and more likely to be male than their natural counterparts. The net result is that the average hatchery fish may have only about 0. 80 of the reproductive potential of the average natural fish. Changes in growth conditions in the ocean probably did not contribute to the change in size, although the ocean fisheries of Southeast Alaska and British Columbia appear to select, in the genetic sense, against large size and old age in Brights. Since 1978, in-river commercial fisheries have caught larger Brights and a higher proportion of females than are found in the escapement of the Priest Rapids Hatchery component of the stock, but the fisheries impact the two sexes differently by taking the larger males and the smaller females. The effect on the natural component may differ because of their apparently larger average size. I found no evidence that larger fish or more females were caught when 8 -in. minimum restrictions were in effect on gillnet mesh size relative to periods when mesh size was not restricted. Impounding the mainstem during the last 50 + yr may have removed obstacles to migration (e. g., Celilo Falls) that selected for large size in Brights, but that hypothesis could not be tested. The perserverance of larger and older phenotypes in the <b>Bright</b> <b>stock</b> suggests that countervailing selection [...] perhaps during spawning, incubation, and/or early rearing [...] may have resisted the effects of a century of size- and age-selective fisheries. That resistance, however, may reduce the productivity of the stock. Declines in average size and age at maturity can have undesireable consequences. Lower average size means less biomass landed and lower commercial value. Lower average fecundity and a diminished ability to reproduce in some environments are also expected. Loss of size and age classes may reduce the ability of the stock to adapt to environmental variations. These results are relevant to several management practices. A holistic approach to fishery management issues is necessary to avoid erroneous conclusions based on narrow perspectives. Measuring reproductive potential of the catch and escapement would be superior to the conventional practice of simply counting numbers of fish. Many aspects of artificial propagation can be improved, including broodstock aquisition, mating regimes, and rearing practices. Stock abundance is a major factor in determining the effect of many management practices on the stock. In general, fisheries managers must be mindful that they manage very complex natural systems...|$|E
