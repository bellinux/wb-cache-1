Perhaps due to the {{uncertainty}} of their future, nobody was courageous enough {{to take up the}} responsibility, except for the confident Arniko. When the king tried to discourage him because of his youth, he replied, [...] "My body is indeed young, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> is not." [...] The king eventually made him the team leader of eighty artisans and sent him to Lhasa. He was only seventeen when he departed from Nepal.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{priests and}} {{former members of}} {{religious}} orders had already married, including Andreas Karlstadt and Justus Jonas, but Luther's wedding set the seal of approval on clerical marriage. He had long condemned vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds, but his decision to marry surprised many, not least Melanchthon, who called it reckless. Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524, [...] "I shall never take a wife, as I feel at present. Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> is averse to wedlock because I daily expect {{the death of a}} heretic." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was again}} raised why Miller was not playing {{international}} cricket. [...] "If {{called up to}} do a job , will do to best of ability - <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> is not really on it," [...] Miller said. [...] "The one thing I'd say about criticism of whether I could replicate my domestic performances at Test level, and can only speak for myself - I have played in A team cricket in 2013 versus India and Sri Lanka, playing against guys like [...] Sehwag, [...] Gambhir, [...] Pujara, Yuvraj [...] and got five-wicket hauls and was the leading West Indies A wicket-taker. Yes, the standard (of West Indies domestic cricket) could improve to another level, but if it was I believe I'd still do well, because if you're good, you perform despite the standard." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Chili Peppers {{entered the}} studio, and {{completed}} recording of their fourth album, Mother's Milk, in early 1989. Upon release, {{the album was}} met with mixed reactions from critics, but received far more commercial attention, peaking at number fifty-two on the Billboard200. Although his band was experiencing greater success, Kiedis' withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his personal life. This led {{to the end of}} his two-year relationship with Skye in December 1989: [...] "I had managed to stay sober by not ingesting drugs, so my body had healed from all that torturous activity, <b>but</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> still wasn't healthy enough to work out all the problems that come up in a relationship." [...] In 1990 Kiedis received a conviction for indecent exposure [...] and sexual battery in Virginia related to an incident at the George Mason University in Fairfax County in April 1989. He was ordered to pay a fine on both counts.|$|E
