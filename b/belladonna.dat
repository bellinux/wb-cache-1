5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa <b>belladonna)</b> that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
5|$|Prescribed 90 {{medications}} {{during the}} war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments. He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine, as well as potassium bromide and atropa <b>belladonna</b> (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills). He suffered ruptured eardrums {{as a result of the}} 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs. Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life. Ernst-Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cope began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, <b>belladonna,</b> and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|E

5000|$|Modern reviews {{are also}} very positive. AllMusic's Steve Huey said the album was a great leap forward from its {{predecessor}} and one of Anthrax finest. He praised the lyrics for paying tribute to fictional characters as in [...] "Lone Justice" [...] and [...] "Medusa". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff calls the album [...] "a shocking blast of noise from a long-haired bunch of punks that knew their own business", praising the [...] "deceptively chaotic songcraft" [...] and <b>Belladonna's</b> vocals. Also Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno liked <b>Belladonna's</b> vocals, {{as well as the}} tight riffs of guitarists Ian and Spitz. Stagno said Spreading the Disease had excellent sound and production and recommended the album for fans of thrash metal. Frank Trojan of Rock Hard wrote that Spreading the Disease more potential and intelligence than Fistful of Metal, as well as more differentiated songs.|$|R

500|$|Chad Grischow of IGN {{commented that}} the album sounded [...] "as fresh and eruptive as ever" [...] with the {{exception}} of [...] "Crawl", the [...] "rare misstep on the otherwise fantastic album". Loudwire's Matthew Wilkening said that <b>Belladonna's</b> 20-year absence from the band hasn't affected the band's chemistry at all. According to him, the album represented the maturity and musical growth of the band. PopMatters's Chris Colgan described the music as a combination of the [...] "later material with shades of their thrash beginnings". He believes this wasn't [...] "the glorious comeback" [...] for Anthrax, but called it a solid album with signs of progress for the group. Metal Rules chose Worship Music the best metal album of 2011.|$|R

25|$|Noted for {{its live}} performances, Anthrax {{signed with the}} {{independent}} label Megaforce Records, which released the band's debut studio album in 1984. Lilker soon left the band to form Nuclear Assault, {{and was replaced by}} roadie Frank Bello. Lead vocalist Neil Turbin was replaced after two years by Matt Fallon, who was then subsequently replaced in 1984 by Joey <b>Belladonna.</b> With a new lineup, the band recorded Spreading the Disease (distributed by Island Records) in 1985. Anthrax's third album, Among the Living, was released in 1987 to critical praise. The band experienced another lineup change in 1992, when John Bush from Armored Saint replaced <b>Belladonna</b> as lead vocalist. Sound of White Noise was released the following year, peaking at number seven on the Billboard 200. Studio recordings during the 1990s saw the band, influenced by other genres, experimenting with its sound.|$|E
50|$|The Tolkien Society {{gradually}} {{took shape}} {{over the following}} years. December 1969 saw the publication of <b>Belladonna's</b> Broadsheet, which after three issues was replaced by The Mallorn in October 1970. This was conceived as a quarterly publication, and the first issue was joined by The Tolkien Society Bulletin, {{which was to be}} produced on a six-weekly basis. The Society's official bulletin was replaced in January 1972 with Anduril, but was quickly supplanted by Henneth Annûn after three issues (the first had been numbered 0 and it continued independently until issue number 7). This new publication changed its name to Amon Hen with the second issue, seemingly for no particular reason. It, together with Mallorn (the definite article having being dropped from issue 2), are still published by the Tolkien Society.|$|R
2500|$|The EP {{received}} favorable reviews {{by music}} critics. AllMusic reviewer Jason Lymangrover gave the album two-and-a-half stars, saying the tracks are [...] "meticulously executed in the fun, dumb spirit that most Anthrax fans will love". Chad Bowar from About.com named the album [...] "certainly not essential", but {{assumed that the}} fans of the band will enjoy it. [...] In a review for Metal Forces, Jim McDonald felt that the songs on Anthems were [...] "perfect covers" [...] with [...] "superb melodies". Aside from [...] "Jailbreak", which he pointed as the [...] "sole low point", McDonald {{went on to say}} [...] "all in all, Anthems is an interesting diversion while fans wait for the next album". Kory Grow from Revolver also made positive comments on the record, saying that <b>Belladonna’s</b> voice [...] "perfectly" [...] fits the covers. Writing in PopMatters, reviewer J.C. Maçek stated that Anthrax delivered [...] "the most accurate cover songs they possibly can". However, he noted that the band was [...] "too careful" [...] on this record, adding [...] "nothing new" [...] to it. Chris Ayers of Exclaim! was more enthusiastic towards the album, labeling it a [...] "metal milestone" [...] in Anthrax's [...] "storied career".|$|R
