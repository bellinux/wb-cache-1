The Equitable's Annual Regulatory Returns, submitted each year to the regulatory authorities (the Department of Trade and Industry - DTI) had set out this practice since the 1993 (when the current annuity rate first fell below the guaranteed annuity rate).

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} one of {{the most}} common life insurance products - the so-called participating (or with profits) policy. This type of contract stand in contrast to Unit-Linked (UL) products in that interest is credited to the policy periodically according to some mechanism which smoothes past returns on the life insurance company's (LIC) assets. As is the case for ULL products, the participating policies are typically equipped with an interest rate guarantee and possibly also an option to surrender (sell-back) the policy to the LAC before maturity. The paper shows that the typical participating policy can be decomposed into a risk free bond element, a bonus option, and a surrender option. A dynamic model is constructed in which these elements can be valued separately using contingent claims analysis. the impact of various bonus policies and various levels of the guaranteed interest rate is analyzed numerically. we find that values of participating policies are highly sensitive to the <b>bonus</b> <b>policy,</b> that surrender options can be quite valuable, and that LAC solvency can be quickly jeopardised if earning opportunities deteriorate in a situation where bonus reserves are low and promised returns are high. ...|$|E

40|$|Summary—Bonus {{depreciation}} subsidized only {{purchases of}} equipment with very long tax lives. Investment in {{these types of}} equipment responded sharply to the subsidy, {{but because it was}} so narrowly targeted, the subsidy had only modest effects on the overall economy. In 2002 businesses received a tax cut {{in the form of a}} “bonus depreciation ” provision that allowed them to immediately write off 30 percent of qualified investment spending. The bonus was increased to 50 percent in 2003 and expired at the end of 2004. 1 The <b>bonus</b> depreciation <b>policy</b> mainly benefited relatively long-lived business equipment. Current tax law already allows firms to rapidly write off investment expenditures for most other types of equipment. Consequently, the additional tax saving from writing off more in the first year is quite small for many types of investment. For example, the average subsidy resulting from the 50 percent bonus to equipment with service lives of 7 years or less was at most 1 percent. In addition, many of these investment goods (which include vehicles, computers, and “general equipment”) are purchased by firms that are not affected by bonus depreciation because their annual investment spending is low enough to write it off immediately. In contrast, the subsidy for longer-lived capital goods was much greater. These goods, whic...|$|R

40|$|The Australian baby bonus {{offering}} parents $ 3, 000 on {{the birth}} of a new child was announced on 11 May 2004. The availability of five years of birth data following the introduction of the baby bonus allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the policy implications than is current in the literature. The focus {{of this paper is to}} identify if there is a positive fertility choice response to the introduction of the Australian baby <b>bonus</b> <b>policy</b> and if this response is sustained over time. To do this, 19 years of birth and macroeconomic data, beginning in 1990, is analysed using an unobservable components model. The results indicate a significant increase in birth numbers ten months following the announcement of the baby bonus, and this overall increase was sustained up to the end of the observed period. A cumulative growth in birth numbers which commenced in January 2006 slows in 2008 and 2009. It is suggested that the initial increase in births, identified in March 2005, is a direct fertility response to the introduction of the policy, and that the subsequent change in the growth of birth numbers may be the result of a delayed effect working through a number of channels. We estimate that approximately 108, 000 births are attributable to the baby bonus over the period, at an approximate cost of $ 43, 000 per extra child...|$|E

We show that the particular risk management strategy followed by the insurance company can significantly change the risk exposure of the company, and that it should thus be taken into account by regulators. We first study how the regulator establishes regulation intervention levels in order to control for instance the default probability of the insurance company. This part of the analysis is based on a constant volatility. Given that the insurance company is informed of regulatory rules, we study how results can be significantly different when the insurance company follows a risk management strategy with non-constant volatilities. We thus highlight some limits of the prior literature and believe that the risk management strategy of the company should be taken into account in the estimation of the risk exposure as well as in that of the market value of liabilities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of several avoided deforestation policies within a patchy forested landscape. Central {{is the idea that}} one neighbour's deforestation actions may impact the returns to deforestation in nearby patches. We determine {{the impact of}} each policy in terms of avoided deforestation and leakage levels at the landscape scale through modelling and simulations. Avoided deforestation policies at a landscape level are respectively: two Payment for Environmental Services (PES) policies, one focused on deforestation hotspots, the second being equally available to all agents; a conservation area; and, an agglomeration bonus. Because our model accommodates spatial interactions {{in the absence of a}} deforestation policy, it is possible that a spatial policy can affect both within-intervention areas and outside-intervention spatial spillovers in terms of leakage across different landowners’ forest patches. These two different elements of the total extent of displacement across the full landscape have not been considered before. Our contribution is twofold. In terms of methodology, we expand the concept of leakage in accounting for direct impacts to adjacent patches and spatial spillovers over the landscape, and we provide a measure of leakage in a dynamic manner for policy assessment. From our analytical model and simulations, we show that leakage is sensitive to the spatial distribution of forest patch types. The two PES policies are the most cost-effective policies regarding avoided deforestation. The agglomeration <b>bonus</b> <b>policy</b> is efficient at the expense of a higher cost, while the conservation area policy is efficient when patches with similar characteristics are gathered...|$|E

40|$|This study {{emphasizes}} that project scheduling and material ordering (time {{and quantity of}} an order) must be considered simultaneously to minimize the total cost, as setting the material ordering decisions after the project scheduling phase leads to non-optimal solutions. Hence, this paper mathematically formulates {{the model for the}} multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling with material ordering (MRCPSMO) problem. In order to be more realistic, <b>bonus</b> and penalty <b>policies</b> are included for the project. The objective function of the model consists of four elements: the material holding cost, the material ordering cost, the bonus paid by the client and the cost of delay in the project completion. Since MRCPSMO is NP-hard, the paper proposes three hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms called PSO-GA, GA-GA and SA-GA to obtain near-optimal solutions. In addition, the design of experiments and Taguchi method is used to tune the algorithms&# 039; parameters. The proposed algorithms consist of two components: an outside search, in which the algorithm searches for the best schedule and mode assignment, and the inside search, which determines the time and quantity of orders of the nonrenewable resources.

40|$|With many of {{the poor}} people in Brazil living in rural areas, local governments have {{intensified}} their efforts to design and implement effective policies that boost rural development. In 2004, a national program for production and use of biodiesel was launched aiming at increasing income among less endowed family farmers across the country. With expectations building on further expansion of the mandatory blending of biodiesel with fossil diesel, national and local government bodies are challenged by the search for policies able to foster biodiesel crop production through the wider cultivation of crops that produce more oil than soybean (e. g. sunflower and castor bean) and by improving the participation of less endowed farmers, especially in semi-arid regions. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to perform an ex-ante integrated assessment of the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of four biodiesel policy scenarios towards different farm types in a semi-arid and more humid region of southeast Brazil. The applied modelling framework was a combination of a technical coefficient generator (TechnoGIN) and a bio-economic farm model (FSSIM). We explored the impact of market-driven (<b>bonus</b> price <b>policy),</b> input provision (fertiliser and land preparation policy) and oil production (oil mill policy) policy scenarios on soybean farmers in Chapada Gaúcha and maize/beans farmers in Montes Claros. The impacts of the different policies on farm gross margins, oil crop production, labour requirements, nitrogen losses and biocide residues were assessed against the baseline scenario. Our results indicated that the scope for biodiesel crops on smallholder, non-soybean producers in Montes Claros is less evident than in Chapada Gaúcha, particularly among the less endowed farmers for whom the increase in farm gross margin in all scenarios is limited to only 6 % while oil production was 140 kg per farm, which is very low compared to the 41 % increase and more than 48, 000 kg of oil of soybean producers. The most effective policy scenario was the provision of inputs such as fertiliser and land preparation. Because in Montes Claros farmers have limited access to fertiliser, machinery and biocides, strategies that enable farmers to increase their cropped area (i. e. land preparation policy more than doubled the crop area) and crop yield levels (i. e. fertiliser policy almost quadrupled crop yields) have highest potential to benefit these farming systems...|$|R
