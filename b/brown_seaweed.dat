Leaning heavily upon the arm which a sailor held out to his assistance, he stepped into the waiting boat that rose and fell on the heaving black waters.

60|$|Every time a fresh wave broke over him, {{lifting up}} {{his hair and}} garments, which were of <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed</b> and all rags and tatters, it seemed to annoy him somewhat; but he never stirred; and when the wave retired he would wring the water out once more and blow a cloud of sea-spray from his beard. At length, holding out his mighty arms towards Martin, he opened his great, cod-fish mouth, and burst into a hoarse laugh, which sounded like the deep laughter-like cries of the big, black-backed gulls. Still, Martin did not feel at all afraid of him, for he looked good-natured and friendly.|$|E

At the same time the outcry of the birds were redoubled until he was nearly deafened by their screams, and the screams seemed to shape themselves into words. [...] "Martin! Martin!"

But {{after a while he}} began to think that there was some living thing in it, which was always near him though he could not see what it was. From time to time the surface of the sea was broken just as if some huge fish had risen to the surface and then sunk again without showing itself. It was {{something}} very big, judging from the commotion it made in the water; and at last he did see it or a part of it--a vast brown object which looked like a gigantic man's shoulder, but {{it might have been the}} back of a whale. It was no sooner seen than gone, but in a very short time after its appearance cries as of birds were heard at a great distance. The cries came from various directions, growing louder and louder, and before long Martin saw many birds flying towards him.|$|E

60|$|At Long Key the Gulf Stream is {{offshore}} five miles. The water shoals gradually {{anywhere from}} two feet near {{the beach to}} twenty feet five miles out on the reef. When {{there has been no}} wind for several days, which is a rare thing for Long Key, the water becomes crystal clear and the fish and marine creatures are an endless source of interest to the fisherman. Of course a large boat, in going out on the reef, must use the channel between the keys, but a small boat or canoe can go anywhere. It is remarkable how the great game fish come in from the Stream across the reef into shoal water. Barracuda come right up to the shore, and likewise the big sharks. The bottom is a clean, white, finely ribbed coral sand, with patches of <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed</b> here and there and golden spots, and in the shallower water different kinds of sponges. Out on the reef the water is a light green. The Gulf Stream runs along {{the outer edge of the}} reef, and here between Tennessee Buoy and Alligator Light, eighteen miles, is a feeding-ground for sailfish, kingfish, amberjack, barracuda, and other fishes. The ballyhoo is the main feed of these fishes, and it is indeed a queer little fish. He was made by nature, like the sardine and mullet and flying-fish, to serve as food for the larger fishes. The ballyhoo is about a foot long, slim and flat, shiny and white on the sides and dark green on the back, with a sharp-pointed, bright-yellow tail, the lower lobe of which is developed to twice the length of the upper. He has a very strange feature in the fact that his lower jaw resembles the bill of a snipe, being several inches long, sharp and pointed and hard; but he has no upper lip or beak at all. This half-bill must be used in relation to his food, but I do not have any idea how this is done.|$|E

A maximum amount of crude fucoidan was recorded from Sargassum wightii (7. 15 % alga dry wt.) followed by Dictyota dichotoma, Turbinaria ornata, T. c onoides, T. decurrens, Sargassum myriocystum, S. ilicifolium, S. marginatum, Padina boergesenii, P. gymnospora and Stoechospermum marginatum (2. 13 % alga dry wt.). Highest L-fucose content of 232. 5 mg g - 1 dry crude fucoidan (23. 25 % in crude fucoidan) was extracted in Sargassum wightii among the 11 seaweeds studied. Maximum sulphate content of 98. 7 mg g - 1 dry crude fucoidan (9. 87 % in crude fucoidan) was also recorded in Sargassum wightii.

40|$|The {{bioactive}} {{materials in}} <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> hold great interest for developing new drugs and healthy foods. The oil content in <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> (Saccharina japonica and Sargassum horneri) was extracted by using environmentally friendly supercritical CO 2 (SC-CO 2) with ethanol as a co-solvent in a semi-batch flow extraction process and compared the results with a conventional extraction process using hexane, ethanol, and acetone mixed with methanol (1 : 1, v/v). The SC-CO 2 method was used at {{a temperature of}} 45 °C and pressure of 250 bar. The flow rate of CO 2 (27 g/min) was constant for the entire extraction period of 2 h. The obtained oil from the <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> was analyzed to determine their valuable compounds such as fatty acids, phenolic compounds, fucoxanthin and biological properties including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antihypertension effects. The amounts of fucoxanthin extracted from the SC-CO 2 oils of S. japonica and S. horneri were 0. 41 ± 0. 05 and 0. 77 ± 0. 07 mg/g, respectively. High antihypertensive activity was detected when using mixed acetone and methanol, whereas the phenolic content and antioxidant property {{were higher in the}} oil extracted by SC-CO 2. The acetone–methanol mix extracts exhibited better antimicrobial activities than those obtained by other means. Thus, the SC-CO 2 extraction process appears to be a good method for obtaining valuable compounds from both <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds,</b> and showed stronger biological activity than that obtained by the conventional extraction process...|$|R
