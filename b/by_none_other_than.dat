Initially focused on original music creation for discrete client-driven projects, an additional business line was introduced in 2000. Cast-offs from the recording of original music soundtracks were enhanced, edited and produced to completion and organized into a searchable, online music library. With the debut of the second version of its killersound.com website in July 2000 at the Flash Forward Conference & Film Festival, killersound became the first online music library with fully searchable and downloadable music tracks and single-tier pricing.Over time, the library grew to nearly 1,000 customizable and loop-able music tracks featuring several dozen composers. One of the most notable composers discovered <b>by</b> killersound was <b>none</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> 2009 Grammy Award Nominated Artist Joel Zimmerman (Deadmau5) as well as music producer and sound designer MIDIhead who has most recently created patch libraries for Spectrasonics Omnisphere™.

40|$|El artículo plantea la cuestión de Dios a partir de la crítica de Heidegger a la metafísica. En primer lugar, se presenta el carácter derivado del proceder lógico fundamentante causalístico, para mostrar luego que, según Heidegger, el fundamento verdadero que se ha ocultado, dando lugar así al fundamentar óntico, es el ser mismo (abismo) que, manifestado como tal, anula el preguntar "¿por qué?". Desde allí queda criticado el ente supremo, causa primera, que la metafísica onoto-teo-lógica ha identificado con Dios. Dios se presenta en su divinidad, según Heidegger, en primer lugar en la palabra de Hólderlin, donde el ser-Cuarteto, con sus Divinos, señala hacia ese Dios, que así aparece más allá de tal ser-Cuarteto. El pensamiento tiene entonces su tarea propia en el seguimiento de ese poetizar. Tanto el poeta, como el pensador del ser que llega hasta lo Ereígnísy el pensador que piensa en seguimiento de la poesía acaban en el silencio. En tal silencio, precedido por "nombres que no nombran", se hace presente propiamente el Dios divino, el Dios "verdadero" según Heidegger. The article {{sets out}} the {{question}} of God from {{the starting point of}} Heidegger's criticism of metaphysics. In the first place, the derivative character of the fundamentally causal, logical procedure is presented in order to then show that, according to Heidegger, the true fundamental that has been hidden, resulting in this way in ontic fundamentation, is Being itself (abyss) that, manifested as such, annuls the questioning "Why?" From there the Supreme Being, First Cause, that onto-theo-logical metaphysics has identified with God, is criticized. God is presented in His divinity, according to Heidegger, in the first place in the word of Hólderlin, where the Quartet-being, with his Divine beings, points towards that God, which thus appears beyond such a Quartet-being. Thinking then has as its own task the following of that poetic language. The poet as much as the thinker of the being that climbs to the Ereignis, and the thinker that thinks of following poetry, finish in silence. In such a silence, preceded <b>by</b> "unnamed ñames", <b>none</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the divine God is made present, the "true" God according to Heidegger...|$|R
