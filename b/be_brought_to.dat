5|$|According {{to one of}} {{the many}} Greek legends about the Constantinople's fall to the Ottomans, when the Turks entered the city, an angel rescued the emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> life again to conquer the city back for Christians. The legend {{explained}} the later walling up of the gate as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{a network}} of former SS members, Mengele sailed to Argentina in July 1949. He {{initially}} lived in and around Buenos Aires, then fled to Paraguay in 1959 and Brazil in 1960 while being sought by West Germany, Israel, and Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal {{so that he could}} <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> trial. In spite of extradition requests by the West German government and clandestine operations by the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, Mengele eluded capture. He drowned while swimming off the Brazilian coast in 1979 and was buried under a false name. His remains were disinterred and positively identified by forensic examination in 1985.|$|E

5|$|During Easter in 1563, some {{priests in}} Ayrshire celebrated Mass, thus defying the law. Some Protestants tried {{to enforce the}} law {{themselves}} by apprehending these priests. This prompted Mary to summon Knox for the third time. She asked Knox to use his influence to promote religious toleration. He defended their actions and noted she was bound to uphold the laws and if she did not, others would. Mary surprised Knox by agreeing that the priests would <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> justice.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 the Art Association {{campaigned for}} a major retrospective, the Augustus Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition, to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Indianapolis. The exhibition, also {{referred}} to as the Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition of Statuary, attracted 56,000 visitors during its three-month run, well beyond the board's goal of attracting 50,000 visitors. A 1937 exhibition, Dutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century, included loans from the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The six-week exhibition presented 65 pieces, including several Rembrandts, and was considered the beginning of the museum's rise to connoisseurship.|$|E
5|$|Maximus' {{refusal to}} accept Monothelitism {{caused him to}} <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the {{imperial}} capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658. In Constantinople, Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Maximus stood behind the Dyothelite position and was sent back into exile for four more years. During his trial {{he was accused of}} aiding the Muslim conquests in Egypt and North Africa, which he rejected as slander.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} raids of the Viking era may have taken place near Dorchester around 790. According to a chronicler, the King's reeve {{assembled}} a few men and sped to meet them thinking that they were merchants from another country.

5|$|Shakur {{was acquitted}} after seven hours of jury {{deliberation}} on January 16, 1976, {{and was immediately}} remanded back to New Jersey for the Turnpike trial. The actual transfer took place on January 29. She {{was the only one}} of the six suspects in the robbery to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> trial. Andrew Jackson and two others indicted for the same robbery pleaded guilty; Jackson was sentenced to five years in prison and five years' probation; another was shot and killed in a gunfight in Florida on December 31, 1971, and the last remained at large at the time of Shakur's acquittal.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Che≈Çmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E

5|$|The {{best known}} Welsh cheese is Caerphilly, named in 1831 but made long before that. Originally {{a method for}} storing excess milk until it could <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> market, it was a moist cheese that would not last very long. Production of the cheese was halted due to milk {{rationing}} after World War II, although it was still made in England. There, the cheese was produced very quickly and sold early in its maturation process, creating a dryer cheese. In the 1970s, production of Caerphilly returned to Wales and over the following few decades {{a variety of new}} cheeses have also been produced in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The first St. John's dog {{was said}} to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> England in or around 1820, but the breed's {{reputation}} had already spread to England; there {{is a story that}} the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury saw a St. John's dog on a fishing boat and immediately made arrangements with traders to have some of these dogs imported to England. These ancestors of the first labradors so impressed the Earl with their skill and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilising the breed.|$|E

5|$|The last of {{the bronze}} reliefs on the column's {{pedestals}} was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although {{part of the original}} design, were only added in 1867. Each lion weighs seven tons. A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place. Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the London Zoo to <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to decompose and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|After Team Plasma's defeat, Looker {{arrives in}} Unova and tasks the player with finding the {{remaining}} Sages of Team Plasma, {{so they can}} <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pok√©mon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pok√©mon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pok√©mon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pok√©mon living in harmony. Cynthia, a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, {{is also found in}} this area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after Shigeki Morimoto, a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, {{and the director of the}} HeartGold and SoulSilver games, can also be found and battled in the game.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Wiesenthal {{dedicated}} most of {{his life}} to tracking down and gathering information on fugitive Nazi war criminals so that they could <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> trial. In 1947 he co-founded the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Linz, Austria, where he and others gathered information for future war crime trials and aided refugees in their search for lost relatives. He opened the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna in 1961 and continued to try to locate missing Nazi war criminals. He played a small role in locating Adolf Eichmann, who was captured in Buenos Aires in 1960, and worked closely with the Austrian justice ministry to prepare a dossier on Franz Stangl, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1971.|$|E
5|$|An {{operations}} plan {{suited for}} {{an attack on a}} small enemy formation was drafted by Ziegler, who was an adviser to Dam and the command staff of the 7th Infantry Division. Ziegler's plan, codenamed Operation Duc Thang I, called for the South Vietnamese to assault Ap Tan Thoi from three different directions: three rifle companies from the 11th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, to move from the north; the Dinh Tuong Civil Guards Regiment to march north from the south in separate columns; and a company of 13 M113 armored personnel carriers with an infantry company on board from the southwest. The M113 carriers and the infantry company could act as both a mobile reserve and a reaction force, so it was positioned where it could be shifted to the contact area if the Viet Cong began to retreat. In addition, Dam would also deploy two rifle companies at Tan Hiep airfield, which could <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the battlefield by helicopters from the US Army 93rd Transportation Company.|$|E
5|$|By late December 1946, {{the ship}} was in very bad condition; on 21 December, she began to list severely. A salvage team could not <b>be</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Kwajalein in time, so the US Navy {{attempted}} to beach the ship to prevent her from sinking, but on 22 December, Prinz Eugen capsized and sank. Her main battery gun turrets fell out of their barbettes when the ship rolled over. The ship's stern, including her propeller assemblies, remains visible above {{the surface of the}} water. The US government denied salvage rights {{on the grounds that it}} did not want the irradiated steel entering the market. In August 1979, one of the ship's screw propellers was retrieved and placed in the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany. The ship's bell is currently held at the National Museum of the United States Navy, while the bell from Tegetthoff is held in Graz, Austria.|$|E
