5|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} for such a past resonance is Miranda's unusually high orbital inclination (4.34°) for a <b>body</b> <b>so</b> close to the planet. The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. Titania and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are airless bodies. For instance, Titania was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 10–20nanobar.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is {{the eighth}} or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) {{in the human}} <b>body,</b> <b>so</b> that a 60kg adult {{contains}} {{a total of about}} 120g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only calcium and phosphorus are more abundant (with the exception of the ubiquitous CHON elements). Potassium ions are present {{in a wide variety of}} proteins and enzymes.|$|E
5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the <b>body,</b> <b>so</b> they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E

5|$|In 1799, after {{a seven-year}} journey, Nilkanth's travels as a yogi {{eventually}} concluded in Loj, {{a village in}} the Junagadh district of Gujarat. In Loj, Nilkanth Varni met Muktanand Swami, a senior disciple of Ramanand Swami. Muktanand Swami, who was twenty-two years older than Nilkanth, answered the five questions to Nilkanth's satisfaction. Nilkanth decided to stay {{for the opportunity to}} meet Ramanand Swami, whom he met a few months after his arrival in Gujarat. He later claimed in the Vachnamrut that during this period, he took up a severe penance to eliminate his mothers flesh and blood from his <b>body</b> <b>so</b> that the sign of his physical attachment to family, was completely removed.|$|E
5|$|We wretched and needy men reverently give thee thanks, almighty God, heavenly Father, for {{the food}} which thou hast sanctified and {{bestowed}} for the sustenance of the <b>body,</b> <b>so</b> that we may use it thankfully; {{at the same time}} we beseech thee that thou wouldst impart to us the food of angels, the true bread of heaven, the eternal word of God, Jesus Christ our Lord, so that our mind may feed on him and that through his flesh and blood we may be nourished, sustained and strengthened.|$|E
5|$|David prepares Weyland for an {{excursion}} to the Engineer ship. Shaw asks David {{about his}} freedom after Weyland's eventual demise, {{to which he}} ominously asks about every child's dream of having their parents dead. He leads the team to the flight deck of the ship, where he awakens and speaks with the Engineer, who reacts by decapitating him and killing {{the rest of the}} team, save for Shaw. David's severed head watches from the floor as the Engineer launches the ship and attempts to embark for Earth. After the ship is disabled by Prometheus getting purposefully crashed into it, David warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming for her. David contacts Shaw after she escapes the Engineer and convinces her to retrieve his head and <b>body,</b> <b>so</b> that he may pilot another ship. Shaw dictates that she will cooperate with him if he takes them to the Engineer home world, which he agrees to, despite not understanding her motivations. Together, they depart from the moon aboard an Engineer ship.|$|E
5|$|Timema spp. {{differ from}} other Phasmatodea in that their tarsi have three {{segments}} rather than five. For stick insects, they have relatively small, stout <b>bodies,</b> <b>so</b> {{that they look}} somewhat like earwigs (order Dermaptera).|$|R

5|$|Lioba's emotionless state causes her to act less rationally and as {{a result}} the {{corporation}} stop her. It is deemed that she has to be deleted. Before this happens, John manages to find her and give her back her emotions. They agree to leave Planet B and meet up in real life. However, after they do, Lioba becomes ill and goes into a hospital, where John discovers that Medley is one of the staff. John discovers that not only is he still in Planet B, but Lioba has no physical <b>body</b> <b>so</b> she cannot leave. Lioba's illness comes from a patch designed to delete the rogues. John and Medley help to cure Lioba, and they unite in order to prevent more rogues from being destroyed. Cerberus then confronts them and battles with Medley, while John and Lioba flee to safety.|$|E
5|$|Megan {{receives}} backlash from Kate for {{not following}} procedure, but clay found in both Lizzy and Joe's pockets match. Samantha realizes that Joe found {{the crime scene}} of Lizzy's murder; the tennis courts at her school. Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression on her back, which matches {{one of her friends}} Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the <b>body,</b> <b>so</b> Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather. Lou also admits killing Joe, as he was getting too close to the truth. After they arrest them, Megan revisits her mother Joan, asking to exhume her father’s body. Joan declines the request, telling Megan to leave him be. Megan and Samantha revisit Helen and Becky, revealing that Joe had an undiagnosed brain disorder, causing the emotional distance from the two, telling them that Joe helped solve the Lizzy Adler case.|$|E

25|$|Skin {{friction}} {{is caused}} by viscous drag in the boundary layer around the object. There {{are two ways to}} decrease skin friction: the first is to shape the moving <b>body</b> <b>so</b> that smooth flow is possible, like an airfoil. The second method is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is practicable.|$|E
25|$|Since, W=downward {{force on}} the body by the centre of earth, {{and there is no}} {{acceleration}} in the <b>body.</b> <b>So,</b> there exists opposite and equal force by the support on the body. Also it is equal to the force exerted by the body on its support because action and reaction have same numerical value and opposite direction.|$|E

30|$|Metabasite predominates {{in these}} {{high-grade}} rocks and has nascent island-arc affinity (Wakabayashi et al. 2010). Metachert horizons are spatially associated with antigorite schist <b>bodies</b> <b>so</b> that the inferred ocean floor stratigraphy was one where serpentinized mantle rocks were overlain by basalt and chert successively. Metaclastic rocks are absent in this package.|$|R

Formaldehyde was used to preserve the body before it was flown to the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Gesture-based {{controllers}}. These controllers act as {{an extension}} of the <b>body</b> <b>so</b> that when gestures are performed, some of their motion can be conveniently captured by software. An example of emerging gesture-based motion capture is through skeletal hand tracking, which is being developed for virtual reality and augmented reality applications. An example of this technology is shown by tracking companies uSens and Gestigon, which allow users to interact with their surrounding without controllers.|$|E
