The front of these two crests is interrupted by a groove.

60|$|He himself, with a reeling imagination, {{knew not}} what he could be at to find a spur for the heavy hours. The first day I came there, he gave my cousin a revolver, (we were upon the high road,) and to show it off, or his own shooting, he shot a passing chicken; and half an hour later, when he had brought us to the lake's edge under his castle, now but the <b>broken</b> <b>corner</b> of a tower with a winding stair, he fired at or over an old countryman who was walking on {{the far edge of}} the lake. The next day I heard him {{settling}} the matter with the old countryman over a bottle of whiskey, and both were in good humour. Once he had asked a timid aunt of mine if she would like to see his last new pet, and thereupon had marched a race-horse in through the hall door and round the dining-room table. And once she came down to a bare table because he had thought it a good joke to open the window and let his harriers eat the breakfast. There was a current story, too, of his shooting, in the pride of his marksmanship, at his own door with a Martini-Henry rifle till he had shot the knocker off. At last he quarrelled with my great-uncle William Middleton, and to avenge himself gathered a rabble of wild country-lads and mounted them and himself upon the most broken-down rascally horses he could lay hands on and marched them through Sligo under a land-league banner. After that, having neither friends nor money, he made off to Australia or to Canada. I fished for pike at Castle Dargan and shot at birds with a muzzle-loading pistol until somebody shot a rabbit and I heard it squeal. From that on I would kill nothing but the dumb fish.|$|E
5000|$|The Murrili {{meteorite}} fell as {{a single}} 1.68 kg heart-shaped rock, with approximate dimensions of 13 × 7 × 6 cm.

Two wedge-shaped sections were cut from the rock for further study and are currently kept at Curtin University, Western Australia.

5000|$|According to Information Resources International, in 1993, Doritos earned $1.2 {{billion in}} retail sales, {{one-third of the}} total Frito-Lay sales for the year. Nevertheless, in the costliest {{redesign}} in Frito-Lay history, in 1994 the company spent $50 million to redesign Doritos to make the chips 20% larger, 15% thinner, and rounded {{the edges of the}} chip. Roger J. Berdusco, the vice president of tortilla chip marketing, said a primary reason for the change was [...] "greater competition from restaurant-style tortilla chips, that are larger and more strongly seasoned". The design change {{was the result of a}} two-year market research study that involved 5,000 chip eaters. The new design gave each chip rounded corners, making it easier to eat and reducing the scrap resulting from <b>broken</b> <b>corners.</b> Each chip was also given more seasoning, resulting in a stronger flavor. The redesigned chips were released in four flavors beginning in January 1995.|$|R
60|$|It {{must have}} been a bright and {{brilliant}} bit of colouring in its best days--hence, possibly, the local tradition that the stone sweats oil. The whole building, from the pavement to the coping, notched to receive the roof-joists, is of alabaster, plain-white and streaked with ruddy, mauve, and dark bands, whose mottling gives the effect of marble. Perhaps in places the gypsum has been subjected to plutonic action; and we thought that the coloured was preferred to the clear for the bases of the columns. The exposed foundations of the eastern and western walls, where the torrent has washed away the northern enceinte, show that, after the fashion of ancient Egypt, sandstone slabs have been laid underground, the calcaire being reserved for the hypaethral part. The admirable hydraulic cement is here and there made {{to take the place of}} <b>broken</b> <b>corners,</b> and flaws have been remedied by carefully letting in small cubes of sound stone. There are also cramp-holes for metal which, of course, has been carried off by the Bedawin: the rusty stains suggest iron.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes Mario Benedetti’s novel Primavera con una esquina rota (A Spring with a <b>Broken</b> <b>Corner)</b> {{with special}} attention to the subject of the political prisoner and the representation of the crisis that unfolded in Uruguay after the 1973 coup d’état. Up until now, criticism on Primavera has focused, almost exclusively, on the topic of exile, limiting with this the text’s multidimensional quality. This dissertation postulates that the subject of the political prisoner is as central to the novel as that of exile. As a consequence, if we try to interpret the work paying attention only to one of the two topics, leaving the other aside, the resulting interpretation will be necessarily a partial one. The analysis developed here acknowledges that the place, from which the character of Benedetti speaks in the autobiographical chapters, {{as well as that of}} most of the characters in the novelistic sections, is exile. However, the centrality of the subject of the political prisoner is justified by the fact that the protagonist’s place of enunciation is his inner exile and the political prison. Exile and inner exile inside the political prison conform, then, the two symptoms and main consequences of the crisis generated by Uruguayan dictatorship. This is why both symptoms make the concept of crisis their crucial complement. It is in this sense that this dissertation incorporates three critical perspectives that allow the reader to see the internal trauma as well as the dislocation the prison experience inflicts on the political prisoner, the exiles, and the family as a synecdoche of a fragmented nation. The analysis here presented uses René Girard’s theory of the plague, Michel Foucault’s concept of prison discipline, and the ideas about textual fragmentation proposed by Carol Clarck D’Lugo, Mieke Bal, and Luis Díaz Márquez, as well as Mikhail Bahktin’s concept of heteroglossia. The methodology developed for the present research thus combines literary, historical, theoretical, and sociological sources. PhDDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.
