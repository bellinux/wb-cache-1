Schools of the future must be provided with estates where the children will be surrounded with many natural and <b>beautiful</b> <b>things.</b> Part of the practical work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E

25|$|The Emperor of China {{learns that}} one of the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> in his empire is the song of the {{nightingale}}. When he orders the nightingale brought to him, a kitchen maid (the only one at court who knows of its whereabouts) leads the court to a nearby forest, where the nightingale agrees to appear at court, where it remains as the Emperor's favorite. When the Emperor is given a bejeweled mechanical bird he loses interest in the real nightingale, who returns to the forest. The mechanical bird eventually breaks down; and the Emperor is taken deathly ill a few years later. The real nightingale learns of the Emperor's condition and returns to the palace; whereupon Death is so moved by the nightingale's song that he allows the Emperor to live.|$|E

500|$|Wenger managed Nagoya for {{the final}} time on 28 August 1996 and {{delivered}} a farewell speech, thanking the fans in Japanese. Assessing his time in Japan, biographer Jasper Rees felt Wenger had left a mixed legacy at the club, as the immediate success was followed by fluctuating league finishes; {{it was not until}} 2010 that Nagoya (under Stojković) won their first title. Wenger continues to speak fondly of his career in Japan and once likened the country to his ancestral home: [...] "It has <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> that we have lost in Europe, <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> that make life good." [...] He also credited the culture for improving his temperament and rediscovering his passion for the game. Wenger returned to Japan as a television pundit for the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, and a decade later, took Arsenal to face Nagoya in a pre-season friendly.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the three most <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> in England, Miller said [...] "The hills of Derbyshire, the leg sweep of Denis Compton and Princess Margaret". Having already gained a high profile in England during the Victory Tests of 1945 and {{possessing}} good looks, he was a popular celebrity throughout the country. In 1948, he was sought out for many social functions, such as at music or theatrical performances, and at dinner receptions {{with members of the}} Royal Family, peerage and political leaders. His friendship with Princess Margaret—the second daughter of King George VI—was the subject of widespread media speculation as to whether a romantic liaison was involved.|$|E
500|$|Conservationists {{concerned}} about the Everglades have been a vocal minority ever since Miami was a young city. South Florida's first and perhaps most enthusiastic naturalist was Charles Torrey Simpson, who retired from the Smithsonian Institution to Miami in 1905 when he was 53. Nicknamed [...] "the Sage of Biscayne Bay", Simpson wrote several books about tropical plant life around Miami. His backyard contained a tropical hardwood hammock, which he estimated he showed to about 50,000people. Though he tended to avoid controversy regarding development, in Ornamental Gardening in Florida he wrote, [...] "Mankind everywhere has an insane desire to waste and destroy the good and <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> this nature has lavished upon him".|$|E

And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt.

Requiem was first published by [...] in 1916, edited by Ulrich Haverkampf, with the dedication Dem Andenken der im Kriege gefallenen deutschen Helden (To {{the memory of the}} German heroes who fell in the War).

[...] Emily Yoshida from Grantland labelled it a [...] "murkily winsome, ever-so-slightly chopped ballad", while writer Kyle Jaeger for The Hollywood Reporter praised the track's lyrical content and its catchy melody. [...] "Tennis Court" [...] was picked {{as one of the}} standout tracks of Pure Heroine by Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, Jon Hadusek from Consequence of Sound, and Time Out editor Nick Levine. In an interview with USA Today, English singer-songwriter Elton John praised [...] "Tennis Court", describing it as [...] "one of the most touching, <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> on earth." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbette was {{championed by}} avant garde artist Jean Cocteau. Cocteau wrote in 1923 to Belgian friend and critic Paul Collaer: [...] "Next week in Brussels, you'll see a music-hall act called 'Barbette' {{that has been}} keeping me enthralled for a fortnight. The young American who does this wire and trapeze act is a great actor, an angel, and he has become the friend to all of us. Go and see him ... and tell {{everybody}} that he is no mere acrobat in women's clothes, nor just a graceful daredevil, {{but one of the}} most <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> in the theatre. Stravinsky, Auric, poets, painters, and I myself have seen no comparable display of artistry on the stage since Nijinsky." [...] To other friends he wrote [...] "Your great loss for 1923 was Barbette – a terrific act at the Casino de Paris...Ten unforgettable minutes. A theatrical masterpiece. An angel, a flower, a bird." ...|$|E
500|$|The word, [...] "untrimmed" [...] in line eight, can {{be taken}} two ways: First, {{in the sense of}} loss of {{decoration}} and frills, and second, in the sense of untrimmed sails on a ship. [...] In the first interpretation, the poem reads that <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> naturally lose their fanciness over time. [...] In the second, it reads that nature is a ship with sails not adjusted to wind changes in order to correct course. [...] This, in combination with the words [...] "nature's changing course", creates an oxymoron: the unchanging change of nature, or the fact that the only thing that does not change is change. [...] This line in the poem creates a shift from the mutability of the first eight lines, into the eternity of the last six. [...] Both change and eternity are then acknowledged and challenged by the final line.|$|E

500|$|... "Stephen" [...] {{received}} positive {{comments from}} music critics. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music used [...] "Stephen" [...] {{as an example}} of the songs on Animal that exemplified the singer's vocals, saying it had [...] "beautiful layered a cappella harmonies. Sure, it tumbles into clunky pop straight afterwards, but then, that also seems to be what she does: <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> are bashed against ugly things, pretty melodies ruined by silly noises, emotional lyrics stuffed with buzzwords." [...] Daniel Brockman of The Boston Phoenix wrote of the album that [...] "in a post–'Birthday Sex' pop landscape, there's plenty of room for dumb if it's done well." [...] He described [...] "Stephen" [...] as [...] "an ode to forcing your sexual advances on your high-school history teacher." [...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times listed the song as one of those that exemplified the album's more experimental side, calling it a [...] "country-in-space" [...] rendition.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Bellman {{writes that}} modern concert {{performance}} style—set in the [...] "conservatory" [...] tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against {{what is known}} of Chopin's more intimate performance technique. The composer himself said to a pupil that [...] "concerts are never real music, {{you have to give}} up the idea of hearing in them all the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> of art." [...] Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as [...] "always crescendo to a high note", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. [...] Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin [...] "has created a kind of chromatic embroidery... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn". Hiller wrote that [...] "What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers." ...|$|E
500|$|Other Coward works {{produced}} in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays Easy Virtue (1926), a drama about a divorcée's clash with her snobbish in-laws; The Queen Was in the Parlour, a Ruritanian romance; This Was a Man (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; The Marquise (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; Home Chat (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues On with the Dance (1925) and This Year of Grace (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, [...] "A Room with a View". His biggest failure in this period was the play Sirocco (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred Ivor Novello, of whom Coward said, [...] "the two most <b>beautiful</b> <b>things</b> {{in the world are}} Ivor's profile and my mind". Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre. Coward later said of this flop, [...] "My first instinct was to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles." ...|$|E
