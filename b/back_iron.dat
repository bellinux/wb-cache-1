5000|$|Manufacturers {{sometimes}} try {{to combine}} the characteristics of both muscle and cavity <b>backed</b> <b>irons,</b> which has resulted in terminology such as [...] "cut-muscle", or [...] "split-cavity" [...] to describe these designs.|$|R
5000|$|Historically all irons were forged from a flat {{piece of}} metal, which {{produced}} a thin clubhead that resembled a blade. Modern investment casting processes enabled manufacturers to easily mass-produce clubs with consistent properties. This manufacturing process {{was first used}} by PING, and also {{made it possible to}} take weight {{out of the back of}} the clubhead and distribute it around the perimeter. These perimeter weighted, or cavity <b>back,</b> <b>irons</b> made it much easier to achieve consistent results even when striking the ball outside the [...] "sweet spot", when compared with traditional bladed, or muscle <b>back,</b> <b>irons.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1933 Wilson Advisory Staff member Willie Ogg {{created a}} design for distributing weight {{away from the}} heel of the club head, moving it towards the “sweet spot” of the blade.

50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{features of the}} APS-95 over the Galil and the R4 were its distinctive handguard and front sight, and its carrying handle integrating an 1.5× optical sight and optional backup <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> sights. The pistol grip was also different, featuring finger grooves, much {{in the style of}} the M16 rifle.|$|E
50|$|Ogg died on Christmas Day 1959 in Tampa, Florida. At {{the time}} of his death, Ogg was engaged in design work on a new course in Tampa. He is remembered as a touring golf {{professional}} with a number of tournament wins and good finishes in golf major championships. He was the first golf club maker to build and patent the forerunner to the modern perimeter-weighted or cavity <b>back</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|E
50|$|As Iron Man was {{delivering}} {{him to the}} police, Stewart Cadwall {{realized that}} the Thundersword powers that the Beyonder bestowed upon him came from himself and not the Shazam Award trophy. After breaking out of prison, Thundersword forged a new sword and recreated Boromir. When Iron Man arrived upon learning that Thundersword is <b>back,</b> <b>Iron</b> Man was then defeated by Thundersword who left. Realizing that he is no match for Thundersword, James Rhodes contacted Tony Stark where {{they came up with}} a plan to power up the Iron Man armor. Now sporting the extra strength, Iron Man resisted Thundersword's blows and was able to use one punch to knock him into the ocean. Thundersword's body was never found.|$|E

50|$|Bilodeau was {{a member}} of the Canadian moguls team going to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. He started the {{competition}} on Sunday, February 14 in favourable conditions. This was in contrast to the previous day for the women in which they skied in rain, sleet, and generally slushy conditions. Bilodeau finished the qualification run in 2nd place overall. In the final run, Bilodeau threw a back double full on the first jump and followed it with a <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> cross on the second. His jump and style scores combined with the second fastest run of the night, saw him scoring 26.75 points to win the gold. With the gold he became the first Canadian to win a gold medal during a Canadian-hosted Olympics.|$|E
50|$|To reduce {{component}} size, weight, durability requirements, {{and most}} importantly, cost, the magnetic circuit must be optimized to deliver more {{energy to the}} projectile for a given energy input. This has been addressed to some extent {{by the use of}} <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> and end iron, which are pieces of magnetic material that enclose the coil and create paths of lower reluctance in order to improve the amount of magnetic flux coupled into the projectile. Results can vary widely, depending on the materials used; hobbyist designs may use, for example, materials ranging anywhere from magnetic steel (more effective, lower reluctance) to video tape (little improvement in reluctance). Moreover, the additional pieces of magnetic material in the magnetic circuit can potentially exacerbate the possibility of flux saturation and other magnetic losses.|$|E

Later that day, Firepower lures Iron Man into a trap, Iron Man having identified Firepower {{as the result of}} the name missing from Hammer's list. Iron Man blasts Firepower, but he strikes <b>back.</b> <b>Iron</b> Man struggles to fight Firepower due to his superior weaponry. In the nick of time, Iron Man escapes Firepower's wrath with the help of Rhodes. Unfortunately, Iron Man leads a final assault on Firepower. In retaliation, Firepower launches a nuclear missile at Iron Man, seemingly killing Iron Man in the process.|$|E

50|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{bacteria}} rely on iron intake for its biological processes. However, iron is sometimes difficult to access in certain environments, like soil. Some bacteria have evolved siderophores, iron-chelating particles that seek and bring <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> for the bacteria. Siderophores {{are not necessarily}} specific to its producer - sometimes another individual could take up the particles instead. Pseudomonas fluorescens is a bacterium commonly found in the soil. Under low-iron conditions, P. fluorescens produces siderophores, specifically pyoverdine, to retrieve the iron necessary for survival. However, when iron is readily available, either from freely diffusing in environment or another bacteriums siderophores, P. fluorescens ceases production, allowing the bacterium to devote its energy towards growth. One study showed that when P. fluorescens grew in association with Streptomyces ambofaciens, another bacterium that produces the siderophore coelichen, no pyoverdine was detected. This result suggested that P. fluorescens ceased siderophore production in favor of taking up iron-bound coelichen, an association also known as siderophore piracy.|$|E
50|$|Boston, {{who had not}} won a game in the Forum all season, played tough {{through the}} first half and would keep the game close, with a score of 60-60. Remarkably, Boston would pull away and entered the fourth quarter up by 18. It seemed to be over when Lakers center Wilt Chamberlain was injured and {{replaced}} by reserve Mel Counts. The Celtics, however, would begin to show their age when they began missing shots and turning the ball over and Laker Jerry West pulled L.A. to within one. Despite having numerous opportunities, the Lakers couldn't get over the hump and Don Nelson would make an incredible foul-line jump-shot which bounced off the <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> and fell in. During this, another battle was heating up off the court between Jack Kent Cooke and Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff. Chamberlain was pleading for Breda Kolff to put him back in, but he refused. Cooke then came down to personally order the defiant coach to insert Wilt, but to no avail. This would prove critical as the Celtics held on and triumphed 108-106.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general analytical method for predicting the magnetic fields of different Halbach magnet arrays {{with or without}} <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> mounted on slotless permanent magnet (PM) linear machines. By using Fourier decomposition, the magnetization components of four typical Halbach magnet arrays are determined. By applying special synthetic boundary conditions on the PM surfaces, the expressions of their magnetic field distributions are derived based on the magnetic scalar potential (MSP), which are simpler than those based on the magnetic vector potential (MVP). The correctness of the method is validated by finite element analysis. The harmonics of airgap flux density waveforms of these Halbach magnet arrays with or without <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> are also compared and optimized. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Problem Statement: Axial flux {{permanent}} magnet machines {{are regarded as}} compact high efficiency generators for micro-turbines employed in the distributed power generation systems. High-speed rotor of the generator causes some designing and modeling problems. Sensitivity analysis tasks of the machine parameters are difficult and completely different {{in comparison with the}} problems associated with conventional machines. Approach: This article presents a modeling procedure with some details for performance predictions of High-Speed Axial Flux Generator (HSAFG). The FEM results are employed to validate the proposed model. Proper values of inner diameter to outer diameter ratio, plus <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> thickness of two rotor discs located in two ends are serious design problem for a HSAFG. Results: Impacts of these two parameters on the performance characteristics of a HSAFG are investigated in this paper. Their optimum values are determined for the machine by somewhat precise considerations of the output voltage and efficiency. Conclusions/Recommendations: It has been found out that the optimum performance of HSAFG regarding the voltage and efficiency is achieved by the value of inner to outer diameter ratio sited between 0. 5 - 0. 65. Moreover, the thickness of the rotor <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> can be designed by trial method to produce sufficient air gap flux and resultant terminal voltage. Adding extra <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> would just increase the rotor inertia with no benefit...|$|E

In the proposed method, the relative permeability of the <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> is calculated by a simple function. Then using electromagnetic analysis, the parameters of the equivalent circuit are obtained. Next, a few approximations are proposed to develop an individual expression for calculation of each of the equivalent circuit parameters.

40|$|Abstract: In Induction Motors, {{irrespective}} of the load condition, whenever supply is provided to the electric motor, core loss exists and it remains constant. Therefore, Core loss is a major loss component in electric motors. Hence, core quality checking {{is an important one}} in electric motor. In this project, core loss tester is developed for measuring core loss in cleated stator pack. In <b>back</b> <b>iron</b> of the cleated stator pack, a 1. 5 T flux density is established to measure the core loss. For this purpose, virtual instrumentation technique is used. ...|$|E
