5|$|There {{are areas}} which people {{believe to be}} {{protected}} from tornadoes, whether <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a general rule, no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, shrimps and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> {{close proximity to the}} stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|Colonel François-Charles de Bourlamaque, {{in command}} of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm's arrival, knew by June 23 that a major British {{offensive}} was about to begin. He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie (part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders) on June 10, expecting him to return; {{the fact that the}} British held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the British camp. Bourlamaque increased scouting activities, and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sector}} of Longwy, Sedan and Namur, where the Ardennes and the River Meuse meet, the French Ninth Army and French Second Army were made up chiefly of poor quality divisions. Reinforcements were minimal, and those units were {{equipped}} with obsolete weapons. The resources at {{the disposal of}} the two Series B divisions, the 55th and later 71s Infantry Divisions, who were to bear the brunt of the attack, were weak. They had almost no Regular officers and they had not been broken-in to war conditions <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> contact with the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} founded in 1883 as the Ottawa Senators, a {{successful}} independent team that joined the NHL as a charter member in 1917. From the mid-1920s onward, they endured financial strain caused, in part, <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the NHL's smallest market. The financial problems forced the Senators to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season. Upon their return to play, having sold their better players {{in an effort to}} raise funds, the Senators finished in last place for two straight seasons and continued to lose money. Following the repeat last place finish, the team decided that it could not survive in Ottawa and hoped to move to a bigger market.|$|E
5|$|Barnes went to England in the Australian {{winter of}} 1947. In his autobiography, {{he claimed to}} have gone as a {{representative}} for an alcohol company, although appears to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply due to rationing. Once in England, he was approached by Burnley to play as a professional in Lancashire League cricket, which he did briefly before becoming disinterested and resigning. Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, as the Australian authorities frowned on those who played professionally in England. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian Board of Control's rule that wives were not allowed to travel with players, <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the same overseas country.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} Shropshire is moderate.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the four species responsible for {{a significant number of}} fatal attacks on humans, a number of other species have attacked humans without being provoked, and have on extremely rare occasions been responsible for a human death. This group includes the shortfin mako, hammerhead, Galapagos, gray reef, blacktip, lemon, silky shark and blue sharks. These sharks are also large, powerful predators which can be provoked simply <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the water at the wrong time and place, but they are normally considered less dangerous to humans than the previous group.|$|E
25|$|A recent study, done in November 2010 and {{published}} March 2011, {{was done by}} a team of scientists from the University of Rochester and University of Colorado School of Medicine. They did an experiment to attempt to repair trauma to the Central Nervous System of an adult rat by replacing the glial cells. When the glial cells were injected into the injury of the adult rat’s spinal cord, astrocytes were generated by exposing human glial precursor cells to bone morphogenetic protein (Bone morphogenetic protein is important because it is considered to create tissue architecture throughout the body). So, with the bone protein and human glial cells combined, they promoted significant recovery of conscious foot placement, axonal growth, and obvious increases in neuronal survival in the spinal cord laminae. On the other hand, human glial precursor cells and astrocytes generated from these cells <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> contact with ciliary neurotrophic factors, failed to promote neuronal survival and support of axonal growth at the spot of the injury.|$|E
25|$|Later that season, Elliott {{signed to}} drive the No. 21 for Wood Brothers Racing in 2007, {{in part due to}} his {{championship}} provisional, which guaranteed starting the race. Since fellow champion Dale Jarrett had used all of his guaranteed starts in his Toyota for Michael Waltrip Racing, Elliott was the only champion eligible for the provisional not guaranteed a spot <b>by</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the top 35 in owner's points. His first race for the team was the Coca Cola 600 at Charlotte, which he qualified without needing one of his six provisionals. He led the race at one point until he was involved in a wreck around lap 200. At Michigan, Elliott gave the team a much needed 11th-place finish, and was kept in the car until the fall Richmond race. The car then fell out of the top 35 again but at Bristol got back into top 35 in points. Ken Schrader returned to the No. 21 replacing Elliott at a testing session at Talladega Superspeedway due to the team being back in the top 35 in owners points. He returned for the final four races after the 21 fell out of the top-35 once again.|$|E
