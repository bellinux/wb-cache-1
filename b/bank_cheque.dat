The existing automatic cheque processing systems are proprietary and not adapted to the Portuguese language, which is crucial for the cheque analysis and recognition.

This put them in 11th place, and in fourth place among the parties which did not gain seats in parliament. Libertarianz did not contest the party vote in the 2002 elections - due to an oversight, the party's <b>bank</b> <b>cheque</b> was not transmitted to the electoral authorities by the appointed time. The party was therefore able to contest the election only through individual electorate candidates. Its five candidates gained 672 votes amongst them.|$|E
50|$|Politics {{played a}} part in the {{development}} of the National Giro as the British Postgiro was named. It reflected a general feeling in the Labour Movement that the banks were not meeting the mass banking needs of the British population. In the early 1960s, the majority of adults in the United Kingdom did not have a bank account and the banks did not court business from the working classes, which they regarded as unprofitable. If you were working class, you would be paid weekly and in cash. If middle class, you were more likely to be salaried and paid with a <b>bank</b> <b>cheque</b> at the end of the month. If you could afford to have a bank account, you could pay the cheque into the account—but even among the middle class, many had no bank account. It was common practice for cheques to be endorsed to local traders (and especially the milkman) who would know the customer and be prepared to exchange the cheque for cash.|$|E

50|$|The cross border money {{transfer}} {{facilities are}} limited to major bank in towns. The money transfer to countries outside of common monetary area is particularly very expensive because of high banks commission {{and one of the}} poorest currency buying & selling rates. The bank's commission is applicable to both inward and outward remittance. Cross border foreign currency <b>bank</b> <b>cheque</b> and bank draft have been abolished. SWIFT is the preferred method for cross border remittance by banks. Further, in an effort to curb money laundering and to protect the country’s foreign exchange reserves, exchange control regulation is applied to all outward remittances. An expatriate employee in Namibia is only allowed send a certain percentage of their net earning back to their home country. In terms of Exchange Control Regulations, every person who contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of these Regulations shall be guilty of an offence and liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Namibia Dollars (N$250 000) or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years (5) or both.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basis of}} WeRe Bank is the Re unit of currency, {{effectively}} a time-based currency where members can be credited with units {{according to the}} [...] "energy" [...] they expend. The most prominent feature of the concept is the [...] "WeRe cheques" [...] provided by Smith to Re Movement members. These have {{the appearance of a}} standard British <b>bank</b> <b>cheque,</b> and several websites have encouraged their readers to become WeRe members and attempt to use the [...] "cheques" [...] to settle debts such as mortgage arrears, loan repayments or utility bills. Because WeRe Bank is not a bank within the British Cheque and Credit Clearing Company system or even a company, and because WeRe Bank does not subscribe to the standards of the UK Payments Administration nor any of the world's clearing houses, the payees will not receive payment of the amounts on the fake cheques, meaning that the debt is unpaid, and can be increased by late payment fees, return check charges and legal costs. Financial regulators in the UK (including the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Ombudsman Service) and in several other jurisdictions have published warnings to the public about WeRe Bank.|$|E
50|$|In Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia, cheques {{have almost}} {{completely}} vanished {{in favour of}} direct bank transfers and electronic payments. Direct bank transfers, using so-called giro transfers, have been standard procedure since the 1950s to send and receive regular payments like rent and wages and even mail-order invoices. In the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, all kinds of invoices are commonly accompanied by so-called acceptgiros (Netherlands) or Überweisungen (German), which are essentially standardized bank transfer order forms preprinted with the payee's account details and the amount payable. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at his bank, which will then transfer the money. It is also very common to allow the payee to automatically withdraw the requested amount from the payer's account (Lastschrifteinzug (German) or Incasso (machtiging) (Netherlands)). Though similar to paying by cheque, the payee only needs the payer's bank and account number. Since the early 1990s, this method of payment has also been available to merchants. Due to this, credit cards are rather uncommon in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and are mostly used to give access to credit {{rather than as a}} payment mechanism. However, debit cards are widespread in these countries, since virtually all Austrian, German and Dutch banks issue debit cards instead of simple ATM cards for use on current accounts. Acceptance of cheques has been further diminished since the late 1990s, because of the abolition of the Eurocheque. Cashing a foreign <b>bank</b> <b>cheque</b> is possible, but usually very expensive.|$|E
