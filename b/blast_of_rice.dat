It is now known that M. grisea consists of a cryptic species complex containing at least two biological species that have clear genetic differences and do not interbreed. Complex members isolated from Digitaria have been more narrowly defined as M. grisea.

30|$|CSSLs are a {{powerful}} tool to determine phenotypic differences conferred by various QTL alleles. Sequence analysis of the pi 21 blast resistance gene {{from a number of}} cultivars identified 12 alleles (based on insertion–deletion polymorphisms in the region) that might be involved with the protein's function (Fukuoka et al. 2009). However, it was sometimes difficult to infer the effect of each mutation from the sequence only. Developing CSSLs for the chromosome region of interest by using diverse germplasm as the donor material provided a solution to this problem. Evaluation of this series of CSSLs, each possessing one of the pi 21 alleles in the genetic background of a susceptible cultivar, clearly demonstrated that all except one were susceptible, and suggested that two deletions in the allele are required to confer resistance (Fukuoka et al. 2009). The analysis also revealed that the resistance allele was present in some strains <b>of</b> japonica <b>rice,</b> suggesting that it could improve <b>blast</b> resistance <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> worldwide.

40|$|Abstract Background Magnaporthe oryzae, {{the causal}} agent <b>of</b> <b>blast</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>rice,</b> {{is the most}} {{destructive}} disease <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> worldwide. The genome of this fungal pathogen has been sequenced and an automated annotation has recently been updated to Version 6 [URL]. However, a comprehensive manual curation remains to be performed. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation is a valuable means of assigning functional information using standardized vocabulary. We report {{an overview of the}} GO annotation for Version 5 of M. oryzae genome assembly. Methods A similarity-based (i. e., computational) GO annotation with manual review was conducted, which was then integrated with a literature-based GO annotation with computational assistance. For similarity-based GO annotation a stringent reciprocal best hits method was used to identify similarity between predicted proteins of M. oryzae and GO proteins from multiple organisms with published associations to GO terms. Significant alignment pairs were manually reviewed. Functional assignments were further cross-validated with manually reviewed data, conserved domains, or data determined by wet lab experiments. Additionally, biological appropriateness of the functional assignments was manually checked. Results In total, 6, 286 proteins received GO term assignment via the homology-based annotation, including 2, 870 hypothetical proteins. Literature-based experimental evidence, such as microarray, MPSS, T-DNA insertion mutation, or gene knockout mutation, resulted in 2, 810 proteins being annotated with GO terms. Of these, 1, 673 proteins were annotated with new terms developed for Plant-Associated Microbe Gene Ontology (PAMGO). In addition, 67 experiment-determined secreted proteins were annotated with PAMGO terms. Integration of the two data sets resulted in 7, 412 proteins (57 %) being annotated with 1, 957 distinct and specific GO terms. Unannotated proteins were assigned to the 3 root terms. The Version 5 GO annotation is publically queryable via the GO site [URL]. Additionally, the genome of M. oryzae is constantly being refined and updated as new information is incorporated. For the latest GO annotation of Version 6 genome, please visit our website [URL]. The preliminary GO annotation of Version 6 genome is placed at a local MySql database that is publically queryable via a user-friendly interface Adhoc Query System.

Introduction of Pb 1 gene into rice plants by marker selection breeding has been actively carried out. As a result, there are several Pb 1 cultivars to panicle <b>blast</b> resistance <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> in Japan. Among them, K 209 and its progeny cultivar Hoshijirushi have been found to exhibit weak resistance to rice panicle blast despite harboring Pb 1. The loss of Pb 1 -mediated resistance over time has generated a negative impact for rice breeders for a long time. To this end, we attempted to identify the mechanism of the loss of Pb 1 -mediated <b>blast</b> resistance <b>of</b> Pb 1 in K 209. Traditionally, a functional gene region is introduced into a genomic fragment, so the gene can have a large additive effect in breeding. However, interactions with the genes in the background have been known to cause differential effects with respect to rice bacterial blight resistance (Sun et al. 2004; Cao et al. 2007; Iyer-Pascuzzi et al. 2008). In this study, we attempted to solve the conundrum of the absence <b>of</b> resistance to <b>rice</b> <b>blast</b> despite the presence of the resistance gene Pb 1 in the K 209 line. Our studies revealed the exact locus in the gene responsible for rice blast resistance, underscoring the importance of this research in blast resistance breeding. Genetic analysis of KASBL and K 209 revealed that the regions Chr 8, Chr 9, Chr 7, and Chr 11 were involved in rice blast resistance in at least four rice genomes (Fig. 4). Among them, three QTLs (Chr 9, Chr 7 and Chr 11) negatively affected the resistance despite the presence of Pb 1. Chr 8, on the other hand, had a positive influence on signal transduction, so it is expected that these QTLs will specifically change Pb 1 -mediated resistance single handedly or in combination with others (Fig. 4). This paves the way for creating a line in future containing just the positively acting QTL and excluding the negatively affecting QTLs {{in order to make a}} more effective Pb 1 -mediated resistance. Therefore, this result is important in developing highly persistent blast resistance disease varieties by selection of markers.|$|R

40|$|Certain plants contain {{products}} such as alkaloids, tannins, quinones, coumarines, phenolic compounds, ipomeamarone in their extracts and exudates and they are known for antifungal activities (3). Rice blast caused by Pyricularia grisea Cav. is considered {{as one of the}} most important diseases <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> (Oryza sativa L.) because of its wide distribution and destructiveness under favourable conditions resulting in serious loss of yield (10). As an alternative to chemicals used for the management of diseases, which cause health hazards and environmental pollution, the antifungal nature of various plant species was examined. In this study, we report evaluation of leaf extracts of plant species against rice blast pathogen / disease and the biochemical nature of the effective plant extracts for their antifungal properties. The plant species for the present investigation were selected on the basis of easy availability round the year in the field which are free from diseases. The test pathogen P. grisea was isolated from <b>blast</b> infected leaves <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> variety IR 50 by standard methods (12). Pure cu Iture from single spore was maintained on apple agar medium for growth. Cold water extracts of fresh leaves of 20 plant species were prepared. The fresh plant leaves were separately washed in distilled water and were separately homogenised with sterile distilled water at I: I w / v in a pestle and mortar and filtered through muslin cloth. This formed 100 % plant extract solution. The plant extracts so prepared were heated to 40 DC for 10 min to avoid contamination (4) and were diluted to required concentrations with sterile distilled water for further studies. In sterile Petri dish, 18 ml of apple agar medium was poured, 4 wells of 8 mm were prepared at 5 em apart from each other.

The susceptibility was determined under field conditions and greenhouse inoculation studies, having been used five isolated of Magnaporthe grisea of the Portuguese population of the pathogen and one isolated of reference of the Japanese population (JP 56). The beginning of tillering of the advanced lines and the varieties occurred between 19 and 29 days after sowing, the booting between 74 and 84 days and heading between 80 and 92 days. The duration of the vegetative cycle varied between 121 days and 140 days, having the majority of the studied advanced lines presented cycle greater than 130 days. In field test 60 % of the advanced lines and 58 % of commercial varieties were susceptible to leaf or panicle blast, having the advanced lines OP 1227 and OP 1229 and the commercial varieties “Ariete” and “Dardo” been most susceptible to leaf blast. In the study of inoculation 15. 8 % of the advanced lines presented susceptibility to all isolates, while no commercial variety presented susceptibility to all isolates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Rice blast is {{not only}} one of the {{earliest}} known plant disease but {{also one of the most}} widely distributed, occurring in every region of the world where rice is grown. Ten isolates of Pyricularia oryzae causing rice blast disease were evaluated for their morphological, pathogenic, virulence and genetic characterization using RAPD marker. Isolates were classified into three groups based on pathogenicity viz. severely pathogenic, moderately pathogenic and mildly pathogenic and also into four another gropus i. e. PG-I, PG-II, PG-III and PG-IV based on cultural & morphological characteristics. The molecular polymorphism among isolates by means were analyzed by means of RAPD-PCR and the genetic coefficient matrix derived from the scores of the RAPD profile showed that minimum and maximum per cent similarities among isolates were in the range of 80 to 35 percent respectively. The cluster analysis by unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) separated the isolates into two major groups at 0. 53 of similarity coefficient. Through morphological characterization, pathogenicity and RAPD grouping of isolates suggested no correlation among test isolates but genetic variability among P. oryzae isolates should be taken into account for the screening <b>of</b> <b>blast</b> resistant <b>rice</b> genotypes...|$|R
