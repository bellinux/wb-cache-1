Both dance forms {{are constructed using}} virtuoso spin, which, in ballet is right-handed and in Kathak executed to the left. As Lead Costume Designer I researched, designed and produced six costumes, for Ballet and Kathak to enhance the neo-classic ‘fusion’ choreography; the Kathak costumes respected the traditional modesty of the dancers, and the inherent ballet idiom. The research investigated the response of cut and fabric to spin, in clockwise and anticlockwise directions. This original concept involved my attendance at rehearsals to video dancers and test fabrics and cutting styles in unprecedented manner informed by dance practice. The unique garment patterns were complex ‘golden mean’ spirals cut in tulle using <b>bias</b> <b>fabric</b> properties distributed around a stretch silk tunic attached in either, left or right-hand orientation. The spin performance is staged in the round, with live musicians on a central dais, the audience faces outwards and dancers wheel around in alternately illuminated areas. Digital video, to which I contributed content, allows simultaneous projection of the dancers in kaleidoscopic effect, creating spinning and ‘ghost’ dancers in the performance space. Throughout the gestation of spin; I devised a ground-breaking method of simulating the spiral silhouettes, colour and fabric combinations in movement and lighting effects on computer in 2 D and 3 D using Poser 5 software and BVH animated (. swf) files. This efficient new working process allowed me to email results for team approval and considerably boosted the design, negotiation and decision cycle. I continue to hone this methodology...|$|E
40|$|A manual bench-top inkle-type loom was {{designed}} to enable hand woven textiles. These PGF textiles, along with unidirectional (UD) fiber mats made from the same batch of yarns, were utilized to manufacture fully resorbable textile composites (T-C), unidirectional aligned fiber composites (UD-C) and 0 °/ 90 ° lay-up UD fiber reinforced composites (0 / 90 -C). The fiber volume fraction in the composites was set at ~ 20 %. Retention of flexural properties and mass loss of the composites were evaluated during degradation in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 28 days. The higher flexural strength and modulus values observed for the T-C when compared to 0 / 90 -C were attributed to the textile weaving resulting in a <b>biased</b> <b>fabric</b> with a higher density of fibers in the warp direction. After 28 days immersion in PBS ~ 20 % flexural strength and ~ 25 % flexural modulus values for the UD-C, T-C and 0 / 90 -C composites were still prevalent...|$|R
5000|$|Glamour, {{understated}} elegance, and exquisite fabrics endeared Travis Banton to {{the most}} celebrated of Hollywood's beauties and {{made him one of}} the most sought-after costume designers of his era. As a viewing of such films as The Gilded Lily (1935) and Desire (1936) reveals, his costume designs were marked by simple but stylish cuts (often on the <b>bias),</b> rich <b>fabrics</b> (such as satin and lamé), and extravagant decoration (beads, fur, and feathers). He collaborated closely with directors and actresses in order to fulfil their vision.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} rubber {{expansion}} joints {{are made with}} a molding process. Typical joints that are molded are medium-sized expansion joints with bead rings, which are produced in large quantities. These rubber expansion joints are manufactured on a cylindrical mandrel, which is wrapped with <b>bias</b> cut <b>fabric</b> ply. At the end the bead rings are positioned and the end sections are folded inwards over the bead rings. This part is finally placed in a mold and molded into shape and vulcanized. This is a highly automated solution for large quantities of {{the same type of}} joint.|$|R

The bias strip is placed on top of the seam allowance, right sides together, and stitched 1/8" [...] from raw edges. The bias strip is then folded over the raw edge and around to the underside and stitched in place.|$|R

Sampling {{elongate}} clasts that protrude from a planar {{face for}} clast macro-fabric analysis introduces a <b>bias</b> into reconstructed <b>fabrics</b> because clasts aligned {{perpendicular to the}} sampling face are over-represented relative to those aligned parallel to the face. This study develops a probability-based mathematical analysis to quantify sample bias {{for a variety of}} clast shapes and population fabrics, including isotropic, clustered and girdled fabric styles. Bias is expressed in terms of sample eigenvalues and eigenvectors relative to those of the parent population. Results indicate that sampling always has the effect of artificially drawing fabrics towards perpendicularity to the sampling face relative to the populations from which they are drawn. This rotation generally has the effect of artificially strengthening population fabrics, by up to 30 % in the case of very weakly clustered or girdled populations. However, fabric strengthening is by no means universal and sampling alters different parent populations in different, sometimes complex, ways: the analysis in this paper identifies situations where sampling can strengthen or weaken parent fabrics, where it can rotate parent fabrics (by up to 90 ? {{in the case of a}} very weak population fabric), and where it can even change the style of a population fabric. For example, near-isotropic population fabrics can appear clustered; weakly clustered and weakly girdled population fabrics can appear isotropic; weakly clustered population fabrics can appear weakly girdled; and girdled population fabrics can appear clustered. Overall, this analysis indicates that weakly orientated population fabrics are most susceptible to bias. Thus, a weakly clustered population fabric aligned parallel to a sample face is particularly susceptible to major sample <b>bias</b> in both <b>fabric</b> strength (artificially overestimated) and orientation (artificially rotated perpendicular to the face). Bias can be reduced either by sampling all the clasts from a cube-shaped block of sediment excavated from the face, or by sampling equal numbers of clasts from the three orthogonal faces of the same sedimentary unit.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved constitutive model having application in {{finite element analysis}} of composites made of hyperelastic matrix with <b>biased</b> woven <b>fabric</b> reinforcement {{and is based on}} a pragmatic approach and the continuum mechanics theory. A generalised strain energy function is developed via a series of uniaxial tests in fibre warp and weft directions and via shear tests of representative samples of composite fabric. The proposed material characterisation approach is demonstrated on composites made of neoprene rubber matrix with nylon biased woven reinforcements having volume fraction composition 0 · 74 vol. -% neoprene and 0 · 26 vol. -% nylon. The material parameters in the anisotropic hyperelastic model are obtained by minimisation of least square residuals of uniaxial and pure shear energy densities against the respective strain invariants. Numerical simulations of uniaxial and bulge tests of the composites using the material model presented in this paper are shown to correspond well with results obtained from laboratory experiment...|$|R
50|$|Single-fold {{bias tape}} is bias tape with each raw edge folded {{in toward the}} center, wrong sides together, and pressed.Double-fold bias tape is single-fold bias tape which has been folded in half and pressed, with the single folds to the inside. (Another way {{to think of it}} is to fold a Single-fold bias tape in half along its center-line.)Devices are {{available}} commercially to aid the home sewer in making folded <b>bias</b> tape. The <b>fabric</b> strip is fed through the device, which folds the fabric. The folds are then pressed into place. The resulting folded tape will be 1/4 the width of the original fabric strip.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a method based on non – contact image analysis, which allows to simplify experimental process and increase measurement accuracy, identifying local deformations of woven material. Striving to gain accuracy of image analysis results, specimen preparation and deformation process fixation stages are of great importance. For the studies differently marked specimen groups were prepared. Their behaviour in process of tension was analysed using a special calibrated image acquisition system. Using digital images of deformed specimen {{the displacement of}} the marked surface elements - points and their shape changes were measured and material deformations in separate specimen parts (A and B) were described. According the obtained results zones of uniform deformations were established and it confirmed that stretched specimen was deformed unevenly. Mild deformations obtained in part A and the highest values of deformation recorded in the centre of part B: local deformations in the transverse to tension direction were set up to - 42. 9  % and 27. 6  % of local elongation along tension direction. Results of local deformation variation explain buckling phenomenon of <b>bias</b> stretched <b>fabric.</b> Particular local deformation values allow us to describe behaviour of deformed material, bring opportunities to perform experimental and modelling comparison of the results. The suggested methodology could be applied for the investigation of differently deformed material behaviour. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
5000|$|Halston {{launched}} his first ready-to-wear line, Halston Limited, in 1969. Halston's design was usually simple and minimalist but sophisticated, glamorous but also comfortable {{at the same}} time. Halston like to use soft, luxurious fabric like silk and chiffon. He later told Vogue that he got rid of [...] "...all of the extra details that didn't work—bows that didn't tie, buttons that didn't button, zippers that didn't zip, wrap dresses that didn't wrap. I've always hated things that don't work." [...] Another design characteristics {{was the use of}} bias. He believed that clothes cut and sewn from the <b>bias</b> of every <b>fabric</b> can develop a sexy, polished image. In past history, people had the interpretation that shows a woman's body shape was mainly through the curve of the clothing. Halston changed the fitted silhouette and created a new definition of showing the female body shape by allowing the natural flow of the fabric to create its own shape. Halston said “Pants give women the freedom to move around they've never had before. They don't have to worry about getting into low furniture or low sportscars. Pants will be with us for many years to come—probably forever if you can make that statement in fashion.” In the 1970s, his ultra-suede suit was a big hit. He brought in functionality into fashion. He designed the Ultrasuede shirtdress and re-introduce pants for women. The shirtdress was interpreted as an elongated men's shirt. He also included elements of sportswear and combined it into women's clothing, merging features from both women wear and menswear together.|$|R
