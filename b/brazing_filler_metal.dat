40|$|Both {{aviation}} {{and land}} based turbine components such as vanes/nozzles, combustion chambers, liners, and transition pieces often degrade and crack in service. Rather than replacing with new components, innovative repairs {{can help reduce}} overhaul and maintenance costs. These components are cast from either Co-based solid solution superalloys such as FSX- 414 or Ni-based gamma prime precipitation strengthened superalloys such as IN 738. The nominal compositions of FSX- 414 and IN 738 are Co- 29. 5 Cr- 10. 5 Ni- 7 W- 2 Fe [max]- 0. 25 C- 0. 012 B and Ni- 0. 001 B- 0. 17 C- 8. 5 Co- 16 Cr- 1. 7 Mo- 3. 4 Al- 2. 6 W- 1. 7 Ta- 2 Nb- 3. 4 Ti- 0. 1 Zr, respectively. Diffusion brazing {{has been used for}} over 4 decades to repair cracks and degradation on these types of components. Typically, braze materials utilized for component repairs are Ni- and Co-based <b>braze</b> <b>fillers</b> containing B and/or Si as melting point depressants. Especially when repairing wide cracks typically found on industrial gas turbine components, these melting point depressants can form brittle intermetallic boride and silicide phases that affect mechanical properties such as low cycle and thermal fatigue. The objective of this work is to investigate and evaluate the use of hypereutectic Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr <b>braze</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metals,</b> where the melting point depressant is no longer B, but Hf and/or Zr. Typically, with joint gaps or crack widths less than 0. 15 mm, the <b>braze</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> alone can be utilized. For cracks greater than 0. 15 mm, a superalloy powder is mixed with the <b>braze</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> to enable wide cracks to be successfully brazed repaired. As a means of qualifying the diffusion braze repair, both metallurgical and mechanical property evaluations were carried out. The metallurgical evaluation consisted of optical and scanning electron microscopies, and microprobe analysis. The diffusion brazed area consisted of a fine-grained equiaxed structure with carbide phases, gamma dendrites, flower shaped/rosette gamma-gamma prime - eutectic phases, and Ni 7 Hf 2, Ni 5 HF, or Ni 5 Zr intermetallic phases dispersed both intergranularly and intragranularly. Hardness tests showed that the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phase only has a hardness range of 250 - 400 HV, whereas, the typical Cr-boride phases have hardness ranges from 800 HV to 1000 HV. Therefore the hardness values of the Ni-Hf and Ni-Zr intermetallic phases are 2. 5 - 3. 2 times softer than the Cr-boride intermetallic phases. As a result the low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties of the wide gap Ni-Cr-Hf and Ni-Cr-Zr brazed joints are superior to those of the Ni-Cr-B <b>braze</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metals.</b> The mechanical property evaluations were tensile tests at both room temperature and elevated temperature, stress rupture test from 760 °C to 1093 °C, and finally LCF tests, the latter being {{one of the most important}} and severe tests to conduct since the cracks being repaired are thermal fatigue driven.

The thesis aims {{to come up with a}} solution on how the ICC can be brazed. To achieve a successful brazing operation there are several factors to consider. <b>Brazing</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metals,</b> joint design, joint clearance, non-destructive testing and the complete brazing process with manufacturing solutions for the involved parts has been investigated in this thesis. A literature study of <b>brazing</b> methods, <b>brazing</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metals,</b> joint designs and furnace types was made in the beginning of the thesis work. Solutions for these stages were categorized in concepts and then selections were made with the aid of comparison tables and evaluation matrices. The conclusions drawn in this project are that brazing of the ICC is possible as long as the tolerances of the parts are accurately controlled and suggestions on how the tolerances can be controlled are presented in the thesis. The joint proposed is a modified butt-lap joint and the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> proposed is the nickel based Ni- 613. The final concept advocates that no clearance except the work-pieces surface roughness should be used when brazing the ICC. Guidelines for improving the Technological Readiness Level at VAC are also included in the thesis. Validerat; 20110505 (anonymous...|$|R
40|$|Various {{compositions}} in the Ag-CuOx {{system are}} being investigated as potential <b>filler</b> <b>metals</b> {{for use in}} air brazing high-temperature electrochemical devices such as solid oxide fuel cells and gas concentrators. Prior work {{has shown that the}} melting temperature, and therefore the potential operational temperature, of these materials can be increased by alloying with palladium. The current study examines the effects of palladium addition on the joint strength of specimens prepared from yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) bars brazed with three different families of filler metals: Ag-CuO, 5 Pd-Ag-CuO, and 15 Pd-Ag-CuO. In general it was found that palladium leads to a small-to-moderate decrease in joint strength, particularly in low copper oxide compositions <b>filler</b> <b>metals.</b> However the effect is likely acceptable if a higher temperature air <b>braze</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> is desired. In addition, a composition was found for each <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> series in which the joint failure mechanism undergoes a transition, typically from ductile to brittle failure. In each case, this composition corresponds approximately to the silver-rich boundary composition of the liquid miscibility gap in each system at the temperature of brazing...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper {{deals with the}} joining of different materials such as SiCp/ 6063 Al MMCs and Fe-Ni alloys by means of vacuum brazing with active filler metal Ag 47 -Cu 18 -In 17 -Sn 17 -Ti 1. With the optimal process parameters, i. e., brazing temperature 580 °C, soaking time of 30 min and vacuum degree of 6. 5 × 10 - 3 Pa, the joint shear strength can achieve the maximum of 56 MPa. Once the brazing temperature of 580 °C has exceeded the solidus temperature of SiCp/ 6063 Al MMCs, the specimen can still keep the original shape due to the stiffness of composites. Sufficient diffusion between <b>brazing</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> and SiCp/ 6063 Al MMCs could occur across the interface in liquid phase considerably faster than that in solid phase. The component analysis indicates that the elements in filler metal such as Ag, Sn and In can diffuse into SiCp/ 6063 Al MMCs, which {{is believed to be}} beneficial for the joint quality...|$|E
40|$|The NOνA Experiment will {{construct}} a detector optimized for electron neutrino detection {{in the existing}} NuMI neutrino beam. The NuMI beam line is capable of operating at 400 kW of primary beam power and the upgrade will allow up to 700 kW. Ceramic beam tubes are utilized in numerous kicker magnets in different accelerator rings at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Kovar flanges are brazed onto each beam tube end, since kovar and high alumina ceramic have similar expansion curves. The tube, kovar flange, end piece, and braze foil alloy brazing material are stacked in the furnace and then brazed. The most challenging aspect of fabricating kicker magnets {{in recent years have}} been making hermetic vacuum seals on the braze joints between the ceramic and flange. Numerous process variables can influence the robustness of conventional metal/ceramic brazing processes. The ceramic-filler metal interface is normally the weak layer when failure does not occur within the ceramic. Differences between active <b>brazing</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> and the moly-manganese process will be discussed along with the applicable results of these techniques used for Fermilab production kicker tubes.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{the effect}} of {{mischmetal}} (48 wt%Ce– 27 wt%La– 14 wt%Nd– 6 wt%Pr) additions on the microstructural characteristics of an Cu- 7 wt%P <b>brazing</b> <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> (BCuP- 2) were investigated. The volume fraction of primary Cu was considerably increased with increasing mischmetal addition in the BCuP- 2. Also, the eutectic structure was changed from lamella to fibrous morphology and the pseudo-eutectic phase (Cu 3 P) was formed around the primary Cu with the mischmetal addition above 0. 03 wt%. Compound containing {{a small amount of}} mischmetal was formed in the primary Cu phase and this compound acts as the nucleation sites of primary Cu. The fraction of primary Cu was increased by about 1 - 2 wt % due to the mischmetal rich phase. The mischmetal rich phase also formed in the pseudo-eutectic phase and this enhanced the formation of pseudo-eutectic phase. The addition of mischmetal changes the eutectic phase lamella to fibrous by suppressing both the solid-liquid interfacial energy and the surface energy of the solid. The mischmetal additions showed a very strong influence on the nucleation process of primary Cu and the subsequent formation of Cu 3 P phase as well as the eutectic structure change...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{theoretical}} {{approaches to}} the erosion and wetting/flowing phenomena during the laser brazing process {{were made by the}} computer simulation. The erosion kinetics of the Inconel 600 base metal was investigated using Au- 18 %Ni <b>filler</b> <b>metal.</b> The erosion profile during the laser brazing was estimated by applying the additivity rule to the Nernst-Brunner theory based on the measured thermal cycle of the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> droplet. The computed erosion profiles in the laser brazed joints were fairly consistent with the experimental ones. The wetting and flowing of the melted Au- 18 %Ni <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> on the Inconel 600 butt joint during the laser brazing were analyzed by the metal flow model. The <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> droplet wetted and spread on the base metal and simultaneously infiltrated into the joint gap with the lapse of time. In the single beam <b>brazing,</b> the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> did not infiltrate into the 0. 1 mm wide joint gap at the completion of <b>brazing,</b> however, the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> could be filled up in it in the tandem beam brazing...|$|R
5000|$|Soldering (AmE: , BrE: [...] ), is {{a process}} in which two or more items (usually metal) are joined {{together}} by melting and putting a <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> (solder) into the joint, the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> having a lower melting point than the adjoining metal. Soldering differs from welding in that soldering does not involve melting the work pieces. In <b>brazing,</b> the <b>filler</b> <b>metal</b> melts at a higher temperature, but the work piece metal does not melt.
