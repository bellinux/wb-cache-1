30|$|The second {{generation}} of the digital video broadcasting over satellite standard (DVB-S 2) is the latest generation standard for SatComs enabling <b>broadband</b> and <b>interactive</b> <b>services</b> via satellite [41]. It has been designed for broadcasting services (standard and high definition tv), Internet and professional services such as TV contribution links and digital satellite news gathering [42]. During the formulation of DVB-S 2, three main concepts were carefully considered: (a) best transmission performance approaching the Shannon limit, (b) total flexibility and (c) reasonable receiver complexity [43]. High performance and low complexity iterative decoding schemes like Low Density Parity Check codes (LDPC) along with high order Amplitude and Phase Shift Keying (APSK) modulations were adopted for efficient operation over the nonlinear satellite channel in the quasi error free region. Compared to previous standards, the {{second generation}} standard attains 20 - 35 % capacity increase or alternatively 2 - 2.5 dB more robust reception for the same spectrum efficiency {{by virtue of the}} advanced waveforms. Furthermore, to facilitate the provision of <b>interactive</b> <b>services,</b> the standard features operation under Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) parameters. When used for <b>interactive</b> <b>services,</b> ACM allows optimization of the transmission parameters adaptive to varying path conditions [44, 45]. Hence, resources are optimally exploited, since operation under a constant fading margin according to a worst case scenario design, is no longer necessary. Moreover, DVB-RCS NG is a next generation (NG) return channel over satellite, Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) standard that has recently been approved by the DVB technical module as common physical layer standard within the RCS 2 context. This standard improves the existing mature DVB-RCS standard by including state of the art channel coding and highly efficient, nonlinear modulation schemes. Hence, the efficiency and the flexibility of the return channel operational modes is enhanced. All of these standards have been devised for large multiuser satellite two-way systems and can be adapted to the proposed multibeam processing techniques.|$|R

The implied temporal elasticity in quality-of-service provides opportunity to achieve economies in transmitted power. The value of such opportunity is quantified by comparison of two extreme cases. We develop an approximate system model which allows optimization of the rate allocation when the number of users is small, and a heuristic which is useful when the number of users is not small.
