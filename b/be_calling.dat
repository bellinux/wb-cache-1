25|$|The most {{well-known}} of his literary jabs at Boulstred is his “Epigram on the Court Pucell,” which many critics call a “disturbingly ‘personal’ {{attack on a}} woman.” Jonson supposedly wrote this poem {{as a response to}} a criticism Boulstred made of his play draft Epicoene: the Silent Woman. He claimed that his epigram was stolen out of his pocket when he was drunk and given to Boulstred, which he had not wanted to happen. Regarding the title of the poem, “pucell” was the early modern term for prostitute, so Jonson seems to <b>be</b> <b>calling</b> Boulstred a prostitute in this poem. He also accuses Boulstred of being promiscuous, bisexual, pretentious, hypocritical, and much more. His accusation of bisexuality stems from her close relationship with Lucy Russell, the countess of Bedford. However, another reading of the poem is that rather than a direct criticism of Boulstred, the work was meant to be one of a “generic court pucelle, and by that means, an image of the false world.” Yet another reading is that the poem is a representation of Jonson’s frustration with having to rely on a woman, like the countess of Bedford, for literary success. Lucy Russell was the matron of many writers, such as John Donne, and Jonson attempted to gain her matronage for many years. Jonson may have been frustrated by this apparent “inversion of traditional gender codes,” so he used the “trope of prostitution” in this poem to reassert his position of power as a male.|$|E

Mitch accelerated toward the coast of Florida as it interacted with the approaching cold front. On November5, the circulation became elongated, and the NHC commented that [...] "if [...] were not the remnants of Mitch, [...] would probably not <b>be</b> <b>calling</b> [...] a tropical cyclone." [...] The storm strengthened to reach winds of 65mph (100km/h) before making a final landfall in southwestern Florida near Naples. It quickly crossed the state, producing five tornadoes and tropical storm-force winds, and the storm emerged into the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Late on November5, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not locate a well-defined center associated with Mitch, instead observing an elongated circulation embedded in the cold front.
