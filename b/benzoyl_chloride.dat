40|$|To {{understand}} the analogies {{and differences between}} the cucurbituril and cyclodextrin cavities different solvolytic reactions have been studied {{in the presence of}} cucurbit[7]uril, CB 7, and β-CD or its methylated derivative, DM-β-CD. Solvolysis of 1 -bromoadamantane {{has been used as a}} test to evaluate the ability of the cavities to solvate the Br- leaving group. Obtained results show that in both cases the polarity inside the cavity is similar to that of a 70 % ethanol:water mixture. Solvolysis of substituted <b>benzoyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> shows a great difference between the CB 7 and DM-β-CD cavity. Solvolysis of electron withdrawing substituted <b>benzoyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> (associative mechanism) is catalyzed by DM-β-CD and inhibited by CB 7. However, solvolysis of electron donating substituted benzoyl chlorides(dissociative mechanism) is catalyzed by CB 7 and inhibited by DM-β-CD. These experimental behaviors have been explained on the basis of different solvolytic mechanisms. Participation of the hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin as a nucleophile can explain the catalytic effect observed for solvolysis of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> reacting by an associative mechanism. Solvolysis of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> reacting by a dissociative mechanism is catalyzed by CB 7 due to the ability of the CB 7 cavity to stabilize the acylium ion developed in the transition state by electrostatic interactions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDFT {{computations}} {{have been}} performed in acetone and water solvents in order to investigate the mechanism of hydrolysis of acid chlorides. Acetyl chloride and chloroacetyl chloride hydrolyze via concerted, one-step SN 2 mechanism, with the attack of water at the sp 2 hybridized carbon atom of the C=O group, and the transition state (TS) has distorted tetrahedral geometry. Solvent molecules act as general base and general acid catalysts. The TS of chloroacetyl chloride is tighter and less polar than the TS of acetyl chloride. The structure of the SN 2 TS for the hydrolysis of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> changes with the substituents and the solvent. Tight and loose TSs are formed for substrates bearing electron withdrawing (e-w) and electron donating (e-d) groups, respectively. In acetone, only the e-w effect of the substituents increase the reactivity of the substrates, and the change {{of the structure of}} the TSs with the substituents is small. In water, polar and very loose TSs are formed in the reactions of <b>benzoyl</b> <b>chlorides</b> bearing e-d substituents, and the rate enhancing effect of both e-d and e-w groups can be computed at higher level of theory. Calculated reactivities and the changes {{of the structure of the}} TSs with substituents and solvent are in accordance with the results of kinetic studies. In SN 2 nucleophilic substitutions late/early TSs are formed if the attacking reagent is poorer/better nucleophile than the leaving group, and loose/tight TSs are formed for substrates bearing e-d/e-w substituents and in protic/aprotic solvents...|$|R
