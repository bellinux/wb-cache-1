5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{government}} reined in inflation <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> peso equal in {{value to the}} U.S. dollar, and privatised numerous state-run companies, using part of the proceeds to reduce the national debt. However, a sustained recession {{at the turn of}} the 21st century culminated in a default, and the government again devalued the peso. By 2005 the economy had recovered, but a judicial ruling originating from the previous crisis led to a new default in 2014.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Prince finally {{succumbed to}} {{syphilis}} on 30 October 1713, sparking a succession crisis.

5|$|The {{abortive}} Ivelchester and Langport Navigation scheme {{had sought}} to avoid the Great Bow Bridge <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> Portlake Rhine navigable, rebuilding Little Bow Bridge in the centre of Langport, and making a new cut to Bicknell's Bridge. Seven locks, each with a small rise, were planned, but the scheme foundered in 1797 due to financial difficulties. After the cessation of hostilities with France {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century, there was renewed interest in canal building in Somerset; the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was authorised in 1824, the Glastonbury Canal in 1827, and the Chard Canal in 1834.|$|E

5|$|The final treaty also voided Spanish {{guarantees}} of military support that colonial officials {{had made to}} Native Americans in the disputed regions, greatly weakening those communitiesâ€™ ability to resist encroachment upon their lands. The treaty represented a major victory for Washington administration, and placated many of the critics of the Jay Treaty. It also enabled and encouraged American settlers to continue their movement west, <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> frontier areas more attractive and lucrative. The region that Spain relinquished its claim to through the treaty was organized by Congress as Mississippi Territory on April 7, 1798.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, a {{new report}} was released stating that the Route 30 Connector project was feasible. The proposed Connector was to be one mile (1.3km) long, and would be constructed as an elevated highway above the wetlands. Construction cost was estimated at $80 million, half {{of which could be}} paid for <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> Connector a toll road. The new report also identified US 30 as an important roadway for reducing city traffic, as it carried the least amount of traffic and had the greatest capacity out of the city's three major entering highways, the other two being the Expressway and the Black Horse Pike (US 40/US 322).|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then {{goes on to say that}} spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.|$|E

5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation.|$|E
5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> electrode and base material alternate between {{positive and negative}} charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the Great Exhibition in October 1851, Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace was bought and moved to Penge Place atop Sydenham Hill, South London by the newly formed Crystal Palace Company. The grounds that {{surrounded}} it were then extensively renovated and turned into a public park with ornamental gardens, replicas of statues and two new man-made lakes. As part of this renovation, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to build the first-ever life-sized models of extinct animals. He had originally planned to just re-create extinct mammals before deciding on building dinosaurs as well, which he did with advice from Sir Richard Owen, a celebrated biologist and palaeontologist of the time. Hawkins set up a workshop on site at the park and built the models there. The models were displayed on three islands acting as a rough timeline, the first island for the Paleozoic era, a second for the Mesozoic, and a third for the Cenozoic. The models were given more realism <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> water level in the lake rise and fall, revealing different amounts of the dinosaurs. To mark the launch of the models, Hawkins held a dinner on New Year's Eve 1853 inside the mould of one of the Iguanodon models.|$|E
5|$|Hamhuis transitioned to the NHL the {{following}} season <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> Predators' line-up out of training camp. He scored his first NHL goal on October 16, 2003, a game winner on the powerplay against St. Louis Blues goaltender Chris Osgood; Nashville {{won the game}} 4â€“1. Late in the campaign, he recorded a five-point night (one goal and four assists) in a 9â€“4 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins on March 4, 2004. He finished the season with seven goals and 26 points over 82 games with Predators in 2003â€“04. He ranked tied for third in point-scoring and second in average ice time among the NHL's rookie defencemen. Hamhuis was also chosen to the 2004 NHL YoungStars Game, representing the Western Conference in a 7â€“3 win. Hamhuis helped the Predators make {{the playoffs for the}} first time in franchise history in his rookie season and added two assists in the club's first-round elimination to the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{meets his}} girlfriend Elisa's {{grandmother}} (Teresa Yenque). The grandmother {{does not like}} Jack because he reminds her of the Generalissimo, the antagonist from her favorite Mexican telenovela Los Amantes Clandestinos. Jack buys Los Amantes Clandestinos and tries to kill the Generalissimo off, but the actors on the show refuse to cooperate. Jack then meets Hector Moreda (also played by Baldwin), the actor who plays the Generalissimo, and asks why he will not follow the script. According to Hector, {{his role as the}} Generalissimo allows him to cut in line at Disney World, among other perks. Jack shows him a picture of Elisa, explaining that he wants to kill off the character for her. Understanding Jack's feelings, Hector agrees to help Jack <b>by</b> <b>making</b> <b>the</b> character fall in love with an elderly Hispanic woman, thereby winning the affection of Elisa's grandmother. The grandmother subsequently accepts Jack as Elisa's boyfriend, but makes one more request of him: to make NBC News less depressing. Jack responds by airing a montage of pictures of Puerto Rican babies to the music of Tito Puente on The Today Show, much to the displeasure of Matt Lauer.|$|E
