50|$|Pocket cruisers {{range in}} length from 10 to about 26 ft, with some variation, {{depending}} on individual requirements. Most {{are in the}} range of 15 to 20 ft long, with a beam around 6 ft. Commercial models generally have either a short, <b>ballasted</b> shoal <b>draft</b> keel or a weighted centerboard, while home-built designs often use water ballast and leeboards. The short length and low weight of most pocket cruisers (and short keels on models with fixed keels) allow them to be trailered easily.|$|R
