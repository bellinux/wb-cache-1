50|$|Tincalconite {{typically}} {{occurs as}} a fine grained white powder. It crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system and has been found as primary euhedral di-rhombohedral, pseudo-octahedral crystals. It is also found pseudomorphically replacing <b>borax</b> <b>crystals.</b> It has a specific gravity of 1.88 and a Mohs hardness of 2. Refractive index values are nω=1.460 and nε=1.470.|$|E
50|$|In 1872, {{while working}} as a woodcutter, he {{discovered}} a rich supply of ulexite at Teel's Marsh, near the town he would found ten years later, Marietta, Nevada. He staked a claim, started a company with his brother Julius Smith, and established a borax works {{at the edge of the}} marsh to concentrate the <b>borax</b> <b>crystals</b> and separate them from dirt and other impurities.|$|E

This experiment was carried out at temperature of 25 �C and relative supersaturation of 0. 21 and 0. 74 under in situ cell optical microscopy method.

50|$|Heavy {{attrition}} {{saw only}} eight cars running at the finish. Winner Lee Wallard's car lost its brakes, suffered a damaged exhaust pipe, and broke a shock absorber mounting. In {{addition to the}} unbearably uncomfortable ride, Wallard had worn a fire retardant outfit, created by dipping his uniform {{in a mixture of}} <b>borax</b> <b>crystals</b> and water. Due to not wearing an undershirt, Wallard suffered serious chafing, and required treatment at the infield hospital after the victory lane celebration. It was estimated he lost 15 pounds during the race.|$|E
40|$|The surface {{topology}} of <b>borax</b> <b>crystals</b> grown at a relative supersaturation of 0. 21 {{has been investigated}} using ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). It {{was found that the}} cleavage of <b>borax</b> <b>crystals</b> along the (010) face planes has features of the cleavage of layered compounds, exhibiting cleavage steps of low heights. The step heights of the cleavage of the (010) face of borax crystal are from one unit cell to three unit cells of this face.   Keywords: AFM, cleavage, borax...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth rates}} of <b>borax</b> <b>crystals</b> from aqueous {{solutions}} in the (010) direction at various flow rates were measured. The observed variations of the growth rate can be represented by a normal distribution.   It was found {{that there is no}} correlation between growth rate distribution and solution flow under these experimental conditions.   Keywords: Growth rate dispersion (GRD), borax, flow rat...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth rates}} of borax single {{crystals}} from aqueous solutions at various flow rates in the (001) direction were measured using in situ cell method. From the growth rate data obtained, the growth rate distribution of <b>borax</b> <b>crystals</b> was investigated using Minitab Software and SPSS Software at relative supersaturation of 0807 and temperature of 25 °C. The result shows that normal, gamma, and log-normal distribution give a reasonably good fit to GRD. However, there is no correlation between growth rate distribution and flow rate of solution.   Keywords: growth rate dispersion (GRD), borax, flow rat...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a model-experimental {{feedback}} {{approach is}} developed and applied to fabricate high-quality, warm-white light-emitting diodes based on quantum dots (QDs) as color-conversion materials. Owing to their unique chemical and physical properties, QDs offer huge potential for lighting applications. Nevertheless, both emission stability and processability of the QDs are limited upon usage from solution. Incorporating them into a solid ionic matrix overcomes both of these drawbacks, while preserving the initial optical properties. Here borax (Na 2 B 4 O 7 · 10 H 2 O) {{is used as a}} host matrix because of its lower solubility and thereby reduced ionic strength in water in comparison with NaCl. This guarantees the stability of high-quality CdSe/ZnS QDs in the aqueous phase during crystallization and results in a 3. 4 times higher loading amount of QDs within the <b>borax</b> <b>crystals</b> compared to NaCl. All steps from the synthesis via mixed crystal preparation to the warm-white LED preparation are verified by applying the model-experimental feedback, in which experimental data and numerical results provide feedback to each other recursively. These measures are taken to ensure a high luminous efficacy of optical radiation (LER) and a high color rendering index (CRI) of the final device as well as a correlated color temperature (CCT) comparable to an incandescent bulb. By doing so, a warm-white LED with a LER of 341 lm/Wopt, a CCT of 2720 K and a CRI of 91. 1 is produced. Finally, we show that the emission stability of the QDs within the <b>borax</b> <b>crystals</b> on LEDs driven at high currents is significantly improved. These findings indicate that the proposed warm-white light-emitting diodes based on QDs-in-borax hold great promise for quality lighting. © 2015 American Chemical Society...|$|E
