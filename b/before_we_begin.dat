60|$|I {{write in}} the {{greatest}} haste, for the rehearsal time is close at hand, and I have the master carpenter and gasman to see <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Take up thy weapon, Glumm, {{and guard}} thee. But <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin,</b> {{perhaps it would}} be well to ask for whose hand it is that we fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us get {{as near as}} we can <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to shout, Beric. They may {{run back}} a few paces at our voice, but will speedily rally." ...|$|E
6000|$|WILLIE. Very much as usual, I believe. But {{you should}} have been here ten minutes sooner, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to read the lessons. (Laughs.) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to acting, Ames enjoys writing and wrote Strangers on the Ledge, <b>Before</b> <b>We</b> <b>Began,</b> and Jack and Eva after being inspired by meetings with prolific directors at Sundance Film Festival.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, you witch-mother, you sorceress! How is a Christian man {{to win a}} game off you? I {{should have}} {{sprinkled}} the board with holy water <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began.</b> You've not won that game by fair means, now, so don't pretend it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] said Patsy, firmly. [...] "The weapons {{must all}} be {{surrendered}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin.</b> We positively refuse to dance if rioting and shooting {{are likely to}} occur." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} breakfast <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin,</b> Dias. Your wife {{went off to}} prepare it when we came out from the waterfall. I dare say it is ready by this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{have studied}} and practiced medicine," [...] she answered, [...] "and {{expect to do}} {{a great deal more}} of it <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> operations. The physician's art is my true vocation." ...|$|E
60|$|The lot drawing to-night was Five. This {{proved to}} be the number of the first of Morgan's stories, which he had {{completed}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> the readings. His second story, finished this day, being still uncorrected by me, could not yet be added to the common stock.|$|R
60|$|I had {{to hurry}} breakfast, {{for the train}} started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had {{to sit in the}} {{carriage}} {{for more than an hour}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to move.|$|R
6000|$|... {{attended}} me to {{the very}} spot to which that sentence alludes {{in the mind of}} the fallen Argive.--Our intimacy <b>began</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to date at all, and it rests with you to continue it till the hour which must number it and me with the things that were.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it's all right," [...] he concluded. [...] "I always {{believe in}} havin' plenty. Have some beer {{to wash the}} dust away <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin?</b> Watch out for the glasses. I gotta return them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good. You shall lead us. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> {{to descend}} the cliff, you shall creep {{down to the}} hut, as noiselessly as possible, and {{ascertain}} if the traitor royalists are there? Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{go on to}} {{the first}} bend, and see if it's all right <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to race," [...] Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{the makings}} of a man in that boy," [...] the artist said to himself. [...] "I wish though I had {{finished}} his figure <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to talk about his plans for the future. I shall be very proud of that boy if he ever makes a name for himself." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was present}} {{a friend of}} Fowler's, {{a young man who}} was possessed of some psychic power. We will call him Frank. Fowler and I took entire charge of the psychic, and her bonds were even more {{carefully}} nailed than <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> <b>began</b> the séance, as before, by putting her to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{was already}} {{doing some of}} those things wanted… He’s got what Eddie Kramer or Sam Phillips had back in the day… he {{encourages}} you to try new sounds and ideas… <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> [...] "Muzzle" [...] I said to Vance [...] "I want this song to sound like a monster" [...] and he just said [...] "OK". He knew exactly what to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us see first {{what is in}} {{the other}} casket <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to be angry,' thought the Emperor, and there came out the nightingale. It sang so beautifully that one could {{scarcely}} utter a cross word against it.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{out with}} your news, Willie," [...] he added, [...] "mine will keep; and as yours is, {{according}} to yourself, partly known already to my mother, it's as well to finish off one subject <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, lads," [...] Mr. Brook said, [...] "Jack Simpson is master now, and we {{will all}} work under his orders. But <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin,</b> boys, let us say a prayer. We are in God's hands; let us ask his protection." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{mounted the}} steps. The surly man {{stepped forward and}} murmured a few morose words in German. Charles brushed him aside and strode on. Then there {{followed}} a curious scene of mutual misunderstanding. The surly man called lustily for his servants to eject us. It was some time <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to catch at the truth. The surly man was the real Graf von Lebenstein.|$|R
50|$|<b>Before</b> <b>we</b> can <b>begin</b> {{to make an}} {{intensive}} study, we must first make an extensive preliminary survey covering the vast area of the Central Congo Basin.|$|R
30|$|Eight 3 -year-old cornsnakes (with {{a mass of}} 114.65 [*]±[*] 3.22  g; range, 102.9 to 127.6  g) {{were placed}} in a {{constant}} temperature chamber at 25 °C on a 12 : 12 -h L/D photoperiod with the photophase at 6 : 00 to 18 : 00 Central Daylight Time (CDT). Snakes were starved for 6  days <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> the experiment. During the experiment, none of the snakes was in ecdysis, and all reliably fed when offered a meal.|$|R
6000|$|... "But we {{must not}} blunder," [...] added Aquareine cautiously. [...] "To fail in our attempt would be to {{acknowledge}} Zog's superior power, so we must think well upon our plan <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to carry it out. What do you advise, sir?" [...] she asked, turning to Cap'n Bill.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{we must be}} very cautious," [...] remarked Rooney, {{becoming}} serious, as {{they rose}} to proceed on their adventure. [...] "It would not do to let any of our party get hurt. To my thinking, the women should take to the ice-cliffs <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin,</b> and get upon pinnacles, up which the bear could not climb." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, Blyth," [...] {{cried the}} {{voice from the}} stairs. [...] "I told you I should bring the gloves, and make a {{fighting}} man of you, last time I was here, you know. Come on! I only want to open your chest by knocking you about {{a little in the}} painting-room <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to draw." ...|$|E
5000|$|A more mixed review {{came from}} Roger Ebert, {{who wrote that}} it was [...] "one of those long, ponderous, star-filled [...] "serious" [...] films that were popular in the 1950s, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to value style more highly than the director's good intentions. It isn't successful, {{particularly}} not on Kazan's terms (he sees it, doubtless, as a bitter sermon on the consequences of selling out). But it does draw nourishment from the remarkable performances of Kirk Douglas and Faye Dunaway." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{debates about}} {{proceeding}} at all had detained us so long, and the [...] "one boiler" [...] {{proved to be}} so powerless, that night set in, and we had not yet made the coast of France. The breeze had been fresh, but it lulled towards sunset, though not <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to feel {{the influence of the}} tides. About midnight, however, I heard some one exclaim, [...] "Land!" [...] and we all hastened on deck, to take a first look at France.|$|R
6000|$|Mindful always of his religion, he {{made the}} {{youngest}} of the party say a little prayer <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> breakfast, crossing himself as devotedly as a woman. I had never seen him pray before, or make that pious sign; he did it so simply, with such child-like faith, I could not help smiling pleasurably as I watched; his eyes met my smile; he just stretched out his kind hand, saying, [...] "Donnez-moi la main! I see we worship the same God, in the same spirit, though by different rites." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've made {{something}} like two hundred mile this week, and mean {{to have a}} day or two's rest <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin.</b> We've done some Injun fighting, my mates and me, in our time, and we says to ourselves it was about time we burned a little powder against the redcoats. Things seem quiet enough about here. Nothing doing, eh?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the general}} {{division}} which I have instituted between bad-weather and fair-weather clouds {{must be more}} carefully {{carried out in the}} sub-species, before we can reason of it farther: and <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> talk either of the sub-genera and sub-species, or super-genera and super-species of cloud, perhaps we had better define what every cloud is, and must be, to begin with.|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Mr. Gubbins said, [...] "we {{must begin}} {{at once to}} sink a shaft. If, when we get down a bit, we cannot judge as to the direction, we must drive two or three {{listening}} galleries in different directions. But <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> we must let Major Anderson, of the Royal Engineers, know, and take his advice; he is in command of all mining operations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So! So it was. But, lest {{our work}} should be too easy, the King had done such a dread justice over at Salehurst, for {{the killing of the}} Kentish knight (twenty-six men he hanged, as I heard), that our folk were half mad with fear <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began.</b> It is easier to dig out a badger gone to earth than a Saxon gone dumb-sullen. And atop of their misery the old rumour waked that Harold the Saxon was alive and would bring them {{deliverance}} from us Normans. This has happened every autumn since Santlache fight.' ...|$|R
60|$|Lieutenant Gerard and I were lighter men, and our mounts were {{as good as}} his, {{so that it was}} {{not long}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to gain upon him. If we could only keep him in sight it was certain that we should ride him down; but there was always the danger that he might use his {{knowledge}} of the country to throw us off his track. As we sank beneath each hill my heart sank also, to rise again with renewed hope as we caught sight of him once more galloping in front of us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our windows, as you observe, {{are very}} {{strongly}} barred. They look westward, but that range of buildings opposite prevents our getting {{a view of}} the sea. One thing is evident, at once: that it is no manner of use for us to think of cutting through those bars, or dislodging them; for we should only, on lowering ourselves, be in the courtyard, and no nearer escape than <b>we</b> were <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> the job. It is a good thing to get at least one point off our mind.|$|R
