5|$|Everything ThatHappens WillHappen Today is {{the second}} album made in {{collaboration}} between DavidByrne and BrianEno, released on August 18, 2008, by TodoMundo. The album explores themes of humanity versus technology and optimism in spite of bleak circumstance through the <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> electronic and gospelmusic. Critical reception was largely positive and the album received awards for both the musical content {{as well as the}} packaging and technical production.|$|E
5|$|Historians Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, and geographers Pausanias and Strabo, who {{traveled}} throughout the Greek world and noted {{the stories they}} heard, supplied numerous local myths and legends, often giving little-known alternative versions. Herodotus in particular, searched the various traditions presented him and found the historical or mythological roots in the confrontation between Greece and the East. Herodotus attempted to reconcile origins and the <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> differing cultural concepts.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> {{platinum}} ores display linear grinding and flotation characteristics {{or whether}} non-linear effects occur, i. e. synergistic/antagonistic effects. Ores from four different shafts {{are used in}} the study, i. e. Salene, Waterval UG 2, Paardekraal and Townlands. Laboratory grinding and flotation tests are conducted on <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> the four ores using a statistical simplex lattice mixture design. Grinding results show no evidence that <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ores display non-linear grinding characteristics. Flotation results show significant antagonistic effects in binary <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> the Salene ore with the other ore types. On the other hand, ternary/quaternary <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ores result in synergistic effects. The study concludes that <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> platinum ores display non-linear (non-additive) characteristics when there are large differences in metallurgical properties between the ore types. The study demonstrates that appropriately designed mixtures experiments are an effective way to study the performance <b>of</b> ore <b>blends</b> in the laboratory...|$|R

5|$|Many Dungeons & Dragons {{elements}} {{appear in}} hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role playing {{can be seen}} in improvisational theatre. Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in Glorantha's board games among others. Ultimately, however, Dungeons & Dragons represents a unique <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> these elements.|$|E

5|$|M.I.A.'s debut studio album, Arular, was {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} released in September 2004, but the release was delayed by six months due to problems with the clearance of samples used in the songs. She released two singles and a mixtape in the interim. Although the album had limited commercial success, it was highly regarded by music critics for its <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> genres such as grime, hip hop, ragga and Brazilian baile funk, and for its politicised lyrics. Music magazines in the United States and Europe included it in lists of the best albums of the year, and it was nominated for the Mercury Prize in the United Kingdom.|$|E
30|$|In LP, cotton {{yields of}} all 30 genotypes were {{significantly}} lower than its counterpart in NP (Table  3). Late planting stress reduced SCY, LCY, bolls/P, L%, SI, and LI by 20.4, 23.1, 18.9, 3.3, 4.4, and 11.5, respectively. The largest reductions in LCY due to the stress of LP were observed for the inbreds (33.2 %) and hybrids (47.8 %), whereas the lowest reductions were detected in <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> hybrids (15.1 %). This was reflected in higher sensitively stress indices for inbreds (SSI[*]=[*] 1.1 or susceptible) and hybrids (SSI[*]=[*] 2.0 or susceptible). However, reductions for <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> inbreds (−[*] 12.9 %) superior in LP than NP (SSI[*]=[*]−[*] 0.6 or high stress tolerant) and <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> hybrids (15.1 %) superior in LP than NP (SSI[*]=[*] 0.4 or high stress tolerant). Adding to <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> inbreds revealed <b>blend</b> response (25.2 %), and <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> hybrids revealed heterotic response (52 %) in LP for high potential yielding ability (Table  4). Therefore, heterogeneity populations (<b>blend</b> <b>of</b> inbreds and <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> hybrids) are of much important as {{to be involved in}} breeding program for tolerance to late planting stresses.|$|R
40|$|<b>Blends</b> <b>of</b> in situ {{polymerized}} PBT from cyclic oligomers (c-PBT) and PYB {{were prepared}} with varying compositions and compared with mechanical <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> conventional PBT and PVB. The materials {{were characterized by}} a variety of techniques including DSC. DMTA. DETA, FrIR, NMR and GPC. It was found that the in situ prepared <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> c-PBT/PYB has one glass transition temperature and shows evidence of miscibility. In contrast, the conventional <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> PBT/PYB shows incompatibility after <b>blending.</b> The cause <b>of</b> miscibility in the in situ prepared PBT/PYB blends is thought to be the formation of a graft copolymer. These results show that there are unique possibilities for in situ processing by combining polymerization of cyclic polyester oligomers with blending...|$|R
40|$|Six {{different}} <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> zinc calcium phosphorous oxide ceramics (ZCAP) {{were prepared}} by mixing and calcining powders (ZnO:CaO:P 2 O 5) of weight percent ratio: 50 : 30 : 20, 48 : 32 : 20, 44 : 20 : 26, 40 : 40 : 20, 30 : 40 : 30, and 30 : 30 : 40. ZCAP is a resorbable bioceramic {{and has been}} used to repair bone defects and deliver drugs in a continuous manner. The chemical composition, porosity, and elements released on exposure to buffered Tris HCl were measured for each <b>blend</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP. The products of mixing and thermal reaction were beta-Ca 3 (PO 4) 2, alpha-CaZn 2 (PO 4) 2, and 2 CaO. P 2 O 5. Free calcium and/or zinc oxide was present in several <b>blends.</b> The components <b>of</b> ZCAP and their volume percentages influenced the interconnected porosity of ZCAP bioceramics. The interconnected porosity for all <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP ranged from 35 to 38 %. Pore sizes from these six <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP ranged from less 1 micron to greater than 100 microns. Results of the 12 hour dissolution study showed that more calcium was released than zinc or phosphorous from all <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP. Zinc was released in trace amounts from all <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP. Release of phosphorous from the different <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP was not detected by the procedures used to detect phosphorous in this investigation. These <b>blends</b> <b>of</b> ZCAP have the potential to be used as bone substitutes and probably long term treatment of zinc deficiency in humans...|$|R
5|$|Other {{influences}} {{included the}} composer Niccolò Jommelli and his maître de ballet at Stuttgart, Jean-Georges Noverre. Noverre's Lettres sur la danse (1760) called for dramatic effect over acrobatic ostentation; Noverre was himself {{influenced by the}} operas of Rameau and the acting style of David Garrick. The considerable quantity of ballet in Orfeo ed Euridice {{is thought to be}} due to his influence. Jommelli himself was noted for his <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> all aspects of the production: ballet, staging, and audience.|$|E

Although there were already accomplished African-American sportscasters, his <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> hip hop with sportscasting was unique for television. By 2008, he was a staple in ESPN's programming, and also began on ABC as lead host for their coverage of the NBA.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparison}} of coral strontium/calcium minimums with sea surface temperature maximums, data recorded from , {{time can be}} correlated to coral strontium/calcium and δ18O variations. To confirm accuracy of the annual relationship between Sr/Ca and δ18O variations, a perceptible association to annual coral growth rings confirms the age conversion. Geochronology is established by the <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> Sr/Ca data, growth rings, and stable isotope data. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{is directly related to}} climate fluctuations that influence coral δ18O ratio from local salinity variations associated with the position of the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and can be used for ENSO modeling.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the vins de pays, a classification produced under less stringent regulations than those of an AOC, opened up the Languedoc wine industry to the labeling of varietal wines and the <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah and Chardonnay. Examples include Vin de pays d'Oc, Vin de pays d'Aude, Vin de pays de l'Hérault, and Vin de Pays du Gard. Winemakers such as Guy Anderson, Thierry Boudinaud and E. & J. Gallo Winery capitalized on this new horizon, producing wines like FAT bastard and Red Bicyclette.|$|E
5|$|The state {{responded by}} {{establishing}} the Department of Divinity ("jingikan") in 1869. This government bureaucracy encouraged the segregation of Kami spirits from Buddhist ones, and emphasized the divine lineage of the Emperor from the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu. This action sought to reverse {{what had been}} a <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> Buddhist and Shinto practices in Japan. That department was unsuccessful, and demoted to a Ministry. In 1872, policy for Shrines and other religions was taken over by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry intended to standardize rituals across shrines, and saw some small success, but fell short of its original intent.|$|E
5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender is not out of the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E

5|$|Experimental <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> Western and Malagasy musical {{elements}} {{was occurring}} simultaneously {{among a number}} of northwestern bands and musicians of Jaojoby's generation. Although no single individual can be credited with creating the modern salegy genre, Jaojoby ranks among the earliest originators of the nascent musical style. A desire for greater freedom to write songs and further develop the syncretic modern salegy style led Jaojoby to leave Los Matadores in 1975 for The Players, another regional band that was less well-established but more willing to take risks. The band was managed by a Chinese shopkeeper who provided them with a sound system and generator. The band toured northwestern Madagascar {{for the next four years}} with increasing success, recording two 45rpm singles and performing in Mahajanga, Diego-Suarez, and other towns and villages throughout the region before disbanding in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Michael Kennedy characterises Vaughan Williams's {{music as}} a {{strongly}} individual <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> the modal harmonies familiar from folk‐song with the French influence of Ravel and Debussy. The basis of his work is melody, his rhythms, in Kennedy's view, being unsubtle at times. Vaughan Williams's music {{is often described as}} visionary; Kennedy cites the masque Job and the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. Vaughan Williams's output was prolific and wide-ranging. For the voice he composed songs, operas, and choral works ranging from simpler pieces suitable for amateurs to demanding works for professional choruses. His comparatively few chamber works are not among his better known compositions. Some of his finest works elude conventional categorisation, such as the Serenade to Music (1938) for sixteen solo singers and orchestra; Flos Campi (1925) for solo viola, small orchestra, and small chorus; and his most important chamber work, in Howes's view—not purely instrumental but a song cycle—On Wenlock Edge (1909) with accompaniment for string quartet and piano.|$|E
5|$|Planet Moon Studios' <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> two genres in Giants {{has earned}} the acclaim of reviewers. Game Revolution and GameSpot found the {{simplified}} real-time strategy task of resource gathering in Giants more interesting than tedious, and Troy Dunniway, Microsoft's Head of Game Design in 2002, commented that the real-time strategy elements enhanced the game's shooter aspect rather than making it a hybrid of two genres. Sci Fi Weekly was impressed that both styles of play never interfered with each other, which was complemented by the unique gameplay of each race. The Entertainment Depot, however, found the base building in several missions tedious; they said the player had to rebuild the base several times due to being forced to leave the base defenseless, which allowed the enemy destroy the structures.|$|E

In 2000, 2,977,187 Oklahomans—92.6% of the resident population five years or older—spoke only English at home, a decrease from 95% in 1990. 238,732 Oklahoma residents reported speaking a language other than English in the 2000 census, about 7.4% of the state's population. Spanish is the second-most commonly spoken language in the state, with 141,060 speakers counted in 2000. The two most commonly spoken native North American languages are Cherokee and Choctaw with 10,000 Cherokee speakers living within the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area of eastern Oklahoma, and another 10,000 Choctaw speakers living in the Choctaw Nation directly south of the Cherokees. Cherokee is an official language in the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area and in the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.|$|E

5|$|In 1485 Ivan III {{commissioned}} {{the building of}} the royal residence, Terem Palace, within the Kremlin, with Aloisio da Milano as the architect of the first three floors. He and other Italian architects also contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers. The small banquet hall of the Russian Tsars, called the Palace of Facets because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario, and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as Aleviz Novyi or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the Cathedral of the Archangel, a building remarkable for the successful <b>blending</b> <b>of</b> Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the Metropolitan Peter in Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called octagon-on-tetragon architectural form in the Moscow Baroque of the late 17th century.|$|E
