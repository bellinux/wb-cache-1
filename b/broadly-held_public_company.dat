40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{earnings}} management in <b>public</b> and private <b>companies</b> within the Netherlands. Because <b>public</b> <b>companies</b> are exposed to various capital market pressures and share prices of <b>public</b> <b>companies</b> are influenced by reported earnings, I expect that <b>public</b> <b>companies</b> engage more in earnings management than private companies. This study combines the power of two models frequently used to measure earnings management: (1) The earnings distribution model; and (2) The modified Jones model. By applying both models on my sample of financial data of 77 <b>public</b> <b>companies</b> and 3. 105 private companies between 2000 and 2009, I provide strong evidence of earnings management. The two models show evidence that both <b>public</b> and private <b>companies</b> in the Netherlands engage in earnings management. I’m unable to provide convincing evidence that earnings management is applied more in either <b>public</b> or private <b>companies.</b> The earnings distribution model shows mixed results, although the evidence of earnings management in private companies is stronger. The modified Jones model shows overwhelming evidence of more earnings management in <b>public</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

This report examines (1) concentration in the market for <b>public</b> <b>company</b> audits, (2) the potential for smaller accounting firms' growth to ease market concentration, and (3) proposals that have been offered by others for easing concentration and the barriers facing smaller firms in expanding their market shares. GAO surveyed a random sample of almost 600 large, medium, and small <b>public</b> <b>companies</b> on their experiences with their auditors. GAO also interviewed the four largest accounting firms and surveyed all other U.
