500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino {{has lately}} {{become the focus}} {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right {{around the time of the}} Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the NRA has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or LaPierre, can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. <b>But</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence? ...|$|E

[...] The little area {{in front of the}} basement was heaped with a mixture of mortar, bricks, laths, and shavings from the interior; the brownstone steps to the front door were similarly bestrewn; the doorway showed the half-open, rough pine carpenter's sketch of an unfinished house; the sashless windows of every story showed the activity of workmen within; the clatter of hammers and the hiss of saws came out to them from every opening.|$|E

They tremble when we are in danger, and weep when we die; but the tears are not for us, but for a father wasted, a son's breeding thrown away. They accuse us of treating them as a mere means to our pleasure; but how can so feeble and transient a folly as a man's selfish pleasure enslave a woman as {{the whole purpose of}} Nature embodied in a woman can enslave a man? ...|$|E

A gang. <b>But</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang? What struggle could have taken place--what struggle so violent and so enduring as to have left its 'traces' in all directions--between a weak and defenceless girl and the gang of ruffians imagined? The silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have been over. The victim must have been absolutely passive at their will. You will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against the thicket as the scene, are applicable in chief part, only against it as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual. If we imagine but one violator, we can conceive, and thus only conceive, the struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the 'traces' apparent.|$|E
6000|$|And now we may see, {{it seems}} to me, what the text {{has to do with}} Easter-day. To my mind our Lord is using here the same parable which St. Paul preaches in his famous chapter which we read in the Burial Service. Be not anxious, says our Lord, for your life. Is not the life more than meat? There is an eternal life which depends not on earthly food, but on the will and word of God your Father; and that life in you will conquer death. Behold the birds of the air, which sow not, nor reap, nor gather into barns, to provide against the winter's need. <b>But</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> starve and die? Does not God guide them far away into foreign climes, and feed them there by his providence, and bring them back again in spring, as things alive from the dead? And can he not feed us (if it be his will) with a bread which comes down from heaven, and with every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God? ...|$|E
6000|$|In fact, {{the whole}} belief in [...] "genius" [...] {{seems to me}} rather a mischievous superstition, and if not mischievous always, still always a superstition. From the account of those who talk about it, [...] "genius" [...] {{appears to be the}} {{attribute}} of a sort of very potent and admirable prodigy which God has created out of the common for the astonishment and confusion {{of the rest of us}} poor human beings. <b>But</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> really believe it? Do they mean anything more or less than the Mastery which comes to any man according to his powers and diligence in any direction? If not, why not have an end of the superstition which has caused our race to go on so long writing and reading of the difference between talent and genius? It is within the memory of middle-aged men that the Maelstrom existed in the belief of the geographers, but we now get on perfectly well without it; and why should we still suffer under the notion of [...] "genius" [...] which keeps so many poor little authorlings trembling in question whether they have it, or have only [...] "talent"? ...|$|E

60|$|O the wildness, the frenzy, the madness, that {{possesses}} {{the heart and}} mind of carnal men! they walk according to {{the course of this}} world, according to or after that spirit which is in truth the spirit of the devil, which worketh in the children of disobedience (Eph 2:1-3). <b>But</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> believe that thus it is with them? No, they are, in their own account, as other madmen are, the only ones in the world. Hence they are so taken and tickled with their own frantic notions, and deride all else that dwell in the world. But which is the way to make one that is wild, or a madman, sober? To let him alone will not do it; to give him good words only will not do it; no, he must be tamed; means must be used to tame him. 'He brought down their hearts with labour,' or by continual molestation; as you have it (Psa 107:10-12). He speaketh there of madmen that are kept up in darkness, and bound in afflictions and irons, because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{just these}} first instinctive impulses of the girl-child, {{combined}} with her imitativeness and wonderful precocity, which make her so fascinating. <b>But</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> think? They do, but this first early thinking {{does not make}} them self-conscious as does their later thinking, to the spoiling of their charm. The thinking indeed begins remarkably early. I remember one child, a little five-year-old {{and one of my}} favourites, climbing to my knee one day and exhibiting a strangely grave face. [...] "Doris, what makes you look so serious?" [...] I asked. And after a few moments of silence, during which she appeared to be thinking hard, she startled me by asking me what was the use of living, and other questions which it almost frightened me to hear from those childish innocent lips. Yet I have seen this child grow up to womanhood--a quite commonplace conventional woman, who when she has a child of her own of five would be unspeakably shocked to hear from it the very things she herself spoke at that tender age. And if I were to repeat to her now the words she spoke (the very thought of Byron in his know-that- whatever-thou-hast-been-'Twere-something-better-not-to-be poem) she would not believe it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen. To me, {{believing in}} a {{doctrine}} doesnt mean holding up {{your hand and}} saying, 'Credo.' It means habitually acting {{on the assumption that}} the doctrine is true. Marian thinks it wrong not to go to church; and she will hold up her hand and cry 'Credo' to the immortality of her soul, or to any verse in the New Testament. The shareholders of our concern in the city will do the same. <b>But</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> or she ever act {{on the assumption that the}}y are immortal, or that riches are dross, or that class prejudice is damnable? Never. They dont believe it. You will find that Marian has been thoroughly trained to separate her practice from her religious professions; and if you allude to the inconsistency she will instinctively feel that you are offending against good taste. In short, her 'Credo' doesnt mean faith: it means church-going, which is practised because it is respectable, and is respectable because it is a habit of the upper caste. But church-going is church-going; and business is business, as Marian will soon let you know if you meddle with her business. However, we need not argue about that: we know one another's views and can agree to differ." ...|$|E
