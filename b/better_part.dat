5|$|Torres {{was drafted}} {{out of the}} Ontario Hockey League (OHL), where he played three seasons with the Brampton Battalion. He was a two-time OHL Second Team All-Star during his junior career. Beginning in 2001–02, he turned {{professional}} with the Islanders' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. He spent the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of two seasons in the AHL before the Islanders traded him to the Oilers in 2003. He played five seasons in Edmonton, becoming a full-time NHL player with the club. He recorded career numbers as an Oiler in 2005–06, while also helping them to the Stanley Cup Finals that year. In the 2008 off-season, he was dealt to the Blue Jackets, where he played the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of two seasons. After a brief stint with the Sabres in 2009–10, he signed with the Canucks and played one year for them where they reached the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. Torres then signed with the Phoenix Coyotes {{and then with the}} San Jose Sharks. Internationally, he represented Canada at the 2001 World Junior Championships, winning a bronze medal.|$|E
5|$|Once {{freed from}} running the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of two businesses, and financially independent, Muller went to Germany to study {{geography}} and ethnography. He attended lectures at the universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig before completing his doctorate at the University of Giessen in 1894, summa cum laude. His thesis Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo (Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo) was mainly based on secondary material, {{rather than the}} materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in East Africa. This limited the originality of the study, although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work, and was also published in a commercial version.|$|E

5|$|The Melbourne Storm has {{a strong}} rivalry with Brisbane, built {{in large part on}} the large number of finals games played between the teams, {{including}} one final in each year from 2004 to 2009; the Storm winning all but one of them. The move of Brisbane assistant coach Craig Bellamy to Melbourne has also been attributed to fueling the rivalry, as well as the wide spread of Queensland Origin players across their squads in the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of the past decade.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire conquered Dacia in AD 101 and 106, {{during the}} rule of Trajan, and the Roman {{settlement}} Napoca, established thereafter, is first recorded on a milestone discovered in 1758 {{in the vicinity of}} the city. Trajan's successor Hadrian granted Napoca the status of municipium as municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses. Later, in the 2nd century AD, the city gained the status of a colonia as Colonia Aurelia Napoca. Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia Porolissensis and thus the seat of a procurator. The colonia was evacuated in 274 by the Romans. There are no references to urban settlement on the site for the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of a millennium thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of}} the duty day.|$|E
50|$|Modern life in China's {{urban village}} is vastly {{different}} from the traditional agricultural way of life {{due to the lack}} of farmland.

5|$|Through the {{influence}} of a rise in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few ovarian follicles are stimulated. These follicles, which were present at birth and have been developing for the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of a year in a process known as folliculogenesis, compete with each other for dominance. Under {{the influence}} of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary, or Graafian, follicle, and it contains the ovum.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part of the menu for the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released {{in the summer of}} 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Nazi Party on 30 January 1933 gave German motor companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union, an {{opportunity}} to return to motor racing. Having secured promises of funding shortly after the Nazis' {{rise to power}}, both companies spent the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of 1933 developing their racing projects. Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes racing manager, travelled to the Caracciolas' chalet in Lugano in November {{with a plan to}} sign him for the 1934 Grand Prix season if he was fit. Neubauer challenged Caracciola to walk, and although the driver laughed and smiled while he did so Neubauer was not fooled: Caracciola was not yet fit. Nevertheless, he offered him a contract, provided he prove his fitness in testing at the AVUS track early in the next year. Caracciola agreed and went to Stuttgart to sign the contract. The trip wore him out so much he spent much of his time lying on his hotel bed recuperating.|$|E

5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities, Napoleon (proclaimed Emperor in 1804) planned an invasion of England, spending the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> {{of the next two}} years (1803–05) on this objective. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement {{led to the creation of}} the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France and neutralising the threat of invasion. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and by April 1805, the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Alarmed by Napoleon's consolidation of northern Italy into a kingdom under his rule, and keen on revenge for having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, Austria would join the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1950, Snetkov was {{assistant}} {{chief of staff}} for operations of a regiment, and then entered the Military Academy of the Armored Forces, graduating in 1953. Until 1965, he successively served as a regimental chief of staff, chief of a division's operations staff department, and commander of a tank regiment. Between 1965 and 1966 Snetkov was chief of staff of a division, and in 1968 he graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff. After graduating, Snetkov took command of a tank division in the Kiev Military District, and in May 1971 transferred to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) as chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 3rd Shock Army. He was promoted to major general in 1972, and would serve in the GSFG for the <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of the decade. He was appointed commander of the 1st Guards Tank Army in August 1973, after which he was promoted to lieutenant general in 1974, and became First Deputy Commander in July 1975. He left East Germany to command the Siberian Military District in January 1979, and was promoted to colonel general that year, moving westwards again to lead the Leningrad Military District in November 1981. On 7 May 1986, Snetkov was promoted to army general.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} link systems {{together}} {{such that they}} behave as predicted once they {{interact with each other}} is an essential requirement for the forward-engineering of robust synthetic biological circuits. Unfortunately, because of context-dependencies, parts and functional modules often behave unpredictably once interacting in the cellular environment. This paper reviews recent advances toward establishing a rigorous engineering framework for insulating parts and modules from their context to improve modularity. Overall, a synergy between engineering <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> and higher-level circuit design will be important to resolve the problem of context-dependence...|$|R
