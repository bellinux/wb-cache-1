25|$|Pemphigus is an {{uncommon}} autoimmune skin disease. The {{most common form}} in dogs is pemphigus foliaceus, which manifests as erosions and crusting of the skin and mucocutaneous junctions. Pemphigus vulgaris is more rare and manifests as blister-like lesions in the mouth and at mucocutaneous junctions. <b>Bullous</b> <b>pemphigoid</b> is most commonly seen in Dobermanns and Collies and appears as a scald-like lesion of the groin.|$|E
25|$|On March 18, 2014, Flaherty {{announced}} that he was resigning as Minister of Finance in order to return to the private sector. While he had openly discussed health challenges associated with managing <b>bullous</b> <b>pemphigoid,</b> including taking prescription steroids, he said the decision was reached after many months of consultation with his family and that his health was not a factor in his decision. Flaherty continued sitting in the House of Commons as an MP until his death three weeks later.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} tumor causes circulating and tissue-bound {{antibodies to}} direct themselves against antigens in the plakin family, which {{are involved in}} the intracellular attachment structures in various levels of the skin/respiratory tract/membranes (keeping skin tissue together throughout the body). The number of target antigens varies on a case by case basis. The variability is likely what accounts for the different presentations of PNP. Through immunoprecipitation, target antigens have been found to include desmoglein-3, desmoglein-1, envoplakin, periplakin, desmoplakin 1, desmoplakin 2, and <b>bullous</b> <b>pemphigoid</b> antigen I.|$|E
500|$|Bruegel {{painted with}} the {{empirical}} objectivity of the Renaissance. [...] In earlier paintings the blind were typically depicted with eyes closed. Here, Bruegel gives each man a different ocular affliction, all painted with a realism that allowed identification of their conditions by later experts, {{though there is}} still some diagnostic disagreement. [...] French anatomical pathologist Jean-Martin Charcot and anatomical artist Paul Richer published an early account, [...] ("The deformed and sick in art", 1889), and French pathologist Tony-Michel Torrillhon followed with more research on Bruegel's figures in 1957. [...] The first man's eyes are not visible; the second has had his eyes removed, along with the eyelids: the third suffers from corneal leukoma; the fourth atrophy of the globe; the fifth is either blind with no light perception, or photophobic; and the sixth has pemphigus or <b>bullous</b> <b>pemphigoid.</b> [...] Charcot and Richer noted Bruegel's accuracy in portraying the blind men facing not forward but with their faces raised in the air, as {{they would have had to}} rely on their senses of smell and hearing.|$|E

50|$|Esophageal webs are {{associated}} with bullous diseases (such as epidermolysis bullosa, pemphigus, and <b>bullous</b> <b>pemphigoid),</b> with graft versus host disease involving the esophagus, and with celiac disease.|$|E
50|$|The bullae {{are formed}} by an immune reaction, {{initiated}} by the formation of IgG autoantibodies targeting Dystonin, also called <b>Bullous</b> <b>Pemphigoid</b> Antigen 1, and/or type XVII collagen, also called <b>Bullous</b> <b>Pemphigoid</b> Antigen 2, which is a component of hemidesmosomes. A different form of dystonin is associated with neuropathy. Following antibody targeting, a cascade of immunomodulators results in a variable surge of immune cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils coming to the affected area. Unclear events subsequently result in a separation along the dermoepidermal junction and eventually stretch bullae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bullous</b> <b>pemphigoid</b> may be self-resolving in {{a period}} ranging from several months to many years even without treatment. Poor general health related to old age is {{associated}} with a poorer prognosis.|$|E

5000|$|Lymphoma of {{the skin}} is an {{uncommon}} occurrence.

5000|$|Pemphigus foliaceus is {{the most}} common {{autoimmune}} disease of the dog. Blisters in the epidermis rapidly break to form crusts and erosions most often affecting the face and ears initially, but in some cases spreading to include the whole body. The pawpads can be affected causing marked hyperkeratosis (thickening of the pads with scale). Other autoimmune diseases include <b>bullous</b> <b>pemphigoid</b> and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with other}} NSAIDs, {{ibuprofen}} {{has been associated}} with the onset of <b>bullous</b> <b>pemphigoid</b> or pemphigoid-like blistering. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen has been reported to be a photosensitising agent, but it is considered a weak photosensitising agent compared to other members of the 2-arylpropionic acid class. Like other NSAIDs, ibuprofen is an extremely rare cause of the autoimmune disease Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Ibuprofen is also an extremely rare cause of Lyell's Syndrome (toxic epidermal necrolysis).|$|E
