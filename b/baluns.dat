5000|$|A balun [...] is an {{electrical}} device that converts between a balanced signal (two signals working {{against each other}} where ground is irrelevant) and an unbalanced signal (a single signal working against ground or pseudo-ground).

Sometimes, in the case of transformer <b>baluns,</b> they use magnetic coupling but need not do so. Common-mode chokes are also used as <b>baluns</b> and work by eliminating, rather than ignoring, common mode signals.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A novel compact {{model for}} a five-port {{transformer}} <b>balun</b> is proposed for the efficient circuit design of hybrid <b>balun.</b> Compared to the conventional model, the proposed model provides much faster computation time and more reasonable values for the extracted parameters. The hybrid <b>balun,</b> realized in 0. 18 µm CMOS, achieves 2. 8 dB higher gain and 1. 9 dB lower noise figure than its passive counterpart only at a current consumption of 0. 67 mA from 1. 2 V supply. By employing the hybrid <b>balun,</b> a differential zero-IF receiver is designed in 0. 18 µm CMOS for IEEE 802. 15. 4 ZigBee applications. It is composed of a differential cascode LNA, passive mixers, and active RC filters. Comparative investigations on the three receiver designs, each employing the hybrid <b>balun,</b> a simple transformer <b>balun,</b> and an ideal <b>balun,</b> clearly demonstrate {{the advantages of the}} hybrid <b>balun</b> in fully differential CMOS RF receivers.

The location of the step transition along the axis of the <b>balun</b> and the diameter change are two dimensional parameters that are not present in the conventional split coaxial <b>balun.</b> These additional parameters, together with the double slot width, provide more flexibility to design the <b>balun</b> for better impedance matching. The effects of the three dimensional parameters on the input impedance seen at the (unbalanced) coaxial line side of the <b>balun</b> are investigated when it is terminated with specific lumped impedance at its (balanced) split side.

50|$|To {{convert a}} signal from {{balanced}} to unbalanced requires a balun.

The <b>balun</b> was modeled using two commercial electromagnetic simulators: Momentum and HFSS. Using these numerical solvers, design information such as the design of CPW bridges, aspect ratio of the double-y <b>balun,</b> and stub lengths of the CPW and CPS open and short stubs were studied. A dipole, along with the outer conductor of a coaxial line was modeled in NEC. The model was used to study the currents along the arms and feedline of balanced and unbalanced dipoles. Normalized amplitude patterns were generated along the azimuth and elevation planes for balanced and unbalanced dipoles. These patterns were used later for comparison with measured patterns. Experimental work was conducted to measure {{the performance of a}} double-y <b>balun</b> designed to feed a resistively loaded V-dipole. The performance of the <b>balun</b> was investigated via VSWR, insertion loss, and antenna pattern measurements.
