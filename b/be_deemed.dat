5|$|Certain astronomical objects {{known as}} spiral nebulae such as M31 {{would later be}} {{recognized}} as conglomerations of stars when the true distance to these objects began to be discovered, and they would <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> island universes. However, the word Universe was later understood to mean the entirety of existence, so this expression fell into disuse and the objects instead became known as galaxies.|$|E

An Order in Council was made under this section on 19 March 1908, which transferred all existing units of the Yeomanry and Volunteers, with a small number of exceptions.|$|E
5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice).

It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{judicial}} system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use {{during and after the}} Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.|$|E
5|$|The Skanda Purana narrates that Bhikshatana-Shiva {{appears on}} another {{occasion}} as a naked, fierce Kapali beggar. Once, at a sacrifice hosted by Brahma, Bhikshatana appears and begs for food. The Brahmins performing the sacrifice try to drive him away, considering a hungry beggar unfit for sacrificial rites. Bhikshatana throws his skull begging-bowl {{on the ground and}} the Brahmins throw it out, but another skull bowl appears in its place. Consequently, hundreds of skulls appear, polluting the sacrifice, which compels Brahma to promise Shiva that no sacrifice will <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> complete without an invocation to him, Kapaleshvara—the Lord of the skulls.|$|E

5|$|The Special Reserve {{was to be}} {{organised}} by regulations issued {{under the}} Reserve Forces Act 1882, forming regiments and battalions either of existing regular corps or of newly created ones.

5|$|The author {{discusses}} influential legal cases {{including a}} judgment involving Compuserve, where {{the court ruled}} that the Internet service provider should <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> similar to a bookstore avoiding liability for publishing potentially offensive speech.

United States Secret Service which followed a raid by the United States Secret Service in 1990 on Steve Jackson Games and his involvement influencing the media relating to the incident. He cites the LaMacchia case, which dealt with charges of copyright infringement of software subsequently dismissed. An incident at Santa Rosa Junior College which involved issues of free speech and gender discrimination is discussed and analyzed in the book.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in the domain name would have to <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E

5|$|His wife {{of nearly}} half a century, Elizabeth, to whom {{he had not been}} faithful, died in 1971. Brundage had once jested that his {{ambition}} was to wed a German princess. In June 1973, this came to pass when he married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss (1936–2003), daughter of HeinrichXXXVII, Prince of Reuss-Köstritz. Von Reuss had worked as an interpreter during the Munich Games; she stated that she had met Brundage in 1955, when she was 19. When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year difference in their ages, Brundage responded that he was young for his age and she mature for hers, and instead of 85 years to 37, it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage's death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage's fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> investments.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} such an area became {{apparent}} when in 1989, after repeated attacks by haredim, activists belonging to a group called Women of the Wall petitioned to secure the right of women to pray at the wall without restrictions. In a 2003 directive, Israel's Supreme Court disallowed any women from reading publicly from the Torah or wearing traditional prayer shawls at the plaza itself, but instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson's Arch to host such events. The site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall. In May 2013 a judge ruled that the 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the wall should not <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> as disturbing the public order.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Flossie yielded stormy {{weather to}} Hawaii in late July2013. The sixth {{tropical}} cyclone and named storm {{of the annual}} hurricane season, Flossie originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on July9. Tracking westward across the Atlantic with little development, it passed over Central America and into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July18, where favorable environmental conditions promoted steady organization. By 0600UTC on July25, the wave acquired enough organization to <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> a tropical depression; it intensified into a tropical storm six hours later. Continuing westward, Flossie attained peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) on July27 before entering the central Pacific Ocean. There, unfavorable upper-level winds established a weakening trend; on July30, Flossie weakened to a tropical depression, and by 1200UTC that same day, the storm degenerated into a remnant low, northeast of Kauai.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa and moved westward across the Atlantic before entering the eastern Pacific on October8. Despite strong easterly wind shear, the system acquired enough organization to <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> a tropical depression at 0000UTC on October15. Within a broad cyclonic gyre, the system moved erratically, first drifting south then east-northeast and eventually northwest. Early on October16, the system briefly intensified into a tropical storm as a convective band wrapped around the circulation, but continued strong shear caused associated convection to dissipate and the system weakened to a tropical depression by 1800UTC. After intensifying back to a tropical storm the following day, a brief reprieve in harsh upper-level winds allowed Kiko to reach its peak intensity with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 991mb (hPa; 29.27inHg). An increase in southerly shear and entrance into a more stable airmass caused the system to weaken to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on October23; the system degenerated into a remnant low 24 hours later. The remnant low tracked west before turning north and eventually dissipated early on October27.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Korean War, the Korean Peninsula was split by an American-backed {{government}} at the south and a Soviet-backed opposing government at the north. Divided by the 38th Parallel, both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to maintain the division until a mutual decision was made {{about the future of the}} peninsula. On 25 June 1950, North Korean troops crossed the parallel and attacked several key South Korean targets. As the United States prepared military assistance with the South Koreans, the Soviet Union also helped the North Koreans by training pilots and providing MiG-15 aircraft. Jabara arrived in Korea on 13 December 1950 with the 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The squadron was the first F-86 Sabre unit deployed to the Fifth Air Force to counter the threat by the Soviet MiG-15s. By 2 January 1951, he had flown five combat missions in F-86s and had damaged one MiG-15 Korean jet fighter in air combat. Jabara achieved his first confirmed victory on 3 April 1951 when 12 F-86 Sabres took on 12 MiG-15s in MiG Alley, a region in northwestern North Korea. He was credited with another on 10 April, a third on 12 April, and a fourth on 22 April. Eager to get his fifth victory to <b>be</b> <b>deemed</b> a flying ace, Jabara voluntarily transferred to the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron when the 334th was rotated back to the United States.|$|E
