5|$|In agriculture, the {{increased}} usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to <b>be</b> <b>spun.</b> In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily {{life was the}} use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill, allowing {{the upper part of the}} windmill to <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> around to face the direction from which the wind was blowing. The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland is {{also noted}} {{in the fields of}} {{biotechnology}} and fuel cell research, led by Case Western Reserve University, the Cleveland Clinic, and University Hospitals of Cleveland. Cleveland is among the top recipients of investment for biotech start-ups and research. Case Western Reserve, the Clinic, and University Hospitals have recently announced plans to build a large biotechnology research center and incubator {{on the site of the}} former Mount Sinai Hospital, creating a research campus to stimulate biotech startup companies that can <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> off from research conducted in the city.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E

50|$|Once the top <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> on its stem, it {{does not}} spin in the {{opposite}} direction to which its <b>spin</b> <b>was</b> initiated. For example, if the top <b>was</b> <b>spun</b> clockwise, as soon as it is on its stem, it will <b>be</b> <b>spinning</b> clockwise viewed from above. This constant <b>spin</b> direction <b>is</b> due to conservation of angular momentum.|$|R
50|$|Rock Mill <b>was</b> {{used for}} <b>spinning</b> finer counts of Egyptian cotton, for twists. By 1911 it <b>was</b> <b>spinning</b> both Egyptian and American, and in 1951 it <b>was</b> <b>spinning</b> 30's and 40's.|$|R
5|$|Water-power {{was first}} {{introduced}} to England by John Lombe at his silk mill in Derby in 1719, but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water-power {{to the process of}} producing cotton in the 1770s. His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> continuously, meaning it could be produced by unskilled workers. Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright's first mill, with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then-new workforce; this system of production and workers' housing was copied throughout the valley. To ensure the presence of a labour force, it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers. Thus, new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills– sometimes developing a pre-existing community– with their own amenities such as schools, chapels, and markets. Most of the housing still exists and is still in use. Along with the transport infrastructure form part of the site. A transport infrastructure was built to open new markets for the mills' produce.|$|E
25|$|Despite health {{problems}} {{in his later}} years, he continued acting. In 1994, shortly before his death, Peppard completed a pilot with Tracy Nelson for a new series called The P.I. It aired as an episode of Matlock and was to <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> off into a new television series, with Peppard playing an aging detective and Nelson his daughter/sidekick.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} division, TransÉnergie, was {{the first}} to <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> off in 1997, in response to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's publication of Order 888. The restructuring was completed in the year 2000 with the adoption of Bill 116, which amended the Act respecting the Régie de l'énergie, to enact the functional separation of Hydro-Québec's various business units.|$|E
50|$|Texas Mill <b>was</b> {{used for}} <b>spinning</b> medium counts of American cotton. In 1951 it <b>was</b> <b>spinning</b> high-class combed and carded hosiery yarns from 20's to 40's count. In 1971 it <b>was</b> <b>spinning</b> {{artificial}} fibres.|$|R

25|$|Wild silk, cocoons {{collected}} from the wild after the insect had eaten its way out, was also known; being of shorter smaller lengths, its fibres had to <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> into somewhat thicker yarn than the cultivated variety. A rare luxury cloth with a beautiful golden sheen, known as sea silk, was made from the long silky filaments or byssus produced by Pinna nobilis, a large Mediterranean clam.|$|E
25|$|With Igor Novikov and Don Page he {{developed}} the general relativistic theory of thin accretion disks around black holes, and using this theory he deduced that with a doubling of its mass by such accretion a black hole will <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> up to 0.998 of the maximum spin allowed by general relativity, but not any farther. This is probably the maximum black-hole spin allowed in nature.|$|E

25|$|Autogyros {{are also}} known as gyroplanes or gyrocopters. The rotor is {{unpowered}} and rotates freely in the airflow as the craft travels forward, so the craft needs a conventional powerplant to provide thrust. An autogyro is not intrinsically capable of VTOL: for VTO the rotor must <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> up to speed by an auxiliary drive, and vertical landing requires precise control of rotor momentum and pitch.|$|E
25|$|Wool may <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> {{before or}} after washing, {{although}} excessive amounts of lanolin may make spinning difficult, especially when using a drop-spindle. Careless washing may cause felting. When done prior to spinning, this often leads to unusable wool fibre. In washing wool the key thing to avoid is too much agitation and fast temperature changes from hot to cold. Generally, washing is done lock by lock in warm water with dish-soap.|$|E
25|$|Hemp, or {{industrial}} hemp (from Old English hænep), {{typically found}} in the northern hemisphere, is a variety of the Cannabis sativa plant species that is grown specifically for the industrial uses of its derived products. It {{is one of the}} fastest growing plants and was one of the first plants to <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> into usable fiber 10,000 years ago. It can be refined into a variety of commercial items including paper, textiles, clothing, biodegradable plastics, paint, insulation, biofuel, food, and animal feed.|$|E

50|$|Long draw <b>is</b> the <b>spinning</b> {{technique}} {{used to create}} woolen yarns. It <b>is</b> <b>spun</b> from carded rolags. It <b>is</b> generally <b>spun</b> from shorter stapled fibers. Long draw <b>spun</b> yarns <b>are</b> light, lofty, stretchy, soft, and full of air, thus they are good insulators, and make good knitting yarns.|$|R
25|$|On June 25, 2014, Barnes & Noble {{announced}} that the Nook division business would <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> off into an independent company. On December 4, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced an end to its partnership with Microsoft connected to Nook and that it intended to complete the separation of Nook {{by the end of}} the first quarter of 2015. However, in February 2015, B decided to keep the Nook division for the short term future. In April 2016, B outsourced most Nook technical services to be managed by an Indian company Bahwan CyberTek.|$|E
25|$|Food Machinery Corporation (FMC) {{was founded}} in nearby Los Gatos as the Bean Spray Pump Company in 1884 and moved to San Jose in 1903. In 1941 the company {{received}} an order from the United States War Department for one thousand LVTs, bringing defense contracts to San Jose for the first time. After World War II, FMC continued as a defense contractor, with the San Jose facilities designing and manufacturing military platforms such as the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and various subsystems of the M1 Abrams. FMC's military business would later <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> off into United Defense.|$|E
25|$|Chrysotile {{has been}} used {{more than any other}} type and {{accounts}} for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America. Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in joint compound and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.|$|E

25|$|Desert {{tribes and}} Mongolian nomads use camel hair for tents, yurts, clothing, bedding and accessories. Camels have outer guard hairs and soft inner down, and the fibers are sorted by color {{and age of}} the animal. The guard hairs can be felted for use as {{waterproof}} coats for the herdsmen, while the softer hair is used for premium goods. The fiber can <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> for use in weaving or made into yarns for hand knitting or crochet. Pure camel hair is recorded as being used for western garments from the 17th century onwards, and from the 19th century a mixture of wool and camel hair was used.|$|E
25|$|Cotton {{forms the}} {{foundation}} of warps and wefts {{of the majority of}} modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for {{the foundation of}} a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet. Chemically treated (mercerised) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Several special filming {{techniques}} were devised to obtain {{some of the}} footage of rare and elusive animals. One cameraman spent hundreds of hours waiting for the fleeting moment when a rare frog, which incubates its young in its mouth, finally spat them out. Another built a replica of a mole rat burrow in a horizontally mounted wheel, so that as the mole rat ran along the tunnel, the wheel could <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> to keep the animal adjacent to the camera. To illustrate the motion of bats' wings in flight, a slow motion sequence was filmed in a wind tunnel. The series {{was also the first}} to include footage of a live (although dying) coelacanth.|$|E
