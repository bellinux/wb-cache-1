5|$|Agriculture in Wales {{is heavily}} subsidised by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy with farmers getting annual {{payments}} {{for the area}} they farm. A new scheme was announced in 2014; after a transitional period lasting until 2019, lowland farms will receive almost £200 per hectare while farms in disadvantaged areas will receive £166. The total payment for Wales between 2014 and 2020 will be £1,870 million, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> this (15%) {{will be used for}} rural development projects.|$|E

5|$|Although textile-related {{engineering}} declined {{with the}} processing industry, {{leading to the}} demise of both Stotts and Platts, other engineering firms existed, notably electrical and later electronic engineers Ferranti in 1896.

Part of the original Hollinwood site was operated by Siemens Metering and Semiconductor divisions. The remainder of the site is occupied by Mirror Colour Print Ltd; the printing division of the Trinity Mirror group, which prints and distributes thirty-six major newspapers, and employs five hundred staff.|$|E
5|$|Cheng Yan Yan Wendy (born Cheng Yan Yan; 28 April 1984), {{better known}} by her {{pseudonym}} Xiaxue, is a Singaporean blogger and online television personality who writes about her life, fashion and local {{issues in a}} provocative style. Her main blog, which attracts about 50,000 readers daily, has won prestigious blog awards and earned her sponsorship deals, as well as stints as a columnist and TV show host, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her posts have sparked national controversies. She is married to American engineer Mike Sayre and they have one child.|$|E
5|$|DisCo built {{a station}} at Lemington, {{in the western}} {{outskirts}} of the city, to provide electricity for a tram line which ran through their supply area, from the City Centre to Throckley. The station was sited amid the derelict buildings of the Tyne Iron Company's ironworks. They had opened in 1797 and closed in 1886. The works were largely demolished, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the ironworks' buildings and chimneys still stood unused, and the power station was built amongst them. DisCo opened Lemington Power Station in 1903.|$|E

5|$|In the manga series Pokémon Adventures, Team Rocket creates Mewtwo, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his DNA {{is placed}} {{inside of the}} Gym leader Blaine. Because of the DNA that they share, the two are unable to be {{separated}} for very long without becoming ill. Later, another Pokémon, Entei is able to break the bond between the two by removing the DNA in Blaine's arm, at which point Mewtwo leaves. It eventually helps the main character of the series, Red, fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys.|$|E
5|$|Insecure {{attachment}} {{styles in}} toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person.

These children {{are more likely to have}} later social problems with peers and teachers, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{there are}} 126 {{speaking}} {{parts in the}} film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming. Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance. Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie. Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the Schindlerjuden and fly them in to film the scene.|$|E

It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} {{situation}} reigned in Russia. As early as April 1918, some Romanian volunteer groups joined {{up with the}} Bolshevik Red Army, taking their orders from Commissar Béla Kun, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their members continued to serve the nationalist cause. In June 1918, a number of Romanian prisoners who had {{signed up for the}} Volunteer Corps were cut off from Romania by the Russian Civil War and left to fend for themselves. Some crossed into Bolshevik Russia hoping to be repatriated together with the Romanian consulate, while others took to areas controlled by the White movement, reaching Irkutsk; still others escaped through northern routes into Sweden. The various groups were monitored by French public opinion, and plans were drafted to merge them into the Romanian Legion on the Western Front, or even to have them open up a new Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts of marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of marijuana outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, {{and the potential for}} state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical use of marijuana has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E
