30|$|The missing {{database}} or {{the high}} {{complexity of the}} matter (also due to the overlapping of various emission sources and sinks) does not excuse FAO from clearly displaying this complexity rather than omitting important <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios.</b> It would rather be correct to desist from estimating specific emission values (or emission intensities, as the FAO report terms them) than to suppress weighty <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios,</b> because they are complex and difficult to quantify. Moreover, certain pastoral ecosystems may represent a sink and not a source for methane (Gocher 2009, quoting Mark Adams, University of Sydney).

40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} quantifies {{the changes}} in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from dairy farms, caused by anaerobically digesting (AD) cattle manure. As this is a novel quantifiable synthesis of the literature, a database of GHG emissions from dairy farms is created. Each case in the database consists of a baseline (reference with no AD system) and an AD scenario. To enable inter-study comparison, emissions are normalised by calculating relative changes (RCs). The distributions of RCs are reported by specific GHGs, and operation units. Non-parametric statistical tests are applied to the RCs {{in order to identify}} statistical di↵erence of AD with respect to <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios</b> (Wilcoxon rank test), correlations (Spearman test) and best estimation for changes in emissions (Kernel density distribution estimator). From 749 studies identified, 30 papers yield 89 independent cases. The median reductions in emissions from the <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios,</b> according to operation units are: - 71. 2 % (n. s.) for storage, - 76. 7 % for field application of slurries, - 100. 7 % for o↵set of energy from fossil fuel and - 91. 6 % (n. s.) for o↵set of inorganic fertilisers.

25|$|CBO {{estimated}} {{under the}} <b>baseline</b> <b>scenario</b> that the U.S. debt {{held by the}} public would increase approximately $8.5 trillion {{between the end of}} 2014 and 2024. Under a $2 trillion deficit reduction scenario during that first decade, federal debt held by the public in 2039 would stand at 75 percent of GDP, only slightly above the value of 72 percent at the end of 2013. Under a $4 trillion deficit reduction scenario for that decade, federal debt held by the public would fall to 42 percent of GDP in 2039. By comparison, such debt was 35 percent of GDP in 2007 and has averaged 39 percent of GDP during the past 40 years.|$|E
25|$|The sooner {{austerity}} {{steps are}} taken (e.g., raising revenues or reducing spending {{or a combination}} of both), the smaller those changes can be to maintain or reduce the debt level projected in 2039. For example, under the <b>baseline</b> <b>scenario,</b> stabilizing the ratio of debt to GDP at 74% (its current level) would require non-interest spending cuts and/or tax hikes of 1.2% of GDP annually if implemented in 2015, or 1.5% of GDP annually if begun in 2020. To bring the debt-to-GDP ratio back to its 40-year average of 39%, the austerity measures required would be 2.6% GDP if begun in 2015 and 3.2% GDP if begun in 2020. Over the 1974 to 2013 period, federal spending averaged 20.5% GDP and revenue 17.4% GDP. For scale, a 2% GDP reduction in spending would be approximately a 10% spending cut.|$|E

Under that scenario, deficits excluding interest payments would be about $2 trillion larger over the first decade than those under the baseline; subsequently, such deficits would be larger than those under the extended baseline by rapidly increasing amounts, doubling as a percentage of GDP in less than 10 years. CBO projects that real GNP in 2039 would be about 5 percent lower under the extended alternative fiscal scenario than under the extended baseline with economic feedback, and that interest rates would be about three-quarters of a percentage point higher.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} long-term {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) emissions and their mitigation {{in a family}} of high economic and energy demand growth scenarios in which technological change unfolds in alternative "path dependent" directions. Four variants of this family are developed and used as <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios,</b> for which alternative policy cases leading to a stabilization of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations at 450, 550, 650, and 750 ppmv {{by the end of the}} 21 st century are examined.

We illustrate the sensitivity of projected future GHG emission levels and resulting global climate change to alternative developments in energy systems technologies. We conclude that uncertainties in technological change are as important for determining future GHG emissions as uncertainties in long-term demographic and economic developments. We also illustrate that differences in costs between alternative <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios</b> of technological change may be larger than the cost differences of reaching alternative environmental (climate change stabilization) targets. Under our assumptions of high economic and energy demand growth, even in scenarios favoring fossil fuels, the long-term energy portfolio needs to include improvements in zero-carbon technologies and carbon-related technologies and infrastructures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and assess the {{profitability}} of four highbush blueberry farming systems in the south: organic field production, conventional field production, organic high tunnel production and conventional high tunnel production. Four <b>baseline</b> budget <b>scenarios,</b> one for each system, are developed for a 15 year production period. The results suggest that under expected production and price conditions for Northwest Arkansas, while all four production systems generated positive present value of net returns, the conventional field production produced the highest present value of net returns across the 15 years. The breakeven years of production were 7 and 8 for the conventional field system and organic field system, respectively. Because high tunnel production systems are not expected to increase yields over that of the field systems, the present value of net returns to these high tunnel systems were lower than those from their field production counterparts and these systems broke even much later, in year 12. Sensitivity analyses were conducted around the level of yields, input prices, output prices and pesticide application rates used in the <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Of the ranges of values examined for the sensitivity analyses, changes in yields seemed to have the greatest impact on the changes in present values of net returns. More study is needed to determine whether the range of values examined are representative of those faced by Arkansas producers.

40|$|Measuring {{human capital}} {{has been a}} {{significant}} challenge for economists because the main variable of interest is intangible and not directly observable. In the Middle Eastern and Northern African region the task is further complicated by the general scarcity of comparable and reliable data. This study overcomes these challenges by relying on a unique international survey that covers most of the region and by deriving a market-based measure that uses returns to education and various labour market factors as guidance. The results show that private returns to schooling are relatively low in most southern Mediterranean countries (SMC). Israel and Turkey are clear outliers, surpassing even the EU-MED averages. In Algeria and Jordan, the returns are almost flat, implying that earnings do not respond significantly to education levels. Despite high attainment levels, Greece, Spain and Portugal also perform badly; only marginally surpassing some of the bottom-ranked SMC, providing evidence of problems in absorption capacity. The <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios</b> for 2030 show substantial sensitivity to current estimates on returns to education. In particular, improving attainment levels can produce measurable gains in the future only when the returns to education are already high. Such is the case for Egypt, Morocco and Turkey, which substantially improve their human capital stocks under the <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios,</b> surpassing several EU-MED countries with little or no room for improvement...|$|R
40|$|Almost all {{macroeconomic}} indicators change upon shocks {{influenced by the}} global financial crisis that has also spilled over to the public sector, seriously threatening fiscal sustainability. The aim {{of this paper is}} to estimate public debt sustainability in the crisis and post-crisis period from 2011 to 2015. For estimation of public debt movements, decomposition of basic flows that lead to its change will be considered, and each one will be separately modeled dynamically. It is shown that in the period up to 2015 the share of public debt in GDP in optimistic scenarios does not exceed the margin of 60 %, prescribed by the Maastricht criteria. In <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios</b> we get two-sided results, so in the first model public debt slightly exceeds the limit of 60 % with a share of 62. 6 % of GDP in 2015, while in all other <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios</b> public debt stays at the level of 45. 8, or 52. 5 % of GDP. Therefore, we conclude that in the medium-term period up to 2015 there is a real danger of public debt increasing over its acceptable limit and the major threats lie in contingent liabilities and exchange rate shocks, while minor vulnerability can be observed in case of real GDP growth and nominal interest rate shocks. public debt, fiscal sustainability, dynamic models, deficit, stock-flow adjustment, the Croatian economy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} secondary aerosol generation {{potential of}} biofuel {{use in the}} energy sector from the photochemical interactions of precursor gases on a life cycle basis. The paper {{is divided into two}} parts—first, employing life cycle analysis (LCA) to evaluate the extent of the problem for a typical biofuel based electricity production system using five baseline scenarios; second, proposing adequate mitigation options to minimise the secondary aerosol generation potential on a life cycle basis. The <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios</b> cover representative technologies for 2010 utilising energy crop (miscanthus), short rotation coppiced chips and residual/waste wood in different proportions. The proposed mitigation options include three approaches—biomass gasification prior to combustion, delaying the harvest of biomass, and increasing the geographical distance between the biomass plant and the harvest site (by importing the biofuels). Preliminary results indicate that the <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios</b> (assuming all the biomass is sourced locally) bear significant secondary aerosol formation potential on a life cycle basis from photochemical neutralisation of acidic emissions (hydrogen chloride and sulphur dioxide) with ammonia. Our results suggest that gasification of miscanthus biomass would provide the best option by minimising the acidic emissions from the combustion plant whereas the other two options of delaying the harvest or importing biofuels from elsewhere would only lead to marginal reduction in the life cycle aerosol loadings of the system...|$|R

In the EU project ROUTES several case studies have been performed in order to evaluate innovative wastewater and sludge treatment <b>scenarios</b> against <b>baseline</b> <b>scenarios,</b> {{in order to understand}} whether the new ones perform better or worse from an environmental systems perspective and identify the hot spots in the studied systems from where the main environmental pressure originates.

This article discusses the relevance of the obtained results and identifies further assessments needed in order to provide a solid result.
