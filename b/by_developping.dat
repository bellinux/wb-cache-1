We give a {{definition}} of categorical models for the multiplicative fragment of non-commutative logic, which we call entropic categories. We demonstrate the soundness and completeness of our axiomatization with respect to cut-elimination. We then focus on several methods of building entropic categories. The first method is constructed via {{the notion of a}} partial bimonoid acting on a cocomplete category. We also explore an entropic version of the Chu construction, and apply it in this setting. It has recently been demonstrated that Hopf algebras provide an excellent framework for modelling a number of variants of multiplicative linear logic, such as commutative, braided and cyclic. We extend these ideas to the entropic setting <b>by</b> <b>developping</b> a new type of Hopf algebra, which we call entropic Hopf algebras. We show that the category of modules over an entropic Hopf algebra is an entropic category. Several examples are discussed, based first on the notion of a bigroup...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} twofold. In a first part, we extend the {{classical}} differential calculus to continuous non differentiable functions <b>by</b> <b>developping</b> {{the notion of}} scale calculus. The scale calculus {{is based on a}} new approach of continuous non differentiable functions by constructing a one parameter family of differentiable functions f(t, ǫ) such that f(t, ǫ) → f(t) when ǫ goes to zero. This lead to several new notions as representation, fractal functions and ǫ-differentiability. The basic objets of the scale calculus are left and right quantum operators and the scale operator which generalize the classical derivative. We then discuss some algebraic properties of these operators. We define a natural bialgebra, called quantum bialgebra, associated to them. Finally, we discuss a convenient geometric object associated to our study. In a second part, we define a first quantization procedure of classical mechanics following the scale relativity theory developped by Nottale. We obtain a non linear Schrödinger equation via the classical Newton’s equation of dynamics using the scale operator. Under special assumptions we recover the classical Schrödinger equation and we discuss the relevance of thes...|$|E

From a theoretical model with heterogenous downstream firms, we show that falling input tariffs induces a reallocation of exports market shares from low productivity firms to high productivity firms. In addition, when export fixed costs are high enough, a fall in input tariffs raises the probability of exporting and the most productive firms gain more than the less productive firms. In contrast, when export fixed costs are low enough, a fall in input tariffs decreases the probability of entering the foreign markets. Under this configuration, the exports of the high productivity firms rise {{at the expense of}} the low productivity firms.

Finally, it is found that problems faced when using conventional banks can favor the development of Islamic products of financing especially partnership contracts...|$|E

40|$|Rank {{minimization}} can {{be converted}} into tractable surrogate problems, such as Nuclear Norm Minimization (NNM) and Weighted NNM (WNNM). The problems related to NNM, or WNNM, can be solved iteratively by applying a closed-form proximal operator, called Singular Value Thresholding (SVT), or Weighted SVT, but they suffer from high computational cost of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) at each iteration. We propose a fast and accurate approximation method for SVT, that we call fast randomized SVT (FRSVT), with which we avoid direct computation of SVD. The key idea is to extract an approximate basis for {{the range of the}} matrix from its compressed matrix. Given the basis, we compute partial singular values of the original matrix from the small factored matrix. In addition, <b>by</b> <b>developping</b> a range propagation method, our method further speeds up the extraction of approximate basis at each iteration. Our theoretical analysis shows the relationship between the approximation bound of SVD and its effect to NNM via SVT. Along with the analysis, our empirical results quantitatively and qualitatively show that our approximation rarely harms the convergence of the host algorithms. We assess the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method on various computer vision problems, e. g., subspace clustering, weather artifact removal, and simultaneous multi-image alignment and rectification.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} dissertation “Viva vox iuris” {{is aimed at}} extending the research on law and literature <b>by</b> <b>developping</b> a new perspective, based on Pierre Legendre’s “dogmatic anthropology”. Starting with {{an overview of the}} current state of research in this field, and based on a detailed presentation of Legendre’s theory, the dissertation develops the hypothesis that the deep entanglement of law and literature confers upon literature the capacity of either reinforcing the effectivity of cultural normativity, or of influencing it {{in the sense of a}} modificatory force. The plausibility of this hypothesis is then assessed by a thorough analysis of Kafka’s The Trial and Hoffmann’s The Sandman. The Trial is presented as being a novel that stages the failure of interpretation on the diegetic, hermeneutic as well as the production level, i. e. with regard to the author (– interpretation being, from Legendre’s perspective, the fundamental cultural technique assuring a non-delusional human existence). Being confronted with this failure and the consequent lack of a regime of sense, the reader gains insight, ex negativo, into the necessity of being inscribed, by way of interpretation, into an order of Reference that needs to be mediated by literature and law. With regard to The Sandman, the dissertation undertakes to show, through a combination of the concept of testimony with the dogmatic-anthropological core concepts of alterity and representation, how the fantastical blurring of the limits between reality and fiction, as staged in the novel, provides insights into the contingency of the fundamental structure of the normative order of cultural and subjective identity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAirborne lidar systems (ALS) provide 3 D point {{clouds of}} the {{topography}} by direct time measurement {{of a short}} laser pulse after reflection on the Earth surface. For the last decade, this technique {{has proved to be}} the ideal remote sensing tool for delivering very accurate digital terrain model (DTM) of the Earth surface, and then for answering main environmental issues such as natural hazard prevention and natural ressource management. Moreover, such active systems, also called "multiple echo lidar", allow to detect several return signals for a single laser shot. It is particularly relevant in case of vegetation areas since a single lidar survey allows to acquire not only the canopy top (the only visible layer from passive sensors), but also points inside the vegetation layer and on the ground underneath. Thus, among the different remote sensing techniques, airborne laser scanning has also proved to be the most efficient technique to characterize both forest structure and ground topography. For a few years, new airborne laser scanning systems called full-waveform lidar systems have emerged, providing not only 3 D point clouds as classical ALS systems, but entire altimeter profiles of reflected energy from the Earth surface. These profiles represent the laser backscattered energy as a function of time. They give to the end-user more control and flexibility on the signal processing steps and enable to extract more information than classical multi-echo lidar data. A detailed state-of-the-art of such systems can be found in [1]. However, managing these data with spacial and time dependency is much more complex than images or 3 D point clouds : raw full-waveform lidar data are sets of range profiles of various lengths that are stored in the sensor geometry following both the scan angle of the lidar system and the chronological order along the flight track. Moreover, the data volume is drastically larger than 3 D point clouds: it takes about 140 GB for an acquisition time of 1. 6 h with a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 50 kHz. Furthermore, there is neither commercial nor opensource toolkit to handle full-waveform lidar data, but some constructor solutions, that are black boxes, can only extract 3 D point clouds from raw data and are designed to their own sensors. Finally, there is not standard file format for full-waveform data (such as the LAS format for multi-echo data). Managing full-waveform lidar data is therefore a challenging task, and we adress this issue <b>by</b> <b>developping</b> a specific research tool: FullAnalyze...|$|E
