40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a low cost/fast prototyping wireless sensors network {{that was designed}} for a huge range of applications and making use of low cost commercial of the shelf components. Such applications includes industrial measurements, biomedical, domestic monitoring, remote sensing, among others. The concept of the wireless sensor network is presented and simultaneously, hot topics and their implementation are discussed. Such topics are valuable tools and can't be discarded when a wireless sensors network is planed. By the contrary, such tools must be taken in account to make the communications between the nodes and the base station the best possible reliable. The architecture, protocols and the reasons that were behind {{the selection of the}} components are also discussed. The chapter also presents performance metrics that are related to with the physical characteristics of sensors and with the radio specificity. Microcontrollers with a RISC architecture are used by the network nodes to control the communication and the data acquisition and operate in the 433 MHz ISM band with ASK modulation. Also, in order to improve the communication and to minimise the lost of data, it is predicted to put the wireless nodes to handle line and source coding schemes. This chapter cover the following topics: - the focus and application of the wireless sensor network; - the implications of the radio system; - the test bed implementation of the proposed low cost wireless sensors networks; - the wireless link power <b>budget,</b> <b>coding</b> and data recovering; - performance metrics of the wireless sensors networks; - cost analysis versus other technologies (wired and emerging wireless) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I revisit the {{acclaimed}} transformation towards organic agriculture in Cuba. Using Lefebvre's trialectics of space, I explore how dominant representations of Organic' agricultural space in Cuba, the so-called 'Greening of the Revolution’, was created through government institutions and public policy. I further investigate the locally lived gendered realities of farmers in a selected cooperative. I {{argue that the}} prevailing imaginary of a state-led nationwide transformation needs to be deconstructed {{and the role of}} NGOs, in particular Northern NGOs, to be fully acknowledged in the creation of 'organic' agriculture in Cuba. Northern NGOs were attracted by the romanticist environmental imagery of Cuba’s green agriculture. เท securing funding from donors, they have framed agr๐-ecology in Cuba according to their own understandings as well as needs of 'logframes', <b>budget</b> <b>codes</b> and project cycles. Northern NGOs are acting as transmission belts for Western understandings of NGO characteristics and agency. This has resulted in a re-shaping and positioning of Cuban NGO identity, creating new dependencies and tensions in the process and introducing fashionable themes, such as gender. 'Gender mainstreaming' is an outsider-driven process, as donors and Northern NGOs have requested the integration of gender into projects. Their practices neither go beyond the 'incorporation of women in the workforce', nor engage sufficiently with the gendered realities of the everyday, as I show in my case-study in a cooperative. Farmers are performing, negotiating or at times resisting the dominant 'representations of space' - i. e. the state, regulations and policies, but also - increasingly - NGO discourses and agendas/frameworks.

Moreover, to avoid amplitude saturation in the receiver, overlap multi-pulse PPM coding schemes are also studied.

Seabird time-activity budgets, in particular, reflect short-term changes in prey conditions. We tested an automated technique for long-term continuous recording of Cape gannet, Morus capensis, time-activity <b>budgets</b> using <b>coded</b> very high frequency (VHF) transmitters allowing for simultaneous monitoring of a large sample of study birds. Radiotransmitters attached to leg-rings had no impact on adult foraging trip and nest attendance durations, breeding success or chick growth. Furthermore, frequencies of nest attendance and foraging trip durations estimated by the VHF logging system were no different to those estimated from hourly direct observations. Using time-depth recorders, the relationship between the time that birds rested on the sea surface in relation to foraging trip duration was assessed. Trip duration during chick rearing was clearly an accurate proxy for foraging effort. The VHF monitoring system provides a simple method of accurately assessing the time-activity budgets of colonial seabirds, which can be expanded to a range of other colonially breeding taxa. In the case of seabirds, this approach can potentially provide sensitive, real-time indicators of prey abundance for fisheries management...|$|R

Previous studies proposed selective code compression using profile information {{in order to reduce}} the performance penalty. In this paper, we go one step further. We propose a software-only compression system, called SCS, that automatically finds trade-offs between code size and performance. Through an iterative approach, SCS automatically determines which functions to be compressed given a performance constraint and/or a code size constraint in order to guarantee a minimal performance and a maximal code size for an application. Experimentations illustrate that even with a non-optimal software decompression approach, SCS achieves a high compression rate with a minimal performance degradation...|$|R
