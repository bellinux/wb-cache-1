5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|From 1749 to the 1760s, Fort Chambray {{was built}} on the island of Gozo. It was {{intended}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> fortified city like Valletta, and eventually to replace the Cittadella as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was built. It saw some action during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact.|$|E

5|$|Hitman Go was {{developed}} by Canadian video game studio Square Enix Montreal. It is the first game from the developer, {{which was founded in}} late 2011 by employees of existing Square Enix Europe studios. Upon establishment, the studio announced that their first project would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> video game in the Hitman franchise. The studio's original aspiration was creating triple-A console games within the series and expanding to a team size of 150 people. After a year, while the team was still expanding, the console game was cancelled and the studio shifted its focus to mobile games. This transition led to around one third of the staff leaving the development team.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Mercator {{moved from}} Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves. He never gave {{his reasons for}} the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic {{intolerance}} of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; there was to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> university in Duisburg and teachers would be required. He was not alone; {{over the years to}} come many more would flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.|$|E

5|$|Modern Syria {{was first}} {{established}} in 1920 as the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal. This state was planned to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Arab kingdom, {{and not just}} Syrian, and the state espoused Arab nationalism and pan-Islamic policies. However the British, who had helped establish the state after World War I, made a secret agreement with France and established the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The area thereby functioned as one of France's colonies, and the newly established state was viewed unfavorably by most Syrians, with many of them regarding it as a vessel of European imperialism. At this stage, some movements tried to establish a Syrian identity, most notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or became advocates of communism and Islamism. The majority of Syrians continued {{to see themselves as}} Arabs rather than Syrians.|$|E
5|$|Named and {{described}} by Polish paleontologist Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Białynicka in 1977, Opisthocoelicaudia was first thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{member of the}} Camarasauridae, but is currently considered a derived member of the Titanosauria. Its exact relationships within Titanosauria are contentious, but {{it may have been}} close to the North American Alamosaurus. All Opisthocoelicaudia fossils stem from the Nemegt Formation. Despite being rich in dinosaur fossils, the only other sauropod from this rock unit is Nemegtosaurus, which is known from a single skull. Since the skull of Opisthocoelicaudia remains unknown, several researchers have suggested that Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia may represent the same species. Sauropod footprints from the Nemegt Formation, which include skin impressions, can probably be referred to either Nemegtosaurus or Opisthocoelicaudia as these are the only known sauropods from this formation.|$|E

Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.|$|E

Any additional Avatara within the House are Princes ranked by generation. Although Avatara form blood dynasties from father to son, House affiliations can be mixed within a dynasty. If the youngest Prince in a dynasty dies, the dynasty is ended. Most dynasties only last on average three generations, since typical Avatara can be killed by any means. When a dynasty ends, the first male child born {{elsewhere in the world}} with the most Avataric blood will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Prince starting a new dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Tucker McCall is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. Introduced by former head writer Maria Arena Bell, the character debuted during the episode airing on December 2, 2009, portrayed by William Russ. The character was slated to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> businessman and billionaire, leading to speculation that Tucker {{would become a}} replacement character for icon Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), as Braeden's future with the series was in jeopardy at the time. However, Tucker ended up being a new character who would be revealed as Katherine Chancellor's (Jeanne Cooper) long lost son. Russ was let go shortly after his debut due to producers wanting to take the character in a different direction, resulting in the hiring of Stephen Nichols as his replacement.|$|E

5|$|Days before Halloween, a man explodes a {{truck in}} Mars' capital city, {{spreading}} what {{is assumed to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> pathogen that kills or sickens over three hundred people. In response, the Mars government issues a record bounty of 300 million woolong for the culprit's capture. Faye, who was pursuing Lee Sampson, a hacker that was apparently driving the truck, sees the terrorist and the Bebop crew decide {{to take on the}} bounty. Each follows different lines of inquiry. Ed, using a tattoo on the attacker's wrist, manages to identify him as Vincent Volaju, a former member of a military squad apparently killed in the Titan War. In reality, Vincent was the only survivor of a test involving the pathogen, having been immunized with a test vaccine: made an amnesic, he suffers from hallucinations, and his inability to tell dreams from reality eventually drove him insane.|$|E
5|$|Gilmore had {{suspected}} that C. fragilis and C. agilis were the same, but Ostrom {{was able to}} demonstrate this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able to demonstrate that Ornitholestes was quite different from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able to demonstrate {{that this was not}} the case. Additionally, he showed that one of the three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would not be the last small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus, Tanycolagreus.|$|E
5|$|In 1038, Kraków {{became the}} seat of the Polish government. By the end of the 10th century, the city was a leading centre of trade. Brick {{buildings}} were constructed, including the Royal Wawel Castle with St. Felix and Adaukt Rotunda, Romanesque churches such as St. Adalbert's, a cathedral, and a basilica. The city was almost entirely destroyed during the Mongol invasion of 1241. It was rebuilt practically identical, based on new location act and incorporated in 1257 by the high duke Bolesław V the Chaste who following the example of Wrocław, introduced city rights modelled on the Magdeburg law allowing for tax benefits and new trade privileges for the citizens. In 1259, the city was again ravaged by the Mongols. A third attack in 1287 was repelled {{thanks in part to the}} new built fortifications. In 1335, King Casimir III of Poland (Kazimierz in Polish) declared the two western suburbs to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> city named after him, Kazimierz (Casimiria in Latin). The defensive walls were erected around the central section of Kazimierz in 1362, and a plot was set aside for the Augustinian order next to Skałka.|$|E
