On August 21, the U.S. women's team won the gold medal by defeating Brazil 1–0 in extra time, in no small measure due to Solo's performance as she stopped an energetic Brazilian attack, making save after save.

500|$|Four days later, the DA {{submitted}} a complaint to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) about censorship {{by the public}} broadcaster after the SABC informed the DA it would not continue broadcasting a DA television advert titled [...] "ANC Ayisafani", meaning [...] "the ANC's not the same", and five DA radio adverts aired on 8 and 9 April 2014. According to the DA's Mmusi Maimane, who appears in the television advert, the SABC banned all DA adverts from 11 public radio stations {{as well as the}} television advert. ICASA announced that it would hold public hearings on the matter on Thursday the 17th, 6 days after the DA lodged their complaint. Following the DA's announcement that it would submit an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court requesting a ruling on the adverts before the long Easter weekend commencing Good Friday, the day after ICASA's proposed public hearing date, the ICASA hearings commenced 2 days earlier than originally scheduled. On the day after the hearing, the ban was lifted temporarily as the SABC had failed to provide reasons for the ban during the ICASA hearings and requested more time to prepare a response. The DA also objected to the SABC not allowing the national official opposition party to participate in a televised election debate on land reform on SABCin the first 2 weeks of April. On 25 April, ICASA upheld the SABC's ban on the television advert finding that it contravened ICASA's regulations on party election broadcasts. ICASA ordered that a photograph taken by The Citizen photographer Alaister Russell of a police officer firing rubber bullets at unarmed residents during the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest be removed from the advert as [...] "the police should not be seen {{as a threat to the}} community". In the advert, Maimane says [...] "We've seen a police force killing our own people" [...] while the photograph is shown on the screen. The South African Police Service had earlier {{submitted a}} complaint to ICASA that this footage would incite violence against police officers.On 15 April 2014, a protest campaign against corruption with the slogan [...] "Vukani! Sidikwe! (Wake up! We are Fed up!) Vote No", supported by over 100 ANC veterans, was launched by former government ministers Ronnie Kasrils and Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge. The IEC has requested a legal opinion on whether the campaign contravenes the Electoral Act. The campaign urges ANC supporters to either spoil their votes or vote for a smaller party. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu welcomed the campaign, and human rights activist and cleric Barney Pityana describes it as [...] "a campaign to bring rationality, order, morality and decency <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>our</b> electoral system" [...] in a Mail & Guardian opinion piece.|$|E

40|$|Although most {{mutations}} are deleterious, an {{interplay between}} somatic mutation and selection within germinal centers (GC) results in rapid generation of high affinity memory B cells. How high affinity B cells {{with large numbers}} of mutations are generated and preserved within GC containing at their peak only a few thousand cells has been puzzling. We have developed a model of somatic mutation and B cell expansion within a GC that resolves this puzzle. We show that the frequent recycling of Ag-selected centrocytes <b>back</b> <b>into</b> centroblasts can lead to efficient affinity maturation. Memory cells are generated in large numbers even when most of the selected centrocytes recycle <b>back</b> <b>into</b> centroblasts. <b>Our</b> model suggests that a germinal center reaction in which the output of cells is low up to the point of GC dissociation, followed by the release of centrocytes into the periphery, is advantageous for generating high affinity memory...|$|R

40|$|We {{are happy}} to present our new book to the community. Although {{this is a book}} on {{revision}} theory, it uses general methodologies which are applied in other areas of logic. We would like to highlight these methodologies in this preface. 1. the idea of logic by translation Given a new logical system L, whose properties we want to investigate, we trans-late L into a well-known logic, usually classical logic C, modal logic or intuition-istic logic. We study the properties we want in the target logic and then translate <b>back</b> <b>into</b> L. <b>Our</b> approach of revision by translation (see Chapter 7) is an in-stance of that methodology. We can also do interpolation by translation. What is most well known in the community is semantics by translation and decidability and undecidability by translation. This is a common way of obtaining semantics or decidability results for logical systems. 2. meta-level/object-level movement Given a logic L, there may be some manipulations of L done in the meta-level. Such notions can be provability or consequence, e. g., A ⊢ B or deletion from...|$|R
