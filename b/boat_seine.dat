50|$|Fish {{was caught}} {{by means of the}} seine net, which {{together}} with the curing at the fish pallices had been introduced by English settlers in the period. Two <b>boats,</b> the <b>seine</b> <b>boat</b> and the so-called “follower” were used. The <b>seine</b> <b>boat,</b> a large boat pulled by perhaps a dozen or more oars, carried the net, which was often 300-400 yards long. An experienced fisherman acted as a “huer” by directing fishing operations from suitable points of vantage. From high land, the huer could see the shoals of pilchards clearly, and he directed the “skipper” of the <b>seine</b> <b>boat,</b> by suitable signs to the location of a likely shoal. On a given signal, the net was shot around the shoal by the <b>seine</b> <b>boat,</b> and in the meantime, the free end of the net was picked up by the “follower”, with a crew of perhaps five or six, and the two ends of the net were brought together. Weighted pieces of timber were placed to prevent the fish from escaping. The escaping footropes of the net were gradually drawn up until the fish were completely enclosed, and by means of baskets the fish were transferred from the net to the boat, and fishing continued until no more fish could be managed, or if catches were poor. The pilchards were preserved with salt in the “pallices” or occasionally smoked.|$|R

A total of 91 fish and cephalopod species were recorded in the catches, of which 20 species were always retained, 40 were always discarded and the remaining 31 were selected depending on size (only larger specimens were retained). The most abundant species in the retained catch were Spicara smaris, Atherina hepsetus and Mullus barbatus, while Chromis chromis, Symphodus ocellatus and small specimens of Boops boops dominated the discards. An estimated 43. 5 % by number and 28. 5 % by weight of the total catch were discarded. Since the minimum landing size (MLS) is regulated for only 4 out of the 15 most important species in this study, and even these regulations are only partially followed, discarding practices were generally market-driven.

The fish can be found from south of Taiwan to northwestern Japan (Ichimaru 2007; Chang et al. 2012 b); however, it has not been found in the Philippines according to a 3 -year sampling program conducted in Batanes (SK Chang and CH Lin, unpublished data). The fish was utilized as the main source of eggs for flyingfish egg fisheries in northern Taiwan and the bait of longline and troll fisheries in eastern Taiwan (Chang et al. 2012 a, b). Juveniles of the fish also constituted an important target of <b>boat</b> <b>seine</b> and setnet fisheries in northwestern Japan (Ichimaru 2007). A decline of more than 60 % in catches of the fish and its eggs occurred in Taiwan during the 2006 to 2007 period (Fisheries Agency 2010). This decline has caused serious concerns regarding the fish stock status and prompted the Taiwan government to implement a set of regulations on flyingfish egg fishery since 2008, including an annual catch limit. The catch limit regulation is precautionary, however, and has no scientific support regarding the optimal fish stock abundance or, more basically, on the boundary of the fish population that is crucial for effective fishery management (Garcia 2005). Therefore, the population structure of H. oxycephalus needs to be resolved urgently in order to confirm if the population is trans-boundary and is exploited by more than one country.|$|E
