2500|$|The {{most common}} mode of {{operation}} for a TEM is the bright field imaging mode. In this mode the contrast formation comes from the sample having varying thickness or density. Thicker areas of the sample and denser areas or regions with a higher atomic number will block more electrons and appear dark in an image, while thinner, lower density, lower atomic number regions and areas with no sample in the beam path will appear bright. The term [...] "bright field" [...] refers to the <b>bright</b> <b>background</b> field {{where there is no}} sample and most of the beam electrons reach the image. The image is assumed to be a simple two dimensional projection of the sample's thickness and density down the optic axis, and to a first approximation may be modelled via Beer's law, more complex analyses require the modelling of the sample image to include phase information.|$|E

50|$|Caillebotte employs sharp {{contrast}} between the shady foreground in {{the lower part of}} the image and the <b>bright</b> <b>background.</b> The shadows are painted in muted greens and purples, while the lawn and flower beds are brilliant greens, reds and whites. The strong definition between the areas of sunlight and shadow is a departure from the dappled light that occurs in similar outdoor scenes by Impressionists Renoir and Monet. Art historian and critic Kirk Varnedoe suggests that this contrast contributes to a sense of afternoon heat.|$|E
50|$|Bright-field {{microscopy}} is {{the simplest}} of all the optical microscopy illumination techniques. Sample illumination is transmitted (i.e., illuminated from below and observed from above) white light, and contrast in the sample is caused by attenuation of the transmitted light in dense areas of the sample. Bright-field microscopy is {{the simplest of}} a range of techniques used for illumination of samples in light microscopes, and its simplicity makes it a popular technique. The typical appearance of a bright-field microscopy image is a dark sample on a <b>bright</b> <b>background,</b> hence the name.|$|E

Another problem with the screen has been a bright spot in the lower area of the screen. This problem is commonly referred to as the B-spot because it is exactly where the B on the keyboard is. This bright spot is only noticeable when using a <b>bright</b> <b>background.</b> The B-spot is also noticeable when screen display is set to automatic brightness.|$|E

The ceiling was painted (1933-1934) from the façade to the presbytery with scenes from the old to new testament by the painter Mario Prayer. The bronze doors (1968) were created by Giuseppe Niglia. Below the main altar is a crypt with archeologic evidence of prior structures in a mosaic pavement. The dome has frescoes depicting a procession of St Gerard. The apse has a Christ the Redeemer frescoed against a <b>bright</b> <b>background.</b> The chapel of St Gerard has a 15th-century reliquary statue.|$|E
50|$|When mesospheric {{clouds are}} viewed above the atmosphere, the {{geometrical}} limitations of observingfrom {{the ground are}} significantly reduced. They may be observed ‘edge-on’ against the comparativelydark sky background, even in full daylight. The photometer field of view must be well baffled to avoidinterference from the very bright Earth about a degree beneath the cloud layer. It is a much moredifficult task to observe the clouds against the <b>bright</b> <b>background</b> of the illuminated Earth, althoughthis has been achieved in the ultraviolet in the 200 to 300 nm spectral region, because of the verysmall albedo of the earth {{in this part of}} spectrum.|$|E
50|$|If {{the signal}} is either slowly varying or {{otherwise}} constant (essentially a DC signal), then 1/f noise typically overwhelms the signal. It may then {{be necessary to}} use external means to modulate the signal. For example, when detecting a small light signal against a <b>bright</b> <b>background,</b> the signal can be modulated either by a chopper wheel, acousto-optical modulator, photoelastic modulator at a large enough frequency so that 1/f noise drops off significantly, and the lock-in amplifier is referenced to the operating frequency of the modulator. In {{the case of an}} atomic-force microscope, to achieve nanometer and piconewton resolution, the cantilever position is modulated at a high frequency, to which the lock-in amplifier is again referenced.|$|E

40|$|A human {{rhodopsin}} mutation, Gly- 90 [...] >Asp (Gly 90 Asp), cosegregated with {{an unusual}} trait of congenital nightblindness in 22 at-risk members of a large autosomal dominant kindred. Although rhodopsin mutations typically are associated with retinal degeneration, Gly 90 Asp-affected subjects up to age 33 did not show clinical retinal changes. Absolute threshold for visual perception was elevated nearly 3 logarithmic units in 7 individuals tested (ages 11 - 64), indicating greatly compromised rod threshold signaling. However, in vivo rhodopsin density was normal. Although the 38 -year-old proband could not perceive dim lights, his rod increment threshold function was normal on <b>brighter</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> The impaired rod vision for dim but not <b>bright</b> <b>backgrounds</b> {{is consistent with a}} mechanism of increased basal "dark-light" from thermal isomerization equivalent to an increase of > 10 (4) over that of wild-type rhodopsin. The Gly 90 Asp mutation on the second transmembrane helix places an extra negative charge in the opsin pocket; this could contribute to partial deprotonation of the retinal Schiff base and thereby increase photoreceptor noise. In vitro evidence had suggested that transducin is activated by the Gly 90 Asp mutation in the absence of both the retinal chromophore and light, termed "constitutive activity. " The apparent preservation of functioning rods despite extensive and lifelong night-blindness in this kindred is inconsistent with one current hypothesis that chronic rod activation from constitutively active mutant rhodopsin necessarily contributes significantly to photoreceptor demise in human retinal dystrophies...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} shell color of Nerita plicata gastropods and habitat background color in Piis and Romanum Islands, Chuuk State, Federated States of Micronesia. The brightness of habitat background color ranged from 10 to 80, whereas the brightness of shell color varied from 40 to 98. The shell color was usually brighter than the habitat background color, suggesting that N. plicata inhabits backgrounds that are darker than its shell color. Only snails with brighter shell colors inhabited <b>brighter</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> By contrast, darker backgrounds were inhabited by snails with several types of shell color. My findings indicate that N. plicata may adapt to different environments by means of shell-color polymorphism...|$|R
