Bates and was laid down on 4 August 1969 as the only ship of the U.S. Navy to have borne the name. The reason for her naming by then-Secretary of the Navy John Chafee, breaking with a long-standing Navy tradition of naming U.S. Navy attack submarines for sea creatures, was best summed up by Admiral Hyman Rickover, the then-director of the Navys nuclear reactors program, with the pithy comment that, [...] "Fish dont vote!" ...|$|R

50|$|Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), {{also called}} red salmon, kokanee salmon, or <b>blueback</b> <b>salmon,</b> is an {{anadromous}} species of salmon {{found in the}} Northern Pacific Ocean and rivers discharging into it. This species is a Pacific salmon that is primarily red in hue during spawning. They can grow up to 84 cm in length and weigh 2.3 to(-) 7 kg. Juveniles remain in freshwater until {{they are ready to}} migrate to the ocean, over distances of up to 1600 km. Their diet consists primarily of zooplankton. Sockeye salmon are semelparous, dying after they spawn. Some populations, referred to as kokanee, do not migrate to the ocean and live their entire lives in freshwater.|$|E

40|$|Exceptional {{data are}} {{available}} {{for the study of}} the salmon runs of the Columbia River in 1938. Detailed figures on catch were supplied by Oregon and Washington in such form that they could readily be combined with the counts at Bonneville Dam to provide a basis for estimating the escapement. Tables show the catch of each species for each week in each of six zones, and the counts at Bonneville and Rock Island dams. The general course of the run of each species is shown. The numbers of fish bound for the spawning grounds above Rock Island Dam are estimated as follows: Chinook salmon entering Columbia River before May 1, 4 percent; during May, 6 percent; June and July, 15 percent; and August to December, 1 percent. <b>Blueback</b> <b>salmon</b> entering the river during the above periods, 40 percent. Steelhead trout entering the river during June to September, 1 percent; during the rest of the year, 10 percent. Fishing intensities are shown by escapement to catch ratios. Percentages of chinook salmon escapement are less than 15 during May; 17 during June and July; and 33 during the remainder of the year. The June and July runs are now greatly depleted, and an important part of these runs spawns above Rock Island Dam. The <b>blueback</b> <b>salmon</b> escapement is about 20 percent, and of steelhead trout about 33 percent. Weekly and seasonal closed periods are shown to be almost entirely ineffective for increasing the spawning escapement. Exploitation is further increased by the intensive troll fishery conducted from Monterey Bay to southeastern Alaska. Chinook salmon are also subjected to a sport fishery of considerable importance. Main runs of salmon to the Columbia River are practically unprotected and are fished with destructive intensity...|$|E
40|$|The Oregon Fish Commission {{received}} a {{contract from the}} U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, under the Saltonstall-Kennedy Act for a study to develop methods for determining the behavior of juvenile salmonids in reservoirs. The study, consisting of a literature survey and field program, was conducted in Felton and North Fork Reservoirs on the Deschutes and Clackamas Rivers, Oregon, between September 30, 1959 and January 31, 1962. Pelton Reservoir contains chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), <b>blueback</b> <b>salmon</b> (0. nerka), and summer-run steelhead trout (Salmo airdneri); North Fork Reservoir contains chinook salmon, silver salmon (0. kisutch 1 and winter-run steelhead trout.

40|$|Reprinted from Proceedings of the Sixth Pacific Science Congress, University of California Press, Berkeley, California, 1941. THE SALMON of the Columbia River have {{supported}} an intensive fishery for over seventy years but are now showing unmistakable signs of depletion, and various factors {{are contributing to}} the rapid progress of this condition. Five species of fish enter into the commercial fishery on the Columbia River itself. These are (1) the Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha), (2) the <b>blueback</b> <b>salmon</b> (0. nerka), (3) the silver salmon (0. kisutch), (4) the chum salmon (0. keta) and (5) the steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri). The Chinook is of far greater importance than all other species together and constitutes by weight approximately three-quarters of the total catch. In addition to the catch made in the river {{a large number of}} Columbia River salmon are taken in the ocean, especially by trolling, but to a small extent by purse seines. This oceanic catch is almost exclusively composed of Chinooks and silver salmon. The annual commercial value of the pack of salmon on the Columbia River has averaged about four and a half million dollars over the past thirty years. Thousands of people are directly dependent upon this industry for all or part of their income and other thousands benefit indirectly. It constitutes one of the major resources of the Pacific Northwest...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} fishway slope on the {{performance}} and biochemical state of salmonids was studied in two experimental 2 ̆ 7 endless 2 ̆ 7 fishways with slopes of 1 on 8 and 1 on 16. A locking device in each fishway permitted recycling of fish so that pool-and-overfall fishways of any height could be simulated. Ascents were generally confined to a rise of 104 feet, {{but a number of}} fish were permitted to ascend over several hundred feet and one fish was allowed to ascend over 6, 000 feet. Principal species tested were chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), sockeye (Columbia River <b>blueback)</b> <b>salmon</b> (O. nerka), and steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri). Comparisons of individual passage times, patterns of movement, and biochemical phenomena associated with muscular activity showed no evidence of fatigue of the fish in either fishway when proper hydraulic conditions existed. Data indicated that ascent of a properly designed pool-and-overfall fishway is only a moderate exercise for salmonids and that the rate of ascent will not decline in the upper end of a long fishway. Hydraulic conditions were shown to control rate of ascent and pattern of movement through fishways. Differences in rate of movement and in blood lactate levels were measured between species. The effects of size, sex, maturity, and disease on performance and biochemical state of fish were also examined. Significant relationships were found only for length of male chinook and performance (larger fish were slower), and sex and blood lactate level for chinook (female chinook had higher blood lactate levels) ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} problem of the {{increasing}} competition between recreation and irrigation at Wallowa Lake. Originally Wallowa Lake was an abundant source of fish for the Indians but the advent of irrigation in the area by the early settlers eliminated the <b>blueback</b> <b>salmon</b> (oncorhynchus nerka) run that spawned in the lake. This was caused by the establishment of unscreened irrigation ditches in the Wallowa River below the lake and the construction of a concrete dam in the outlet of the lake by the Associated Ditch Companies. The dam raised the natural level of the lake 28. 4 feet, creating an irrigation reservoir. The use of this water for irrigation purposes has caused considerable erosion along the steep banks of the east and west moraines, reducing the desirability of the beaches and hampering the use of boating facilities. The Pacific Power and Light Company used a considerable amount of water from the lake for their generating plant in Joseph from 1929 to 1956. This limited the number of times the lake was filled to capacity, lessening the amount of sloughing of the relatively undeveloped shoreline property around the lake since the greatest damage occurred when the lake was full. After 1950, many more people purchased lots and built cabins on the west moraine and became increasingly aware of the erosion of their property. The erosion problem increased sharply after the Joseph power plant was abandoned in 1956, enabling the Associated Ditch Companies to fill the reservoir to capacity nearly every year since that time. Increased dissatisfaction by the cabin owners with the management practices of the Associated Ditch Companies resulted in a lawsuit in which the ditch companies were found guilty of trespass of private property by exceeding their storage rights. Although the fine in this instance was negligible, future confrontations appear to be inevitable due to the increasing influence of recreationists in an area once considered the exclusive domain of agriculture and power interests. Future cooperation between these conflicting interests is vital in order to realize the full potential of the multiple uses of the lake...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis in salmonoid fishes {{was first}} {{observed}} in the 1952 run of fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) returning to the Bonneville Hatchery of the Oregon Fish Commission. In the studies reported here, tuberculosis was found not only in adult spring chinook but in silver salmon (0. kisutch), <b>blueback</b> <b>salmon</b> (0. nerka), and in anadromous and resident strains of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii). Advanced tuberculosis was found in salmonoid fishes held in fresh water for two years or longer, {{as well as in}} adults returning from the sea. Lesions were most frequently {{observed in the}} liver, and varied in size from small miliary tubercles to huge necrotic areas, filled with characteristic acid-fast bacilli. The typical bacilli were found in stained smears from the kidney, heart, musculature, brain, intestines, pyloric caeca, and roe of infected fish. The disease was originally observed in sexually-underdeveloped fish, and there is indication that it interferes with sexual maturation. It was found that tuberculosis in marked salmon known to be of hatchery origin was extremely high - in some cases 100 percent. Tuberculosis was absent in the small number of silver and chum salmon examined which were known to be the progeny from natural spawning. It is suggested that dissemination of the disease may be due to fish-cultural practices such as the feeding of untreated carcasses and the viscera from tuberculous fish. Since acid-fast bacilli were found in the roe of some fish, it is also suggested that the disease may be transmitted to healthy eggs during the process of fertilization. Tuberculous adult spring chinook were found less capable of surviving to maturity after they reached the spawning grounds than were non-infected fish. It is likely that tuberculosis also influences the ability of salmon to survive during earlier stages of their life history. The incidence of tuberculosis in adult spring chinook entering the Dexter holding ponds on the Middle Fork of the Willamette River in 1955 and 1956 was 8. 7 and 6. 1 percent, respectively. The increase in incidence to 58. 8 percent in 1957 is attributed to the increased dependency of the run on artificial propagation necessitated by the construction of Lookout Point Dam. Among chinook caught in the Columbia River gill-net fishery in. February and in May 1956, 12. 3 and 10. 5 percent, respectively, of those examined were tuberculous. Although these are spring chinook, it is believed that hatchery reared fall chinook also entered the catch, especially during May, and {{may have contributed to the}} number of tuberculous fish taken...|$|E
