5|$|After {{a series}} of {{increasing}} health problems in his final years, <b>Burnet</b> died of cancer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burnet</b> was, however, {{unable to}} prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's {{hypothesis}} in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. <b>Burnet</b> and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. <b>Burnet</b> and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite the rather different personalities and physical separation; <b>Burnet</b> was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, <b>Burnet</b> {{decided that}} {{research}} at the Institute should focus on immunology. <b>Burnet</b> reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; <b>Burnet</b> was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.|$|E

60|$|When she {{put down}} the paper she was {{suddenly}} afflicted by a vivid vision of Susan <b>Burnet's</b> father, losing heart and {{not knowing what to}} do. She had an unreasonable feeling that Susan <b>Burnet's</b> father must have been a small, kindly, furry, bunnyish, little man. Of course there had to be progress and the survival of the fittest. She found herself weighing what she imagined Susan <b>Burnet's</b> father to be like, against the ferrety face, stooping shoulders and scheming whistle of Sir Isaac.|$|R
50|$|Nobel Prize-winning Australian {{biologist}} Sir Macfarlane <b>Burnet's</b> mother, n√©e Hadassah Pollock Mackay, {{was born}} in Koroit in 1872. Her Glasgow schoolteacher father emigrated to Australia in the late 1850s and settled in Koroit. After <b>Burnet's</b> death in August 1985, he was buried at the local cemetery.|$|R
5|$|In 1978 <b>Burnet</b> {{decided to}} officially retire; in {{retirement}} he wrote two books. During this time, {{he missed his}} laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, <b>Burnet</b> {{was one of three}} contributors to Challenge to Australia, writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result {{of the success of the}} book, in early 1983, <b>Burnet</b> was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members became too frail or died.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, <b>Burnet</b> was a {{chairman}} of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and <b>Burnet</b> had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in human biology. He was particularly interested in kuru (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. <b>Burnet</b> later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.|$|E

5|$|While in London, <b>Burnet</b> became {{engaged to}} fellow Australian Edith Linda Marston Druce. She was a {{secondary}} school teacher and {{daughter of a}} barrister's clerk and the pair had met in 1923 and had a few dates but did not keep in touch. Druce sought out <b>Burnet</b> while on a holiday in London and they quickly agreed to marriage although she {{had to return to}} Australia. They married in 1928 after he had completed his Ph.D. and returned to Australia, and had a son and two daughters. At the time, there was a vacancy for the Chair of Bacteriology at the University of London, and Ledingham was lobbying his colleagues to offer <b>Burnet</b> the post, but <b>Burnet</b> returned to Australia, partly because of Druce.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in Europe and America. Kellaway took a liking to <b>Burnet</b> and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that <b>Burnet</b> would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. <b>Burnet</b> left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. <b>Burnet</b> prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E
5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed {{when he had to}} do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom <b>Burnet</b> came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. <b>Burnet</b> applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked <b>Burnet</b> to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. <b>Burnet</b> complied.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, it {{was decided}} by the University of Melbourne that <b>Burnet</b> would be {{appointed}} a professor {{as part of a}} cooperative program so that university students could be experimentally trained at the institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as <b>Burnet</b> repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. <b>Burnet</b> was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, <b>Burnet</b> was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1933, <b>Burnet</b> took {{leave of}} absence to {{undertake}} a fellowship at the National Institute for Medical Research in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute {{had been given a}} large grant from the Rockefeller Foundation that allowed them to hire <b>Burnet</b> at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet‚Äîwhom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist‚Äîbetter equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burnet</b> made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, <b>Burnet</b> worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E

5|$|<b>Burnet</b> {{received}} his Doctor of Medicine {{degree from the}} University of Melbourne in 1924, and his PhD from the University of London in 1928. He went on to conduct pioneering research in microbiology and immunology at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, and served {{as director of the}} Institute from 1944 to 1965. From 1965 until his retirement in 1978, <b>Burnet</b> worked at the University of Melbourne. Throughout his career he played {{an active role in the}} development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia and was a founding member of the Australian Academy of Science (AAS), and served as its president from 1965 to 1969.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burnet</b> {{served as}} a member or {{chairman}} of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, {{he was a member}} of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947‚Äì52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government's Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that <b>Burnet</b> made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of chemical and biological weapons to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled War from a Biological Angle. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, <b>Burnet</b> {{scaled back}} his {{laboratory}} work, taking one day off per week {{to concentrate on}} writing. In 1963, Autoimmune Diseases: Pathogenesis, Chemistry and Therapy, which he authored with Ian Mackay, was published. He also oversaw {{an expansion of the}} Hall Institute and secured funding from the Nuffield Foundation and the state government to build two further floors in the building and take over some of the space taken up by pathology department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Despite this, <b>Burnet</b> believed that a world class research body needed to be small enough that one person could effectively run it, and maintained tight control over its activities throughout his leadership. He determined the policies himself, and personally selected all of the research staff and students, relying on a small staff to enforce his plans.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{breakthroughs}} in virology were made {{while he was}} there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the influenza virus.
