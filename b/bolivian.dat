5|$|Guevara grows {{sick and}} by Day 280 can barely breathe {{as a result}} of his acute asthma. Nevertheless, he {{continues}} to lead his group towards the other column of revolutionaries. On Day 302, the <b>Bolivian</b> Army wipes out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the <b>Bolivian</b> troops about the movements of the rebels. By Day 340, Guevara is trapped by the <b>Bolivian</b> Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of La Higuera. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and Cuban American CIA agent Félix Rodríguez emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The <b>Bolivian</b> high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution. He is shot on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's landing skids and flown out.|$|E

5|$|Left {{without any}} family, Morales headed for Antofagasta, then a port town in Bolivia that was booming {{due to the}} nitrate mines in the area. She {{travelled}} there as a steerage passenger, with a ticket she bought by selling nearly all of her possessions. While working there, she met Santiago Pizarro, a Chilean in his 30s who made his living in a <b>Bolivian</b> military band, and married him in mid-1878, aged 13. He was tried and executed on 21 September of that year for killing a <b>Bolivian</b> soldier in a drunken brawl. She found his body dumped {{by the side of}} the railway tracks and took a gold ring from his finger, which she wore for the rest of her life.

These two years were one of Bolivia's politically most unstable periods, with five presidents and two military coups, led by General Juan Pereda and General David Padilla respectively; under the latter's regime, Morales was stationed as a guard at the Palacio Quemado (Presidential Palace).|$|E

The film is organized {{by the number of}} days {{that he was in the}} country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as a foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a cocaine smuggler, and the <b>Bolivian</b> Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, there is a shortage of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and <b>Bolivian</b> followers.|$|E

Meanwhile, {{the head of the}} CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam (David Harbour), strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of <b>Bolivian</b> oil. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines (Paul Ritter), is killed by antagonists after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene.

5|$|In 1921, renowned British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas {{described}} Oryzomys wavrini as a {{new species}} of Oryzomys from Paraguay. In the next decades, it was viewed as an aberrant species of Oryzomys (then used in a much broader sense than now), but it was moved to a separate genus, named Pseudoryzomys, by Hershkovitz in 1959, who noted that although it is similar to Oryzomys palustris in appearance, other features suggest it is {{more closely related to}} Phyllotis. Thus, he viewed the animal {{as a member of the}} phyllotine group of rodents, which includes Calomys and Phyllotis, not of the oryzomyine group, which includes Oryzomys, and his opinion was mostly accepted in the next few decades. Scientific knowledge of the rare Pseudoryzomys wavrini—only three specimens were known when Hershkovitz described the genus Pseudoryzomys in 1959—increased in the following years, and in 1975 the <b>Bolivian</b> population was named as a separate subspecies, Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi, because <b>Bolivian</b> animals are slightly larger and darker than those from Paraguay.|$|E
