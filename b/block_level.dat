25|$|As {{a result}} of the 1990 United States Census, Texas was {{entitled}} to three additional congressional districts. In a called session in 1991, the Texas Legislature decided to draw one new Hispanic-majority district in South Texas (District 28), one new African-American majority district in Dallas County (District 30), and one new Hispanic-majority district in the Houston area (District 29). In addition, the Legislature decided to reconfigure an existing minority-majority district in the Houston area (District 18) to increase its percentage of African-Americans. The Texas Legislature had developed a state-of-the-art computer system, RedApl, that allowed it to draw congressional districts using racial data at the census <b>block</b> <b>level.</b> Working closely with the Texas congressional delegation and various members of the Legislature who intended to run for Congress, the Texas Legislature took great care to draw three new districts and reconfigure districts that the chosen candidates could win.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives. During a {{combined}} spinal and epidural technique, extension of sensory block by epidural injection of saline or bupivacaine {{has been demonstrated}} and attributed to a volume effect or to {{the combination of a}} volume effect with a focal anesthetic effect. This two-part study was designed to evaluate the time dependency of the volume effect and the local anesthetic effect on the mechanism of spinal block extension Methods. We performed two prospective studies. Thirty patients were randomized in each study. A combined spinal and epidural was performed in a sitting position in all groups. The patients in the first study received 15 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally and were placed supine 2 minutes after spinal injection. They received 10 mL epidural saline either 5 minutes after spinal (group A) or 20 minutes after spinal (group B) compared to a control group (group C). The patients in the second study received 12. 5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally and were placed supine 5 minutes after spinal injection. They then received epidurally either 10 mL saline 7 minutes after spinal (group D) or 10 mL bupivacaine 7 minutes after spinal (group E) or noticing (group F). Sensory <b>block</b> <b>levels</b> were assessed by a loss of sensation to cold using other. Results. In the first portion of this study, in group A, area under the curve of sensory <b>block</b> <b>levels</b> by time from 10 to 40 minutes after spinal injection, and maximum sensory <b>block</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly higher (P <. 05) compared to groups B and C. In the second portion of the study, sensory <b>block</b> <b>levels</b> were comparable at all times in the three groups. Conclusions. During {{a combined}} spinal and epidural technique with the use of hyperbaric bupivacaine, the volume effect is time dependent anti is seen when epidural top up is done soon after spinal injection. This volume effect is abolished when patients are left seated for 5 minutes after spinal injection. The local anesthetic effect is not demonstrated when high sensory <b>block</b> <b>levels</b> are achieved by spinal injection. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Aim: In this study, we {{aimed to}} show which {{parameter}} {{can be used}} to get a realible result in differentiation of cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) and saline by using the urine test strips. We compared the effectiveness of glucose and pH parameters by dripping CSF samples obtained from spinal needle during combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) by means of glucose and pH regions of the urine test strip. Methods: After obtaining written consent, 70 patients scheduled for lower extremity surgery under CSEA were included in this unicenter and randomized clinical study. During the intervention, <b>block</b> <b>levels</b> and color changes in urine test strips' glucose and pH parameters were all recorded. Results: In both groups, urine test strip color change were positive in 34 patients and negative in 1 patient. There was no statistically significant difference. In our study, even free CSF flow was detected after CSEA implementation, <b>block</b> <b>levels</b> were detected as and ldquo;none and rdquo; in 3 patients in and ldquo;glucose and rdquo; group (9 %) and 1 patient in and ldquo;pH and rdquo; group (3 %). There was a statistically significant difference in comparison of <b>block</b> <b>levels.</b> Conclusion: We found out that CSF samples dripped on urine test strips caused a color change in glucose and pH parameters, similar to previous results. However there was no <b>block</b> <b>levels</b> in 1 patient in and ldquo;pH and rdquo; and 3 patients in and ldquo;glucose and rdquo; groups.
