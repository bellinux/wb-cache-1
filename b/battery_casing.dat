The car's electronics only allow 40% of total rated capacity of the battery pack (6,5 Ampère hour) to be used in order to prolong the battery life. As a result, the SoC is allowed to vary only between 40% and 80% of the rated full charge.

Only the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid has a longer driving all-electric range in blended operation electric-gasoline of 11 mi (EPA rating) until the battery is depleted.

It should be noted that the Mobility Radeon 9800 was based on the R420 core, the same as early ATI Radeon X700 and X800 desktop graphics cards, but with half the pixel pipelines disconnected. A popular modification to the GPU was to bridge two traces in the top right corner of the PCB surrounding the exposed core with a conductive pen to unlock these pipelines. However, this could only be done on cores made before week 43 of 2004. Dell promised graphics card upgradeability, but only delivered the arguably small 9700 to 9800 step for 9700 owners (at a rather steep $399 price tag, including technician to install it), and never delivered the promised upgrade to the 9800 owners. This model also suffers from an annoying whine on the headphone and microphone jacks that are located on the left of the unit. This is because of shared space with the leftmost fan, and the spinning of said fan causes interference.

40|$|The {{focus of}} much of this work is the {{rechargeable}} lithium battery, because of its high energy density, {{and the use of}} solid polymer electrolytes (SPE`s) for ease of fabrication and lightness of weight. The classical solid polymer electrolyte is based on the use of salts such as lithium triflate dissolved in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or poly(propylene oxide). This specific polymer electrolyte has severe limitations. Poly(ethylene oxide) is a microcrystalline polymer at 25 C, and ion migration occurs only in the 20 [...] 30 % of the material that is amorphous. Useable conductivities (10 {sup {minus} 5 } S/cm) can be achieved only when the material is heated above 80 C. Two approaches to generate higher electrolyte conductivities at ambient temperatures are being developed. In the first, organic solvents are added to the polymer to plasticize it and dissolve the microcrystallites. This increases the conductivity but raises the possibility of fires if the <b>battery</b> <b>casing</b> ruptures during high charge or discharge conditions or when the device is punctured by impact. The alternative is to design new polymers that are good solid electrolyte media but which are completely amorphous and have low glass transition temperatures. Such a polymer is MEEP (poly[bis(methoxyethoxy) phosphazene]), first synthesized in the author`s laboratories. The main objective was to develop crosslinking methods for MEEP which could be used on a mass production scale to produce thin film rechargeable lithium batteries.

This thesis analyse the potential of using a cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter as the propulsion inverter. With a multilevel inverter, the battery is divided into several parts and the inverter can now create voltages in smaller voltage levels than the two-level inverter.

The benefit is that the separate inverter can be omitted. In this thesis, measurements and parameterisations of the battery cells are performed at the current and frequency levels that are present in a multilevel inverter drive system. The derived model shows a great match to the measurements for different operating points and frequencies. Further, full drive cycle simulations are performed for the two analysed systems. It is shown that the inverter loss is greatly reduced with the multilevel inverter topology, mainly due to the possibility to use MOSFETs instead of IGBTs. However, the battery packs in a multilevel inverter experience a current far from DC when creating the AC-voltages to the electric machine. This leads to an increase of the battery loss but looking at the total inverter-battery losses, the system shows an efficiency improvement over the classical two-level system for all but one drive cycle. In the NEDC drive cycle the losses are reduced by 30 % but in the demanding US 06 drive cycle the losses are increased by 11 % due to the high reactive power demand at high speed driving. These figures are valid for a plug-in hybrid with a 50 km electrical range where no filter capacitors are used. In a pure electric vehicle, there is always an energy benefit of using a multilevel converter since a larger battery will have lower losses. By placing capacitors over the inputs of the H-bridges, the battery current is filtered. Two different capacitor chemistries are analysed and experimentally verified and an improvement is shown, even for a small amount of capacitors and especially at cold operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of Lithium-ion batteries {{continues to grow}} {{with the introduction of}} more electronic devices, electric cars, and energy storage. Yet the optimization approach taken by the manufacturers and system designers is one of test and build, an approach that nearly every other industry has long abandoned. A computational model is required to reduce the expensive build-test cycle and allow safer, cheaper batteries to be built. The path to building this computational model will involve many different processes and one of those processes dictates the homogenizing of the interior of the <b>battery</b> <b>casing</b> by treating the interior as a homogenized Representative Volume Element. This study explains this process and outlines a procedure for the development of this particular model for both cylindrical and prismatic / pouch cells. Over twenty different mechanical tests were performed on fully-discharged cylindrical and pouched / prismatic lithium-ion batteries, in casings and without casings under multiple loading conditions. These included lateral indentation by a rod, axial compression, through-thickness compression, in-plane unconfined compression, in-plane confined compression, hemispherical punch indentation and three-point bending. Extensive testing on the battery cell and jelly roll of 18650 lithium ion cylindrical cell, combined with the use of analytical solutions to estimate material properties of the cell, yielded the development of a finite element model. It was found that the suitably calibrated model of high density compressible foam provided a very good prediction of the crash behavior of cylindrical battery cell subjected to high intensity lateral and axial loads. For the prismatic / pouch cell, the measured load-displacement data allowed calculation of the individual compression stress-strain curves for the separator, the active anode and cathode materials. The average stress-volumetric strain relation was derived from averaging the properties of individual layers as well as from direct measurement on the bare cell. This information was then used as an input to the FE model of the cell. The model was composed of shell elements representing the Al and Cu foil and solid elements for the active material with a binder lumped together with the separator. Very good correlation was obtained between LS-Dyna numerical simulation and test results for the through-thickness compression, punch indentation and confined compression. Closed form solutions were also derived for the latter three problems which helped explain the underlying physics and identified important groups of parameters. It was also demonstrated that a thin Mylar pouch enclosure provided considerable reinforcement and in some cases changed the deformation and failure mechanism.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{electric}} vehicle (EV) market, the mechanical safety of lithium-ion batteries has become a critical concern for car and battery manufacturers as well as the public. Lithium-ion battery cells consist of cathode, anode, separator and shell casing or aluminum plastic cover. Among them, the shell casing provides substantial strength and fracture resistance under mechanical loading, and the failure of the separator determines onset of internal short circuit of the cell. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, a plasticity and fracture model of the <b>battery</b> shell <b>casing</b> by taking the anisotropic plasticity and stress-state dependent fracture into account was developed. The shell casing model is calibrated and validated at both specimen and component levels. This shell casing model, together with homogenized jellyroll model could predict mechanical behavior of single cylindrical 18650 cell well and could serve for battery pack crash simulation purposes. Another part of this thesis is mechanical test, characterization and modeling of battery separators since the mechanical properties of separators are crucial to internal shorts of lithium-ion batteries. Mechanical properties of commercially available four typical separators that including polypropylene (PP), trilayer (PP-PE-PP), ceramic-coated and nonwoven separators were compared, such as in-plane tensile strength, out-of-plane compression strength and puncture strength. Two distinct failure modes of dry-processed separators under biaxial loading were observed in the tests and used to explain the differences in short circuit characteristics of same cells. A conservative defection-based failure criterion for predicting of onset of short from experimental data was proposed. Numerical model of separator was developed and it succeeded in predicting the response of PP separator under biaxial loading. Owing to the micro porous semi-crystalline nature of widely used PP separator, interrupted tests of PP separator under different in-plane tension including machine direction, transverse direction and diagonal direction were conducted in order to reveal deformation mechanism at the micrometer level. Through scanning electric microscopy (SEM) observation and X-ray diffraction of deformed regions from interrupted test specimens, deformation sequences of micro fibrils and lamellae blocks of PP separator are reported. Lastly, significant mechanical degradation of separator due to charge-discharge cycling was described. by Xiaowei Zhang. Thesis: Ph.

The {{current state of}} practice comprises four steps. Liquids from <b>battery,</b> gearboxes <b>casing,</b> brake fluid, coolant and air conditioning circuit are first collected. Tyres, catalysts, windscreens and windows are then manually removed, prior to the shredding of the car. A magnetic separation is processed on the shredded materials, to recover valuable ferrous components. The remaining part (Automotive Shredder Residue - ASR) undergoes successive separation steps, leading among others to two potentially valuable fractions, one mostly composed of plastics (P 1) and the other of iron oxides (P 2). Currently, P 2 and P 1 are respectively landfilled or used as a fuel source in various processes. In the blast furnace (BF) and the electric arc furnace (EAF) routes, P 1 {{could be used as}} substitute for coal or coke, and P 2 could replace part of the ore, provided some elements (Cl, Cu, Zn) are removed. Chlorinated compounds (PVC) can release toxics (dioxin) or corrosive metal chlorides, detrimental to the installations and the environment. Copper can spoil the cast-iron produced, and zinc favors the development of scabs that modify the flow configuration inside the BF. The whole objective of REFORBA is to assess the possibility of using "purified" fractions P 1 and P 2 in the BF and the EAF, as reducing agents or "iron ore". This would provide steelmakers with raw materials cheaper than coke. As additional potential benefits the amount of CO 2 generated in the processes and the volume of landfilled shredded residues would be lowered. Representative fractions of P 1 and P 2 are obtained by sampling an industrial line of treatment. Comprehensive chemical characterization (ICP-AES, SEM, FTIR, thermal analyses) is performed to know the global content and localization of materials containing chemicals to remove. Sorting operations (grinding, screening, magnetic, eddy current, and sink float separations) are then performed on P 1 and P 2, until the modeled BF global heat and flow profiles match the classical configuration.

The purpose of this Cal Poly senior project, VeloElectric, was to design, build, and test a kinetic energy harvester for bicycles {{that can be used}} to charge common mobile devices via USB. This senior project team created a device that attaches directly to a bicycle and uses vibrations to generate energy, which in turn powers a variety of portable devices. The final product will be used by Professor Lynne Slivovsky on a bike ride from Canada to Mexico. This document contains information on the entire project during the 2014 - 2015 school year. The “Background” section summarizes research and case studies including dynamo chargers and an electromagnetic induction charger called the nPower PEG. The Pedl team used this information to generate initial design ideas such as using piezoelectrics and other kinetic energy harvesting devices. This research was also used to gain a better understanding of the current state of art for this type of product. The end of the background section provides details of the project management plan that was used through the course of the projects focusing heavily on the tasks completed during Spring quarter. Following the “Background” section is an explanation of the development of conceptual designs that lead to the final product. Conceptual designs included decision matrices to decide on a 3 D printed exterior casing, Velcro straps for attachment, electromagnetic induction for energy generation, and a battery for energy storage. Diagrams, models and pictures of the end product are displayed and analyzed in the “Description of Final Design” section. This section shows the exterior casing that was created to house the inner <b>casing,</b> <b>battery,</b> and printed circuit board. The “Product Realization” section focuses on how a lathe was used to create the final inner casing, 3 D printing for the exterior casing and inner casing caps, and simple soldering for the electrical components. The section also explains how the final prototype cost the team about $ 200, but through mass production could be lowered to about $ 45. The “Design Verification” section discusses how the final iteration was tested and includes test descriptions and photos while documenting the results of these tests. Example tests include weight, bike transfer time, USB compatibility, and vibrational tolerance. The document concludes by discussing the progress that was made on the project throughout the year and the recommendations that the design team has for possible future teams assigned to this task...|$|R
