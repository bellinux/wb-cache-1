5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a <b>black</b> <b>Rosewood</b> resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns. Although state and local authorities {{were aware of the}} violence, no arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black residents; none ever moved back.|$|E
50|$|When {{the posse}} {{arrives at the}} Carrier home, Aunt Sarah {{attempts}} to placate the angry crowd. However, when she announces that Fanny Taylor's attacker had been a white man, someone in the crowd shoots her. She subsequently dies of her injuries. The posse comes and Sylvester shoots and kills them. After Aunt Sarah's murder, the posse launches an outright assault on Rosewood. Mann {{is on his way}} out of town when he witnesses the lynching of Sam Carter, the blacksmith. Changing his mind about leaving, Mann returns to Rosewood to fight alongside the residents. Some white men who live in Rosewood help <b>black</b> <b>Rosewood</b> residents escape. Railroad conductors smuggled people out of town on trains. Wright asks the train conductors to pick up the women and children while his wife hides several other African-Americans in their home. Other whites attempt to squelch the rising violence with little success.|$|E
50|$|The reserve {{houses a}} {{tropical}} dry forest ecosystem, within the reserve the flora consists of over 500 species of plants and tropical dry trees, such as pochote, <b>black</b> <b>rosewood,</b> mahogany, hogplum and guacuco, {{as well as a}} large variety and amount of orchids. The fauna consists of mammals such as variegated squirrels, opossums, anteaters, pacas, jaguarundis, howler and white-faced capuchin monkeys. As well as a variety of reptiles such as green iguanas and common boas. Over 230 species of birds have been documented in the reserve, oropendolas, falcons, hummingbirds, and 65 species of migratory birds are present. Two-hundred twenty species of butterflies have been documented in the reserve, including 25 first records for Nicaragua and dozens of mollusks. Lake Apoyo also contains a variety of fish species, including six endemic species of cichlids in the genus Amphilophus. One of these species is the arrow cichlid (Amphilophus zaliosus), described in 1976. Three additional species were described in 2008, by the multinational research team directed by the Nicaraguan NGO, FUNDECI/GAIA, which manages a research station on the shore of the lake. Two additional species were discovered in 2010. The remaining two cichlids were only described in 2010. In addition to the endemics, three cichlids (Parachromis managuense, Oreochromis aureus, and O. niloticus) are found in the lake, but these were introduced by man.|$|E

50|$|The Rosewood Massacre {{occurred}} in Levy County {{in the first}} week of January 1923. It was a race riot in which whites from the nearby town of Sumner, reacting to the alleged rape of a white woman by a black man, burned the predominantly <b>black</b> town of <b>Rosewood</b> to the ground and killed several blacks. A film based on the incident was made in 1997, but was not filmed in Levy County.|$|R
50|$|Rosewood is a 1997 American {{historical}} fiction drama film directed by John Singleton. While based on historic {{events of the}} 1923 Rosewood massacre in Florida, when a white mob killed blacks and destroyed their town, the film introduces fictional characters and changes from historic accounts. In a major change, it stars Ving Rhames as an outsider who comes into Rosewood and inspires residents to self-defense, wielding his pistols in a fight. The supporting cast includes Don Cheadle as Sylvester Carrier, a resident who was a witness, defender {{of his family and}} victim of the riot; and Jon Voight as a sympathetic white store owner who lives in a village near Rosewood. The three characters become entangled in an attempt to save people from racist whites attacking the <b>blacks</b> of <b>Rosewood.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{electric}} guitars in {{this range}} are {{manufactured in the}} Far East and typically sold {{as part of a}} starter package with a Squier SP-10 practice amplifier (e.g. [...] "Starcaster Strat Pack"). In 2006-2007 the Fender website identified them as being sold through Best Buy, Target, Sam's Club, and Costco outlets. Different finishes were available exclusively from each outlet, for example 3-tone sunburst with rosewood fretboard from Best Buy, black with maple fingerboard from Target, metallic <b>black</b> with <b>rosewood</b> fingerboard and pearloid scratchplate (Model No. 0283001165) from Sam's Club. Although the range was withdrawn from the Fender website in 2007, it continues to be developed and is now sold through a variety of outlets, such as BJ's Wholesale Club, Amazon.com and Buy.com. Most of these guitars are Stratocasters but some early versions (sometimes called S1) had an arrow shaped headstock similar to the Fender Swinger.|$|R
50|$|Areas {{associated}} with semi-permanent water support shallow freshwater sedgelands. Bimble box grows in periodically flooded depressions on sandplains and alluvial plains. On dryland areas there are extensive woodlands of belah, <b>black</b> oak, western <b>rosewood</b> and leopardwood. A relatively large expanse of Whitewood - Western Rosewood low woodland occurs on the stony tablelands. There are small patches of supplejack dominated woodland and Western Peneplain woodlands dominated by coolibah and beefwood or ironwood. Gidgee and occasionally Whitewood tall shrublands, mulga (Acacia spp.) communities and Aeolian dunefields comprising patches of gum coolibah woodland also occur.|$|R
500|$|News of {{the armed}} {{standoff}} at the Carrier house attracted white men {{from all over the}} state to take part. [...] Reports were carried in the St. Petersburg Independent, the Florida Times-Union, the Miami Herald, and The Miami Metropolis, in versions of competing facts and overstatement. The Miami Metropolis listed 20 black people and four white people dead and characterized the event as a [...] "race war". National newspapers also put the incident on the front page. The Washington Post and St. Louis Dispatch described a band of [...] "heavily armed Negroes" [...] and a [...] "negro desperado" [...] as being involved. Most of the information came from discrete messages from Sheriff Walker, mob rumors, and other embellishments to part-time reporters who wired their stories to the Associated Press. Details about the armed standoff were particularly explosive. [...] According to historian Thomas Dye, [...] "The idea that <b>blacks</b> in <b>Rosewood</b> had taken up arms against the white race was unthinkable in the Deep South".|$|R

They watched a white man leave {{by the back door}} later in the morning before noon. [...] She said Taylor did emerge from her home showing evidence of having been beaten, but it was well after morning. Carrier's grandson and Philomena's brother, Arnett Goins, sometimes went with them; he had seen the white man before. His name was John Bradley and he worked for the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Carrier told others in the black community what she had seen that day; the <b>black</b> community of <b>Rosewood</b> understood that Fannie Taylor had a white lover, they got into a fight that day, and he beat her. When the man left Taylor's house, he went to Rosewood.|$|R

Fanny, who has a history of cuckolding her husband, has a rendezvous with her lover while her husband is at work. Fanny argues with her lover, who ends up beating her. Aunt Sarah and her granddaughter, Lee Ruth, overhear the argument and subsequent beating but do not intervene. A distraught Fanny, despairing of explaining her injuries to her husband, leaves her house and calls for help. She then tells several townspeople that she has been attacked by a black man. The white residents readily believe Fanny's claim. Hearing of an escaped black convict, a posse from Sumner and nearby towns go to Rosewood to investigate. The <b>black</b> residents of <b>Rosewood</b> quickly become targeted by a white mob, including men from out of state and members of the Ku Klux Klan.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Voight {{appeared}} in six films, beginning with Rosewood, {{based on the}} 1923 destruction of the primarily <b>black</b> town of <b>Rosewood,</b> Florida, by the white residents of nearby Sumner. Voight played John Wright, a white Rosewood storeowner who follows his conscience and protects his black customers from the white rage. Voight next {{appeared in}} Anaconda. Set in the Amazon, Voight played Paul Sarone, a snake hunter obsessed with a fabled giant anaconda, who hijacks an unwitting National Geographic film crew looking for a remote Indian tribe. Voight next appeared in a supporting role in Oliver Stone's U Turn, portraying a blind man. Voight took a supporting role in The Rainmaker, adopted from the John Grisham novel and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. He played an unscrupulous lawyer representing an insurance company, facing off with a neophyte lawyer played by Matt Damon. His last film of 1997 was Boys Will Be Boys, a family comedy directed by Dom DeLuise.|$|R

The mob also {{destroyed}} the white church in <b>Rosewood.</b> Many <b>black</b> residents fled for safety into the nearby swamps, some clothed only in their pajamas. Wilson Hall {{was nine years old}} at the time; he later recounted his mother waking him to escape [...] into the swamps early in the morning when it was still dark; the lights from approaching cars of white men could be seen for miles. The Hall family walked [...] through swampland to the town of Gulf Hammock. The survivors recall that it was uncharacteristically cold for Florida, and people suffered when they spent several nights in raised wooded areas called hammocks to evade the mob. Some took refuge with sympathetic white families. Sam Carter's 69-year-old widow hid for two days in the swamps, then was driven by a sympathetic white mail carrier, under bags of mail, to join her family in Chiefland.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the OnePlus X {{features}} a smooth glass back with textured aluminium bezels which provides a good grip on {{the frame of the}} phone. Both versions of the phone feature a dark glass back reminiscent of the glass back on the iPhone 4. The phone inherits the alert slider first found on the OnePlus 2 which toggles between All, Priority Only and No notifications. Due to the smaller form factor of the phone the internal battery was smaller compared to the OnePlus 2, coming in at 2,525 mAh compared to the latter's 3,300 mAh battery. The lower price of the phone also meant that the fingerprint sensor previously present on the OnePlus 2 has been omitted along with other features like optical image stabilization and swappable back covers. Oddly, the USB Type-C connector of the OnePlus 2 has not been carried over to the OnePlus X and the phone uses the micro USB instead of the newer USB-Type C connector. OnePlus has released textured back covers for the OnePlus X which resemble the styles of the swappable StyleSwap Covers for the OnePlus 2 with Bamboo, <b>Rosewood,</b> <b>Black</b> Apricot and Kevlar backs.|$|R
500|$|Initially, <b>Rosewood</b> {{had both}} <b>black</b> and white settlers.

6000|$|It is odd, however, that {{a gentleman}} so {{burdened}} with engagements,--and noted, too, for punctuality,--should linger thus {{in an old}} lonely mansion, which he has never seemed very fond of visiting. The oaken chair, to be sure, may tempt him with its roominess. It is, indeed, a spacious, and, allowing for the rude age that fashioned it, a moderately easy seat, with capacity enough, at all events, and offering no restraint to the Judge's breadth of beam. A bigger man might find ample accommodation in it. His ancestor, now pictured upon the wall, with all his English beef about him, used hardly to present a front extending from elbow to elbow of this chair, or a base that would cover its whole cushion. But there are better chairs than this,--mahogany, <b>black</b> walnut, <b>rosewood,</b> spring-seated and damask-cushioned, with varied slopes, and innumerable artifices to make them easy, and obviate the irksomeness of too tame an ease,--a score of such might be at Judge Pyncheon's service.

Mamma would advance to meet him, with outstretched hand; the virgin daughter, elderly as he has now got to be,--an old widower, as he smilingly describes himself,--would shake up the cushion for the Judge, and do her pretty utmost to make him comfortable. For the Judge is a prosperous man. He cherishes his schemes, moreover, like other people, and reasonably brighter than most others; or did so, at least, as he lay abed this morning, in an agreeable half-drowse, planning the business of the day, and speculating on the probabilities of the next fifteen years. With his firm health, and the little inroad that age has made upon him, fifteen years or twenty--yes, or perhaps five-and-twenty!--are no more than he may fairly call his own. Five-and-twenty years for the enjoyment of his real estate in town and country, his railroad, bank, and insurance shares, his United States stock,--his wealth, in short, however invested, now in possession, or soon to be acquired; together with the public honors that have fallen upon him, and the weightier ones that are yet to fall!

500|$|Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two {{brothers}} were {{hidden by the}} Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept {{out of the house}} to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: [...] "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long... We got on our bellies and crawled. We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad." [...] Several other white residents of Sumner hid <b>black</b> residents of <b>Rosewood</b> and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville's black community took in many of Rosewood's evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets.

Survivors and their descendants organized to sue the state for having failed to protect <b>Rosewood's</b> <b>black</b> community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned {{a report on the}} massacre. As a result of the findings, Florida became the first U.S. state to compensate survivors and their descendants for damages incurred because of racial violence.

[...] Officially, the recorded death toll of the first week of January 1923 was eight (six black and two white). Historians disagree about this number. Some survivors' stories claim there may have been up to 27 black residents killed, and assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths. Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the Carrier house siege, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house. [...] Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people; one remembers a plow brought from Cedar Key that covered 26 bodies. Others claimed as many as 150 people were killed. However, by the time authorities investigated these claims, most of the witnesses were dead, or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories.|$|R
