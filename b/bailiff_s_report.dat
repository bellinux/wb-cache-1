40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{cultural}} underpinnings of accounting practices through a comparative analysis of India and New Zealand, using the chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report,</b> which is increasingly becoming one of the most important segments of the corporate annual report. Design/methodology/approach – The annual reports of Indian and New Zealand companies from 2001 to 2005 were selected to investigate the extent and nature of information disclosure in their chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report.</b> “Content analysis” is the main methodological orientation of the paper. Findings – The paper argues that, contrary to propositions based on Hofstede 2 ̆ 7 s cultural framework, Indian companies provide more disclosure in their chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report</b> than their New Zealand counterparts. This leads to the conclusion that voluntary disclosure, more generally, is a complex phenomenon and cultural variables alone may not be sufficient predictors of the voluntary disclosure practices of a country. Originality/value – Using India and New Zealand, two countries with significant cultural differences, according to Hofstede 2 ̆ 7 s typology, the paper extends the literature by focusing on the chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report,</b> a more recent accounting phenomenon which is gaining popularity across the globe...|$|R

40|$|Despite growing {{evidence}} suggesting that women engage in verbal and physical dating aggression, there is a dearth of research examining the predictors of women 2 ̆ 7 s engagement in these behaviors. Utilizing a college sample, {{the purpose of the}} current study was to explore women 2 ̆ 7 s perpetration of dating aggression within the context of victimization experiences. Women (N = 374) completed surveys {{at the beginning and end}} of a 10 -week academic quarter for course credit. Results from two retrospective regression analyses (all Time 1 variables) suggested that (1) paternal physical abuse and adolescent/adulthood verbal victimization predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of verbal perpetration and (2) childhood sexual abuse, adolescent/adulthood verbal victimization, adolescent/adulthood physical victimization, and adolescent/adulthood verbal perpetration predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of physical perpetration. Results from the two prospective, longitudinal regression analyses suggested that (1) verbal perpetration (as measured at Time 1) and verbal victimization over the interim predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of verbal perpetration over the interim and (2) physical perpetration (as measured at Time 1), verbal perpetration over the interim, and physical victimization over the interim predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of physical perpetration over the interim. These data suggest the importance of considering previous victimization experiences, mutual partner aggression, and a history of aggressive behaviors when examining women 2 ̆ 7 s use of aggression in dating relationships...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to point}} out the {{significance}} of external audit and auditor 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>reports.</b> The stability of banks and its operations are vital not only for efficient financial system functioning, but also for overall industry. The banking sector, both in developed and undeveloped countries, experienced financial crisis in the last few years. Considering these circumstances and the fact that demands of financial statements users grow in complexity, their control is essential. We provide the empirical evidence on the banking sector auditor 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> in the Republic of Serbia, with particular reference to auditor 2 ̆ 019 s opinions and audit agencies that had conducted banks audits. The review of the audit legislation and professional standards will be presented, as well as the notion of bankruptcy risk and its relevance for baking sector. Our research results indicate that special attention should be paid to banks which auditor 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>report</b> had some explanatory paragraphs or even qualification. In conclusion we highlight the red flags that may damage banks operations and emphasize the importance of keeping the high level of auditor 2 ̆ 019 s independence with the intention to provide confidence to stakeholders who form their decisions based on their report...|$|R
