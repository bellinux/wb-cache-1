5|$|A {{positive}} capsule {{review in}} the Los Angeles Times noted that the authors use logic to point out transparencies in the assertions of Transcendental Meditation. John Horgan, in his book Rational Mysticism, questions Persinger's neutrality and says that in his book he treats religious <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> spiritual practices as mental illness.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem is}} how someone's propositional attitudes (e.g. <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> desires) cause that individual's neurons to fire and muscles to contract.

40|$|The {{constructs}} of <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> memory have become closely in-tertwined in contemporary research on stereotyping. Yet {{even a few}} decades ago psychology's treatment of <b>belief</b> (stereotype) <b>and</b> memory moved along trajectories so disconnected that a link between the two might have seemed implausible. The theme of this book prompts a glance at the consequences of the relationship between <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> memory in experimental social psychology, the field that laid claim to a rigorous understandig of how beliefs about social groups shape judgments of their members. s Stereotyping and Prejudice In the connection that developed between the social psychological study of <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> the cognitive study of memory, the concept of stereotype came to be demystified in two fundamental ways.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to study the}} {{relationships}} between paranormal <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in precognitive dreams with propensity to connect unrelated events and creativity. There were 50 participants {{who took part in}} the study <b>and</b> their paranormal <b>belief</b> score was measured using the revised paranormal belief scale (RPBS) (Tobacyk, 2004) in accordance with the two factor model proposed by Lange, Irwin & Houran (2000). Their belief in precognitive dreams score was measured using a questionnaire with items from Schredl (2004) and Watt & Valášek (2011). Both paranormal <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in precognitive dreams scores were correlated, using Pearson’s product moment correlations, with propensity to connect unrelated events, as measured by a novel connections task inspired by Madey (1993), and creativity, as measured by the bridge-the-associative-gap (BAG) task (Gianotti, Mohr, Pizzagalli, Lehmann & Brugger, 2001). There was a significant positive relationship between paranormal <b>belief</b> score <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in precognitive dream score with connection task score leading to the conclusion that paranormal <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in precognitive dreams are positively and significantly related to propensity to connect unrelated events. There were no significant positive relationships between paranormal <b>belief</b> score <b>and</b> <b>belief</b> in precognitive dreams score with creativity but due to the wealth of research that suggests a link between paranormal <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> creativity, it was concluded that the lack of a significant relationship was likely due to problems with the BAG task...|$|R

The highest god was called Svarog throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names. Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and bought off with offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> rituals {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory.

After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E
