500|$|The Allied fleet {{sailed to}} Salamis, {{off the coast}} of Attica, to assist with the {{evacuation}} of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:"Men of Ionia, that what you are doing is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you." ...|$|E
500|$|Vachss said [...] "writing is {{my way of}} preaching. For me, it's always, {{always the}} message. The plot is {{something}} I contrive to deliver the message. You've got to have enough narrative force {{to get people to}} finish the book, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> give them an exciting story, you can always make your points." [...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2012, Scott {{confirmed}} that the replicants were biological in nature, and contrasted them to the androids in the Alien series: Roy Batty was an evolved... He wasn't an engine. If I cut him open, there wasn't metal, he was grown... and then within twenty years you get the first bill not passed in the Senate where they applied for replication of animals, sheep and goats and cattle and animals and they turned it down, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do that, then you can do human beings. If you go deeper into it and say 'Yeah, {{but if you are}} going to grow a human being, does he start that big and I've got to see him through everything?' ...|$|E
2500|$|Non video-game {{publications}} {{praised the}} quality of the game as well. CiN Weekly gave it a score of 92 out of 100 and stated that [...] "The improved single-player games are worthwhile enough on their own, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find well connected online matches, multiplayer games will keep you addicted for months." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it a score of four stars out of five, saying, [...] "Space conflict complements ground-based action beautifully and jumping into the cockpit of an X-wing or TIE fighter is thrilling." [...] Detroit Free Press gave the Xbox version a score of three stars out of four and said that [...] "The graphics are pretty, the score divine, the story-driven single-player game is actually cinematic and engaging and the lag, while annoying at times online, has been greatly reduced from the original." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to}} be some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|Scott {{was silent}} for a few moments and then looked up. [...] "You can begin work to-morrow and Mr. Thirlwell will pay you what you're worth. We'll make no further promise, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell us {{anything}} you think important." ...|$|R

2500|$|Pretty Little Liars {{opened with}} mixed reviews. Metacritic gave the pilot episode 52 out of 100, based upon 14 {{critical}} reviews. The New York Daily News gave the show a positive review, commenting that it [...] "makes most popular vampire romances look anemic", while concluding, [...] "Pretty Little Liars {{could go in}} several directions, including mundane teen clichés. It's got an equally good shot at making us care about these imperfect pretty girls." [...] A writer on Terror Hook has stated that [...] " [...] 'Pretty Little Liars' gets off to a very promising start. Great production all around, the writing keeps the viewer on their toes, and the acting just reinforces it. The overall mystery of the show in the end is dark and unpredictable, even stepping into the slasher film realm." [...] The New York Post gave the show three out of five stars, stating, [...] "OK, so we've established {{that there is no}} socially redeeming value in this series and that your kids shouldn't watch it if they are too young and impressionable. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> distract them enough to miss the first 15 minutes, the show isn't half-bad. Actually, it is half-good, if that makes sense." [...] The Los Angeles Times wrote that the series is [...] "one of those shows that manages to mildly, and perhaps unintentionally, spoof its genre while fully participating in it, and that's not a bad thing at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rolling Stone's {{reviewer}} {{gave the}} album 3 of 5 stars, {{and found that}} the album was best without the extensive concept surrounding much of the music, stating that [...] "there's way too much conceptual malarkey surrounding the songs, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> ignore her fake posse, you'll find this is Amos' best album in many years". Sputnik Music gave a 3 star review, calling it a [...] "return to form - sort of". The review for PopMatters was very positive, giving it an 8/10 score, praising Amos' assured vocals as [...] "top form" [...] and finding [...] "moments of jaw-dropping virtuosity", but also criticising the length of the album and lack of editing. SPIN gave a glowing review, giving the record a 9/10 score, calling it [...] "arguably the singer/pianist's greatest, and undeniably sexiest, album" [...] and [...] "instantly memorable". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C+ review, calling it a [...] "conceptual wreck", but appreciating the freshness of Amos engaging in glam-rock territory. Mojo, Billboard and NOW Magazine likewise advised Amos to avoid heavy-handed concepts, giving the album average reviews. Slant magazine gave American Doll Posse 3.5 of 5 stars, criticising the structure as alienating, but finding the music itself to be Amos' best since From the Choirgirl Hotel (1998), especially favouring the lead single [...] "Big Wheel" [...] as a straightforward and lively song. Music OHM gave a 4 star review, calling it a coherent and intriguing record, albeit a bit inaccessible conceptually. The Boston Globe was very positive, hailing the record as [...] "a lush sprawl of an album that works with or without the feminist playbook". In general, critical consensus for the album found it to be a return-to-form musically, but questioned Amos' penchant for potentially overwrought concepts and calling for tighter editing.|$|E

Please to {{remember}} that we know all about you, and we won't stand any nonsense from <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> my brother really hurt you, he'll {{be willing to do}} the fair thing; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> gouge him in any way, you've got another guess coming." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Oliver smiled understandingly. [...] "That's sensible.
