25|$|Liszt's own {{point of}} view {{regarding}} programme music can for the time of his youth be taken from the preface of the Album d'un voyageur (1837). According to this, a landscape could evoke a certain kind of mood. Since a piece of music could also evoke a mood, a mysterious resemblance with the landscape could <b>be</b> <b>imagined.</b> In this sense the music would not paint the landscape, but it would match the landscape in a third category, the mood.|$|E
25|$|Social {{psychology}} is the {{scientific study of}} how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, scientific refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms thoughts, feelings, and behaviors include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may <b>be</b> <b>imagined</b> or implied suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms.|$|E

25|$|The {{electromagnetic}} waves in a (metal-pipe) waveguide may <b>be</b> <b>imagined</b> as travelling down the guide in a zig-zag path, being repeatedly reflected between opposite {{walls of the}} guide. For the particular case of rectangular waveguide, {{it is possible to}} base an exact analysis on this view. Propagation in a dielectric waveguide may be viewed in the same way, with the waves confined to the dielectric by total internal reflection at its surface. Some structures, such as non-radiative dielectric waveguides and the Goubau line, use both metal walls and dielectric surfaces to confine the wave.|$|E
25|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first <b>be</b> <b>imagined.</b> It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.|$|E
25|$|However, the First Cause {{does not}} {{necessarily}} have to be temporally the first. Thus, {{the question of whether}} or not the universe can <b>be</b> <b>imagined</b> as eternal was fiercely debated in the Middle Ages. The University of Paris's condemnation of 1270 denounced the belief that the world is eternal. Aquinas' intellectual rival, Bonaventure, held that the temporality of the universe is demonstrable by reason. Aquinas' position was that the temporality of the world is an article of faith, and not demonstrable by reason; though one could reasonably conclude either that the universe is temporal or eternal.|$|E

25|$|Implicitly {{for this}} definition, the second law of {{thermodynamics}} provides information that establishes the virtuous {{character of the}} temperature so defined. It provides that any working substance that complies with the requirement stated in this definition {{will lead to the}} same ratio of thermodynamic temperatures, which in this sense is universal, or absolute. The second law of thermodynamics also provides that the thermodynamic temperature defined in this way is positive, because this definition requires that the heat reservoirs not be in thermal equilibrium with one another, and the cycle can <b>be</b> <b>imagined</b> to operate only in one sense if net work is to be supplied to the work reservoir.|$|E
25|$|The law of {{treasure}} trove in the United States varies {{from state to}} state, but certain general conclusions may be drawn. To be {{treasure trove}}, an object must be of gold or silver. Paper money is also deemed to be treasure trove since it previously represented gold or silver. On the same reasoning, it might <b>be</b> <b>imagined</b> that coins and tokens in metals other than gold or silver are also included, but this {{has yet to be}} clearly established. The object must be concealed for long enough so {{it is unlikely that the}} true owner will reappear to claim it. The consensus appears to be that the object must be at least a few decades old.|$|E
25|$|The site {{contains}} many fine stone buildings {{in various states}} of preservation, and many have been restored. The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called sacbeob.). Archaeologists have identified over 80 sacbeob criss-crossing the site, and extending in all directions from the city. Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors. Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area. The site must <b>be</b> <b>imagined</b> as a colorful one, not like it is today. Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows cave paintings from the pre-historic period discovered by Gudahandi of Kalahandi and Yogi Matha of Nuapada district {{that represent the}} Ghumura and Damru, among other instruments. These paintings date to as early as 8000 BCE and from such painting the antiquity of musical instrument Ghumura and Damru can <b>be</b> <b>imagined.</b> The origin of Ghumura goes back to ancient times. There is a beautiful waterfall in the river valley of Indravati which was initially recognised by Chindak Naagas of Chakrakot. Many believe that Ghumura dance originated from this river valley and gradually spread into the areas between Indravati and Mahanadi, indicating this dance form belongs to the 10th century CE.|$|E
25|$|We {{think of}} the {{proposed}} Harvard library transition {{as a manifestation of}} the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot <b>be</b> <b>imagined</b> in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.|$|E
25|$|The {{scale of}} injury {{and loss of}} life was smaller than might <b>be</b> <b>imagined</b> from such an infernal night.

Figures for the injured are less reliable, but it is supposed that from 400-500 people were injured, some horribly, and many receiving treatment at the Gateshead Dispensary and the Newcastle Infirmary. At the latter hospital, the beds of the existing in-patients {{were given to the}} newly injured, and the existing in-patients—where able—tended the new charges in their beds, {{under the direction of the}} medical staff.|$|E
