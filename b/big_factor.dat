25|$|The {{complicated}} fingering and {{the problem}} of reeds make the bassoon more of a challenge to learn than some of the other woodwind instruments. Cost is another <b>big</b> <b>factor</b> in a person's decision to pursue the bassoon. Prices range from $3,000 up to $60,000 for a good-quality instrument. In North America, schoolchildren typically take up bassoon only after starting on another reed instrument, such as clarinet or saxophone.|$|E

Many peasants, while highly religious, also viewed the church unfavorably. Respect for religion did not extend to the local priests.

Pungency values for any pepper are variable, owing to expected variation within a species—easily by a factor of 10 or more—depending on seed lineage, climate (humidity is a <b>big</b> <b>factor</b> for the Bhut Jolokia; the Dorset Naga and the original Naga have quite different ratings), and even soil (this is especially true of habaneros). The inaccuracies described in the measurement methods above also contribute to the imprecision of these values.|$|E

During his eight years at the yokozuna rank, Akebono won a further eight tournament championships, for a career total of eleven, and was a runner-up on thirteen other occasions, despite suffering several serious injuries.

Detroit, Michigan and Youngstown, Ohio are the only other cities that have had population declines of at least 60% in the same time frame. The population of the city of St. Louis has been in decline since the 1960 census; during this period the population of the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, which includes more than one county, has grown every year and continues to do so.

25|$|One <b>big</b> <b>factor</b> {{that determines}} the {{resource}} usage {{and speed of}} a desktop distribution is the desktop environment it uses. For example, version 10.10 of Lubuntu uses the LXDE desktop and requires a minimum of 128MB of RAM and a PentiumII processor, though the Lubuntu project recommends 256MB - 384MB for a usable system, and at least 512MB for optimal performance; it is a lightweight variant of Ubuntu that, in comparison, uses Unity as a desktop environment and requires a 2GHz processor and 2GB of RAM. The desktop environment can be changed in most Linux distributions, and the same Linux distribution may also have various versions with different desktop environments; examples are Porteus, which comes in LXDE, Xfce and Mate versions, and Zenwalk, which comes in Xfce and Openbox versions.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers {{joined the}} Cowboys in {{their attempt to}} be the first team to ever win a third Super Bowl, after wins in Super Bowl IX and Super Bowl X.

He ranked as the second highest rated passer in the league (84.8), his 28 touchdown passes led the league, and he won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award. Wide receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth provided the team with a great deep threat. Swann recorded 61 receptions for 880 yards and 11 touchdowns, while Stallworth had 41 receptions for 798 yards and 9 touchdowns.

25|$|Many factors affect people's {{retirement}} decisions. Retirement funding {{education is}} a <b>big</b> <b>factor</b> that affects the success of an individual’s retirement experience. Social Security clearly {{plays an important role}} because most individuals solely rely on Social Security as their only retirement option, when Social Security’s both trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2034. Knowledge affects an individual’s retirement decisions by simply finding more reliable retirement options such as, Individual Retirement Accounts or Employer-Sponsored Plans. In countries around the world, people {{are much more likely to}} retire at the early and normal retirement ages of the public pension system (e.g., ages 62 and 65 in the U.S.). This pattern cannot be explained by different financial incentives to retire at these ages since typically retirement benefits at these ages are approximately actuarially fair; that is, the present value of lifetime pension benefits (pension wealth) conditional on retiring at age a is approximately the same as pension wealth conditional on retiring one year later at age a+1. Nevertheless, a large literature has found that individuals respond significantly to financial incentives relating to retirement (e.g., to discontinuities stemming from the Social Security earnings test or the tax system).|$|E
25|$|The city of Munich, Germany, has forked Kubuntu 10.04 LTS {{and created}} LiMux {{for use on}} the city's computers. After {{originally}} planning to migrate 12,000 desktop computers to LiMux, it was announced in December 2013 that the project had completed successfully with the migration of 14,800 out of 15,500 desktop computers, but still keeping about 5000 Windows clients for unported applications. In February 2017 the city decided to evaluate the migration back to Windowssome stated reasons were missing compatibility, bad user acceptance and complexity. In March 2012, the government of Iceland launched a project to get all public institutions using free and open-source software. Already, several government agencies and schools have adopted Ubuntu. The government cited cost savings as a <b>big</b> <b>factor</b> for the decision, and also stated that open source software avoids vendor lock-in. A 12-month project was launched to migrate the biggest public institutions in Iceland to using open-source software, and help ease the migration for others. US president Barack Obama's successful campaign for re-election in 2012 used Ubuntu in its IT department. In August 2014, the city of Turin, Italy, announced its migration from Windows XP to Ubuntu for the 8,300 desktop computers used by the municipality, becoming the first city in Italy to adopt Ubuntu.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} to use the Point-class cutter was one of logistics. The [...] Cape-class cutter was initially considered an option by Roland since it had a greater speed because of its four main drive engines. The Point-class cutter had only two main drive engines but they were more consistent throughout the class than the Cape-class cutters, so {{it was easier to}} supply spare parts and maintain the engines. Additional factors favoring the Point-class cutter were an unmanned engine room with all controls and alarms on the bridge, and air-conditioned living spaces, a <b>big</b> <b>factor</b> in a tropical climate where crews were expected to live on the boat whether on or off duty. [...] The 40-foot utility boats were rejected because they lacked radar, berthing, and mess facilities for extended patrols offshore.|$|E

McKay assumed that Bryant wouldn't be interested in Mitchell because he was black and Alabama had no black players on their roster. Bryant swooped in and recruited Mitchell aggressively. Although Mitchell originally was a bit nervous about the reception he would receive at Alabama, as well as the amount of playing time he could garner, his family encouraged him to return home and accept Bryant's scholarship offer. Besides his family's encouragement and Bryant's assurances that his race would not be a problem, Mitchell's opinion that Alabama's School of Social Work was one of the country's best was a <b>big</b> <b>factor</b> in his decision.|$|E

500|$|Several {{elements}} of the machine had to be properly adjusted to match the timing for the song. The group broke the song into sections, triggered when the machine passed certain gates, to account for small changes in timing that could occur (up to 0.5 sec, according to Brett Doar, one of the machine's chief designers), allowing the band to continue to lip synch while the machine operated. Smaller objects like dominoes {{were found to be}} the trickiest to set, as their patterns would be less predictable than larger and bulkier objects, which are more predominant in the later parts of the machine. Once the machine transitioned to the downstairs portion, it would generally run the rest of the course untouched. Furthermore, the time of day and temperature would play a <b>big</b> <b>factor</b> in how some small components would behave, forcing the team to readjust the timing. Ball tracks and other features had to be wiped clear of dust and debris to prevent slowing down rolling objects. A carved wooden ball track shown early in the video was created to have motions timed to the music, but required a low inclined angle that would often cause the balls to skip out of the tracks.|$|E
