50|$|The first {{generation}} 4Matic system was originally a complex electronically controlled system with automatically engaging four-wheel drive (4WD), the system employs locking central and rear differentials {{to provide additional}} traction in slippery conditions. The centre differential, {{also known as the}} transfer case, contains two clutches. Each hydraulically enabled clutch is controlled separately to allow for three modes of operation: 2WD (mode 0) where 100% of available torque is available to the rear axle while the front axle is disconnected, and two 4WD modes which allow for 35/65 front/rear axle torque split (mode 1) or 50/50 front/rear axle torque split (mode 2). The rear differential lock, previously known as ASD on Mercedes-Benz models, can also be locked (mode 3) if rear wheel slip is still present when the transfer case 50/50 4WD mode 2 is engaged. Due to safety and stability concerns there is no front differential lock. The 4Matic system uses inputs from the three channel ABS system and a steering wheel angle sensor to decide when to intervene. 4WD is disengaged automatically if the ABS service brakes are applied. Engine throttle control is not inherent in the W124 system. Two W124 variants of the 4Matic system were produced: the first system (1986-1991) used a mechanical pressure test lever to disable the system hydraulically while the second system variant (1992/1993) used an electrical test switch to <b>break</b> <b>power</b> to the system. The later system variant when in test mode allows for continued operation of the rear shock self-levelling system (SLS) when installed. Initially plagued with reliability factors, the multi-plate clutch central differentials were subject to failure; it was discontinued in 1993.|$|E
40|$|In {{the recent}} years the {{greenhouse}} effect in the atmosphere has become much stronger because of {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} on the earth. One of these gases is CO 2. This may come from combustion of fossil fuel. The international shipping fleet emitted 1046 million tons of CO 2 in 2007, which corresponds to 3. 3 % of all CO 2 emission in the world. The increase intensity of the greenhouse effect leads to global warming, which can affect the human life heavily. Ice melts, sea level increase, lands will disappear in the water, lead to heat waves, starving people, more widespread of infections, and etc. Because of this there have to be a reduction of these greenhouse gases soon. The ship fleet is expected to grow in the coming years, so the only way to reduce the emissions is to manage a strong reduction for each vessel. There have been many ideas around this, and one up and coming is Slow Steaming. This is that the vessel is reducing the velocity, which corresponds to reduced necessary <b>break</b> <b>power,</b> which may reduce the emissions. One ship operator which have tried out the slow steaming concept is The A. P. Moller Marsk group. They have slowed down the speed on some of their container vessels from 25 knots to 20 knots (slow steaming) and also tried out 12 knots(super slow steaming). They have by reduced the speed to the half, reduced the fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 30 %. But to compensate for reduced service frequency there are two options: Increase cargo capacity of the vessels or put in additional vessels on the route. Both options are reducing the profit, both environmental and economical. In this master thesis there has been performed a case study to look closer to the power prediction when reducing the velocity. Three vessels have been analyzed: a VLCC, a chemical tanker and a container vessel. These have been analyzed in the hydrodynamic workbench ShipX. A route from Le-Havre in Europe to Charleston in America has been applied in ShipX. Since waves are important in <b>break</b> <b>power</b> predictions due to added resistance, both summer season and winter season have been analyzed. The resistance was predicted by the empirical methods Holtrop 84, while the added resistance was calculated by using Gerritsma & Beukelman’s method. For each velocity and each vessel was it calculated an optimal propeller (Wageningen B-series). As expected the <b>break</b> <b>power</b> increased exponential for increasing speed for all three vessels in calm water condition, summer season and winter season. But when I looked closer to an added factor, which is the proportion between <b>break</b> <b>power</b> respectively in summer/winter season over calm water, this was largest for low speeds and decreased when the speed was increased. This means relatively the wave contribution of necessary <b>break</b> <b>power</b> is largest for low speeds. An example of this is that for four to six knots with the container vessel, the <b>break</b> <b>power</b> in calm water had to be multiplied by 2. 2 (120 % increase) to get real <b>break</b> <b>power</b> in summer waves. The added factor for 24 knots was only 1. 21 (21 % increase). When it comes to optimum speed for a vessel, realistic weather conditions have a strong influence here. In realistic weather both size of waves and direction of waves are varying. If the ship is traveling in small waves, the optimum speed will be much higher than if it’s going in rough sea states. There is also big difference if there is head sea, beam sea or following sea. Other factor for finding an optimum speed for a vessel is economic (profit versus costs), value and durability of cargo, demand of transportation, engine performance and etc...|$|E

The CO 2 {{concentration in}} exhaust was in a positive correlation to NOx, brake power, and torque. This is because the consumption of O 2 generated CO 2 and NOx and the energy conversion resulted in the corresponding brake power and torque. In addition, the NOx concentration in exhaust was a sum of substances such as NO and NO 2, and thus it was in a “positive” correlation to the CO 2 concentration.

Biodiesels have lot of good advantages over diesel which attract the users to use it as the substitute of diesel.

However, for the widespread practical applicability of biodiesel more investigation is required related to the engine performance and emission.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} in which both Fanaroff and Riley class I and II extragalactic jets are produced by magnetized accretion disk coronae in the ergospheres of rotating black holes. It employs a hybrid version of the Blandford-Payne and Blandford-Znajek magnetohydrodynamic mechanisms (similar to the Punsly-Coroniti model, {{with the addition of}} a metric-shear-driven dynamo) and a generalized form of the magnetic switch, which is shown to be the MHD analog of the Eddington luminosity. While the jets are produced in the ergospheric accretion disk itself, the output power still is an increasing function of the black hole angular momentum. For high enough spin, the black hole triggers the magnetic switch, producing highly-relativistic, kinetic-energy-dominated jets instead of magnetic-energy-dominated ones for lower spin. The coronal mass densities needed to trigger the switch at the observed FR <b>break</b> <b>power</b> are quite small (∼ 10 − 15 g cm − 3), implying that the source of the jet material may be either a pair plasma or very tenuous electron-proton corona, not the main accretion disk itself.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a {{detailed}} study of a new sample of large angular size FR I and FR II radio galaxies and compare {{the properties of the}} two classes. As expected, a pure morphology based distinction of FR Is and FR IIs corresponds to a break in total radio power. The radio cores in FR Is are also weaker than in FR IIs, although there is not a well defined <b>break</b> <b>power.</b> We find that asymmetry {{in the structure of the}} sample members must be the consequence of anisotropies in the medium where the lobes expand, with orientation playing a minor role. Moreover, literature data and our observations at kiloparsec scales suggest that the large differences between the structures of FR I and FR II radio galaxies must arise from the poorly known central kiloparsec region of their host galaxies. We analyze the sub-sample of giant radio galaxies, and do not find evidence that these large objects require higher core powers. Our results are consistent with giant radio galaxies being the older population of normal FR I and FR II objects evolving in low density environments. Comparing results from our sample with predictions from the radio luminosity function we find no evidence of a possible FR II to FR I evolution. Moreover, we conclude that at z ∼ 0. 1, one out of four FR II radio sources has a linear size above 500 kpc, thus being in an advanced stage of evolution (for example, older than ∼ 10 Myr assuming a jet-head velocity of 0. 1 c). Radio activity seems to be a short-lived process in active galaxies, although in some cases recurrent: five objects in our sample present signs of reactivation in their radio structures.

40|$|Modelling interdependent {{infrastructure}} {{systems is}} a challenging task, and the available {{information about the}} infrastructures is often limited. Although a number of methods for modelling interdependent infrastructures have been developed, only a few detailed case studies of risk analysis of real-world interdependent infrastructure systems have been conducted. The objective of this thesis was to present such a case study, and show {{that it is possible}} to model interdependent infrastructures with limited amount of information. This thesis contributes to and extends the work of an unpublished case study by Brunner et al. (n. d.), where a risk analysis of the power and water distribution systems on the island of St. Kitts is performed in relation to the hurricane threat to the island. In the case study, simulation models are used to perform analyses of the power and water distribution systems, as well as for simulating hurricanes and studying the effect of them on the systems. The water distribution system is dependent on the power system due to wells that require electrical power to pump water into the system. Thus, when hurricanes <b>break</b> <b>power</b> poles and cause power outages on the island, the water distribution system is also affected. The information about the infrastructures and the hurricanes that the models are based upon, were publicly available information. Brunner et al. (n. d.) performed analyses of the power system to identify the most vulnerable parts of the system by simulating historical hurricanes to analyze how these hurricanes affected the power and water distribution systems. This thesis extended to the work of Brunner et al. (n. d.) by performing a synthetic hurricane analysis, where hurricanes were constructed and simulated in order to see if these could provide additional information beyond what the simulation of the historical hurricanes gave. Also, an individual water node analysis was performed, where the wells were analyzed by removing the dependency on electrical power during the simulations for one well at the time. The results of the performed analyses in this case study have provided information that is valuable from a risk management perspective. It has been shown that risk analyses where interdependent infrastructures are modelled can be conducted, even when only publicly available information is used. The main findings of the risk analysis were that the most vulnerable part of the power system was the powerline that encompasses the eastern side of the island from the main city of Basseterre in the south to the northernmost part of the island. For power outages lasting for multiple days, also a central part of the power system located in Basseterre was found to be particularly vulnerable. In cases where the entire island is affected by a power outage, the most critical wells were found to be the wells located on the western side of the island. The simulation of historical and synthetic hurricanes identified which hurricanes that have the potential to cause the worst damages. Based on these findings, possible upgrades to the infrastructures were suggested, as well as preventative measures that can be implemented to reduce the damages in case of hurricane activity...|$|E
