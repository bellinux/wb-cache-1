5|$|In 1997, brook trout, <b>brown</b> <b>trout,</b> {{and white}} suckers {{inhabited}} Scotch Run in its upper reaches. Two decades earlier, {{this part of}} the stream was also inhabited by pumpkinseeds and eastern blacknose dace, but not by <b>brown</b> <b>trout.</b> The reason for the disappearance of the blacknose dace is unknown. The pumpkinseeds were only present in the 1970s due to their escape from nearby farm ponds.|$|E

50|$|Lake Antenna is classified, {{following}} Province of Savona fishing map, as a B category {{water body}} (Acque di categoria B), thus mixed population water. The lake is also defined as touristic fishing reserve (riserva di pesca turistica), and is restocked with rainbow trouts when authorised by Parco del Beigua. Restocking with <b>brown</b> <b>trouts</b> is not permitted {{because they are}} not considered native fish. The lake {{is the subject of a}} yearly fauna survey. Access rules are defined by Provincia di Savona administration.|$|R
5|$|There are a {{total of}} eight species of wild fish in West Creek. Brook trout and <b>brown</b> <b>trout</b> both inhabit West Creek, {{although}} brook trout are slightly more common than <b>brown</b> <b>trout,</b> with nine brook trout and only seven <b>brown</b> <b>trout</b> being observed in a 2010 or 2011 electrofishing survey. Trout are more common upstream of the Pennsylvania Route 239 crossing of the creek than downstream of it. The most common fish in the creek are sculpin, eastern blacknose dace, and cutlips minnows. In the aforementioned electrofishing survey, {{a total of}} 81 sculpin, 34 black-nosed dace, and 17 cutlips minnows were observed. Other species of fish in the watershed include johnny darter, white sucker, and creek chub.|$|E
5|$|Wild trout {{naturally}} reproduce in Hammersley Fork {{from its}} headwaters downstream to its mouth. Great blue herons {{have been observed}} at the headwaters of Hammersley Fork, {{despite the fact that}} they are more commonly found in large river valleys.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{submitted}} {{with the objective}} of providing other fishery investigators with a resume of what has been accomplished in attempting to guide fish by means of subaqueous sonic vibrations. The Fish 2 ̆ 6 Wildlife Service was given the opportunity to test the effects of underwater sound of various frequencies and amplitude on fish. The tests were limited to four undersea warfare sound producing instruments involving three principles of sound production: 1) electromagnetism, 2) Piezoelectricity, and 3) the hydraulic turbine. Because young Pacific salmon were not available at the site, the physiologically similar rainbow and <b>brown</b> <b>trouts</b> were used as experimental animals...|$|R

5|$|Seven {{species of}} fish inhabit Messers Run. These include a highly {{substantial}} population of brook trout. Upstream of the Lofty Reservoir, there are two {{species of fish}} inhabiting the stream: brook trout, eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds. Three species of fish inhabit the stream between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are brook trout, <b>brown</b> <b>trout,</b> and blacknose dace. Six species of fish inhabit the stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: brook trout, blacknose dace, tessellated darters, <b>brown</b> <b>trout,</b> white suckers, and sculpins. However, only the first three species were observed during the 1990 survey of the stream.|$|E
5|$|Cold water {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and <b>brown</b> <b>trout</b> that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.

5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 sites in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace {{are the most common}} fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of the sites. White suckers and <b>brown</b> <b>trout</b> occurred at 80 percent of the sites, longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of the sites, cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent of the sites, and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of the sites. Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild <b>brown</b> <b>trout,</b> although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well.

5|$|The {{drainage}} basin of Spring Brook is {{designated as a}} High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its headwaters downstream to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476). From that point downstream to its mouth, the {{drainage basin}} of the stream is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Spring Brook from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. A 2.4-mile (4-kilometer) section of the stream from the Watres Dam downstream to the Nesbitt Reservoir is considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and <b>brown</b> <b>trout.</b> The tributaries Green Run and Panther Creek are Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout {{and part of the}} tributary Rattlesnake Creek is Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and <b>brown</b> <b>trout.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main stem of Darby Creek is {{designed}} as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 3 bridge. From that point downstream to its mouth, the non-tidal portions of the creek's main stem are a Trout Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Numerous fish species were observed in the creek during a 2009 electrofishing survey by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for smallmouth bass was slightly over 10 and the rate for rock bass was under 10. The catch per unit effort per hour rate for redbreast sunfish was 123, the highest of several warmwater streams tested during the survey. Some stocked rainbow trout and <b>brown</b> <b>trout</b> were also captured in the creek. High numbers of American eels were observed in the creek was well. Fish species such as mummichogs, silvery minnows, striped bass, and white perch were found at the head-of-tide of the creek. <b>Brown</b> <b>trout</b> naturally reproduce in the creek's headwaters.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{species of fish}} in the park: Northern pike and European perch are the most common, others include grayling, common minnow, burbot, three-spined stickleback and the least common, <b>brown</b> <b>trout.</b> The trout came up Pasvikelven about 8000 BC. The other species arrived after the last glacial period from Lake Inari and {{ultimately}} from the ten fresh-water Baltic Sea.|$|E
