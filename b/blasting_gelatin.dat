5000|$|Collodion {{was used}} by Alfred Nobel in his {{development}} of <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin,</b> a more powerful, flexible, and water resistant variation on his highly successful product, Dynamite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blasting</b> <b>gelatin,</b> {{also known}} as gelignite, was invented by Nobel in 1875, using nitroglycerin, wood pulp, and sodium or {{potassium}} nitrates. This was an early low-cost, flexible explosive.|$|E
5000|$|... 6 August 2009: Three convicts {{sentenced to}} death by special POTA court. Other two acquitted. In the {{proceedings}} of the case, accused said that they had acted emotionally in response to the Gujarat communal riots, had pleaded to be spared the death sentence. However, public prosecutor showed the court that they had, in fact, acted in cold blood and planned their attacks well. When a <b>gelatin</b> <b>blast</b> at Ghatkopar in 28 July 2003, claimed just two lives, they decided to use RDX to take a heavier toll in the twin blasts a month later, he said. They enjoyed the act of killing and deserve no mercy. The Pota court rejected all pleas of leniency and held that the brazen terror attack fell under the rarest of rare category of cases where the death sentence was well deserved.|$|R
5000|$|Gelignite (...) , {{also known}} as <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin</b> or simply jelly, is an {{explosive}} material consisting of collodion-cotton (a type of nitrocellulose or gun cotton) dissolved in either nitroglycerine or nitroglycol and mixed with wood pulp and saltpetre (sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate).|$|E
5000|$|Prior to 1910, a shell, made of {{dynamite}} and a sheet metal casing were lowered into a well and detonated by a blasting cap with a fuse. [...] By 1918, the practice had evolved to use <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin,</b> {{a mixture of}} nitroglycerin, guncotton and wood pulp.|$|E
50|$|Between 1 January 1916 and 13 March 1918, a {{total of}} 34 mines were detonated in this theatre of war. Of these, 20 were Italian mines aimed at Austro-Hungarian targets and 14 were Austro-Hungarian mines aimed at Italian targets. The size of the {{explosive}} charges ranged from 110 kg to 50,000 kg of <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin.</b> The largest Italian mine held 35,000 kg of explosive.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to building underground shelters and covered supply routes for their soldiers like the Italian Strada delle 52 Gallerie, both sides also attempted {{to break the}} stalemate of trench warfare by tunneling under no man's land and placing explosive charges beneath the enemy's positions. Between 1 January 1916 and 13 March 1918, Austro-Hungarian and Italian units fired a total of 34 mines in this theatre of the war. Focal points of the underground fighting were Pasubio with 10 mines, Lagazuoi with 5, Col di Lana/Monte Sief also with 5, and Marmolada with 4 mines. The explosive charges ranged from 110 kg to 50,000 kg of <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Swedish chemist and {{inventor}} Alfred Nobel {{found that}} when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr (diatomaceous earth) it became safer and more convenient to handle, and this mixture he patented in 1867 as dynamite. Nobel later on combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds, similar to collodion, but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. Gelignite, or <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin,</b> as it was named, was patented in 1876; and {{was followed by a}} host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances.|$|E
50|$|With few {{troops to}} support them, the {{settlers}} quickly built a laager of sandbagged wagons in {{the centre of}} Bulawayo on their own. Barbed wire was added to Bulawayo's defences. Oil-soaked fagots were arranged in strategic locations in case of attack at night. <b>Blasting</b> <b>gelatin</b> was secreted in outlying buildings that were beyond the defence perimeter, to be exploded in the event the enemy occupied them. Smashed glass bottles were spread around {{the front of the}} wagons. Except for hunting rifles, there were few weapons to be found in Bulawayo. Fortunately for settlers, there were a few working artillery pieces and a small assortment of machine guns.|$|E
5000|$|Mixed with {{nitrocellulose}} and extruded under pressure, {{diethylene glycol}} dinitrate forms a tough colloid whose characteristics (good specific impulse, moderate burn rate and temperature, great resistance to accidental ignition and casual handling) make it well suited as a smokeless powder for artillery {{and a solid}} propellant for rocketry. It was widely used in this capacity during World War II (e.g., by the Kriegsmarine). It also found use as a [...] "productive" [...] desensitizer (one {{that contributes to the}} overall power of the explosion rather than having a neutral or negative effect) in nitroglycerine and nitroglycol-based explosives such as dynamite and <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin.</b> It is also used as plasticizer for energetic materials.|$|E
5000|$|Well known {{examples}} are the mines on the Italian Front laid by Austro-Hungarian and Italian miners, where the largest individual mine contained {{a charge of}} 50,000 kg of <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin,</b> and {{the activities of the}} Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers on the Western Front. During the height of the underground war on the Western Front in June 1916, British tunnellers fired 101 mines or camouflets, while Germans tunnellers fired 126 mines or camouflets. This amounts to a total of 227 mine explosions in one month - one detonation every three hours. At the beginning of the Somme offensive, the British simultaneously detonated 19 mines of varying sizes beneath the German positions, including two mines that contained 40,000 lb of explosives.|$|E
50|$|Nobel later {{combined}} nitroglycerin {{with various}} nitrocellulose compounds, similar to collodion, but {{settled on a}} more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive, and obtained a transparent, jelly-like substance, which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite. 'Gelignite', or <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin,</b> as it was named, was patented in 1876; and {{was followed by a}} host of similar combinations, modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances. Gelignite was more stable, transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes, like those used in drilling and mining, than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the Age of Engineering bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success, though at a significant cost to his health. An offshoot of this research resulted in Nobel's invention of ballistite, the precursor of many modern smokeless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant.|$|E
50|$|In 1916, Col di Lana {{became the}} site of fierce mine warfare on the Italian Front. Lieutenant Caetani of the Italian {{engineers}} developed a plan for mining the peak, which was executed silently using hand-operating drilling machines and chisels. At the start of 1916, the Austro-Hungarian army learned through an artillery observer on Pordoi Pass that the Col di Lana summit had been mined. The Austro-Hungarians began a counter mine, and exploded this on 6 April 1916. The counter mine was, however, {{too far away from}} the Italian explosive tunnel. This was laid with five tonnes of <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatin.</b> On the night of 16/17 April 1916, the 5th Company of the 2nd Tyrolean Kaiserj√§ger regiment was relieved by the 6th Company, under Oberleutnant Anton von Tschurtschenthaler. The struggle reached its zenith on the night of 17/18 April 1916, when at around 23:30 the summit was blasted. The Austro-Hungarians under Tschurtschenthaler then had to surrender the mountain; however they were able to maintain a position on Monte Sief, which is linked to Col di Lana by a ridge, which was cut in two by a mine fired on 21 October 1917 by Austro-Hungarian soldiers, thereby obstructing the Italian breakthrough in the area.|$|E
