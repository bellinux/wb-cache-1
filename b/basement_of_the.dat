50|$|Both the children's and adults' {{buildings}} are {{connected by a}} series of underground tunnels, like many sanitariums. These walkways join <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> <b>of</b> both buildings together. <b>The</b> <b>basements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital {{buildings are}} extremely dangerous and filthy. Large pieces of rusty, sharp metal, cloth and debris hang from the ceiling, and the buildings contain large amounts of asbestos and lead paint. Each hospital basement has its own morgue. Today, these walkways are littered with garbage, broken glass, and graffiti. The hospital basements are also infested with rats and bats. In addition, parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walkways are flooded with nearly 3 ft of water.|$|R
50|$|Hundreds of buildings, public schools, {{hospitals}} and industrial plants {{were destroyed by}} the bombing. Museums and palaces in the suburbs were destroyed, vandalized and looted by the Nazis, while <b>the</b> employees <b>of</b> museums were trying to save some art. Only parts of art collections from the famous suburban palaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tsars were evacuated in time, while some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salvaged art was stored in <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hermitage until <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|R

25|$|Sand at {{the sites}} was removed and the reactor {{was built on}} firm ground. Adjacent soil was backfilled. <b>Basements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactor {{buildings}} extend several levels down (maximum of 42 m below grade). These underground elements stabilize the reactor buildings, making them less likely to suffer sway due to resonance vibrations during an earthquake. As with other Japanese power plants, reactors at the plant were built according to earthquake-resistance standards, which are regulated by law and the JAEC.|$|R
40|$|Two {{monoclonal}} antibodies raised against laminin {{isolated from}} a mouse parietal yolk sac cell line {{were used for}} immunohistochemical studies <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> membranes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouse embryo and various fetal and adult tissues. No immunoreactivity with either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two monoclonal antibodies could be detected in the preimplantation-stage embryos, {{although it has been}} shown that these embryos contain extracellular laminin reactive with the conven-tional polyclonal antilaminin antibodies. Reichert's membrane in early postimplantation stages of development reacted with the monoclonal antibody LAM-I but not with the antibody LAM-II. However, from day 8 <b>of</b> pregnancy onward <b>the</b> Reichert's membrane reacted with both antibodies. <b>Basement</b> membranes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embryo proper were unreactive with both mono-clonal antibodies until day 12 of pregnancy. By day 14 some <b>basement</b> membranes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fetal tissues became reactive with one or both monoclonal antibodies, whereas others remained still unreactive. In the 17 -d fetus and the newborn mouse most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> membranes reacted with both monoclonal antibodies, whereas others still reacted with only one. Similar heterogeneity in <b>the</b> immunoreactivity <b>of</b> <b>basement</b> membranes <b>of</b> various tissue...|$|R
5|$|The <b>basement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house {{initially}} {{served as}} the wine storage area. In 1867, the family had a one-and-a-half-story brick winery constructed. After 1900, when wine grapes were no longer grown commercially, this building served as a storage room. Rübel later converted it to a museum for Ramona visitors, complete with Del Valle family artifacts. In the 21st century it is used for storage of farm equipment and automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating the <b>basement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keep in 1822 and repairing some of the stonework. The ground level of the inner bailey, which had built up over the years, was lowered by about : according to the contemporary archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of loads of earth to be dug out and removed. A great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the process, but the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851. Mary continued the excavation work on the castle site after Fulke's death, and restored the stonework of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|Chandler was {{the fourth}} of five {{children}} born to Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson, and was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. When he was 10yearsold in June 1957, his father hanged himself in the <b>basement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family's apartment. Chandler reportedly jumped into his father's open grave at the funeral as the gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt. Chandler fathered thirteen children, reportedly by twelve women: Kristal Sue, Valerie Lynn, Jeffery Scott, Tobi, Rachael, Suzette, Oba Jr., Skipper, two males and two females placed for adoption and lastly Whitney Ann. His youngest child, Whitney Ann Chandler, was born in February 1989 to her mother Debra Chandler. Between May and September 1991concurrent with the police investigation of the Rogers family triple murderChandler was an informant for the U.S. Customs Bureau's Tampa office.|$|E

The reactor design plans provided by General Electric specified placing the generators and batteries in that location, but mid-level engineers working on <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant were concerned that this made the backup power systems vulnerable to flooding.
