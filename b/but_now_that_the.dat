There is still much to discover about this pathogen-host interaction <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genome has been sequenced, the rate of discoveries will likely increase. One of the main goals pertaining to research of these bacterial genomes is to develop resistant varieties. Unfortunately, no resistant varieties have yet been found.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave Nimrod {{three and a}} half stars out of five, calling it an [...] "invigorating, if occasionally frustrating listen", and although he praised Armstrong's [...] "gift for hooky, instantly memorable melodies", he noted that [...] "the 18 tracks whip by at such a breakneck speed that it leaves you somewhat dazed." [...] Greg Kot of Rolling Stone enjoyed the album's melodic nature as well as the [...] "measure of sincerity" [...] present in Armstrong's vocals. [...] Kot appreciated the return of the band's [...] "juvenile sense of humor" [...] that he felt was lacking on Insomniac, and praised the musical diversity on the record, remarking, [...] "This music {{is a long way from}} Green Day's apprenticeship at the Gilman Street punk clubs, in Berkeley, Calif. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> band has seen the world, it's only fitting that Green Day should finally make an album that sounds as if it has." ...|$|E

2500|$|Finally, Gold {{shows up}} to confront Ingrid, blaming her for ruining his plan, but Ingrid says it that was Elsa who interfered, {{remarking}} {{that they were}} [...] "like sisters." [...] Gold vows that he'll make Ingrid pay, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Snow Queen has harnessed Emma and Elsa's powers after she placed the ribbons on their wrists, she claims that she {{has become much more}} powerful, possibly even powerful enough to defeat Mr. Gold and decorate her palace [...] "with his bones." [...] When she wonders whether she should give it a try, Mr. Gold warns her not to overestimate her powers, but Ingrid warns Mr. Gold not to underestimate her powers, in response. Then, the Snow Queen smiles with delight while using her new-found powers to cast the Spell of Shattered Sight over Storybrooke, which shatters her mirror in the process.|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} Jews are duty bound {{to make their}} {{children}} and their household rejoice on a Festival, for [...] says, [...] "And you shall rejoice it, your feast, you and your son and your daughter." [...] The Gemara taught that one makes them rejoice with wine. Rabbi Judah taught that men gladden with what is suitable for them, and women with what is suitable for them. The Gemara explained that what is suitable for men is wine. And Rav Joseph taught that in Babylonia, they gladdened women with colored garments, while in the Land of Israel, they gladdened women with pressed linen garments. Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra taught that {{in the days of the}} Temple in Jerusalem, Jews could not rejoice without meat (from an offering), as [...] says, [...] "And you shall sacrifice peace-offerings, and shall eat there; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God." [...] <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Temple no longer exists, Jews cannot rejoice without wine, as [...] says, [...] "And wine gladdens the heart of man." ...|$|E
