For example, John of Montecorvino, archbishop of Beijing founded Roman Catholic missions in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language. Long-distance trade brought new methods of doing business from the far East to Europe; <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange, deposit banking, and insurance were introduced to Europe during the Pax Mongolica. <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances because a traveller would not be burdened {{by the weight of}} metal coins.|$|E

5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient justification for a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E
50|$|When the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading {{is used as}} a {{document}} of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is the opposite from a straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading can be negotiated to a third party.|$|R

With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E

5|$|John Nott's The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary (1723), {{still with}} rather few {{precedents}} to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its recipes, from Al to Zest.

50|$|There are {{two types}} where <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading {{can be used as}} carrier's receipt for goods. The first is on board <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, also known as clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is used when there is no {{discrepancy}} between description filled by shipper and the actual goods shipped on board. Clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading indicates that the goods have been properly loaded on board the carrier's ship according to the prima facie evidence. If the carrier finds out that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is different from goods on board, one can provide contradictory evidence on clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is valid as long as in the hand of the carrier, but once it is transferred and negotiated to the third party, it cannot be rebutted and the carrier can no longer mark discrepancy. The second is claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is used when there is some discrepancy between description in the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and the actual goods. For claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, one can mark only when the goods are loaded.|$|R
5000|$|The reach <b>of</b> the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights (beneficiaries, duties, {{time and}} territory) {{demarcates}} {{the types of}} legal disputes to which the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights directly applies. Within this area, the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights overrides ordinary law and conduct that is inconsistent with it. In addition, and subject to considerations of justiciability and jurisdiction, the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights generates {{its own set of}} remedies. This form of application, which is geared towards showing inconsistency between the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights and law or conduct, is called the direct application <b>of</b> the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights.|$|R
50|$|However, {{in order}} to apply the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights indirectly, a court must {{obviously}} {{determine the effect of}} the provisions <b>of</b> the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. A court cannot interpret or develop the ordinary law with reference to the values contained in the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights without knowing what they are. The interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights and its limitation clause therefore remain important, even when the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights is indirectly applied.|$|R
5|$|The <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> bee-eaters are curved, {{long and}} {{end in a}} sharp point. The bill can bite strongly, {{particularly}} at the tip, and it {{is used as a}} pair of forceps with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, and when it is moving on the ground a bee-eater's gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is {{of great}} value in the maritime industry. However, as electronic communication takes over in international trade, the electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is now being considered first in some situations. A brief introduction <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading will be made together with a general comparison between the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and the electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Further analysis will concentrate {{on the issues of}} how the electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading applies in some particular international e-commerce cases and how we can improve the new electronic data interchange system. Finally, this paper aims to demonstrate that it may be advantageous to ultimately switch entirely from the paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading to an electronic one in a modern e-commerce-driven society...|$|R

5|$|According to the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Mortality, {{there were}} in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon {{estimated}} that the true number of mortalities was probably twice that figure. The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. Dr Thomas Gumble, chaplain to the Duke of Albermarle, both of whom had stayed in London {{for the whole of}} the epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.|$|E
5|$|Acton was {{supplanted by}} the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, {{substantially}} written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and recipes, to be looked up as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking {{for a series of}} aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> fare for up to 300 people.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept and}} types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> {{exchange}} The topic of this thesis is "The concept and types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange". The reason for choosing this topic {{has been my}} interest in <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law, which was awaken by my own experience with a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange {{on one hand and}} by the gripping seminars of subject called "Bills of Exchanges", which is taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Charles University in Prague, on the other hand. The aim of the thesis is to characterize the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note, to define their basic characteristics, to explain, what kind of them exist and to analyze their basic requirements. The thesis is composed of six chapters. The first chapter discusses the history <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note. It is divided into three sections that deal with the origin and both national and international development <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law. The second chapter is devoted to the current legislation <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law. It introduces the sources <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law and relations between them and the most specific characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange law, which is rigor cambialis. The third chapter, which consists of three sections, defines the concept <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note, provides a list of their features and the most [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Before Gardner's election, on May 24, 1854, Anthony Burns {{was arrested}} in Boston as a {{fugitive}} under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Edward G. Loring, a Suffolk County probate judge who also served as U.S. commissioner of the Circuit Court in Massachusetts, ordered that Burns be forced back into slavery in Virginia, outraging abolitionists and the increasingly antislavery public in Massachusetts. Under the pressure of a public petition campaign spearheaded by William Lloyd Garrison, the legislature passed two <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> Address, in 1855 and 1856, calling for Judge Loring {{to be removed from}} his state office, but in both cases Gardner declined to remove Loring. A third Bill of Address to remove Loring from office was later approved by Gardner's Republican successor, Nathaniel Prentice Banks.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, Saskatchewan {{passed into}} law a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> rights which was (and remains) unique. The Saskatchewan <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights covered both {{fundamental}} freedoms and equality rights. Saskatchewan's <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights {{is considered to}} have had formative influence on John Diefenbaker, who was from Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Thirteen years later, Diefenbaker successfully introduced the Canadian <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights, in 1960.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the author}} <b>of</b> the Saskatchewan <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights, {{the model for the}} Canadian <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> Rights. It was the first <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> rights in Canada and was one year before the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.|$|R

5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm {{signed off}} on the financial statements in the same year when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, a {{technical}} issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill {{originating in the}} House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered {{that it had not}} been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and the House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type in New York {{as a violation of}} the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that pays the medical and related <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E
40|$|Resumé The concept <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> {{exchange}} and promissory note The {{purpose of the}} thesis is to describe institutes <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> {{exchange and}} promissory note and other important institutes of law related to the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange. The thesis is separated into several parts, in the first chapter I use general characteristic of negotiable instruments for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange. In the second chapter I briefly discuss relations <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange, {{because we have to}} pay attention not only to the essentials but also to other terms <b>of</b> drawing the <b>bill.</b> In the third chapter I deal with the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and promissory note and their essentials. The difference between the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and the promissory note is an unconditional order to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer to drawee, which is characteristic for the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange; whereas the promissory note is characterized by an unconditional promise to pay a determinate sum of money by drawer. The rest of essentials, except for the name of drawee logically, are the same. These essential are the term "bill of exchange" incorporated in the body <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange in the same language as a text <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange, maturity, place of payment, name of payee, place and date <b>of</b> drawing a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange and signature of drawer.
