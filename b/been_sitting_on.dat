His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. But when she {{reaches into the}} sack and feels the vegetables and discovers them, she becomes very, very, angry. Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens.|$|E

25|$|The protagonists {{make their}} way to Firsthome and the Court, but are treated there with {{relative}} indifference. They pick up a new friend, Roofshadow, and go northwest. They are captured by a group of evil cats called the Clawguard, and taken to Vastnir, an enormous mound far to the north, where the evil cat-god Grizraz Hearteater enslaves cats to take over the world, swollen in size and sitting upon a mound of dead and dying creatures. Tailchaser needs to alert the outside world and especially the court about his evil doings. Soon, Roofshadow creates a hole from above ground, and Tailchaser manages to escape, and races to Ratleaf Forest, where he asks a clan of squirrels to alert them for him in repayment for a debt contracted with their lord's brother. He feels guilty with Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow trapped in Vastnir because of him. He returns to the dreadful mound, where Quiverclaw and Prince Fencewalker, whom he had met at the court, come to the rescue. Lord Hearteater creates the Fikos, a dog-like monster of terrible power, out of the mound of dying creatures he had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on.</b> Tailchaser takes advantage of the chaos to rescue Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow. They go through the havoc of Vastnir, and lose Eatbugs, the mad cat, on the way. Roofshadow and Pouncequick escape while Tailchaser goes back to find Eatbugs. He goes into a crevice and sees Eatbugs in a near-deathlike state, and feels dazed and confused. Upon Tailchaser's uttering a prayer to Lord Tangaloor Firefoot, Hearteater's brother, Eatbugs awakens, revealing himself to actually be Firefoot incognito. Tailchaser runs out of Vastnir at Firefoot's urging, and meets his friends, while Firefoot goes to deal with Hearteater, resulting in the destruction of Vastnir.|$|E

500|$|The Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods.

[...] The event level of the arena was filled with water, also wrecking the high definition scoreboard that had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the rink floor during the summer downtime, while the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were swamped. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss". [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the 2013–14 Calgary Flames season. Repairs to the facility forced the cancellation of all concerts and agricultural events scheduled for the 2013 Calgary Stampede.|$|E

The ship also participated in the invasion of the Marshall Islands; on 1 February 1944, the battleship [...] collided with Indiana on her starboard side. 13 of the voids between the torpedo protection system and 13 fuel tanks were flooded, and the longitudinal bulkheads were severely damaged. The starboard outboard propeller was damaged, along with the shaft upon which it was mounted. Two quad-mount 40mm guns and 9 20mm guns were destroyed, along with two of the mounts for the 20mm guns. [...] Indianas starboard catapult was torn from the ship, along with the Kingfisher float plane that had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> it. The ship suffered a list to starboard, which was corrected by flooding compartments on the port side. Indiana sailed to Majuro Lagoon to be repaired enough to make the voyage back to Pearl Harbor; the resulting work was the largest single repair handled at Pearl Harbor other than the battleships damaged during the attack that started the war.|$|E

2500|$|Radiocarbon dating has {{suggested}} that some artifacts at Carlston Annis date back to 5424 BC, although most artifacts dated between 3200 and 1400 BC. [...] Most of its projectile points clearly dated from the Archaic period, although one Adena and occasional Mississippian points were found; they seemingly were left by later peoples, just like the pottery pieces. [...] Two projectile points that were found underneath the mound were fluted points from the Paleoindian period; they {{are believed to have}} <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the riverside before the shell mound was started. [...] Like several other shell mound sites in Kentucky, Carlston Annis produced pieces of three stone pipes and of a single stone cup; these objects may have been religious artifacts used by shamans in attempts to heal diseases. [...] Kentucky's larger riverine Archaic sites vary widely in the amount of shell refuse that they have yielded; the much larger amount of shell refuse at sites such as Carlston-Annis and Indian Knoll is seemingly due to the presence of nearby bivalve beds. [...] The numbers and types of non-human bones at the mound were typical of Archaic shell middens in the region, as was the number of antler pieces, although tools made of human bone were unusually numerous. [...] At least three different processes were used to produce fishhooks from bones: some had been made from deer toes; some from bird bones of all sizes, a technique common at Kentucky shell middens; and a few by drilling large bones. [...] Carlston Annis was the first Kentucky shell midden at which fishhooks made by this technique were found, although evidence of this technique is plentiful at the later Fort Ancient-period Madisonville Site near Cincinnati. Numerous animal bones appear to have been used as ceremonial [...] "medicine bags," [...] which in later centuries were often made by skinning an animal without removing some of the bones.|$|E
