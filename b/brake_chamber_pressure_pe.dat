40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} developing a control scheme for regulating the <b>pressure</b> in the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> of an air brake system found in most commercial vehicles like trucks, tractor-trailers and buses. Such a control scheme {{can be used for}} providing the ground work for future systems such as forward collision avoidance systems, advanced anti-lock brake systems and differential braking systems. The development of this controller involves two tasks. The first task was the development of a control scheme for achieving the desired <b>pressure</b> in the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber.</b> This scheme was based on a mathematical model of the treadle valve of the air brake system. The second task was the implementation of this control scheme on the experimental facility that was set up at Texas A&M University.

To {{solve the}} problem of {{measuring}} the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> at present, this integrative performance test system for bake chamber was built up by using the computer control technology. It can measure these parameters: dynamic characteristic, static characteristic, sealing performance and return performance. To verify the system accuracy, a multi-parameter dynamic simulation model for the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> was designed based on AMESim. It breaks through the limit which was formerly difficult to analyze the defects of the theoretical parameters for <b>brake</b> <b>chamber.</b> By the simulation models and test system, the influence of the key component parameters to the output characteristic is analyzed.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} create a simplified simulation of the flow {{through a hole in}} the surface of a hypersonic aerospace vehicle and the subsequent impingement of the flow on internal structures. In addition to planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) flow visualization, pressure measurements were recorded on the surface of an impingement target. The PLIF images themselves provide quantitative spatial information about structure of the impinging jets. The images also help in the interpretation of impingement surface pressure profiles by highlighting the flow structures corresponding to distinctive features of these pressure profiles. The shape of the pressure distribution along the impingement surface was found to be double-peaked in cases with a sufficiently high jet-exit-to-ambient pressure ratio so as to have a Mach disk, as well as in cases where a flow feature called a recirculation bubble formed at the impingement surface. The formation of a recirculation bubble was in turn found to depend very sensitively upon the jet-exit-to-ambient pressure ratio. The pressure measured at the surface was typically less than half the nozzle plenum pressure at low jet pressure ratios and decreased with increasing jet pressure ratios. Angled impingement cases showed that impingement at a 60 ° angle resulted in up to a factor of three increase in maximum pressure at the plate compared to normal incidence.

40|$|Achieving a plasma sprayed {{cast iron}} coating {{containing}} graphite requires stringent control on spray parameters that synergistically influence the coating properties {{and thus the}} performance. The microstructure of cast iron splats greatly depends on spray parameters such as substrate temperature, <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure,</b> and spray distance. This paper presents the effect of <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> on the splat microstructure, including oxides and graphite. At low <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures,</b> most splats exhibit a disk shape with high flattening ratios, whereas star-shaped splats extensively appear at high <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures.</b> Spraying at high <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures</b> causes the formation of pores and thick oxide zones at the splat/substrate interface, mainly due to the atmospheric gases, which are responsible for a decrease in splat adhesion. Spraying in Ar atmosphere reduces the splat oxidation due to {{a decrease in the}} oxygen partial pressure. Small deformed substrate ridges are observed adjacent to the periphery of splats sprayed at low <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures</b> whereas no ridges are detected at high <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures.</b> Ridge formation generates a kind of mechanical bond, which increases the adhesive strength. Since the molten droplets impinge with high velocity and thus high flattening ratio at low <b>chamber</b> <b>pressures,</b> the solidification rate becomes faster, and graphite formation is resultantly hindered...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} to measure the combustion performance of the Fastrac engine thrust chamber. During mainstage, the thrust chamber exhibited no large-amplitude <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> oscillations that could be identified as low-frequency combustion instability or 'chug'. However, during start-up and shutdown, the thrust chamber very briefly exhibited large-amplitude <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> oscillations that were identified as chug. These instabilities during start-up and shutdown were regarded as benign due to their brevity. Linear models of the thrust chamber and the propellant feed systems were formulated for both the thrust chamber component tests and the flight engine tests. These linear models determined the frequency and decay rate of <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> oscillations given the design and operating conditions of the thrust chamber and feed system. The frequency of <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> oscillations determined from the model closely matched the frequency of low-amplitude, low-frequency <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> oscillations exhibited {{in some of the}} later thrust chamber mainstage tests.

50|$|With {{a service}} brake relay valve installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers,</b> and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers</b> in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R

From the thrust chamber cooling analyses, regenerative/radiation-cooled LO 2 /H 2 thrust chambers offered the largest thrust and <b>chamber</b> <b>pressure</b> operational envelope primarily due to the superior cooling capability of hydrogen and its low critical pressure.
