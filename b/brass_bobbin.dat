5000|$|... #Caption: The <b>brass</b> <b>bobbin</b> in the {{carriage}} which {{move in a}} cradle between the warp threads ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>brass</b> <b>bobbin</b> yarns are {{wound on}} special <b>brass</b> <b>bobbin</b> winding units, with the spools held on jack stands. and then these brass bobbins are {{compressed}} by 25% at a pressure of 20 tons per square inch. They are then steamed and cooled. [...] These {{have to be}} manually placed in the carrier and held by a spring. The thread needs to be laced to the previous one On depletion of the first bobbin, the whole set is removed and goes through a stripper.|$|E
50|$|It has two warp beams, {{though it}} can be run using just one or none. An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the back warp (left warp, reverse warp). All the warp ends pass through a sley with {{individual}} perforations- to keep the threads from tangling.On a machine with 3000 front warp ends, that will mean 6000 perforations, all front warp ends will be of the same count, and all back warp ends will be of the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The warp threads interact with the <b>brass</b> <b>bobbin</b> threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are tensioned by a spring.|$|E
5000|$|The bobbin threads tie the top {{and bottom}} board threads to the pillars. The bobbin threads are carried on <b>brass</b> <b>bobbins</b> that are held in {{carriages}} that are swung back and forth on combs in a pushing and catching routine. Pillaring is controlled by the pillaring cam; in net formation the pillars must be connected and this can be done by the spool threads (top or bottom board). These are secured each time by the bobbin threads. Patterning or gimping is created by using longer shogs on the spool threads.|$|R
5000|$|The {{warp beam}} {{was at the}} top, and the work roller at the bottom. There was a sley and a guide bar.The {{carriages}} with their <b>bobbins</b> (<b>brass</b> <b>bobbins)</b> slid on a concave comb (bolt). In the 1825 modification, the carriages were suspended from a upwardly arching comb. The carriages are propelled by individual pusher rods which strike the ears on the carriage. There was pusher bar (later there were four) {{but there is a}} fetcher bar (locker bar) which act in conjunctions with the pushers [...] It was slow and in the early machine 14 actions were required to form each course; in 1825 this had been reduced to ten. The bobbins were necessarily small and this restricted the length of a single piece to about 4 metres The actions were controlled by an organ barrel until the adoption of the Jacquard process in 1839. This was achieved by James Wright of Radford.|$|R

40|$|A low-field square ended {{superconducting magnet}} has been {{constructed}} with 	Nb-Ti alloy as a coil, {{which is to}} be used for the nuclear magnetic resonance 	experiment at helium temperatures. The wire is wound around a <b>brass</b> <b>bobbin</b> 	(the inner diameter 10 mm and the length 60 mm). To operate the magnet in 	a persistent mode, a persistent current switch with the same wire is attached 	The magnetic field strength at the exciting current 20 A is about 12 kG, which 	is measured by a Bi-sensor. No decay of the persistent current is observed with 	time. The field strength vs. the current and the field distribution in the magnet 	are measured, which are in good agreement with the calculated values...|$|E
