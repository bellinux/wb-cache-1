Entrainment rates for all age classes of crabs ranged from zero at Miller Sands to 0. 224 crabs per cy at Desdemona Shoals in June 2002. The overall entrainment rate at Desdomona Shoals in September was 0. 120 crabs per cy. A modified Dredge Impact Model (DIM) used the summer 2002 entrainment rates to project crab entrainment and adult equivalent loss and loss to the fishery for the Channel Improvement Project.

40|$|The Río de la Plata {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} estuarine systems of the world. It drains the waters of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers, which constitute the second largest basin of South America. As a result, it has a huge discharge with a mean of around 25, 000 m 3 s- 1, and maximum values as high as 50, 000 m 3 s- 1 under extreme conditions. Water stratification is controlled by the confluence of high buoyancy continental discharge advecting offshore, lying on denser shelf waters that intrude into the estuary as a topographically controlled wedge, typically between 100 and 250 km long. The upstream reach of the wedge defines a <b>bottom</b> <b>salinity</b> front, located over a submersed bar named Barra del Indio shoal following the 10 m isobath. Several authors have pointed out the importance of this <b>bottom</b> <b>salinity</b> front in structuring plankton communities as well as in the development of spawning grounds for several coastal fishes. It has been suggested that observed patterns result from retention processes associated to the <b>bottom</b> <b>salinity</b> front. However neither the occurrence of this retention nor the physical and/or behavioral mechanisms involved have been well studied. It has been classically thought that retention would be a natural consequence of the theoretical circulation associated to a salt wedge: salty water incoming from the bottom would push plankton upstream to the <b>bottom</b> <b>salinity</b> front. Nevertheless, several recent papers based on numerical simulations and ADCP current observations have shown that estuarine circulation does not necessarily follow this pattern and, moreover, that it is highly variable and essentially wind dominated. These papers indicate that estuarine scales of variability replicate atmospheric ones, and that currents response to changes in the wind field is very fast, occurring in a lapse of around 6 hours. They also demonstrated that estuarine response to winds can be explained in terms of two modes, both implying currents with a phase lag with respect to winds that depends on the location in the estuary, but that in any case, produce a response in the bottom layer. As a result of the described features, in the time scales relevant to biota, the Río de la Plata would display weather and climate, as the atmosphere does. Atmospheric circulation in the region is characterized in synoptic to intra-seasonal scales by a high variability. As winds in the region rarely blow from the same direction for more than a few days, currents present the same feature. A striking question is, then, whether this highly variable system can favor retention and if this is the fact, what are the involved mechanisms. The aim of this paper is to explore this matter. A set of process oriented numerical experiments in which neutral particles are released along the frontal zone of the Río de la Plata and its vicinity and tracked for different wind conditions in short time scales is conducted. Results of numerical experiments are complemented with an analysis of local wind statistics. As a result a possible mechanism for plankton retention is suggested. Pages: 1383 - 139...|$|E

Using a geographical information system (GIS) this paper sought to calculate the relative abundance of brown shrimp based on catch per unit effort (CPUE) and compare it with bathymetry, type of sedimentary structure, sedimentation rate and <b>bottom</b> <b>salinity.</b> As a result, we {{have concluded that the}} relative abundance (in terms of CPUE) is not uniformly distributed in space. Spatial analysis indicates that commercial trawling efforts were made in the (foreset) region of the subaqueous Amazon delta at depths of 40 to 60 m. In this region, prawn are responsible for the bioturbation of the sediments {{and the creation of a}} sedimentary structure called mottled mud. In the foreset region, sedimentation rates progressively increased up to 10 cm. yr- 1; re-suspension was reduced and <b>bottom</b> <b>salinity</b> was high (~ 36). It appears that all of these factors define a stable muddy area with intense bioturbation. This notable biological activity is to be explained by the occurrence of a high F. subtilis abundance that appears to originate in a microbial loop.

Herring appear to prefer warmer, fresher surface waters associated with the Alaska Coastal Current. Mean pollock density increased between February and August, indicating the nearshore area is important summer habitat, while it is less important for herring after winter spawning. Pollock and herring utilize different horizontal and vertical areas of the bays, with pollock in deeper waters.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss field {{observations}} and modeling results examining the connection between flow-induced stratification and gravitational circulation. We present simultaneous ADCP and top and <b>bottom</b> <b>salinity</b> records collected by the USGS showing that density-driven flows are highly intermittent, with strong gravitational circulation accompanying stratification episodes. Tidal variations in gravitational circulation appear {{to be linked to}} tide-induced vertical mixing and to the strain-induced periodic stratification (SIPS) that is typically found in Northern San Francisco Bay. Results obtained using a ID water column model suggest that there exists a critical condition where tidal mixing is unable to overcome the creation of stratification by advection. Variability of observed stratification is better explained by a parameter which explicitly considers SIPS, and thus which depends explicitly on the longitudinal salinity gradient, than it is by a similar parameter based on flow. The tides and tidal currents in San Francisco Bay are extremely energetic. A...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{temperature}} and salinity of the waters off eastern Gaspe Peninsula following the Late Quaternary deglaciation are recognized {{on the basis of}} benthonic foraminiferal zones in box, trigger weight and piston cores from depths of 373 and 109 m in the Laurentian Channel and Chaleur Trough respectively. The deglacial stage in the Laurentian Channel was characterized by oscillating low- (3 ̆c 25) and high- (ca. 35) <b>salinity</b> <b>bottom</b> water. This was followed by <b>bottom</b> water with <b>salinity</b> between 34 and 35, and then a salinity minimum (30 - 34). Radiocarbon ages for foraminifera and pelecypods indicate that the deglacial stage began before 14 ka BP and ended approximately 13. 5 ka BP; the salinity minimum began about 12. 1 ka BP in the Laurentian Channel. Benthonic foraminiferal zones show that {{the temperature}} of the bottom water in Chaleur Trough has remained close to 0 ∘C since deglaciation. However, the <b>salinity</b> of the <b>bottom</b> water has increased from between 28 and 30 during the deglacial stage to about 33 at present. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the distribution and}} composition of the syllid fauna inhabiting seagrass meadows in the Ensenada de O Grove (NW Spain). Samples were collected on muddy sediments colonized by either Zostera marina L., Zostera noltei Hornemann or by a mixed meadow with both species. Syllids were dominant (13340 individuals; 37 % of total polychaete abundance), including 22 species (12 genera). The mixed meadows housed {{the highest number of}} species and the Z. noltei meadow had practically no syllids. The dominant species were Exogone naidina, Parapionosyllis elegans, Parexogone hebes and Prosphaerosyllis campoyi (> 80 % of total abundance). Carnivores (mainly species of Parapionosyllis, Amblyosyllis, and Streptosyllis) were dominant, especially in muddy sand with either Z. marina or Z. noltei and sandy mud with a mixed meadow. The most important abiotic variables for explaining the composition and distribution of the syllid fauna were <b>bottom</b> water <b>salinity,</b> sorting coefficient and carbonate content. The highest number of species was recorded at sites with a high salinity and carbonate content and the lowest at sites with a high sorting coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 60 years, the {{perception}} of the Arctic Ocean has changed from a hostile, sluggish, steady, ice-covered environment with little global impact to an ocean that has become increasingly accessible, apparently rapidly changing, only partly ice-covered, and connected to the global meridional overturning circulation. Our new observations demonstrate that waters off Northwest Greenland constitute the final limb in the grand cyclonic circulation of the Atlantic layer in the Arctic Ocean. These waters with an Atlantic water mass signature are warming in Nares Strait to the west of Greenland as they are elsewhere. Estimates of the magnitude and uncertainty of this warming are emerging from both moored observations and historical hydrographic station data. Ocean temperatures sensed by instruments moored 3 m above the bottom between 228 and 366 m depth in Nares Strait suggest a mean warming of about 0. 023 ± 0. 015 °C per year for the 2003 – 2009 period at 95 % confidence. Salinity changes for the same period are not significantly different from zero. Nevertheless, oscillating bottom temperatures covary with <b>salinities.</b> Mean <b>bottom</b> <b>salinities</b> in Nares Strait exceed 34. 56 psu while no water with salinities above 34. 51 psu occurs in Baffin Bay to the south. These data indicate a dominantly northern source for the waters sensed by our moorings. Mean bottom temperatures hover near 0 °C, which suggests minimal influence of waters from the northeastern Amundsen Basin in the Arctic Ocean. Thus, we conclude that the observed warming originates from the northeastern Canadian Basin to the southwest of our study area. In addition to these mean conditions, we find large interannual variability. For example, significant freshening emerges for the 2003 – 2006 period that reaches – 0. 02 ± 0. 008 psu per year without significant concurrent temperature trends at three sensor locations. These data contrast with the 2007 – 2009 observational period when five different sensors all indicate warmer waters (0. 063 ± 0. 017 °C per year) and saltier waters (0. 027 ± 0. 01 psu per year), which reverses the 2003 – 2006 freshening. We speculate that some of these observed changes are caused by a changing ice regime. During the 2003 – 2006 winters, ice was landfast, while during 2007 – 2009 it was generally mobile year-round. The warming impacts tidewater glaciers along northern Greenland with sill depths below 300 m, for example, Petermann Gletscher...|$|R
