50|$|A <b>bar</b> <b>loader</b> is a {{variation}} on the bar feeder concept in that multiple pieces of bar stock may be fed into a hopper, and the loader feeds each piece as necessary.|$|E
5000|$|CNC lathes {{and screw}} {{machines}} have accessories called [...] "bar feeders", which hold, guide, {{and feed the}} bar as commanded by the CNC control. More advanced machines may have a [...] "bar loader" [...] which holds multiple bars and feeds them {{one at a time}} into the bar feeder. Bar loaders are like magazines for part blanks (or pallets for milling work) in that they allow lights-out machining. The <b>bar</b> <b>loader</b> is filled with bars (or the magazine or pallet with part blanks) during working hours, and then it runs during the night unattended. Given that there is no human around to detect if something went wrong and the machine should stop, there are various kinds of sensors that are used to detect this, such as load meters, infrared beams, and, in recent years, webcams, which are placed inside the machine tool's enclosure and allow remote viewing of the cutting action.|$|E
50|$|An {{extended}} reach design uses multiple hinges {{and parallel}} lifting <b>bars</b> on the <b>loader</b> arm, {{with the main}} pivot points towards the center or front of the machine. This allows the loader arm to have much greater operating height while retaining a compact design, and allows the vertical movement to be less of an arc and more straight-up vertical, to keep the bucket forward of the operator's cab, allowing safe dumping into tall containers or vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1998 model year, a {{gasoline}} engine was offered, a Mitsubishi derived 4G64 [...] at 5,250 rpm with 218 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. The diesel engine now {{comes with a}} slightly more powerful Mitsubishi derived 4D56 non-intercooled turbo diesel engine with [...] at 201 Nm at 2,000 rpm. Available in two trim levels, SVX and Club, {{and a number of}} body styles (commercial panel van, and pick up (Libero)). A long wheelbase (12-seater) [...] "Jumbo" [...] and short wheelbase (seven- and nine-seater) [...] "RV" [...] was also available. First introduced to this model are luxurious features like side lower body cladding with two-tone paint scheme (SVX, Club), optional dual sunroof (Club), side body [...] "Tetris style" [...] decals (Club), chrome slant grills, rear tailgate handle opener cover (Club), cream moquette upholstery (Club), optional high-tech head unit with television screen and six-disc CD changer (Club) for domestic models, power windows and antenna (SVX, Club) an Aisin Seiki Co. sourced four-speed automatic transmission with ECT and overdrive switch and differently styled [...] "star" [...] 15-inch alloy wheels with exposed lug nuts (Club). For safety, it also features limited-slip differential (LSD), anti-lock braking system (ABS) and driver side airbag. This models was exported to a number countries and proved a big hit to some car markets like the Philippines where at that time was imported via gray market. It gained instant popularity for comfortable sedan-like drive, availability of automatic transmission, expansive interior space and thickly bolstered seats. Its main advantage was being priced lower than its twin, the Mitsubishi Delica Space Gear, yet it packed more features and factory accessories like front bull <b>bars,</b> top basket <b>loader,</b> and a rear ladder. For the following year in the Philippines, the gasoline engine version was dropped due to unusually high gasoline consumption, but still made available for other markets.|$|R
