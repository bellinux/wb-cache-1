5000|$|Emmanuel Torres, {{the son of}} the <b>building</b> <b>custodian,</b> {{was arrested}} on December 29 and in 1985 was convicted of her murder. The case {{attracted}} detailed national coverage for a number of reasons. It highlighted the dangers of 1980s New York City and also showed how violent crime robbed a talented young person of a bright future. There was some controversy that the murder of a white woman received so much more coverage than did the hundreds of killings of women of color each year. The racial politics of the case were further complicated when it was revealed that the killer's brother, Alfredo Torres, was a physician in residence. Much of the coverage took up the question of how two brothers could have such divergent life histories. https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9D03E4D61538F93AA35751C1A962948260 ...|$|E

40|$|M. Tech. ArchitectureThe {{design of}} a digital, genealogical archival {{repository}} in Pretoria West {{for the preservation of}} South African family histories, that will inter alia, provide free public access to such archived material, is proposed. Oppression brought about by colonialism and apartheid in South Africa ultimately led to domination by one racial group, resulting in the inadequate documentation of the personal histories {{of the majority of the}} population; an omission which may be remediated by the archiving of family histories. Archival <b>buildings</b> are <b>custodians</b> of the valuable items of heritage for future generations. However, due to the strenuous and time intensive nature of the genealogical research process, the National Archives and Records Service does not, currently, effectively address this lack, which has led to this field of research being privately practiced. An archive of family history to be housed in Pretoria West, an industrial area characterised by vacant and abandoned buildings in need of intervention, is proposed. The design seeks to adapt a grain silo which forms a part of an old flour mill complex on Charlotte Maxeke Street. An exploration into the building's past as a place which stores, secures and protects the contents within it, led to its selection as a suitable host for an archive which will utilise the preservative functional logic of the silo as a place of storage and security...|$|R
