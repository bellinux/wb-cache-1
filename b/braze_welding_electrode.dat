50|$|<b>Braze</b> <b>welding</b> {{has many}} {{advantages}} over fusion welding. It allows the joining of dissimilar metals, minimization of heat distortion, and {{can reduce the}} need for extensive pre-heating. Additionally, since the metals joined are not melted in the process, the components retain their original shape; edges and contours are not eroded or changed by the formation of a fillet. Another effect of <b>braze</b> <b>welding</b> is the elimination of stored-up stresses that are often present in fusion welding. This is extremely important in the repair of large castings. The disadvantages are the loss of strength when subjected to high temperatures and the inability to withstand high stresses.|$|R

40|$|International audienceJoining steel with {{aluminum}} involving {{the fusion of}} one or both materials is possible by laser beam welding technique. This paper describes a method, called laser <b>braze</b> <b>welding,</b> which is a suitable process to realize this structure. The main problem with thermal joining of steel/aluminum assembly with processes such as TIG or MIG is the formation of fragile intermetallic phases, which are detrimental to the mechanical performances of such joints. <b>Braze</b> <b>welding</b> permits a localized fusion of the materials resulting in a limitation on the growth of fragile phases. This article {{presents the results of}} a statistical approach for an overlap assembly configuration using a filler wire composed of 85 % Zn and 15 % Al.

50|$|The basic {{spot welder}} {{consists}} of a power supply, an energy storage unit (e.g., a capacitor bank), a switch, a welding transformer, and the <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The energy storage element allows the welder to deliver high instantaneous power levels. If the power demands are not high, then the energy storage element isn't needed. The switch causes the stored energy to be dumped into the welding transformer. The welding transformer steps down the voltage and steps up the current. An important feature of the transformer is it reduces the current level that the switch must handle. The <b>welding</b> <b>electrodes</b> {{are part of the}} transformer's secondary circuit. There is also a control box that manages the switch and may monitor the <b>welding</b> <b>electrode</b> voltage or current.|$|R

5|$|Spray {{transfer}} GMAW was {{the first}} metal transfer method used in GMAW, and well-suited to welding aluminium and stainless steel while employing an inert shielding gas. In this GMAW process, the <b>weld</b> <b>electrode</b> metal is rapidly passed along the stable electric arc from the electrode to the workpiece, essentially eliminating spatter and resulting in a high-quality weld finish. As the current and voltage increases beyond the range of short circuit transfer the <b>weld</b> <b>electrode</b> metal transfer transitions from larger globules through small droplets to a vaporized stream at the highest energies. Since this vaporized spray transfer variation of the GMAW weld process requires higher voltage and current than short circuit transfer, {{and as a result}} of the higher heat input and larger weld pool area (for a given <b>weld</b> <b>electrode</b> diameter), it is generally used only on workpieces of thicknesses above about 6.4mm (0.25in).|$|R
