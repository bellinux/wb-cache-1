40|$|Forest {{fragmentation}} {{affects the}} structure and dynamics of plant communities, leading to biodiversity loss in forest remnants. In this paper we show that in a bamboo (Guadua weberbaueri Pilger) dominated forest fragment in southwestern Amazonia edge effect may be confounded by <b>bamboo</b> <b>effect,</b> which also occur inside the forest. We measured growth, mortality and, recruitment rate of trees with DBH &# 8805; 10 cm, in a fragment of bamboo dominated open forest in southwestern Amazonia, state of Acre, Brazil, in 15 plots at the forest edge and 15 plots inside the forest fragment, 500 m away from the border. Time interval between censuses was 1. 8 years. The average diameter growth rate differed significantly between edge (3. 82 ± 0. 10 mm a- 1) and interior (2. 39 ± 0. 18 mm a- 1); {{but there were no}} differences in annual mortality rate (edge = 3. 8 ± 2. 5 % a- 1 CV = 65. 7 %; interior = 3. 6 ± 2. 6 % a- 1 CV = 72. 2 %) or in annual recruitment rate (edge = 7. 1 ± 3. 2 % a- 1 CV = 45 %; interior = 8. 9 ± 7. 9 % a- 1 CV = 88. 7 %). Diameter growth rate, particularly of pioneer and fast-growing trees, is favored by the environmental conditions of the edge, where bamboo abundance is higher. However, the absence of an edge effect on mortality and recruitment could be due to the particular dynamics of bamboo patches, which could be mimicking forest edges and therefore masking possible edge effect in this fragment. We speculate that the mortality and recruitment patterns in fragmented forests of southwestern Amazonia is different from other areas in Amazonia and that bamboo {{is one of the key}} controllers of successional processes in these fragments...|$|E

40|$|Ball-milled bamboo was pre-swelled {{with a cold}} aqueous {{solution}} of NaOH and urea, and then reacted directly with benzyl chloride to synthesize benzylated <b>bamboo.</b> The <b>effects</b> of the molar ratio of benzyl chloride to OH groups in the bamboo (1 to 4), the reaction temperature (70 to 110 °C), and the reaction time (2 to 8 h) on both the product yield {{and the degree of}} substitution (DS) were evaluated. Yields between 67. 6 and 94. 0 % and DS between 0. 31 and 0. 74 of the benzylated bamboo were obtained under such conditions. The incorporation of benzyl groups was evidenced by FT-IR and CP/MAS 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. It was found that the crystalline structure of the native ball-milled bamboo was markedly damaged after modification. In addition, the benzylated bamboo was subjected to thermal degradation at a high temperature with an increase in substitution. It was suggested that the benzylated bamboo with a low crystallinity as well as large non-polar groups is promising as a filler for use in the composite material industry...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} explore bamboo glulam {{utilization}} in structure construction, the adhesive bonded steel connection of bamboo glulam {{was investigated in}} this study. By carrying out both-end pullout tests on glued-in threaded rods in <b>bamboo</b> glulam, the <b>effects</b> of depth and diameter of embedded rods in bamboo glulam on the pullout strength and the failure modes were discussed. Results showed that threaded rods fracture and adhesive interface failure were the two main different failure modes in the tests. The pullout peak load of both-end glued-in rods in bamboo glulam increased with the diameter and the embedded length of the threaded rods. To satisfy tensile load of the glued threaded rods (quality 4.8) used in the connections between engineering structural materials, the slenderness ratio (λ, the ratio of depth and diameter of glued-in threaded rods) equal to 10 or over was necessary.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{environmental}} friendly phenol formaldehyde modified with larch thanaka and urea {{was used to}} make 2 -ply <b>bamboo</b> laminated lumber. <b>Effects</b> of two assemble patterns(inner to inner and outer to outer) on physical and mechanical properties of 2 -ply bamboo laminated lumber from carbonized and bleached bamboo strips were investigated. The results showed that modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) of carbonized bamboo laminated lumber were better than that of bleached bamboo laminate lumber. It illustrated that physical and mechanical properties of carbonized bamboo laminated lumber became better. The MOE and MOR of bamboo laminated lumber, bonding with inner(low density surface) to inner surface, were better than that of outer(high density surface) to outer surface. It meant that MOE and MOR of bamboo laminated lumber were increased by the bonding surface density decreased of bamboo unit.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this study, the {{feasibility}} of manufacturing resin-bonded particleboard from the recently identified Brazilian giant bamboo (Guadua magna) was evaluated. In this second part, the main goal was to study the material properties of the cement and gypsum-composites made from that <b>bamboo</b> species. The <b>effect</b> of CaCl 2 addition in the physical and mechanical properties was also evaluated. Initially, the hydration test was performed to determine the inhibition index of the bamboo particles in the cement and gypsum setting. Three concentrations of CaCl 2 were used to produce bamboo cement-bonded particleboards (BCBP) : 0 %, 2 % and 4 %. CaCl 2 was not added into bamboo gypsum-bonded particleboards(BGBP). Mechanical and physical properties were evaluated and nondestructive testing was performed as well. The inhibition index of Guadua magna in the cement or gypsum setting was classified as "low inhibition". The addition of CaCl 2 at bamboo-cement boards increased the internal bonding and reduced the water absorption. Other properties were not significantly affected. The bamboo-cement boards presented higher bending strength and lower moisture content than bamboo-gypsum boards...|$|R
40|$|Microstructure in the damascene {{interconnects}} evolves {{with the}} overburden layer, an excessive metal layer over trenches. We {{present the results}} of three-dimensional simulation, which show the effects of overburden thickness on mi-crostructure evolution in a trench. When {{the thickness of the}} overburden is {{less than half of the}} trench depth, for a trench with the aspect ratio of unity, the microstructure in the trench tends to evolve into a <b>bamboo</b> structure. This <b>effect</b> is discussed in terms of grain sizes in the trench and those in the over-burden. The thinner overburden layer would have smaller grains, of which growth is limited by its thickness. Such small-sized grains in the overburden are not likely to grow into the trench, which hardly make grain boundaries in the trench. Meanwhile, the grains from the trench are able to continue growth inside the trench, resulting in a bamboo structure. Overburden thickness af-fects the reliability and the electrical performance of the damascene copper in-terconnects. Optimization of overburden thickness is required to minimize these effects...|$|R
40|$|Bamboo is a {{functionally}} graded, {{sustainable construction}} material that has evolved to resist its primary loading in nature. This study {{focuses on the}} effects of geometric and material property variation along the culm length on the capacity of an axially loaded member. Conservatively, compression capacity may be calculated using the smallest section of the member; however, this results in an inefficient use of the culm and may limit the use of long compression members. A more realistic estimate of capacity is obtained by considering the effects of culm taper on buckling capacity. In this work, culm taper was experimentally investigated for three representative <b>bamboo</b> species. The <b>effects</b> of culm section gradient on geometric properties were examined followed by an assessment of geometric variation along the culm height. Following this, a series of buckling analyses of tapered culms was conducted to illustrate the significant effects of taper on culm compression capacity. This analysis was supplemented with comparisons with experimental culm buckling data. Beyond compressive capacity, the paper discusses the implications of culm taper in terms of flexural behaviour, the design of gridshells (involving pre-bent axial load-carrying members), visual grading of bamboo and, ultimately, classification of the many species of bamboo presently used in construction worldwide...|$|R
40|$|A {{biological}} {{approach for}} degumming bamboo substrates has been assessed. The ability of various commercially available enzymes, including cellulase, xylanase, pectinase and mannanase, to hydrolyze bamboo powders was investigated. In addition, a commercial cellulase preparation was applied onto bamboo fibre bundles obtained by natural retting. It {{was found that}} almost all enzymes applied can use bamboo material as a substrate. Mild autoclave pre-treatment can enhance reducing sugar yield from different enzyme treatments. A most pronounced effect was observed with cellulase treatment in which the hydrolysis degree increased 1. 7 fold as measured by reducing sugars for autoclave pre-treated bamboo powders versus non-treated powders after only {{a short period of}} incubation. The combined treatment of hemicellulase preparations showed no effect on the hydrolysis of <b>bamboo</b> substrates. The <b>effect</b> of autoclave pre-treatment on cellulase-treated samples was confirmed by the increase of sugar yield, protein absorption {{as well as by the}} enhancement of surface modification and enzyme penetration observed by CLSM (confocal laser scanning microscopy). This work establishes a base for future studies to develop enzymatic hydrolysis of bamboo materials, making them suitable for textile processing.

40|$|Bamboo {{has deep}} {{cultural}} and economic roots in China, {{the country with the}} largest bamboo resources in the world. Over the last three decades bamboo has evolved from a supply of raw material for basic goods into the material base of an increasingly diversified array of products and, more recently, into a potentially important source of cultural and environmental services. Based on a general literature review and the lessons learned from detailed case studies in different regions of China, we explored the changing roles of <b>bamboo,</b> and its <b>effects</b> on local economies and farmers' livelihood strategies. As the country develops and new economic activities continue to appear, bamboo production has shifted from a superior income-generating opportunity that largely benefited the better-off to a less attractive option left for those who have no other choice. The nature of the work has also changed, from families working directly on their bamboo plots to an emphasis on hired labor, with prosperous bamboo owners devoting most of their time to more lucrative activities. A similar process can be observed in bamboo processing in counties where previous industrial structures hinged around raw material harvests, but which have now entered into other secondary and tertiary industry activities. At the same time, bamboo has attracted new opportunities as a source of cultural, aesthetic, and leisure-related activities, as well as some potentially important climatic, watershed, and biodiversity functions. We analyze the complementarity between goods and services provided by bamboo and discuss some research issues and future trends that may help in overcoming these conflicts...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of nanocellulose with controlled structure from plant sources with easy availability and good sustainability {{is very important}} in science and engineering. In this work, the isolation of cellulose from <b>bamboo</b> and the <b>effects</b> of the hydrolysis of different acids on the morphology, structure, and properties of the resultant cellulose and cellulose nanocrystals were investigated. Bamboo cellulose (PHC) was first isolated from raw bamboo powder by alkali and consecutive bleaching treatments. Cellulose crystallites were then prepared by the controlled hydrolysis of PHC in acid solutions. The samples were characterized by using thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, laser particle size analyzer, Scanning electron microscopy, and Transmission electron microscopy. Cellulose nanocrystals prepared from the hydrolysis of the isolated bamboo cellulose in the sulfate acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, or acetic acid solution had the length of 3 - 200 nm, 20 - 85 nm, 20 - 40 nm, and 6. 5 - 20 nm, respectively. Nanocrystals made by the uses of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid possessed higher crystallinity and lower thermal stability than those by the uses of hydrochloric acid and a mixture of acetic acid and nitric acid. Results suggested the type of acids significantly influenced the structure, morphology, and thermal stability of cellulose crystallites. The anions in the acid solution also contributed to those differences because they affected the swelling of cellulose chains and breakage of hydrogen bonds in cellulose. The findings indicate that a judicious choice of pretreatment of the cellulose and its moieties can be used for the {{production of}} different cellulose nanocrystals...|$|R
40|$|Bamboo salt is a {{traditional}} medicine produced from sea salt. It is widely used in Oriental medicine and is an alkalizing agent with reported antiinflammatory, antimicrobial and chemotherapeutic properties. Notwithstanding, linking specific molecular mechanisms with these properties has been challenging to establish in biological systems. In part, this issue {{may be related to}} bamboo salt eliciting nonspecific effects on components found within these systems. Herein, we investigated the <b>effects</b> of <b>bamboo</b> salt solution on supported lipid bilayers as a model system to characterize the interaction between lipid membranes and bamboo salt. The atomic composition of unprocessed and processed bamboo salts was first analyzed by mass spectrometry, and we identified several elements that have not been previously reported in other bamboo salt preparations. The alkalinity of hydrated samples was also measured and determined to be between pH 10 and 11 for <b>bamboo</b> salts. The <b>effect</b> of processed <b>bamboo</b> salt solutions on the fluidic properties of a supported lipid bilayer on glass was next investigated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis. It was demonstrated that, with increasing ionic strength of the bamboo salt solution, the fluidity of a lipid bilayer increased. On the contrary, increasing the ionic strength of near-neutral buffer solutions with sodium chloride salt diminished fluidity. To reconcile these two observations, we identified that solution alkalinity is critical for the <b>effects</b> of <b>bamboo</b> salt on membrane fluidity, as confirmed using three additional commercial bamboo salt preparations. Extended-DLVO model calculations support that the <b>effects</b> of <b>bamboo</b> salt on lipid membranes are due to the alkalinity imparting a stronger hydration force. Collectively, the results of this work demonstrate that processing of bamboo salt strongly affects its atomic composition and that the alkalinity of bamboo salt solutions contributes to its effect on membrane fluidity...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to prepare a range of {{activated}} carbons with specific textural properties from two solid waste materials, namely, waste tyres and waste bamboo construction scaffolding. A range of experimental parameters have been varied and studied to see how each parameter influences the textural properties of the activated carbons. The waste tyre and bamboo were first converted into chars by thermal treatment. Theromgravimetric analyses have been performed and analysed using multi-stage kinetic decomposition models. For the pyrolysis of waste tyre a five-step model gave the best correlation to experimental data and a six-step model gave the best correlation for <b>bamboo</b> pyrolysis. Compensation <b>effect</b> was observed in the pyrolysis of both materials. Tyre carbons (with or without acid treatment) were produced via carbon dioxide activation with BET surface areas in the range 59 to 1118 m 2 /g. Bamboo-derived carbons by thermal activation in the presence of hydrochloric, nitric and sulphuric acids have lower BET surface area from 183 to 554 m 2 /g. Other characteristion tests include micropore and mesopore surface areas and volumes, pH, and elemental compositions, particularly heteroatoms such as nitrogen and sulphur. They were correlated to the adsorption capacity which were in the range 0. 399 to 0. 914 mmol/g (tyre) and to 0. 022 to 0. 088 mmol/g (bamboo) for acid dyes. For basic dye like Methylene Blue, capacities were in the range 1. 034 to 1. 428 mmol/g (tyre) and 0. 351 to 0. 649 mmol/g (bamboo). Based on the surface coverage analysis, novel molecular orientation modelling of adsorbed dyes has been proposed and correlated with surface area and surface charge. For acid dyes, molecules were likely to be adsorbed over mesopore areas. For basic dye micropore area was critical. While modelling the dye adsorption equilibrium data, the Redlich-Peterson isotherm is preferred...|$|R
