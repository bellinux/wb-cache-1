5|$|The {{skull of}} Tarbosaurus was {{completely}} described {{for the first}} time in 2003. Scientists noted key differences between Tarbosaurus and the North American tyrannosaurids. Many of these differences are related to the handling of stress by the skull bones during a bite. When the upper jaw <b>bit</b> <b>down</b> on an object, force was transmitted up through the maxilla, the primary tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, into surrounding skull bones. In North American tyrannosaurids, this force went from the maxilla into the fused nasal bones on top of the snout, which were firmly connected in the rear to the lacrimal bones by bony struts. These struts locked the two bones together, suggesting that force was then transmitted from the nasals to the lacrimals.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSoft input soft output (SISO) decoders iteratively exchanging {{intermediate}} results (extrinsic information) {{between themselves}} {{lie at the}} core of turbo decoder architectures. The implementation architecture could be serial, parallel or network on chip (NoC) based. In this paper, we present a technique for bit-width reduction of exchanged extrinsic information and analyze the impact of it for different implementation architectures. The methodology is investigated over two kinds of turbo decoding system, both based on the Max-Log-MAP algorithm. First is a serial concatenated convolutional code (SCCC) decoder and the other is a WiMax (IEEE 802. 16 e) parallel concatenated convolutional code (PCCC) decoder. For the SCCC decoder, bitwidth of the extrinsic information can be reduced from 8 <b>bits</b> <b>down</b> to 4 without significant bit-error-rate (BER) degradation. For the WiMax case it can be reduced from 8 <b>bits</b> <b>down</b> to 5 with a BER degradation of 0. 2 dB...|$|R
25|$|Like all abelisaurs, the majungasaurines were {{carnivorous}} and had bulbous teeth, short heads, {{and strong}} necks. This meant that their wide jaws were very powerful, and could crush their prey’s trachea or vertebrae once they <b>bit</b> <b>down.</b> Majungasaurus {{is known to}} have preyed upon medium-sized sauropods such as Rapetosaurus, and its teeth marks have been found on the ribs of other Majungasaurus. Whether it actively hunted members of its own species or merely cannibalized their scavenged remains is unknown. This behavior has not been observed in any other majungasaurines.|$|E

2500|$|The {{butterfly}} stroke has three major parts, the pull, the push, and the recovery. These {{can also be}} further subdivided. From the initial position, the arm movement starts very similarly to the breast stroke. At the beginning the hands sink a little <b>bit</b> <b>down</b> with the palms facing outwards and slightly down at shoulder width, then the hands move out to create a Y. This is called catching the water. The pull movement follows a semicircle with the elbow higher than the hand and the hand pointing towards {{the center of the}} body and downward to form the traditionally taught [...] "keyhole".|$|E
2500|$|Close was the {{youngest}} player on the tour, and had {{little in common with}} the rest of the party; by the end he was not even on talking terms with most of them. After a reasonable start, making a century on his First Class debut in Australia, Close faltered, and then became injured, with a badly pulled groin muscle. He was selected to play in the second Test, which England lost by 28runs. After Australia were dismissed for 194, England had collapsed to 54 for 4 when Close came in to bat, with only eight deliveries to go before the lunch interval on the second day. Misjudging the bounce on the Melbourne wicket, which was somewhat different from the bounce of English wickets, he swept a ball from Jack Iverson only to get a top edge to Sam Loxton, fielding behind square leg. E. W. Swanton called it the worst shot he had seen played by a first-class batsman. The dressing room was silent when he returned. Brown, when advised that Close was a <b>bit</b> <b>down</b> and needed consolation, replied [...] "Let the blighter stew. He deserves it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prop master Russell Bobbitt had {{difficulty}} finding the cassette decks {{that had been}} used in the first film, and all of the Sony Walkman headsets they sourced for the sequel were broken. Sony also did not have any headsets available for filming, while three pairs Bobbitt found on eBay cost around $1,800 and were not the exact model. Bobbitt eventually created six from scratch for Vol. 2. Other props he created for the film included two sets of blasters for Quill, with removable blaster cartridges, and [...] "steampunk-looking weapons and belts" [...] for the Ravagers; Bobbitt explained that four different weapons were designed for the latter group, and then 15–20 versions of those were produced to be used by the various Ravager actors (there could be up to 85–95 Ravagers per scene). For their belts, the props team cut the leather themselves rather than buying existing belts, and then parts from different electronic devices such as radios and cell phones were glued together to make each belt [...] "a unique piece of art". The prop department also made edible props for certain scenes: a prop of a stinkbug-inspired insect was made from chocolate and injected with black honey so it could be eaten on screen and [...] "when he <b>bit</b> <b>down</b> the honey poured out of his mouth"; similarly, a [...] "yarrow root" [...] was designed based on enlarged images of pollen, and then created with non-dairy white chocolate to be eaten onscreen.|$|E

5000|$|Modulation sources {{include two}} {{individual}} triangle-wave LFOs (which Korg calls [...] "MG" [...] for [...] "modulation generator"). There is one LFO for pitch {{and one for}} filter. There are also two separate modulation sources for the built-in twin digital delays. The DSS-1 has two 6-stage envelope generators (one for filter and one for amp). Other features on the DSS-1 are: auto-bend (which allows for a pitch glide up or down to a destination pitch), oscillator sync (unusual for a sampler), and bit-crushing from 12 <b>bits</b> <b>down</b> to 6 <b>bits.</b> Oscillator sync in combination with autobend (on the slaved oscillator) allows the DSS-1 to emulate pulse width modulation.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of fixed point {{calculations}} on the accuracy of automatic emotion detection from speech signals. The tests used natural emotional speech recordings representing 16 speakers expressing two emotions: anger and neutral (unemotional) state. The feature set {{was derived from the}} Teager energy operator (TEO) and the speech was classified using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) method. The results showed that with decreasing fixed point resolution from 16 <b>bits</b> <b>down</b> to 6 <b>bits,</b> the average classification error for the TEO increases from 0. 0 % to 6. 6 %. At 8 bit resolution, the error was an acceptable 2. 4 %, which implies that the TEO can be efficiently calculated using low-cost hardware...|$|R

50|$|Tech Republic {{remarked that}} one of the best {{functions}} of Soda PDF was {{how easy it was to}} change the file size of the PDFs when saving. While reviewing Soda PDF 5, they commented on the fact that reducing file sizes was a straightforward process with the optimize feature. The file size can be adjusted using a slider ranging from minimum to maximum quality. The output can be further tuned by tweaking image sampling based on whether images contain color, grayscale or monochrome elements. Tech Republic concluded that Soda PDF did an excellent job of balancing readability and crunching <b>bits</b> <b>down</b> to more manageable sizes. This feature was carried forward to Soda PDF version 6 as well.|$|R
