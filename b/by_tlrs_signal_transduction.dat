We produce a homology model and present experimental data to support this model by demonstrating that, like mammalian Pellinos, viral Pellino can interact with IRAK- 1 via its forkhead-associated domain, whereas unlike its mammalian counterparts, it fails to post-translationally modify IRAK- 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that viral Pellino can functionally antagonise the activity of human Pellino 3 S.

Type I interferon (IFN) and cytokine production are crucial in the innate immune system. We previously reported that DENV serotype 2 (DENV- 2) induced low levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 and NF-κB activation, thus leading to reduced production of IFN-β in the early phase of infection. Here, we determined whether DENV infection not only hampers type I IFN activation but also cytokine production triggered <b>by</b> Toll-like receptor (<b>TLR)</b> <b>signaling.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used quantitative RT-PCR and found that only low levels of IFN-β and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL- 10), IL- 12 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mRNA were detected in DENV- 2 -infected bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells. Furthermore, DENV- 2 infection repressed cytokine production triggered <b>by</b> <b>TLR</b> <b>signaling.</b> To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this suppression event, we measured NF-κB activation by p 65 nuclear translocation and luciferase reporter assay and found that NF-κB activation triggered <b>by</b> <b>TLR</b> ligands was blocked by DENV- 2 infection.

40|$|Toll-like {{receptor}} (<b>TLR)</b> <b>signalling</b> {{represents the}} first line of defence against infection. TLRs respond to recognition of pathogens by activating transcription factors such as NFκB and the interferon regulatory factors (IRF) s to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs. Whilst many of the components of the <b>TLR</b> <b>signal</b> <b>transduction</b> pathways have been identified, a full understanding of these complex regulatory systems remains to be delineated. This thesis probes the molecular, cellular and physiological roles of a protein termed evolutionary conserved signalling intermediate in toll (ECSIT) in innate immune signalling pathways. ECSIT was initially described as a TRAF 6 interacting protein that bridged the <b>TLR</b> <b>signalling</b> intermediate TRAF 6 to MEKK 1 and downstream activation of NFκB. Subsequent data revealed an important developmental role for ECSIT in the BMP signalling pathway based on the embryonic lethal phenotype in the ECSIT knockout mouse. Other studies have indicated an important role for ECSIT in bacterial killing during infection via the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS). To date no information on the human orthologue of ECSIT (hECSIT) has been available. In this study we describe novel functional roles for hECSIT in <b>TLR</b> <b>signalling.</b> Through use of knockdown studies and a humanised animal model we demonstrate that hECSIT negatively regulates innate immune signalling pathways despite its 80 % sequence homology to mECSIT. We show that phosphorylation, ubiquitination and processing of hECSIT leads to an inhibitory C-terminal form that contains both E 3 ligase and DUB activity. We also demonstrate that hECSIT can independently target and regulate the ubiquitination of TRAF 6, TRAF 3 and RIP 1 in TLR 4 /IL- 1 R, TLR 3 and TNF-α signalling, respectively.

Constitutive mRNA expression of TLRs 1 to 6 was observed in fallopian tubes, uterine endometrium, cervix, and ectocervix. Furthermore, transcripts of the signaling adapter MyD 88 and the accessory molecule CD 14 were also detected in all tissues assayed. Quantitative analysis of TLR 2 mRNA levels revealed highest expression of this molecule in fallopian tube and cervical tissues, followed by endometrium and ectocervix. In contrast to TLR 2, TLR 4 expression declined progressively along the tract, with highest expression in the upper tissues (fallopian tubes and endometrium), followed by cervix and ectocervix. In addition to mRNA, protein expression of TLR 2 and TLR 4 was also documented in these tissues.

Two hundred and forty one-day-old avian broilers were divided into four groups and fed on a corn-soybean basal diet as control diet or the same basal diet supplemented with 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg of NiCl 2 for 42 days.

Our findings not only facilitated the further understanding of the crosstalk between miRNAs and TLRs in tumor biology, but also provided novel potential candidates for treatment of cancer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Fas pathway is {{described}} as an activator of the glioblastoma proliferation by increasing the pathogenicity of this tumour. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pathway depending on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) could limit the glioblastoma spreading. Here, Fas and TLR 4 pathways were activated in glioblastoma cell lines by an agonist antibody and/or LPS treatment. Activation of the Fas pathway or of the TLR 4 pathway induced cell proliferation. However, simultaneous treatment with agonist antibody and LPS decreased proliferation. This anti-proliferative effect was caspase dependent, and a decreased cell migration and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9 expression were also observed. Both TLR 4 and MMP- 9 were highly expressed in human glioblastoma tissues. These data suggest that <b>TLR</b> 4 <b>signal</b> <b>transduction</b> pathways neutralize proliferation and migration induced by Fas pathway activation in glioblastoma cell lines...|$|R
40|$|The {{immune system}} must {{discriminate}} between pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes {{in order to}} initiate an appropriate response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect microbial components common to both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, whereas Nod-like receptors (NLRs) sense microbial components introduced into the host cytosol by the specialized secretion systems or pore-forming toxins of bacterial pathogens. The host signaling pathways that respond to bacterial secretion systems remain poorly understood. Infection with the pathogen Legionella pneumophila, which utilizes a type IV secretion system (T 4 SS), induced an increased proinflammatory cytokine response compared to avirulent bacteria in which the T 4 SS was inactivated. This enhanced response involved NF-kappaB activation <b>by</b> <b>TLR</b> <b>signaling</b> as well as Nod 1 and Nod 2 detection of type IV secretion. Furthermore, a TLR- and RIP 2 -independent pathway leading to p 38 and SAPK/JNK MAPK activation was found to play an equally {{important role in the}} host response to virulent L. pneumophila. Activation of this MAPK pathway was T 4 SS-dependent and coordinated with <b>TLR</b> <b>signaling</b> to mount a robust proinflammatory cytokine response to virulent L. pneumophila. These findings define a previously uncharacterized host response to bacterial type IV secretion that activates MAPK signaling and demonstrate that coincident detection of multiple bacterial components enables immune discrimination between virulent and avirulent bacteria...|$|R
40|$|HBV {{infection}} is characterised by a prolonged ‘immunotolerant hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) -positive phase’ where patients are persistently infected with high viral loads, yet they demonstrate no overt inflammation or liver damage. This represents a highly evolved host-parasite relationship. Viruses {{are known to}} target the host innate immune system {{as a means of}} establishing infection and maintaining chronicity. In humans, the innate immune system recognises pathogens via pattern recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), initiating a pro-inflammatory responses. <b>TLRs</b> and associated <b>signalling</b> proteins are characterised by their transmembrane and cytoplasmic Toll-IL 1 receptor (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is critical for homotypic TIR:TIR interactions with downstream adaptor proteins leading to activation of downstream transcription factors Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) - 3. Previous studies have demonstrated that both TLR expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine production is reduced in HBeAg-positive patients compared to HBeAg-negative patients following TLR stimulation. HBeAg is a secreted, non-particulate version of the HBV nucleocapsid protein, the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). It is transcribed, translated and secreted very early in the HBV replication cycle, although importantly, 20 - 30 % of HBeAg is retained in the cytoplasm. No known role is ascribed to this cytosolic HBeAg. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate interactions between <b>TLR</b> <b>signal</b> <b>transduction</b> pathways and the mature HBeAg protein localised in the cytosol. In this thesis I have provided a novel molecular mechanism illustrating how HBeAg inhibits TIR-mediated inflammatory response through direct interaction with a sub-set of TIR-containing proteins. Bio-informatics analysis of HBeAg identified a novel N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence referred to as the Precore Specific Sequence (PSS) distinct from HBcAg, as homologous to the TIR motif found in <b>TLR</b> and associated <b>signal</b> <b>transduction</b> proteins. I have demonstrated by co-localisation and immunoprecipitation that HBeAg, but not HBcAg, is able to interact with a sub-set of membrane proximal TIR-proteins including MyD 88 adaptor-like (Mal) and Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule- 2 (TRAM). This specificity of this interaction between HBeAg and TIR-containing proteins is demonstrated by the requirement of three critical amino acids “LCL” within the PSS, as mutation of these amino acids ablates all interaction and exerts no inhibitory properties. Critically interactions between HBeAg and TIR-containing proteins were specific as no interaction was observed with MyD 88 as illustrated by co-immunoprecipitation or co-localisation studies. Luciferase reporter assays were employed to demonstrate the biological consequences of HBeAg interaction with TIR-containing receptor and adaptor proteins. Co-expression of HBeAg with TLR- 2, Mal, TRAM and TIR domain containing adaptor inducing interferon (TRIF) resulted in the significant suppression of both NF-κB and Interferon-β (IFN-β) activation. Consistent with previous findings, NF-κB activation was unaffected by co-expression of HBeAg with MyD 88. Importantly, HBcAg which lacks the PSS and the HBeAg mutant had no effect on downstream activation of NF-κB or IFN-β. HBeAg appears to function by sequestering TIR-containing proteins from homotypic TIR:TIR signalling complexes as co-expression. This was illustrated by co-expression of HBeAg inhibiting homotypic TIR:TIR interactions between Mal and MyD 88, therefore disrupting downstream signalling. There are several genotypes of HBV found globally and previous studies have reported variation in responsiveness to IFN-β treatment between genotypes. I wished to determine if there were differences in modulation of innate responses amongst genotypes. Interestingly it appears that genotypes A and B suppress predominantly NF-κB mediated responses, whereas genotypes C and D are were found to significantly inhibit both NF-κB and IFN-β mediated responses. Furthermore, TLR- 2 -induced Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) expression is reduced in HBV genotypes C and D compared to genotypes A and B following treatment with IFN-β and TLR- 2 agonist Pam 3 Cys. Critically my findings demonstrate that HBV genotype significantly influences the degree of immuno-modulation on TIR-mediated responses. These findings correlate with previous clinical studies which show individuals with genotypes A and B have higher response rates to IFN treatment facilitating seroconversion compared to genotypes C and D. Critically I have provided a mechanism describing how administration of IFN enhances host immunity in CHB individuals which may explain differences in responsiveness to IFN treatment between HBV genotypes. Overall HBV genotype is an important predictor of response to IFN-based therapy in CHB infection. For best clinical practice and treatment outcome it is strongly recommend that determination of HBV genotype is established before commencing treatment. In conclusion findings presented in this thesis provide a novel molecular mechanism as to how HBeAg interacts with <b>TLR</b> <b>signal</b> <b>transduction</b> pathways to immuno-modulate TIR-mediated innate responses. Importantly the discovery of the PSS, which acts to negatively regulate <b>TLR</b> <b>signalling,</b> may be used in future designs for a novel therapeutic against not only HBV but other TLR-inflammatory diseases circumventing chronicity and poor clinical outcome...|$|R
40|$|Myeloid {{differentiating}} factor 88 (MyD 88) and MyD 88 adaptor-like (Mal) are adaptor molecules critically {{involved in the}} Toll-like receptor (<b>TLR)</b> 4 <b>signaling</b> pathway. While Mal has been proposed {{to serve as a}} membrane-sorting adaptor, MyD 88 mediates <b>signal</b> <b>transduction</b> from activated <b>TLR</b> 4 to downstream components. The Toll/Interleukin- 1 receptor (TIR) domain of MyD 88 is responsible for sorting and signaling via direct or indirect TIR−TIR interactions between Mal and TLR 4. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in multiple interactions of the TIR domain remain unclear. The present study describes the solution structure of the MyD 88 TIR domain. Reporter gene assays revealed that 3 discrete surface sites in the TIR domain of MyD 88 are important for <b>TLR</b> 4 <b>signaling.</b> Two of these sites were shown to mediate direct binding to the TIR domain of Mal. Interestingly, Mal-TIR, but not MyD 88 -TIR, directly binds to the cytosolic TIR domain of TLR 4.

40|$|The human body’s {{first line}} of defense against invading {{pathogens}} is the innate immune system. This defense mechanism uses pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). One family of PRRs, is the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family consisting of 10 human members which all recognize different PAMPs. Upon detection of their ligands, TLRs initiate an intracellular signaling cascade resulting in either NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (the MyD 88 -dependent pathway) or interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) activation and interferon production (the MyD 88 -independent pathway). TLR 4 is a unique member of the TLR family as it is able to signal via both the MyD 88 -dependent and MyD 88 -independent pathway. Binding of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to TLR 4, results in the intracellular recruitment of the TLR 4 adaptor proteins Mal and MyD 88, initiating the MyD 88 -dependent signaling cascade. Upon endocytosis of the activated receptor, the adaptors Tram and Trif are recruited activating the MyD 88 -independent pathway. A tight regulation of activation of these pathways is required in order to prevent chronic inflammation and several associated diseases. The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf 6) was implicated in <b>TLR</b> 4 <b>signaling</b> as a regulator of the localization of the adaptor protein Mal, hence controlling <b>TLR</b> 4 <b>signal</b> <b>transduction.</b> However, later findings contradicted this. In this PhD, we clarified the role of Arf 6 in <b>TLR</b> 4 <b>signaling.</b> We showed that Arf 6 is able to function independently of Mal upon LPS stimulation. This lead to the discovery of a novel function of Arf 6 as a regulator of LPS-induced transport of the adaptor protein Tram to the endocytic recycling compartment. Via this mechanism, Arf 6 controls the MyD 88 -independent <b>TLR</b> 4 <b>signaling</b> pathway and subsequent interferon production. Next to its role in the MyD 88 -independent pathway, Arf 6 is essential for the initial steps of the TLR 4 MyD 88 -dependent signaling cascade resulting in NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. We show {{for the first time that}} Arf 6 is activated immediately upon LPS stimulation. These results demonstrate that Arf 6 is an essential regulator of <b>TLR</b> 4 <b>signal</b> <b>transduction.</b> Further research on the effector proteins, the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs; deactivators of Arf 6) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; Arf 6 activators) that regulate/are regulated by Arf 6 in its TLR 4 -specific functions might provide valuable information to develop new therapeutics targeting dysregulated TLR 4 processes...|$|R

Both pathways can lead to expression of IFN-. TLR-dependent and-indepen-dent signals converge in the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF 6) adaptor, which mediates the acti-vation of NF-. Infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) with Chlamydia pneu-moniae induces IFN-/- and NF [...] dependent ex-pression of IFN-, which in turn, will control bacterial growth. The role of IRAK 4 and IRF 3 in the regulation of IFN-/ expression and NF- activa-tion was studied inC. pneumoniae-infected BMM. We found that levels of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- mRNA were reduced in infected IRAK 4 / BMM compared with wild-type (WT) controls. BMM also showed an IRAK 4 -dependent growth control of C. pneumoniae. No increased IRF 3 activation was detected in C. pneumoniae-infected BMM. Similar numbers of in-tracellular bacteria, IFN-, and IFN- mRNA titers were observed in C. pneumoniae-infected IRF 3 / BMM. On the contrary, IFN-/ BMM showed lower IFN- and IFN-mRNA levels and higher bac-terial titers compared with WT controls. C. pneu-moniae infection-induced activation of NF- and expression of proinflammatory cytokines were shown to be TRAF 6 -dependent but did not require IRAK 4 or IRF 3. Thus, our data indicate that IRAK 4, but not IRF 3, controls C. pneumoniae-induced IFN- and IFN- secretion and bacterial growth. IRAK 4 and IRF 3 are redundant for infection-induced NF-B ac-tivation, which is regulated by TRAF 6. J. Leukoc...|$|R
