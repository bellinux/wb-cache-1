40|$|Due to the {{multitude}} of advantages <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas have over conventional planar antennas (especially onchip planar antennas), they have received much research attention within the last four years. The focus of the contributions made {{so far has been}} on exploiting different configurations of single-element and array <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas for short-range applications at RF/microwave frequencies. However, the effects of process tolerances of <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> on the radiation characteristics of <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas have not been studied in published literature. Therefore in this paper, we investigate the impact of up to 20 % fluctuations in the parameters of <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> on the performance of 42 GHz and 60 GHz <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas. Our results reveal that the length and radius of <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> are the most and least sensitive parameters, respectively. Furthermore, the severity of the impact of process tolerances depends on the impedance bandwidth of the original antenna, before considering the tolerances. For example, a 10 % change in the length of a <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> causes the resonance frequency of a 42 GHz antenna to be shifted out of the specified 3 GHz bandwidth (40. 5 GHz- 43. 5 GHz) required for point-to-point communication. However, although a 10 % change in length of a <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> yields a 2. 5 GHz shift in the resonance frequency of a 60 GHz <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antenna, it doesn't completely detune the antenna because of the original 6 GHz bandwidth available, prior to the fluctuation. Therefore, to prevent the impact of process tolerances from severely degrading the performance <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antennas, these antennas should be designed to have larger bandwidths than specified. For experimental verification, a <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> antenna was designed, fabricated and measured. Very good correlation was obtained between measurement and simulation...|$|R

Typically used wire materials in industry are aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), and intermetallic compounds of Cu-Al. They are broadly used because of their strength, high thermal conductivity, and low resistivity. This study reports on the influence of thermal loading on the mechanical behaviour of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires.</b> Experimental techniques are developed and introduced in this thesis to analyze quasi-static and dynamic response of <b>bonding</b> <b>wires</b> 300 µm in diameter.

40|$|Abstract—During {{manufacture}} of <b>wire</b> <b>bonding</b> in packaged IC products, {{the breaking of}} <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> and the peeling of bond pads occur frequently. The result is open-circuit failure in IC products. There were several prior methods reported {{to overcome these problems}} by using additional process flows or special materials. In this paper, a layout method is proposed to improve the <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> reliability in general CMOS processes. By changing the layout patterns of bond pads, the reliability of <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> on <b>bond</b> pads can be improved. A set of different layout patterns of bond pads has been drawn and fabricated in a 0. 6 - m single-poly triple-metal CMOS process for investigation by the <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> reliability tests, the ball shear test and the wire pull test. By im-plementing effective layout patterns on bond pads in packaged IC products, not only the <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> reliability can be improved, but also the bond pad capacitance can be reduced for high frequency application.

50|$|Soldered joints {{can fail}} {{in many ways}} like {{electromigration}} and formation of brittle intermetallic layers. Some failures show only at extreme joint temperatures, hindering troubleshooting. Thermal expansion mismatch between the printed circuit board material and its packaging strains the part-to-board bonds; while leaded parts can absorb the strain by bending, leadless parts rely on the solder to absorb stresses. Thermal cycling may lead to fatigue cracking of the solder joints, especially with elastic solders; various approaches are used to mitigate such incidents. Loose particles, like <b>bonding</b> <b>wire</b> and weld flash, can form in the device cavity and migrate inside the packaging, causing often intermittent and shock-sensitive shorts. Corrosion may cause buildup of oxides and other nonconductive products on the contact surfaces. When closed, these then show unacceptably high resistance; they may also migrate and cause shorts. Tin whiskers can form on tin-coated metals like the internal side of the packagings; loose whiskers then can cause intermittent short circuits inside the packaging. Cables, {{in addition to the}} methods described above, may fail by fraying and fire damage.|$|E

5000|$|A person upon first {{seeing a}} ball bonder will usually compare its {{operation}} {{to that of}} a sewing machine. In fact there is a needle-like disposable tool called the capillary, through which the wire is fed. A high-voltage electric charge is applied to the wire. This melts the wire {{at the tip of the}} capillary. The tip of the wire forms into a ball because of the surface tension of the molten metal.The ball quickly solidifies, and the capillary is lowered to the surface of the chip, which is typically heated to at least 125°C. The machine then pushes down on the capillary and applies ultrasonic energy with an attached transducer. The combined heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy create a weld between the copper or gold ball and the surface of the chip - which is usually copper or aluminum. This is the so-called ball bond that gives the process its name. (All-aluminum systems in semiconductor fabrication eliminate the [...] "purple plague" [...] - a brittle gold-aluminum intermetallic compound - sometimes associated with pure gold <b>bonding</b> <b>wire.</b> This property makes aluminum ideal for ultrasonic bonding.) Next the wire is passed out through the capillary and the machine moves over a few millimeters to the location that the chip needs to be wired up to (usually called the leadframe). The machine again descends to the surface, this time without making a ball so that the wire is crushed between the leadframe and the tip of the capillary. This time the surface is usually gold, palladium, or silver - but the weld is made in the same way. The resulting weld is quite different in appearance from the ball bond, and is referred to as the wedge bond, tail bond, or simply as the second bond.|$|E

Integration of radio frequency transmitter (RF) technology with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor/micro electro mechanical systems (CMOS/ MEMS) microsensors is required to realize the wireless smart microsensors system. The essential RF components such as a voltage controlled RF-CMOS oscillator (VCO), spiral inductors for an LC resonator and an integrated antenna have been fabricated and evaluated experimentally.

For the early detection and characterization of such failures, it is important to constantly detect or monitor the health state of IGBT modules, and the state of <b>bond</b> <b>wires</b> in particular. This paper introduces eddy current pulsed thermography (ECPT), a nondestructive evaluation technique, for the state detection and characterization of <b>bond</b> <b>wire</b> lift-off in IGBT modules. After the introduction of the experimental ECPT system, numerical simulation work is reported.
