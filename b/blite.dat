He was an artist on The Real Ghostbusters comic for Marvel UK and was the colourist on the first seven issues of Paul Grist's superhero comic book, Jack Staff. Other work has appeared in Punch, Knockabout, Fox Comics and Power Rangers. Elliott has recently coloured Paul Grist's series Demon Nic which was published in the Judge Dredd Megazine. He has also coloured various Doctor Who comics for IDW Publishing.|$|E
50|$|An {{abundance}} of plants have taken root in Newport Bay. Each {{of the plants}} has adapted to the saltwater-marsh habitat, known as a saltmarsh. These plants are known as halophytes, and have adapted to grow submerged in saltwater. Common halophytes found in the Back Bay include: saltmarsh bird's beak (Cordylanthus maritimus), fleshy jaumea, sea lavender, brewer's salt brush, sea <b>blite,</b> and alkali heath. There are also coastal plant communities scattered throughout the land surrounding the Back Bay. This includes grassland and coastal sage scrub. Native sage scrub varieties include California sagebrush and buckwheat. However, recently the Back Bay {{has been known to}} be home to various plant invaders. These non-native species include wild mustards and pampas grass.|$|E

"Shield Your Eyes" [...] was {{the first}} Jawbreaker song to be released, on the 7" [...] vinyl {{compilation}} album The World's in Shreds Volume Two on independent record label Shredder Records. This {{was followed by a}} single for the song [...] "Busy" [...] and the Whack & <b>Blite</b> 7" [...] E.P. in 1989. In total Jawbreaker wrote almost 20 songs in 1988 and 1989, many of which appeared on compilations and split singles over the next two years. The band played their first show March 16, 1989 at Club 88 in Los Angeles and recorded their debut album, Unfun, in two days in Venice in January 1990. Released through Shredder, its pop punk sound was distinguished by Schwarzenbach's lyrical and vocal intensity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Adaptable Pervasive Flows {{is a novel}} workflow-based {{paradigm}} for the design and execution of pervasive applications, where dynamic workflows situated {{in the real world}} are able to modify their execution in order to adapt to changes in their environment. In this paper, we study a formalisation of such flows by means of a formal flow language. More precisely, we define APFoL (Adaptable Pervasive Flow Language) and formalise its textual notation by encoding it in <b>Blite,</b> a formalisation of WS-BPEL. The encoding in <b>Blite</b> equips the language with a formal semantics and enables the use of automated verification techniques. We illustrate the approach with an example of a Warehouse Case Study. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, WS-BPEL {{has become}} a de facto {{standard}} language for orchestration of Web Services. However, {{there are still some}} well-known difficulties that make programming in WS-BPEL a tricky task. In this paper, we firstly point out major loose points of the WS-BPEL specification by means of many examples, some of which are also exploited to test and compare the behaviour of three of the most known freely available WS-BPEL engines. We show that, as a matter of fact, these engines implement different semantics, which undermines portability of WS-BPEL programs over different platforms. Then we introduce <b>Blite,</b> a prototypical orchestration language equipped with a formal operational semantics, which is closely inspired by, but simpler than, WS-BPEL. Indeed, <b>Blite</b> is designed around some of WS-BPEL distinctive features like partner links, process termination, message correlation, long-running business transactions and compensation handlers. Finally, we present BliteC, a software tool supporting a rapid and easy development of WS-BPEL applications via translation of service orchestrations written in <b>Blite</b> into executable WS-BPEL programs. We illustrate our approach by means of a running example borrowed from the official specification of WS-BPEL...|$|E

40|$|Many {{factors are}} known to {{influence}} greenhouse gas emissions from coastal wetlands, {{but it is still}} unclear which factors are most important under field conditions when they are all acting simultaneously. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of water table, salinity, soil temperature and vegetation on CH 4 emissions and ecosystem respiration (R eco) from five coastal wetlands in the Liaohe Delta, Northeast China: two Phragmites australis (common reed) wetlands, two Suaeda salsa (sea <b>blite)</b> marshes and a rice (Oryza sativa) paddy. Throughout the growing season, the Suaeda wetlands were net CH 4 sinks whereas the Phragmites wetlands and the rice paddy were net CH 4 sources emitting 1. 2 – 6. 1 g CH 4 m − 2 yr − 1. The Phragmites wetlands emitted the most CH 4 per unit area and the most CH 4 relative to CO 2. The main controlling factors for the CH 4 emissions were water table, temperature, soil organic carbon and salinity. The CH 4 emission was accelerated at high and constant (or managed) water tables and decreased at water tables below the soil surface. High temperatures enhanced CH 4 emissions, and emission rates were consistently low (4 m − 2 h − 1) at soil temperatures 18 ppt, the CH 4 emission rates were always low (4 m − 2 h − 1) probably because methanogens were out-competed by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Saline Phragmites wetlands can, however, emit significant amounts of CH 4 as CH 4 produced in deep soil layers are transported through the air-space tissue of the plants to the atmosphere. The CH 4 emission from coastal wetlands can be reduced by creating fluctuating water tables, including water tables below the soil surface, as well as by occasional flooding by high-salinity water. The effects of water management schemes on the biological communities in the wetlands must, however, be carefully studied prior to the management in order to avoid undesirable effects on the wetland communities...|$|E
