It's really, really peaceful and you're drawn to it. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> too close, it can torch you and kill you. But if you just get close enough, it's warm and it's soothing, it's mesmerising and it's peaceful. It can give you everything or destroy you, depending on how smart you are."

500|$|The {{inclusion}} {{or cutting}} of some characters sparked speculation from fans {{as to the}} importance of the characters in the final book of the series, which was released just ten days after the film. In April 2006, representatives of Jim McManus said he would be playing Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus' brother and the barman of the Hog's Head, in which Harry and his friends found Dumbledore's Army. A week later WB announced that the role was [...] "very minor", allaying some of the speculation to the significance of the role, which, before the final book, was not even a speaking part. MTV reported in October 2006 that Dobby the house elf, who appeared in the second film, Chamber of Secrets, and in the fifth book, would be cut, opening up [...] "plot questions" [...] as to how the role of the elf would be filled. MTV also reported about a month before the release of the final book that Kreacher, the Black family's house-elf, was cut from the film in one draft of the script. However, after Rowling prodded the filmmakers to include him, saying, [...] "You know, I wouldn't [...] if I were you. Or you can, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to make a seventh film, you'll be tied in knots", he was added back into the script.|$|E

[...] To grow algae you need lots of CO2, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> it from air you will also get all kinds of other organisms, some of which eat algae. [...] Getting CO2 from a smokestack works out really well. [...] Governments trying to address the external costs of coal power plants may have a carbon tax or carbon credit that provides additional motivation to use CO2 from smokestacks.

Don Rosa, a subsequent cartoonist of Donald Duck, described his placement of the imaginary town: [...] "I won't bother to say precisely where I situated Duckburg and Calisota on America's west coast... <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> out a good map and compare the coastline, you'll see that I stuck the old gold-prospector's adopted hometown directly across the bay from a very appropriately named actual city." ...|$|E
