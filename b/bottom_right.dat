5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a third-person perspective, and the player can freely move in three-dimensional space and rotate the camera in any direction. The top left corner of the screen interface shows the status of Logan's armour, a 'danger-meter' which rises as the player engages enemies through combat, and a target lock. A radar is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen which shows the location of various objects including friendly units, enemies, weapon pick ups or mission objectives. The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the <b>bottom</b> <b>right</b> corner, with the ammunition count. Depending on the weapon used, the camera will shift to first-person mode to assist in aiming.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} <b>bottom</b> <b>right</b> corner, two Polish Jews {{are on the}} edge of the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E

5|$|On 25 August 2011, Challinor {{signed for}} Kettering's Conference Premier rivals York City on a {{contract}} until January 2012, having impressed manager Gary Mills when playing against York for Kettering two days earlier. He made his debut a day later, coming on as a 56th-minute substitute for Patrick McLaughlin in a 0–0 draw away to Fleetwood Town. Challinor was soon converted into a right back at York, a position in which he displayed composure {{and an ability to}} start attacking moves. His first goal for York came in a 4–2 win away to Hayes & Yeading United on 22 October 2011 with a drilled shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>right</b> corner of the goal {{from the edge of the}} penalty area.|$|E
5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and the bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the <b>bottom</b> <b>right</b> of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E
5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{fragment}} of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site. Owing to its damaged state, {{none of the three}} texts is absolutely complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; all of them are broken on the right side, and 12 of them on the left. The following register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on the right side. The final register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the <b>bottom</b> <b>right</b> of the stone.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is {{a departure}} from previous instalments in the series, using a direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's movements with a keyboard or gamepad, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character at certain times. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectable objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player has action choices in the <b>bottom</b> <b>right</b> of the screen - there are four circles with anywhere from one to four actions available at any time; the player selects the desired action with the corresponding key. As in the first two Broken Sword games, in The Sleeping Dragon player character death is possible.|$|E
5|$|This item, {{consisting}} of one painting and associated caption/text, was originally the third {{scene of the}} Matsudaira clan scroll before being reshaped into a hanging scroll by Masuda Donō in 1933. At some point it was in possession of the Ōkura clan　(大倉家), but it is now owned by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and in custody of the Tokyo National Museum. It was designated an Important Cultural Property on March 31, 1953. Like its preceding and successive scenes (scenes 2 and 3 from the Gotoh edition), the painting depicts the celebration for the 50th day {{of the birth of}} the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008). The main characters are in full dress in a room decorated with kichō partitioners and the prince's grandfather, Fujiwara no Michinaga at the bottom is offering rice cake (mochi) to the prince in a form of ceremonial ritual. The female servant at the <b>bottom</b> <b>right</b> is presumably the author of the diary Murasaki Shikibu.|$|E
