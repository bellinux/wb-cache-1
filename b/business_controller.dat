40|$|The {{concept of}} the <b>business</b> <b>Controller,</b> which {{in its present form}} is related to {{financial}} and economic responsibilities within companies, is an American concept that was introduced in the late 19 th century. The concept has since conquered the world and is by now a well-known apponitment. Still there is no universal definition attributed to it, and this causes serious confusion concerning what a Controller is actually supposed to do. We have therefore chosen to try to identify the role of the <b>business</b> <b>Controller</b> in American companies and compare this {{to the role of the}} Swedish Controlller and finally, explain any differences as well as the nature of the origin of these differences. The research was based on an earlier study made on large Swedish companies, from which we constructed a questionnaire that was presented to representatives for large American companies. Next we undertook a series of interviews with knowledgeable Swedish Controllers in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the differences identified, as well as to ensure that our findings were accurate. Through our questionnaire we learned that American Controllers regard internal and external accounting and budgeting as important tasks. Swedish Controllers on the other hand regards reporting as the most important area. This does not imply that any of the areas investigated are unimportant. It merely suggests that the areas are prioritized differently. Nevertheless, all areas considered important by the respondents can be considered as quite traditional accounting tasks, something we found somewhat contradictory to much of the current literature on the subject, which advocates the view of a more strategic role associsted to the <b>business</b> <b>Controller.</b> Furthermore, we found differences concerning desirable traits held by Swedish and American Controllers. For instance, creativity and flexibility were considered important traits in Sweden whilst they were almost considered undesirable in the USA. At the same time, Americans ranked leadership highly whilst the Swedes did not. However, it also became clear that controllers in both countries have to be able to process and analyze economic information and, perhaps even more importantly, be able to communicate this information throughout the organisatíon. Thus, it has been clearly shown that, as well as there are similarities, there are indeed also significant differences in national and corporate cultures, which is also the very reason why a consistent and international defintion to attribute to the <b>business</b> <b>Controller</b> is hard to identify.

40|$|Abstract. Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is an {{initiative}} of the OMG in which the software development process is driven by various software-related models describing the software to be generated. Moreover, the new upcoming UML 2. 0 standard promises to support the execution of models based on several types of actions {{as well as the}} inheritance of statecharts. We adapt this new technology in order to generate business controllers. By application of the popular Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, these controllers separate core business model functionality like database management from the presentation and control logic that uses this functionality (i. e., interactive user access). In particular, a controller translates user interactions realized by means of an interactive view into actions on the core business model. This paper deals with the generation of business controllers applying MDA and UML 2. 0 concepts and presents experiences gained in the background of a bigger industrial project. The focus is on statecharts and actions used for the specification and execution of controllers. In particular, {{in order to deal with}} the inheritance of statechart diagrams specified for business controllers, we define a couple of transformation rules. These rules support the transformation of abstract PIM statecharts modelling the functionality of business controllers to a flat PSM statechart describing a <b>business</b> <b>controller</b> in a more implementation-like fashion. We outline the application of the transformation rules by means of a <b>business</b> <b>controller</b> example application. ...|$|E

Project controllers are involved in development projects in order to review the financial aspects. The authors have examined the role that project controllers hold in respect of two Swedish manufacturers, Volvo CE and Scania CV. The investigation has revolved around three main issues where the authors conducted interviews with controllers that do not work in development projects and project controllers in development projects. The goal of the interviews was to gain {{a greater understanding of}} the role of project controllers, how this role will differ from those that do not work in development projects and the difficulties faced by project controllers. The investigation has shown that studies on the subject area of project controller are limited. Focus has been on the role of <b>business</b> <b>controller</b> and how this role can contribute to better decisions and management of companies. The analysis of the case companies has shows that project controllers contains properties that business controllers has but has also properties of the more analytical and more accounting oriented role of accounting controller. The authors draw the conclusions that the project controller’s role should be developed and aim of doing it more business oriented. The role of project controller should be more clearly described, divided and the processes should be clarified {{in order to make the}} role of project controller at the case companies more similar to the role of <b>business</b> <b>controller...</b>|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of debate on the new business-oriented role of {{management}} accountants during recent years. This paper examines how a case company is trying to change its management accounting culture in practice. Furthermore, it illustrates how accounting practices are woven into the cultural fabric of an organization and the great diversity of practices constituting its business orientation. This longitudinal case study explores and theorizes the multiple cultural change interventions related to management accounting, including how the case company reorganized the management accounting organization, implemented new accounting systems and innovations, pursued a new kind of human resource management (recruitment, training and career planning policies) and set the official corporate values in order to support this change. The deepened decentralization of the <b>business</b> <b>controller</b> function, combined with the effective and increasingly centralized basic accounting systems (such as ERP and consolidation packages) and HRM management, were of high importance in establishing the new business orientation. Moreover, informal interventions such as the role modelling and directing of personal attention - carried out by the top management and top financial executives - and storytelling, contributed to the constitution of cultural practices. Thus, the potential power of these informal change interventions and mechanisms should not be underestimated, with further research being, in fact, in great need. As its major theoretical development, at the end of the report, this study introduces a systematic framework of the cultural change interventions related to management accounting. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is threefold. Firstly, the thesis intends to illustrate the controller that can be observed right after the organisational changes in the case company. In addition, the thesis intends to represent the factors that cause the controller to perform {{in a way that}} can be observed, and consider the permanence of this change. Secondly, the observations are considered through metaphoric roles presented by Vesa Partanen (2001). The purpose is not to observe all of the roles presented by Partanen, but to concentrate on the few which seem to be the most interesting. Thirdly, the thesis looks into the management accounting function's degree of decentralisation. Moreover, it considers how the decreased degree of decentralisation has affected on the controller's roles. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: A qualitative research method was chosen for this thesis's research method because it answers to the questions why, how, and what kind? The qualitative research method is the semi-structured interview method in a case company environment. This sort of research method fits best to real life scenarios in which different events' and factors' effect to each other is complex and cannot be shattered arbitrarily into tiny pieces. The empirical data was gathered by interviewing 1 controller, and 7 managers who represented different managerial levels and regional areas of the case company. In addition, the observations are compared with previous researches that are considered to be valid in this research area. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The observations of this study illustrate that the controller was not fully a bean-counter or a <b>business</b> <b>controller.</b> He had features of both. In addition, there seemed to be two kinds of drivers of change. Others enhancing the bean-counting and others the roles related to business controlling. However, the permanence of the change {{does not seem to be}} constant. In addition, the subsidiary's controller was able to perform the metaphoric role of an envoy. Furthermore, the controller did not seem to have much of decision power while performing his metaphoric role as a rally car co-driver. Last but not least, the decreased degree of decentralisation seemed to increase the controller's monitoring roles...|$|E
40|$|Background: Increasing {{competition}} {{has led to}} a large interest for management control and leadership in Sweden. The controller’s role has changed from just including number crunching tasks to become more market and customer oriented. Therefore the use of controllers today is increasing within Swedish organisations. The role incorporates involvement in management decision making process. Organisational structure affects the work role as well as the location of the employee within an organisation. Purpose: Our objective is to explore how and why the controller roles in Sweden differ from one organisation to another. To make it more interesting a second dimension, organisational structure, is included. We aim to develop guidelines that can provide useful insights to already existing theory. A mix between the inductive and the deductive approach is used. Method: A qualitative cross case study has been performed where controllers from six different organisations present in the Swedish market have been interviewed. The organisations are operating in the clothing industry. Generalisation is not emphasised rather the uniqueness of each case is highlighted. A cross case analysis was performed to reveal differences and similarities between the cases. Conclusion: We have found that a divisionalised structure where the subsidiary is relatively large results in decentralised decision making. The controller belongs to an own function located straight below the CEO and is titled <b>business</b> <b>controller.</b> This controller is recognised to be an involved controller. The involved controller was also found in organisations where some influences of the machine bureaucracy were apparent. If the controller belongs to the finance function it is likely that he/she performs accounting related tasks and the controller role is recognised to be the independent controller. If the controller belongs to the purchase function and the adhocracy is found the split controller role is evident. To prevent confusion we suggest that more controller titles should be added and the title should also communicate what tasks and responsibilities that correspond to the role. If you belong to the finance function an appropriate title would be accounting controller. By looking at the organisational structure it is possible to get guidance for what the role incorporates and what tasks and responsibilities that can be expected. Variance will always apply since there are no rules and regulations for financial control...|$|E
40|$|The duality {{characteristics}} of budgeting between the flexibility driven {{decision making and}} the integration focused management control inspire the author to investigate how the flexibility and integration domains influence <b>business</b> <b>controllers?</b> choices of IS technologies used in budgeting. This includes the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, business intelligent (BI), web tool and spreadsheets. Guided by the concept of human agency, twenty <b>business</b> <b>controllers</b> in eleven companies in Thailand are interviewed. The analysis shows that flexibility and integration in budgeting IS technologies can be viewed from four domains: organisation-in-focus, personal requirement, business requirement and reporting requirement. The analysis also shows that there are conflicts between these four domains based on the needs for flexibility and integration. It is found that spreadsheets are used when flexibility is needed especially for decision making at local unit level. However advanced IS technologies like the ERP system, BI and web tool, are employed for relatively stable management control tasks. The major implication is that <b>business</b> <b>controllers</b> apply budgeting IS technologies to fit {{the nature of the}} budgeting tasks at hand. Therefore there is clearly a need to employ a variety of IS technologies, and not to dominate any particular IS technologies for budgeting because each system is designed for its own respective purposes and intentions...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how contextual {{uncertainty}} {{and the use}} of the budgetary system explain cross-sectional variation in the organisational role of <b>business</b> unit <b>controllers.</b> We argue that there are complementarities between the role of the budgetary control system (i. e. coercive vs. enabling) and the role of the controller (i. e. corporate policeman vs. business partner). Thus, we explore both the direct effect of uncertainty on the role of the controller and the indirect effect through the role of the budgetary control system. Using survey data from 134 <b>business</b> unit <b>controllers,</b> we find that uncertainty provides a partial explanation of the variation in the role of budgetary control systems and in the role of controllers. In particular, our data suggest alignment between the coercive (enabling) use of the budgetary control system and the role of controllers acting as corporate policemen (business partners). These findings add to our understanding of the functioning of <b>business</b> unit <b>controllers</b> within their organisational context...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Study {{objectives}} The goal of {{this study}} is to research the controller's role in a Western manufacture company which operates in China. Prior researchers have focused their vision on the controller's change in Western countries, while the controller's role in China has been rarely known. And previous literature has already discussed some certain troubles faced by controllers. So in order to examine if the findings of the West also apply to Chinese controllers, two following research questions are presented: Q 1 : what kind of role does the controller play in a Chinese context? Q 2 : in what aspects could controllers improve in a Chinese context? Study material and methods The study material consists of academic journals regarding controller's role and literature of management accounting change. The empirical data was conducted in the targeted company and eight interviews were made. To get comprehensive understanding of the controller's role, the scope of the interviews included <b>business</b> unit <b>controllers,</b> CFO, unit-level managers, and financial team member. Findings The empirical findings left us the impression that the <b>business</b> <b>controllers</b> with Chinese background in the case company are considered as "business partners" by their co-workers and themselves. Working in the <b>business</b> unit, <b>controllers</b> seldom do financial accounting job and more business sense is required for being a qualified controller. They are often involved into management issues if BU heads need advice or if their business units undertake projects. However, they are very clear about their limited influence, as every person in the company has specific responsibilities and those formal rules restrict them to reach out of their territory. In addition to some objective factors such as culture, organizational structure and management accounting change may have effects on the working ways of controllers; individual factors are significant in this case and controllers expect themselves to have more development in the future...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{why some}} <b>business</b> unit <b>controllers</b> {{are more likely}} to {{deliberately}} bias accounting data than others.

Instead, our analysis shows the importance of personality differences. We present the results from an experiment among 136 management accountants, who assumed the role of <b>business</b> unit <b>controller.</b> The results suggest that the personality construct Machiavellianism interacts with involvement to explain controllers' responses to social pressure to bias accounting data. Controllers scoring high on Machiavellianism were more likely to give in to pressure by business unit management to slack budgetary targets when they had been involved in strategic and operational decision making. Controllers scoring low on Machiavellianism instead became less susceptible to pressure when they had been actively involved in management...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the {{position}} of the <b>business</b> unit <b>controller</b> has grown in importance. This study gives a review of the research behind the two roles, which business unit-controllers can fulfill in business life: the support role and the control role. The support role is associated with involvedness of controllers by supporting managerial decision-making in the business unit; the control role focuses on providing reliable and timely financial accounting information for the corporate level and insuring that the financial function complies with relevant regulations. This paper contributes to the Management Accounting literature by documenting the available literature regarding the roles of controllers and by developing a theoretical framework to study the controller involvement in management. Based upon this framework twelve propositions and a regression model are presented, which can be used in future studies to test empirically which factors influence the controller involvement in management.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of {{spreadsheets}} in budgeting in order to explain how and why spreadsheets are used or not used in budgeting practice. Guided by modern budgeting research, budgeting is considered as a social phenomenon which requires flexibility for decision-making and integration for management control. Twenty-one interviews with <b>business</b> <b>controllers</b> in eleven leading for-profit organisations in Thailand were conducted for this study. The analysis at the activity level, led by the concept of ‘conflict’ in structuration theory (ST), reveals that spreadsheets allow a full flexibility over decision-making activities in budgeting. However, spreadsheets are not appropriate for integration in management control as there are many problems and errors associated with {{the use of}} spreadsheets. The analysis at the structural level, directed by the concept of ‘contradiction’ in ST, concludes that the weak characteristics of spreadsheets for integration are contradictory to the budgeting process which fulfils the dual roles of flexibility and integration. This study concludes that use of spreadsheets in budgeting is significant despite the availability of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and business intelligence (BI). This study explains that spreadsheets are heavily used because of (1) the lack of integration between financial and management accounting functions and (2) the fit for spreadsheets to support the flexibility in decision-making. This paper offers two contributions. First, it shows an over-reliance on spreadsheets for management accounting practice. Second, it informs academia and practitioners of the need to reduce their reliance on spreadsheets for management control functions because there are many drawbacks associated with it...|$|R

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} This {{qualitative}} commissioned case study aims {{to develop a new}} budgeting system for headcount and personnel costs in a Finnish subsidiary of a multinational pharmaceutical organization. Furthermore, this study examines the role uncertainty might play in the budgeting process. The objective {{of the study}} is to define how a new budgeting system should be designed for the case company’s needs. As there is little conclusive evidence about the form which budgets should take in organizations, a detailed case study might help to partly fill this research gap. Data and methodology The study method to be used is a qualitative constructive case study. The empirical data consists of nine interviews with relevant stakeholders and benchmarks within the pharmaceutical organization, as well as internal and external company documents and several informal discussions with some of the stakeholders. The interviewed persons were Human Resources Director, Finance Director, and Head of Controlling within the Finnish subsidiary, and two <b>Business</b> <b>Controllers</b> from other European subsidiaries of the company. Main findings The study found that through driver-based planning, variance analysis, and attaching action plans to scenarios showed early positive results for control, learning, and discussing strategy. Answering the requirements from the headquarters was made more transparent through driver-based planning. This transparency facilitated variance analysis that was expected to enhance organizational learning. attaching personnel costs to products provided aids for decision making, increasing critical discussion about headcount decisions. Attaching personnel costs to products provided aids for decision making, increasing critical discussion about headcount decisions. Combining initiatives to scenario analyses facilitated debate and communication about reactions to possible scenarios. The results indicated that budget can serve various uses within an organization, depending on the perceived (un) certainty. The different uses also allowed different levels of uncertainty to be formalized in the budget: when used for control, budget uncertainty was informal knowledge, while when used for discussion, the flexibility of the budget was formalized. Thus, budget uses should not be examined as an either-or-question, but as co-existing within organizations...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the potentially versatile use of the net present value (NPV) investment calculation in the context of pharmaceutical new product development (NPD) process. The objective of the study is to illustrate how the NPV can be used managerially in alternate ways to complement the most commonly presented view in the literature. As little earlier evidence on the how question on management accounting techniques in the context of NPD can be found, the respective gap in the literature is partly filled with a detailed look on the selected problem. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The study method to be used is a qualitative in-depth case study. The empirical data used in the study consists of 27 semi-structured interviews with selected managers in a European pharmaceutical company, as well as other company related public or internal material. The interviewed managers held a variety of positions within the company, including Senior Vice President of R&D, CFO, <b>Business</b> <b>Controllers,</b> Vice Presidents of Business Units, and other Directors. The data was gathered between June of 2013 and September 2014. MAIN FINDINGS: Findings on the study indicate a more versatile use of NPV during pharmaceutical NPD in several dimensions. The high uncertainties of pharmaceutical NPD set several implications on the uses of NPV in the process. First, as the NPV is prepared several times during the process due to product or process related requirements, its significance in terms of decision-making can be seen to increase gradually until conducting the most expensive trials, decreasing afterwards with a focus shift from profitability towards modelling revenue streams. Second, while most NPD and capital budgeting literature promote the project selection function and the decision-making roles for NPV, this study evidence suggests a more versatile role for the calculation as a management tool. Additional benefits of NPV in NPD are extracted from its ability to facilitate communication across organizational boundaries, while also serving as a coordination and monitoring tool, and a mechanism to legitimate decisions...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a single-company case study {{commissioned}} by Gasum Oy. The two main businesses, on-grid and off-grid gas, are studied {{in order to}} find the fundamental differences in value creation and management control that ultimately lead to different performance management practices. The objective of this thesis is to develop target-oriented performance management practices for both businesses. The researcher was employed by Gasum Oy during the writing of this thesis. Analysis is based on semi-structured interviews of the key personnel, a workshop and personal observations about the everyday business and management practices in the company. In addition, the researcher was allowed to participate in a management reporting development project to gain more insight into the current performance management practices. The analysis is structured as follows. First, the business environment and current performance management practices are studied. Second, the businesses and their value chains are examined to determine the relevant key performance indicators (KPIs). Third, the businesses and their KPIs are compared. Finally, suggestions for overall improvement of performance management practices are provided. On-grid gas business is mature business and its overall strategic theme is, thereby, effectiveness. The suggested strategic level KPIs to be followed include cash flow (CF), EBITDA, take-or-pay limits and capital structure efficiency. These are cascaded down to tactical and operational level KPIs. The control, especially cost control, must be tight. Clear target levels must be set, and if they are exceeded, corrective actions must be taken. Cash flows generated from this business should not be used in expansion investments of the grid network as they are needed to finance both the day-to-day operations of the company and its new emerging businesses. Off-grid gas business is an emerging liquefied natural gas (LNG) business with high growth expectations. Thus, its overall strategic theme is growth. The suggested strategic level KPIs to be followed comprise sales margin, portfolio balance, inventory turnover and capital expense efficiency. These are also cascaded down to tactical and operational level KPIs. IN LNG business performance management and management control should support growth and not restrict the operations with tight controls. Agile organization and management as well as innovative mindset are needed in new business development. Encouraging examples in LNG business and changed mindsets could lead the way to a change in the organizational culture of the whole group. Suggestions for overall performance management practices involve improvements in modelling practices, such as, cash flow models, volume forecasts and LNG supply chain modelling. Other key issues are target setting and the linkage between strategy and operations. The <b>business</b> <b>controllers</b> should shift towards delivering analyses and strategy-related information.

In this study, we rely on prior literature and insights from field interviews to argue that such an increase also leads to role ambiguity and conflict, which in turn can lead to an increased tolerance of data misreporting. We test our predictions using survey responses of 134 BU controllers. As predicted, we find that the emphasis on the functional responsibility of BU controllers is positively associated with role conflict and role ambiguity, both of which are related to data misreporting at the BU level...|$|R
40|$|A human {{information}} and people-counting sensor using an integrated matrix array of thermopile infrared sensors with an appropriate optical system {{was developed and}} fabricated. It was designed {{for the detection of}} presence, number, and situation of human bodies in the field of view covered by the sensor. By testing this system in a laboratory with an area of 5 x 5 m, the number of occupants was determined with a high accuracy for up to four persons in the room. Moreover, the location of a person at a distance of 2 m can be determined with an accuracy of 25 cm. Therefore, this developed system can be used for security and <b>business</b> purposes, light <b>controllers,</b> energy saving, and air conditioning applications. Furthermore, this system is also important for taking care and watching old, sick, and disabled people by giving the a kind of independence in their houses...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} Windows {{application}} capable of working with multiple web-based applications provided by Tasys for motor vehicle dealers. The application required the development of several sub systems which included; user management, customer management, inventory management, sales management vehicle finance tracking, and customer finance tracking while incorporating mechanisms for transferring data securely and advanced error handling. An agile methodology was use to develop the system. The application was developed using a multilayer architecture where local database queries pass through three separate layers: <b>Controller,</b> <b>Business</b> Logic, and Data Access. This method provided a scalable and reusable development environment. The application has assisted in the administration, trading, and financial transactions related to motor vehicle sales. The system can communicate with web-based systems to provide up to date information on all vehicles.

40|$|Self-adaptive {{software}} is widely-use for users {{who need to}} output varies results after responding from changing environment. The results are normally followed by the Control Theory {{in order to be}} constructed in a rigid feedback loop. According to the Control Theory, the controller is designed to measure result errors for the purpose of re-inputs of edited results into the system. The research in the paper proposes an approach to improving the context-aware ability of controller by designing a controller that enhance the self-adaptive software to solve both certain and uncertain problems especially in <b>business.</b> The <b>controller</b> relies on both Control Theory based modules and combination based module, in order to generate outputs including but not limited to activities based on costs or balanced scorecards through adding business context sensors, and create feedback loop to test differences for each module. When the proposed controller is established in self-adaptive software, it is important to extract and filter business information due to user demands, and make software to react itself in a changing environment. In summary, a designed controller model will help self-adaptive software to understand users' need and requirements clearly, so that not only existing parameters could be changed, but also the self-adaptive software can be made to to gain the ability to modify the parameter itself, and more importantly, a good context-aware controlled self-adaptive software could save costs for organisations in addition to improving the effectiveness and efficiency for business in a creative way...|$|R
