50|$|RFA Sir Galahad {{was built}} by Swan Hunter and entered service in 1988. She was named and given the {{identical}} pennant number to the Sir Galahad sunk in the Falklands War. Built as a combined landing craft and ferry with two flight decks for helicopters and <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>doors,</b> there was capacity for around 400 troops and 3,440 tonnes of supplies.|$|E
50|$|The ships {{had both}} <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> leading onto the main vehicle deck, making them roll-on/roll-off, {{combined}} with ramps {{that led to}} upper and lower vehicle decks. Thanks to their shallow draught, they could beach themselves and use the bow doors for speedy unloading of troops and equipment. The ships also had helicopter decks on both the upper vehicle deck and behind the superstructure.|$|E
50|$|In June 1942, Shōkaku had her {{anti-aircraft}} armament augmented {{with six}} triple 25 mm mounts, two each at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern,</b> <b>and</b> one each {{fore and aft}} of the island. The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> groups each received a Type 95 director. In October another triple 25 mm mount was added at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> 10 single mounts were added before the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} ferry, former Caledonian MacBrayne vessel MV Iona, {{was purchased}} in October 1997 and renamed Pentalina-B. The first drive-through MacBrayne ferry with both <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>doors,</b> she carried around 50 cars, or 4-5 articulated lorries and fewer cars. During the off-seasons since 2006, she was chartered out, carrying livestock across the channel from Dover and providing freight relief for CalMac. She {{was sold to}} an owner in Cape Verde in late 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The Ropucha (toad), or Project 775 class landing {{ships are}} {{classified}} in the Russian Navy as [...] "large landing craft" [...] (Bol'shoy Desantnyy Korabl). They were built in Poland in the Stocznia Północna shipyards, in Gdańsk. They are designed for beach landings and can carry a 450-ton cargo. The ships have both <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> for loading and unloading vehicles, and the 630 m² of vehicle deck stretches {{the length of the}} hull. Up to 25 armored personnel carriers can be embarked.|$|E
5000|$|MS Nindawayma’s {{decommissioning}} from Canadian service {{after four}} years of use {{is said to have been}} due to [...] "unsatisfactory performance". There was a distinct smell of diesel fuel at deck level, possibly due to her low-set twin funnels. (Photos of her in Canadian service show that the funnel-top smoke deflectors had been removed.) Her French Pielstick diesel engines were apparently troublesome, and sailings were canceled due to mechanical problems. Her <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>doors</b> were claimed to not be high enough to accommodate semi-trailer trucks despite this not being a problem in Manx or Spanish service. These factors caused significant numbers of ferry passengers to avoid the MS Nindawayma in favour of the MS Chi-Cheemaun, even if waiting involved very long delays at the ferry terminals in Tobermory and South Baymouth.|$|E
50|$|The main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} six 120 mm Canet guns in shielded mountings, one each at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> four in sponsons. Anti-torpedo boat armament consisted of eight 47 mm guns, {{four in the}} <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> casemates <b>and</b> four in midship sponsons. Five torpedo tubes with 11 torpedoes were placed one on the <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> two on each side, all above water.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> ramps allowed drive-through operation, {{although}} initially {{she only}} used the stern ramp.|$|R
50|$|The {{next phase}} {{is to build}} up the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern.</b> Tapering cones of reeds are wedged {{together}} until a high <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> double <b>stern</b> are formed. The double stern adds more stability and carrying capacity to the ship while at sea.|$|R

50|$|The actual sheerline of Fuzhou junks {{is not so}} extreme. Much of the {{confusion}} {{with respect to the}} Keying may come from reported <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> heights above the waterline that may have been for the tops of wings and poop, not of the weather deck at <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern.</b> The exaggerated measurements in most contemporary reports suggest it was the former, not the latter.|$|R
500|$|In June 1942, Shōkaku and Zuikaku {{had their}} {{anti-aircraft}} armament augmented with six more triple 25mm mounts, two each at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern,</b> <b>and</b> one each {{fore and aft}} of the island. The <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> groups each received a Type 95 director. In October another triple 25mm mount was added at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> 10 single mounts were added before the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944. After the battle, Zuikakus anti-aircraft armament was reinforced with 26 single mounts for the 25mm Type 96 gun, bringing the total of 25mm barrels to 96, 60 in 20 triple mounts and 36 single mounts. These guns were supplemented by eight 28-round AA rocket launchers. Each [...] rocket weighed [...] and had a maximum velocity of [...] Their maximum range was [...]|$|R

50|$|Pictures {{released}} by Brittany Ferries show the ship will have double deck vehicle access at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> to decks 3 and 5 though while on her usual route loading of deck 5 will be via an internal ramp {{due to lack}} of double deck facilities at Plymouth or Roscoff. The <b>stern</b> <b>door</b> will be narrower than the one fitted to the Cotentin.|$|R

5000|$|Whalebacks {{were the}} {{precursors}} of the turret deck ship {{of the late}} 19th and early 20th century, which like the whaleback had rounded hulls, but unlike the whaleback had conventional <b>bows</b> <b>and</b> <b>sterns</b> <b>and</b> a superstructure.|$|R

50|$|A salient {{property}} of water waves is dispersiveness; i.e., {{the longer the}} wave, the faster it moves. Waves generated by a ship are affected by her geometry and speed, {{and most of the}} energy given by the ship for making waves is transferred to water through the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> parts. Simply speaking, these two wave systems, i.e., <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> waves, interact with each other, and the resulting waves are responsible for the resistance.|$|R

5000|$|Dingyuan-class - This {{class of}} two ironclads had a {{secondary}} armament of one 15 cm SK L/35 at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern.</b>|$|R
50|$|The hulls {{are made}} of Fiberglass or FRP, heavily {{reinforced}} by numerous bulkheads, <b>and</b> usually have <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> enclosed flotation compartments.|$|R
50|$|A jumping wire is a {{wire cable}} {{stretched}} between the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> of a submarine, via the conning tower or periscope standards.|$|R
5000|$|Police Barges have rowers {{dressed in}} black and have a {{relatively}} flat <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern,</b> with the stern raised slightly higher than the bow.|$|R
50|$|The hull {{of these}} symmetrically-designed boats was almost {{level with the}} surface of the water at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern.</b> This design reduced the power needed to lift the tow chain onto the bow of the boat and also reduced the draught at the bow. The greater height of the boat in the centre made it easier to {{accommodate}} the steam engine. This deck shape - low at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern,</b> <b>and</b> higher in the centre - is typical of all subsequently built chain boats.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ships are}} fitted with <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> {{thrusters}} <b>and</b> perfectly operational anchors. They behave like real ships {{from this point}} of view as well.|$|R

5000|$|Boyarin - The primary {{armament}} of {{this ship}} consisted of six, shielded, 120/45 guns, in single mounts. One each at the <b>bow</b> <b>and</b> <b>stern</b> <b>and</b> four in sponsons amidships.|$|R
