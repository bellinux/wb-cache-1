Waseda University professor Norihiro Kato stated that Kimigayo is a separate issue {{more complex than the}} Hinomaru flag.

Three of these members had been made Council members the day <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> (South Africa, Bolivia, and Egypt).

5|$|Virginia voters {{approved}} a government-run lottery in 1987. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote,</b> supporters of a lottery suggested {{a number of}} possible ways in which lottery profits could be designated in Virginia, such as education, transportation and Chesapeake Bay cleanup. However, the referendum made no designation of how lottery profits would be spent. Sales began September 20, 1988. In 1989, the General Assembly directed Lottery proceeds to capital construction projects. From 1990 to 1998, the proceeds went to Virginia's General Fund. Starting in 1999, a provision in Virginia's budget called for all proceeds to be assigned exclusively to education. In November 2000, Virginia {{voters approved}} the creation of the State Lottery Proceeds Fund by an 83.5-point margin. The measure, which is a permanent part of Virginia's Constitution, directs the General Assembly to use all Lottery profits for educational purposes. The Lottery does not control how its profits are spent.|$|E
