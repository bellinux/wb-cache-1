50|$|A tala {{does not}} have a fixed tempo (laya) and can be played at {{different}} speeds. In Hindustani classical music a typical recital of a raga falls into two or three parts categorized by the quickening tempo of the music; Vilambit (delayed, i.e., slow), Madhya (medium tempo) and Drut (fast). Carnatic music adds an extra slow and fast category, categorised by divisions of the pulse; Chauka (1 stroke <b>per</b> <b>beat),</b> Vilamba (2 strokes <b>per</b> <b>beat),</b> Madhyama (4 strokes <b>per</b> <b>beat),</b> Dhuridha (8 strokes <b>per</b> <b>beat)</b> and lastly Adi-dhuridha (16 strokes <b>per</b> <b>beat).</b>|$|R

40|$|Background—Although type B aortic {{dissection}} {{has been}} treated with blockers to lower the arterial blood pressure (BP), {{there has been little}} evidences about reduction in heart rate (HR). We assessed whether tight HR control improved the outcome of medical treatment in patients with aortic dissection. Methods and Results—From 1997 to 2005, 171 patients with acute aortic dissection medically treated and controlled to lower BP under 120 mm Hg were enrolled. Based on the average HR at 3, 5, and 7 days after the onset, patients were divided into tight HR (60 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> minute) control group (32 patients; mean HR of 56. 63. 1 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> minute) and conventional HR (60 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> minute) control group (139 patients; mean HR of 71. 78. 2 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> minute). We compared the frequency of aortic events including late organ or limb ischemia, aortic rupture, recurrent dissection, and aortic expansion of 5 mm, and surgical requirement between two groups. During a median follow-up of 27. 0 months, late organ or limb ischemia, aortic rupture, recurrent dissection, pathological aortic expansion, and aortic surgery occurred in 0, 8, 14, 39, and 26 patients, respectively. Reduction in aortic events was observed in tight HR control group (12. 5 %) compared to conventional HR control group (36. 0 %), (Odds ratio: 0. 25, C. I. : 0. 08 to 0. 77, P 0. 01). Conclusions—The present study demonstrated that tight heart rate control improved the outcome of medical treatment in patients with aortic dissection. (Circulation. 2008; 118 [suppl 1]:S 167 –S 170.)

50|$|Rate {{pressure}} {{product is}} a measure of the stress put on the cardiac muscle based on the number of times it needs to <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> minute (HR) and the arterial blood pressure that it is pumping against (SBP).

50|$|The dance {{follows a}} pattern of three quick steps in place, one <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> step, and on the fourth beat there is a raising of the knee.

5|$|The song is {{associated}} with dance-rock with a slight country twang. Electric guitars and synths are also used. Near the start, the song begins to make a beat of paparazzi's flashbulbs. It is set in common time with a moderated tempo of 120 <b>beats</b> <b>per</b> minute. The song is written in the key of A minor. Cyrus' vocals span two octaves, from A3 to C5. The song has the following chord progression, A5C5D5.|$|E
5|$|While diving, {{the emperor}} penguin's oxygen use is {{markedly}} reduced, as its heart rate {{is reduced to}} as low as 15–20 <b>beats</b> <b>per</b> minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. Its haemoglobin and myoglobin are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in loss of consciousness.|$|E
40|$|Goal: A {{new method}} for heart rate {{monitoring}} using photoplethysmography (PPG) during physical activities is proposed. Methods: It jointly estimates spectra of PPG signals and simultaneous acceleration signals, utilizing the multiple measurement vector model in sparse signal recovery. Due {{to a common}} sparsity constraint on spectral coefficients, the method can easily identify and remove spectral peaks of motion artifact (MA) in PPG spectra. Thus, it does not need any extra signal processing modular to remove MA as in some other algorithms. Furthermore, seeking spectral peaks associated with heart rate is simplified. Results: Experimental results on 12 PPG datasets sampled at 25 Hz and recorded during subjects' fast running showed that it had high performance. The average absolute estimation error was 1. 28 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> minute and the standard deviation was 2. 61 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> minute. Conclusion and Significance: These {{results show that the}} method has great potential to be used for PPG-based heart rate monitoring in wearable devices for fitness tracking and health monitoring.

5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 <b>beats</b> <b>per</b> minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two <b>beats</b> <b>per</b> bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{explained}} that he instantly liked the song, but listened to it twice before making his final decision. Although the song was written by Kelly, Jackson was adamant that the production should be a collaborative effort amongst the two musicians. The tape sent to him had no harmony or modulations, so Jackson added a choir in the final portion and added a sense of climax and structure to the final piece. The song has a tempo of 60 <b>beats</b> <b>per</b> minute, {{making it one of}} Jackson's slowest songs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{tempo of}} the piece is the speed or {{frequency}} of the tactus, {{a measure of how}} quickly the beat flows. This is often measured in 'beats per minute' (bpm): 60 bpm means a speed of one <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> second, a frequency of 1 Hz. A rhythmic unit is a durational pattern that has a period equivalent to a pulse or several pulses [...] The duration of any such unit is inversely related to its tempo.|$|R
