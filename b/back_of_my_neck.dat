Approximately two years later, when she left school, Bates moved in with Smith {{at his home in}} Furnival Road, Gorton. She had concealed the relationship from her parents. Bates' mother said of her first meeting with Smith after the two began living together: [...] "As soon as I saw Smith the hairs on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> went up. I tried everything I could to get Kelly Anne away from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|During May 2002 Wilson {{recorded}} his next album, King for a Day (July 2002), at two studios in Melbourne with Kerryn Tolhurst producing. Along with Bourne, Folley and Rodgers, the album featured Tollhurst (guest guitars, piano, mandolin and tipple), Cindy Boste (guest lead vocals), Sarah Carroll (guest lead vocals) and Skip Sail (guest banjo). In March 2003 Richard Sharman of I-94 Bar website reviewed Chris Wilson and The Spidermen's gig at the Bridge Hotel in Sydney, {{and found that}} Wilson's [...] "voice was magnificent ranging from soft tenderness to a bellowing roar that raised shivers at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> His voice sounded better than ever and his harp playing was superb – this boy can play!" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{so pleased}} me that I {{did not try}} to resist, but allowed this simple-hearted {{stranger}} to throw his arms about me and weep a few tranquilizing tears down the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> Then he went his way.|$|E
6000|$|On the 8th I had {{followed}} the Army of the Potomac in rear of Lee. I was suffering very severely with a sick headache, and stopped at a farmhouse on the road some distance in rear of {{the main body of}} the army. I spent the night in bathing my feet in hot water and mustard, and putting mustard plasters on my wrists and the <b>back</b> part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> hoping to be cured by morning. During the night I received Lee's answer to <b>my</b> letter <b>of</b> the 8th, inviting an interview between the lines on the following morning. (*43) But it was for a different purpose from that of surrendering his army, and I answered him as follows: ...|$|R

A mother, son and {{daughter}} live there, too, more ink on their six fat arms than the bumper Sunday paper. I don 2 ̆ 7 t want to think about what they might have put over the rest of themselves. No, I 2 ̆ 7 m not judging people by their cover. I got a tattoo, my very own constellation of stars. The most stars that could fit onto the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> little <b>neck.</b> I always was skinny. Bones like a fish, some men said. Bones, my first husband said, that he could pick from between his teeth. I never did feel there was enough of me, especially not after all he took out of me...|$|R
40|$|A USA Air Force Master Sergeant {{suffered}} severe {{hair loss}} from the scalp and face {{a few weeks}} after receipt of his fifth dose of anthrax vaccine. He also suffered from a reduction in his eyesight, insomnia, headaches, involuntary twitches of the right arm muscle, and memory loss. In addition, he felt chronically tired, had hot and cold flashes on his head, and cold flashes on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> his <b>neck.</b> <b>My</b> investigation <b>of</b> this case revealed that hair loss and serious systemic illness have also been reported by some other individuals who received anthrax vaccine and other vaccines. Differential diagnosis was used to evaluate the medical evidence in this case to identify the causes of illness and hair loss. Treatment with zinc gluconate at a dose level of 60 mg zinc per day for a few months subsequently led to the complete reversal of hair loss in this case. It is plausible that vaccines induced a stage of zinc deficiency by activating the immune system and increased the utilization of zinc. Zinc is an essential element required for hair metabolism and the activation of the immune system...|$|R

60|$|When I {{tell you}} that just as I heard these frightful words a fairly {{substantial}} beetle of sorts dropped from the bush down the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and I couldn't even stir to squash the same, you will understand that I felt pretty rotten.

60|$|While {{the ship}} was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke up as having seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment, {{starting}} up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. He would say nothing else--repeating his cry impatiently, back water! black water! The men put back as speedily as possible, but {{by this time the}} ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions to take in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and beating violently against it with every movement of the hull. After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board--for the body proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green baize jacket I had on, and through the <b>back</b> part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right ear. I was immediately put to bed--although life seemed to be totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain, however, treated me with every attention--to make amends, I presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure.|$|R
6000|$|Instead of answering, {{he gently}} lifted a long lock <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hair, which hung {{at the side}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> (<b>My</b> head, I should add, had been dressed that evening on the old-fashioned plan, by my aunt's maid--to please my aunt.) ...|$|R

60|$|I have a {{plan for}} my own bedroom. I spend long hours in bed, reading, studying, and working. I have tried {{sleeping}} in the open, but the lamp attracts all the creeping, crawling, butting, flying, fluttering things to the pages of my book, into my ears and blankets, and down the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> So my bedroom shall be indoors.|$|E
6000|$|Leland laughed, {{though his}} eyes were half closed. [...] "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "I'll be round again to-morrow all right.

60|$|About ten o'clock, {{as far as}} I could judge, {{when the}} Moon had just risen above {{the lip of the}} crater, Gunga Dass made a move for his burrow to bring out the gun-barrels whereby to measure our path. All the other wretched {{inhabitants}} had retired to their lairs long ago. The guardian boat drifted down-stream some hours before, and we were utterly alone by the crow-clump. Gunga Dass, while carrying the gun-barrels, let slip the piece of paper which was to be our guide. I stooped down hastily to recover it, and, as I did so, I was aware that the diabolical Brahmin was aiming a violent blow at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head with the gun-barrels. It was too late to turn round. I must have received the blow somewhere on the nape <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> A hundred thousand fiery stars danced before my eyes, and I fell forward senseless {{at the edge of the}} quicksand.|$|R

60|$|I felt {{as though}} {{somebody}} was pouring funk out of a can down the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> My legs became feeble. I had got the first intimation of what the disaster meant for me. There was that confounded boy--sky high! I was utterly left. There was the gold in the coffee-room--my only possession on earth. How would it all work out? The general effect was of a gigantic unmanageable confusion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can we not? I shall {{show you}} that!' and {{there came a}} jerk on the bridle which nearly pulled me to the ground. At the same instant a sword flashed and the leather was cut through within two inches <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{rather have}} broken my arm, or {{anything}} short <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> than {{that she should}} have broken that flower. Arthur planted it, and now the clumsy girl has destroyed it," [...] and Mildred looked as though she were going to cry.|$|R
6000|$|... "'How'd that Buck Caperton get in here?' and he skinned {{the side}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> with a bullet.

60|$|He {{turned the}} handle as he spoke, {{but the door}} did not yield. We threw {{ourselves}} against it. With a crash it burst open, and we almost fell headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and my heart seemed to stand still.|$|E
60|$|One moment I had {{sat with}} my mind filled with sublime resolutions, the next I was {{flattened}} out upon {{the bottom of}} the boat, the breath dashed out of my body, and this monster pinning me down. I felt the fierce pants of his hot breath upon the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> In an instant he had torn away my sword, had slipped a sack over my head, and had tied a rope firmly round the outside of it.|$|E

60|$|There were times, too, {{when faced}} by a mighty cave bear, a saber-toothed tiger, or huge felis spelaea, black-maned and terrible, even my {{powerful}} rifle seemed pitifully inadequate--but fortune favored {{me so that}} I passed unscathed through adventures that even the recollection of causes the short hairs to bristle at the nape <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R
60|$|I parried that thrust, but I only parried {{it when it}} {{was within}} some three inches <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> and even as I turned it aside it missed me as {{narrowly}} as it might without tearing my skin. The imminence of the peril had been such that, as we mutually recovered, I found a cold sweat bathing me.|$|R
60|$|But {{those words}} of his put {{something}} new into my head. Could we not decide the matter in some better way than fighting? The Bart was placing me in such a position that I should have to hurt him, or he would certainly hurt me.

6000|$|We {{believe that}} the Reverend George H. Nobbs is still alive. At all events he was so last year, (1879), having written a letter in June to the Secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, in which, among other things, he speaks of the [...] "rapidly {{increasing}} community, now numbering 370 persons." [...] He adds--"I am becoming very feeble from age, and my memory fails me in consequence of an operation at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> for carbuncle two years since;" [...] {{and goes on to}} tell of the flourishing condition of his flock.|$|E
60|$|The street rang {{with the}} cheer that followed, and when Dixon seized his hat {{the action was}} infectious. The next minute we were moving forward amid {{the ranks of the}} {{enthusiastic}} crowd behind the vehicle, which jolted slowly towards the station; and I discovered later that the uncomfortable sensation at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck</b> was caused by the hot oil from a torch, which dripped upon it. In the meantime I noticed nothing but the sea of faces, the tramp of feet, and the final burst of cheering at the station, in which Mackay, holding aloft his forage cap, joined vociferously.|$|E
6000|$|... "For me, a kiss. Imagine six {{little girls}} sitting before their easels twenty years ago, {{down by the}} side of a lake, {{painting}} the water-lilies, the first red water-lilies I'd ever seen. And suddenly a kiss, there on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> And my hand shook all the afternoon so that I couldn't paint. I took out my watch and marked the hour when I would allow myself to think of the kiss for five minutes only--it was so precious--the kiss of an old grey-haired woman with a wart on her nose, the mother of all my kisses all my life. Come, Caroline, come, Hubert." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gilgun {{went on to}} {{describe}} more specifically the usage of such practical prosthetics, remarking, [...] "They've took a mold <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> You could imagine the silicone looking wrap around <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> Built in there is a squib, which is basically a tube that runs down my top so that this piece of glass that's wedged in there they can just put some pressure on his blood pack and it pumps blood out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck.</b> It looks incredible." [...] Make-up artist Mike Smithson of KNB EFX was also interviewed for the [...] "Making Of Preacher: Monster Swamp" [...] segment, with him noting, [...] "This is the spot where he's taken the shrapnel pointing to Gilgun's neck, and underneath is a little reservoir for some thin blood. Then we hook this up to our pressure spot ..." [...] Ruth Negga spoke of her combat preparation for the scene with Cassidy, wherein she states, [...] "I've been training with John Koyama, who's our stunt master, and he's been teaching me {{how to use a}} baton lethally. I'm using actually a rubber prop ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`Then do it!' and seizing {{me by my}} {{trousers}} and the nape <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck,</b> he tossed me over the side into the sea.

5000|$|Shortly {{before his}} head {{was placed on the}} guillotine, Kürten turned to the {{psychiatrist}} and asked the question: [...] "Tell me... after my head is chopped off, will I still be able to hear, at least for a moment, the sound <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own blood gushing from the stump <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>neck?</b> That would be the pleasure to end all pleasures." [...] When asked whether he had any last words to say, Kürten simply smiled and replied, [...] "No." ...|$|R
