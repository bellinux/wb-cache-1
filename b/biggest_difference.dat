5|$|Marisa Chase appears only in Uncharted: Golden Abyss. She is the {{granddaughter of}} an {{archeologist}} Vincent Perez. She carries a golden amulet, {{which was very}} important to her grandfather. She lived her youth with her grand father because her parents were shot when she was very young. She, just like Nate, got her climbing, knowledge of ancient artifacts and treasure hunting skills at age of 15. She has a problem trusting people who she doesn't know. When she calls someone her partner, that means that she trusts them. Her <b>biggest</b> <b>difference</b> to Elena is that she never uses a gun, even when she is getting shot at. She survived an RPG shot from Roberto Guerro during the events of the game. She finally decides to use a gun {{near the end of the}} game. She is voiced by Christine Lakin.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{received}} significant financial {{rewards for}} reaching the Champions League final. However, despite losing the match, it was Manchester United who earned {{the most money}} from their 2008–09 Champions League campaign, receiving €38.281million compared to Barcelona's €30.968million. All 32 teams in the group stage of the competition received €3million for {{taking part in the}} competition and €2.4million for their participation in the group stage matches, as well as further bonuses based on their performances in each match (€600,000 for each win and €300,000 for each draw). For their four wins and one draw, Barcelona received a performance bonus of €2.7million, while Manchester United earned €2.4million for their two wins and four draws. Both teams then also received a total of €7.7million for their participation in the rounds leading up to the final; however, Barcelona received a win bonus of €7million for winning the final, while Manchester United received €4million for finishing as runners-up. The <b>biggest</b> <b>difference</b> between the teams' financial rewards came {{as a result of their}} share of the market pool, based on the value of the television market in their home countries. As the most successful of the English teams in the competition, Manchester United received the greatest share (€18.781million) of approximately €55.5million reserved for the English teams. However, although Barcelona were the most successful of the Spanish teams in the competition, they had finished in third place in La Liga the previous season, and so received the second-smallest share of the €33.8million given to the four Spanish clubs, taking home €8.168million.|$|E

25|$|Waveguides {{are similar}} to coaxial cables, as both consist of tubes, with the <b>biggest</b> <b>difference</b> being that the {{waveguide}} has no inner conductor. Waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section, but rectangular cross sections are the most common. Because waveguides {{do not have an}} inner conductor to carry a return current, waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an electric current, but rather by means of a guided electromagnetic field. Although surface currents do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides, those surface currents do not carry power. Power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields. The surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the waveguide and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the waveguide. Waveguides have dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the alternating current to be transmitted, so they are only feasible at microwave frequencies. In addition to this mechanical feasibility, electrical resistance of the non-ideal metals forming the walls of the waveguide cause dissipation of power (surface currents flowing on lossy conductors dissipate power). At higher frequencies, the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large.|$|E
25|$|The first singles {{semifinal}} match saw white group no. 1 Petra Kvitová and red group no. 2 Samantha Stosur. Kvitová was {{the only}} player {{to make it through}} the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5–1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwańska in straights. And although she was up an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7–5, 1–0 lead, with a break point to go up 7–5, 2–0. Just like she did before, though, Kvitová came alive when she needed to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6–3, then racing ahead 5–0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5–3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5–7, 6–3, 6–3. Both Kvitová and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitová 38–39, Stosur 16–18) but the <b>biggest</b> <b>difference</b> came in creating break point opportunities – Kvitová brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only got six break points (converting on three).|$|E

500|$|The <b>biggest</b> <b>difference</b> {{from the}} earlier Sinyavino Offensive was the {{location}} of the main attack. In September 1942 the Soviet forces were attacking south of the town of Siniavino, which allowed them to potentially encircle several German divisions, but also left the army open to flanking attacks from the north, and it was this which ultimately caused the offensive to fail. In January 1943 the offensive was conducted north of Siniavino, closer to the Ladoga Lake shore, which removed the threat of flanking attacks and increased the probability of success, but forced the Soviets to abandon the idea of encircling most of the German forces in the [...] "bottleneck".|$|E
500|$|Once {{the game}} is completed, a new game plus mode is {{available}} called [...] "EX game".

The items, weapons, power-ups and enemies are more powerful, as are the enemies the player encounters. However, the <b>biggest</b> <b>difference</b> from the normal game is the addition of the Chrysler Building, a brand new location with 77 floors (containing mostly randomized content), leading to a final boss battle with Aya's older sister, Maya.|$|E

500|$|In late 1992 it was {{announced}} that because of the success of The Who's Tommy, it would be produced for Broadway and open in April 1993. The production cost eight million dollars and it broke the box office record for the biggest non-opening day with US$494,897 earned on April 23, 1993 at St. James Theatre (where the musical opened on April 22), [...] beating Guys and Dolls 1992 record. Des McAnuff, who directed the musical at both La Jolla Playhouse and on Broadway, decided to bring many actors from the original cast with him despite weeks of auditions with thousands of actors trying out for the roles in front of him. The Broadway production featured some changes to the musical, such as a new song devoted to Tommy's parents that Gaven thought [...] "helps show their side of the story." [...] However, as she told The San Diego Union-Tribune, the <b>biggest</b> <b>difference</b> was the increased amount of money she earned.

500|$|In September 2012, Tomlinson {{signed a}} four-month {{contract}} with Burton Albion, having previously been on trial at Preston North End. He joined the [...] "Brewers" [...] after manager Gary Rowett was {{dissatisfied with the}} performances of Ross Atkins and Dean Lyness. After keeping a clean sheet on his debut, in a 1–0 win over Rochdale at Spotland on 8 September, assistant manager Kevin Summerfield said that [...] "the <b>biggest</b> <b>difference</b> for me {{was that we were}} playing the game in their half and they were defending corners because he [...] can kick the ball so far up the pitch". He was aiming for a longer stay at the Pirelli Stadium, but a knee injury sustained in a home draw with former club Port Vale left him sidelined for up to six months. He recovered to full fitness in half that time, and signed a new contract in February to extend his stay at Burton until summer 2014. Burton reached the play-offs {{at the end of the}} 2012–13 season, but were defeated 5–4 by Bradford City at the semi-final stage. Tomlinson retired in July 2013 after surgeons advised him that scar tissue damage and a tear in his anterior cruciate ligament meant that his left knee was in poor shape and was vulnerable to further damage.|$|E
500|$|On May 28, 2003, {{the first}} {{performance}} of Wicked {{was held at}} the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, as the start of SHN pre-Broadway tryouts. After officially opening on June 10, 2003, it ran there for the month and finished on June 29, 2003. Audience reaction was mostly positive and although critics tended to compliment the aesthetic and spectacle of the show, they disparaged the state of its book, score, and choreography. Dennis Harvey of Variety commented positively of the [...] "sleekly directed", [...] "snazzily designed" [...] and [...] "smartly cast" [...] production yet still disapproved of its [...] "mediocre" [...] book, [...] "trite" [...] lyrics and [...] "largely generic" [...] music while Karen D'Souza of the San Jose Mercury News wrote that [...] "Style over substance is the real theme in this Emerald City."
