40|$|It is {{a comment}} on the current lack of trust in the U. S. voting system that {{scientists}} and scholars in disciplines ranging from astrophysics to statistics ask me if the Presidential election in 2004 was stolen in Ohio. After <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballots</b> (Wand, Shotts, Sekhon, Mebane, Herron, and Brady 2001) and punchcards (Mebane 2004) in 2000, I suppose as consternating as it may be, the question has become reasonable to ask. If we value the legitimacy of our elections, it is of great importance that questions raised about discrepancies between official vote counts and exit polls be carefully examined. Questions about Ohio are particularly important because the state was pivotal in 2004. The authors—Kyle, Samuelson, Scheuren, Vicinanza and Mitofsky (henceforth KSSVM) —are {{to be commended for}} continuing to try to put the questions to rest even though their critics have at times been hysterical. I agree with the authors that, unlike Florida in 2000, there is no scientific evidence that any of the reported irregularities in Ohio rose to the level of changing the outcome. 1 I also agree that given the grave and increasing difficulties with implementing exit polls, {{it is hardly surprising that}} exit polls are often erroneous. Given what we know, it appears to be the case that the official vote count for all of its difficulties was more reliable than the exi...|$|R
50|$|Ballot design can aid or inhibit {{clarity in}} an election. Poor designs lead to {{confusion}} and potentially chaos if {{large numbers of}} voters spoil or mismark a ballot. The <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot</b> used in the Palm Beach County, Florida U.S. presidential election, 2000 (a ballot paper that has names down both sides, with a single column of punch holes in the center, which has been likened to a maze) led to widespread allegations of mismarked ballots.|$|E
50|$|Deckard {{ultimately}} {{moved to}} Florida, {{where he became}} a computer technical specialist for Citibank in Tallahassee. A supporter of Pat Buchanan, he was the Reform Party's nominee for U.S. Senator in 2000. Deckard's 17,338 votes, only 0.30% of the total votes cast, {{became the subject of}} statistical analysis by critics of the <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot</b> in Palm Beach county. He died of an apparent heart attack on September 6, 2016 at a hospital in McKinney, Texas. He lived in Little Elm, Texas in his retirement.|$|E
50|$|Ballot papers {{may be used}} to {{discourage}} votes for a particular party or candidate, using design or other features which confuse voters into voting for a different candidate. For example, in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Florida's <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot</b> paper was criticized as poorly designed, leading some voters to vote for the wrong candidate. The ballot was designed by a Democrat; that party was assessed as the most harmed by voter errors because of this design. Poor or misleading design is not usually illegal and therefore not technically election fraud, but can subvert the principles of democracy.|$|E
40|$|Even {{before it}} came down to <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballots</b> and {{pregnant}} chads, the battle between George W. Bush and Al Gore had already raised some familiar questions about elections, and in particular, the way they are dealt with by the media (see Norris, 2001 a). Although scholars will always disagree {{on the extent to which}} the media actually influence the result of the contest, there are few who can resist bemoaning the so-called 'horse-race' style of campaign coverage pumped out by networks and newspapers, seemingly more interested in opinion polls than issues. With the result 'too close to call' going into the final days, things appeared to be little better this time around (Norris, 2001 b). Some would even say worse - especially those conservatives convinced that the major networks' exit poll predictions of a Gore win in Florida prior to the close of voting may have robbed Bush of votes that might have rendered the multiple recounts unnecessary. But however bad things got, few if any American commentators - in or out of the academic community- seriously suggested that political opinion polls should be done away with altogether for part or all of the campaign. This essential liberalism is by no means universal, however, even in advanced democracies - including many whose enlightened progressivism apparently obliges them to scold the Americans for their reactionary attitudes on a whole host of issues, most notably on the environment and on the death penalty. An attempt to identify cultural reasons for the variation between countries which restrict the reporting of pre-election and exit polls and those which do not would indeed be fascinating. But the aim of this brief report is rather more modest. It arose out of the surprising difficulty encountered by the author in putting together a submission on prevailing international practice to a Select Committee of the New Zealand Parliament regarding a clause seeking to ban opinion polls for three weeks prior to a general election - a clause inserted at the last minute into an otherwise uncontroversial government bill. This report aims simply to bring together in one convenient place our best understanding of the current situation in a number of English-speaking and European democracies (countries with which New Zealand routinely compares itself) and a few other important cases. If anything, there is some bias towards discussion of countries in which legal restrictions are in operation. For instance, both France and Italy feature heavily here, even though, in trying to enforce a period of pre-election opinion poll silence, they have more in common with the former communist countries of Eastern Europe than with their Western counterparts...|$|R

5000|$|In 2000, to {{accommodate}} {{the large number of}} Presidential candidates eligible in Florida, LePore designed a staggered two-page format with candidate names on alternating sides of a central punch button column. Conservatives commented that the same ballot was successfully used in the 1996 election; in fact, it had never been used in a Palm Beach County election among rival candidates for office. In 2000, the confusing design led to an increased amount of miscast votes in the presidential election (votes that would otherwise have been a decisive reversal) and consequently achieved notoriety. A study by the [...] "The Palm Beach Post" [...] speculated that voters confused by Palm Beach County's <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot</b> cost Al Gore the presidency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next day}} it was {{discovered}} that 'bad data' resulted in the carnage of the previous night. Due to the Bush margin of victory being less than 0.5% {{of the total number of}} votes cast, an automatic statewide machine recount was ordered. In Palm Beach County, a <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot</b> was used to conduct the election in some precincts. On election day, voters intended to vote for Al Gore instead voted for Pat Buchanan, and the Reform Party ticket. Buchanan received 3,407 votes or 0.8% of the total compared to 0.29% of the total statewide. As a result, unwilling Buchanan voters in Palm Beach county reported votes for Gore in exit polling which resulted in flawed data. Palm Beach County's butterfly ballots ...|$|E
50|$|Since 1992, Palm Beach County has {{supported}} a Democrat for the presidency. Prior to 1992, the county {{had been carried}} by a Republican every four years since 1948. Palm Beach County {{was the center of}} a nationwide media storm in 2000 when it appeared to have impacted the presidential election that year between eventual winner George W. Bush and Al Gore. A major source of controversy was the <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot</b> used in Palm Beach County, a confusing ballot design which may have caused many voters to mistakenly vote for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan instead of Al Gore. Buchanan had an unexpectedly strong showing in the county. In the end, Gore carried the county, but Bush captured the state of Florida by 537 votes after the recount was effectively halted by the Supreme Court of the United States in Bush v. Gore.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{voters in}} Palm Beach County who {{intended}} {{to vote for}} Gore actually marked their ballots for Pat Buchanan or spoiled their ballots because they found the ballot's layout to be confusing. The ballot displayed the list of presidential running-mate pairs alternately across two adjacent pages, with a column of punch spaces down the middle. Bush's name appeared {{at the top of}} the ballot, sparing most Bush voters from error. About 19,000 ballots were spoiled because of overvotes (two votes in the same race), compared to 3000 in 1996. According to a 2001 study in the American Political Science Review, the voting errors caused by the <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot</b> cost Gore the election: [...] "Had PBC used a ballot format in the presidential race that did not lead to systematic biased voting errors, our findings suggest that, other things equal, Al Gore would have won a majority of the officially certified votes in Florida." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the recount, {{controversy}} ensued {{with the}} discovery of various irregularities that had occurred in the voting process in several counties. Among these was the Palm Beach [...] "butterfly ballot," [...] which resulted in an unusually high number of votes for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan. Conservatives claimed that the same ballot had been successfully used in the 1996 election; in fact, it had never been used in a Palm Beach County election among rival candidates for office. Also, before the election, the Secretary of State's office had expunged tens of thousands of citizens identified as felons from the Florida voting rolls, with African-Americans identified on some counties' lists at up to five times their share of the population. Democrats claimed that many of these were not felons and should have been eligible to vote under Florida law. It was expected that had they been able to vote, most would have chosen the Democratic candidate. Additionally, this Florida election produced many more [...] "overvotes" [...] than usual, especially in predominantly African-American precincts in Duval County (Jacksonville), where some 21,000 ballots had multiple markings, such as two or more choices for president. Unlike the much-discussed Palm Beach County <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot,</b> the Duval County ballot spread choices for president over two non-facing pages. At {{the same time that the}} Bush campaign was contesting hand recounts in Democratic counties, it accepted hand recounts in Republican counties that gained them 185 votes, including votes where Republican Party workers were permitted to correct errors on thousands of applications for absentee ballots for Republicans. Alternately, Republicans charged that Democrats had registered non-citizens to vote, fought to exclude overseas military ballots, and arbitrarily changed vote-counting criteria after the election.|$|E
40|$|W e {{show that}} the <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot</b> used in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the 2000 presidentialelection caused more than 2, 000 Democratic voters to vote by mistake for Reform {{candidate}} PatBuchanan, a number larger than George W. Bush’s certified margin of victory in Florida. We use multiple methods and several kinds of data to rule out alternative explanations for the votes Buchanan received in Palm Beach County. Among 3, 053 U. S. counties where Buchanan was on the ballot, Palm Beach County has the most anomalous excess of votes for him. In Palm Beach County, Buchanan’s proportion of the vote on election-day ballots is four times larger than his proportion on absentee (nonbutterfly) ballots, but Buchanan’s proportion does not differ significantly between election-day and absentee ballots in any other Florida county. Unlike other Reform candidates in Palm Beach County, Buchanan tended to receive election-day votes in Democratic precincts and from individuals {{who voted for the}} Democratic U. S. Senate candidate. Robust estimation of overdispersed binomial regression models underpins much of the analysis. Beginning on election day November 7, 2000,Palm Beach County (PBC), Florida, attractednational and eventually international attention because thousands of voters in the county complained that they had difficulty understanding the now infa-mous <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot.</b> As a result, they claimed that they had cast invalid or erroneous presidential votes...|$|E
40|$|George W. Bush is {{president}} because he overcame his election day deficit with overseas absentee ballots that arrived and were counted after election day.

40|$|In November 2000, {{a poorly}} {{designed}} 'butterfly' ballot in Palm Beach County, Florida, of the United States of America, changed election history. Mostly African American and older voters {{believed that they}} had mistakenly voted for Pat Buchanan instead of Al Gore because they misread or misinterpreted the instructions on the ballot that had candidate names on both pages and punch-holes down the middle. While some institutions and individuals wrote reports and dissected {{the problems with the}} <b>butterfly</b> <b>ballot,</b> few people or groups sought to redesign the ballot. In 2001, AIGA Chicago chapter members developed an interdisciplinary group of information designers, industrial designers, and social researchers to understand and redesign the voting experience. This group became Design for Democracy, an organization that seeks to increase civic participation by making the experience clearer, understandable, easier to accomplish, and more trustworthy. Through partnerships between professionals and undergraduate students at University of Illinois at Chicago, over three years, the organization conducted ethnographically-based research and redesigned the election experience in Cook County Chicago, the Vote-By-Mail experience for the State of Oregon, and a get-out-the-vote campaign for culturally and linguistically disenfranchised voters in Chicago. This paper explores the role of research, particularly ethnographic research, in the interpretation of the 'meaning' of redesigned election artefacts within the discourses of American democracy following the 2000 Presidential election. In particular, it focuses on the shifting discourses of American democracy as framed by the contexts of American professional design and usability organizations, international museums, and American federal government officials. I argue that the research enables people to reframe the negative view of American politics following the November 2000 election to one of politics of inclusion, complexity, and transformation. This reframing has significant impact on individuals' and groups' perceptions of their active roles as potential positive change agents in civic life...|$|E
