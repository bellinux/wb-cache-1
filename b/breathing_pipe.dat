50|$|The blowgun {{can also}} {{double as a}} <b>breathing</b> <b>pipe</b> and straw to enable the ninja {{practitioner}} to better survive in the wilderness.|$|E
50|$|Fear {{of being}} buried alive was {{elaborated}} {{to the extent}} that those who could afford it would make all sorts of arrangements {{for the construction of a}} safety coffin to ensure this would be avoided (e.g., glass lids for observation, ropes to bells for signaling, and <b>breathing</b> <b>pipes</b> for survival until rescued).|$|R
5000|$|Ranatra is a genus of {{generally}} slender predatory {{members of}} the family Nepidae, known as water scorpions or water stick-insects. [...] Their front legs are strong and are used to grasp prey. They breathe through a pair of long <b>breathing</b> <b>pipes</b> extending from their tails. They eat tadpoles, small fish and other insects, which they pierce with their beak and inject a saliva which both sedates and begins to digest their prey.|$|R
50|$|Scene four {{consists}} of a chorus of Israelites singing, <b>Breathe</b> the <b>Pipe,</b> the Timbrel sound, a man singing, The Victor on his lofty seat, and the chorus repeating again.|$|R
50|$|Inside Stargher's mind, Novak is {{captured}} {{and subjected to}} King Stargher's torture while Deane looks on as Stargher's servant. Novak reminds Deane of a painful memory to reawaken her awareness that she is in Stargher's mind. Deane breaks free of Stargher's hold and stabs King Stargher to free Novak. During their escape, Novak sees {{a version of the}} glass enclosure with the same insignia as the hoist in Stargher's basement. Novak's team discovers that after the hoist's previous owner went bankrupt, the government hired Stargher to seal up his property. Novak races to the property, where the enclosure is completely filled but Hickson is treading water and <b>breathing</b> through a <b>pipe.</b> Novak breaks the glass wall and rescues Hickson.|$|R
5|$|Abi {{discovers that}} Ian's {{restaurant}} {{is on fire}} and goes inside to find Jane in a corridor on the floor struggling to <b>breathe.</b> A <b>pipe</b> falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and Steven soon find her and drag her out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side in the ambulance. At the hospital Abi tells Steven {{he is going to}} be a father. Steven declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. Steven then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven. Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks if she and Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together.|$|R
6000|$|Velez. [...] Nay! [...] My Albert lov'd sad {{music from}} a child. [...] Once he was lost; and after weary search [...] 60 [...] We {{found him in}} an open place of the wood, [...] To which spot he had follow'd a blind boy [...] Who <b>breathed</b> into a <b>pipe</b> of {{sycamore}} [...] Some strangely-moving notes, and these, he said, [...] Were taught him in a dream; him we first saw [...] 65 [...] Stretch'd on the broad top of a sunny heath-bank; [...] And, lower down, poor Albert fast asleep, [...] His head upon the blind boy's dog--it pleased me [...] To mark, how he had fasten'd round the pipe [...] A silver toy, his grandmother had given him. [...] 70 [...] Methinks I see him now, as he then look'd. [...] His infant dress was grown too short for him, [...] Yet still he wore it.|$|R
5000|$|The Goofy Gophers {{find that}} the tree they are living in has been cut down, and is gone. They find that it's in a log pile about to be taken away, to be {{produced}} into paper. They find it, but {{have to go up}} a waterfall on a log. When they go inside, they find themselves coming face to face against a bizarre machine designed to turn trees into toothpicks. They also make artificial logs. They find a room with furniture made of wood. The furniture then goes on a truck. The gophers get a rubber pipe and one of the gophers <b>breathes</b> into the <b>pipe</b> and turns green. The truck then leaves the factory. The gas is left all on the street providing evidence for the gophers to find out where the truck went. The truck then runs out of gas and one of the men says [...] "Are you sure you filled up before we left?" [...] The other says [...] "Yeah, I'm sure we filled up before we left." [...] The gophers get their furniture {{out of the truck and}} put it back in their new furniture tree. They now have a TV and now waiting for electricity to go to their new home.|$|R
40|$|Each year, {{innocent}} {{human lives}} are lost in collapsed structures {{as a result}} of both natural and man-made disasters. We have developed a prototype device, called the Rubble Rescue Radar (RRR) as a aid to workers trying to locate trapped victims in urban search and rescue operations. The RRR is a motion sensor incorporating Micropower Impulse Radar and is capable of detecting human breathing motions through reinforced concrete. It is lightweight, and designed to be handled by a single operator for local searches in areas where trapped victims are expected. Tests of the first prototype device were conducted on site at LLNL using a mock rubble pile consisting of a reinforced concrete pipe with two concrete floor slabs placed against one side, and random concrete and asphalt debris piled against the other. This arrangement provides safe and easy access for instruments and/or human subjects. Breathing signals of a human subject were recorded with the RRR through one floor slab plus the wall of the pipe, two slabs plus the wall of the pipe, and the random rubble plus the wall of the <b>pipe.</b> <b>Breathing</b> and heart beat signals were also recorded of a seated human subject at a distance of 1 meter with no obstructions. Results and photographs of the experimental work are presented, and a design concept for the next generation device is described...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} elastic {{anisotropy}} in piping materials on fluid–structure interaction are studied for water-filled carbon-fiber reinforced thin plastic pipes. When an impact is introduced to {{water in a}} pipe, there are two waves traveling at different speeds. A primary wave corresponding to a <b>breathing</b> mode of <b>pipe</b> travels slowly and a precursor wave corresponding to a longitudinal mode of pipe travels fast. An anisotropic stress–strain relationship of piping materials has been taken into account to describe the propagation of primary and precursor waves in the carbon-fiber reinforced thin plastic pipes. The wave speeds and strains in the axial and hoop directions are calculated {{as a function of}} carbon-fiber winding angles and compared with the experimental data. As the winding angle increases, the primary wave speed increases due to the increased stiffness in the hoop direction, while the precursor wave speed decreases. The magnitudes of precursor waves are much smaller than those of primary waves so that the effect of precursor waves on the deformation of pipe is not significant. The primary wave generates the hoop strain accompanying the opposite-signed axial strain through the coupling compliance of pipe. The magnitude of hoop strain induced by the primary waves decreases with increasing the winding angle due to the increased hoop stiffness of pipe. The magnitude of axial strain is small at low and high winding angles where the coupling compliance is small...|$|R
6000|$|As for {{the grim}} Doctor, there {{did not appear}} to be much {{alteration}} in that hard old character; perhaps he drank a little more, though that was doubtful, because it is difficult to see where he could find niches to stick in more frequent drinks. Nor did he more frequently <b>breathe</b> through the <b>pipe.</b> He fell into desuetude, however, of his daily walk, [Endnote: 1] and sent Elsie to play by herself in the graveyard (a dreary business enough for the poor child) instead of taking her to country or seaside himself. He was more savage and blasphemous, sometimes, than he had been heretofore known to be; but, on the other hand, he was sometimes softer, with a kind of weary consenting to circumstances, intervals of helpless resignation, when he no longer fought and struggled in his heart. He did not seem to be alive all the time; but, on the other hand, he was sometimes a good deal too much alive, and could not bear his potations as well as he used to do, and was overheard blaspheming at himself for being so weakly, and having a brain that could not bear a thimbleful, and growing to be a milksop like Colcord, as he said. This person, of whom the Doctor and his young people had had such a brief experience, appeared nevertheless to hang upon his remembrance in a singular way,--the more singular as there was little resemblance between them, or apparent possibility of sympathy. Little Elsie was startled to hear Doctor Grim sometimes call out, [...] "Colcord! Colcord!" [...] as if he were summoning a spirit from some secret place. He muttered, sitting by himself, long, indistinct masses of talk, in which this name was discernible, and other names. Going on mumbling, by the hour together, great masses of vague trouble, in which, if it only could have been unravelled and put in order, no doubt all the secrets of his life,--secrets of wrath, guilt, vengeance, love, hatred, all beaten up together, and the best quite spoiled by the worst, might have been found. His mind evidently wandered. Sometimes, he seemed to be holding conversation with unseen interlocutors, and almost invariably, so far as could be gathered, he was bitter, and then sat, immitigable, pouring out wrath and terror, denunciating, tyrannical, speaking as to something that lay at his feet, but which he would not spare. [Endnote: 2] Then suddenly, he would start, look round the dark old study, upward to the dangling spider overhead, and then at the quiet little girl, who, try as she might, could not keep her affrighted looks from his face, and always met his eyes with a loyal frankness and unyielded faith in him.|$|R
