In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.|$|E

Gurovich and Beck argued, however, that the p4 of Argentodites did not differ materially from that in the jaw they allocated to Ferugliotherium, and that Argentodites was based on a specimen of either Ferugliotherium or a closely related animal. Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described mammals from the Allen Formation, a third Argentinean formation of similar age, in 2009, including a new ferugliotheriid, Trapalcotherium matuastensis. They also regarded Argentodites as a likely relative of Ferugliotherium and suggested that Ferugliotheriidae are either multituberculates or closely related to them.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of surveys of specialists in labor {{economics}} and public economics at 40 leading research universities in the United States. Respondents provided opinions of policy proposals; quantitative <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> and 95 % confidence intervals for economic parameters; answers to values questions regarding income redistribution, efficiency versus equity, and individual versus social responsibility; and their political party identification. We find considerable disagreement among economists about policy proposals. Their positions on policy are {{more closely related to}} their values than to their estimates of relevant economic parameters or to their political party identification. Average <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> of the economic parameters agree well with the ranges summarized in surveys of relevant literature, but the individual <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> are usually widely dispersed. Moreover, economists, like experts in many fields, appear more confident of their estimates than the substantial cross-respondent variation in estimates would warrant. Finally although the confidence intervals in general appear to be too narrow, respondents whose <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> are farther from the median tend to give wider confidence intervals for those estimates. ...|$|R

Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments.

25|$|Without climate feedbacks, a {{doubling}} in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration {{would result in}} a global average temperature increase of around 1.2°C.

Historical information and global climate models indicate a climate sensitivity of 1.5 to 4.5°C, with a <b>best</b> <b>estimate</b> of 3°C. This is an amplification of the carbon dioxide forcing by a factor of 2.5. Some studies suggest a lower climate sensitivity, but other studies indicate a sensitivity above this range. Partly because of the difficulty in modeling the cloud feedback, the true climate sensitivity remains uncertain.|$|E

The dating of detrital zircons from the Bass Formation have yielded dates of about 1200 Ma. These dates suggest that the 1254 Ma age {{may be a bit}} too old. However, these zircons likely underwent some lead loss, and, as a result these apparent dates are younger than their actual ages.

25|$|Sulfate aerosol has {{two main}} effects, direct and indirect.

The effect varies strongly geographically, with most cooling believed to be at and downwind of major industrial centres. Modern climate models addressing the attribution of recent climate change take into account sulfate forcing, which appears to account (at least partly) for the slight drop in global temperature {{in the middle of the}} 20th century.

30|$|The CMT data {{inversion}} can yield the <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> and the variance–covariance matrix {{of the model}} parameters for the stress field (Terakawa and Matsu’ura 2008). By varying the synthetic model parameters using multivariate normal random numbers with the <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> of the model parameters (the means) and the variance–covariance matrix, we repeatedly calculated the possible stress patterns for 100 sets. For each set, we measured the closeness between the stress pattern with the <b>best</b> <b>estimates</b> of the model parameters and the pattern with synthetic model parameters using the inner tensor product, and calculated the average value of the inner tensor products of the 100 sets (AVITP) together with the standard deviation (SDVITP). We used the AVITP and the SDVITP as the estimation error of the regional stress pattern and the 67 % confidence region, respectively. The AVITP and SDVITP values were larger (the estimation errors were smaller) and smaller, respectively, in the region with more data (Fig.  4 a; Additional file 4), {{which means that the}} quantities of AVITP and SDVITP are appropriate for estimation errors of the stress pattern and the confidence region, respectively.|$|R
