The hall is a Grade I listed building, and {{entrance}} is free.|$|E
5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense {{is a logical}} {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and published in its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The Miracle of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> rest.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that parents <b>were</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for children, nor <b>were</b> children <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for parents; a person <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death only for the personâ€™s own crime.

60|$|But indeed, at that time, <b>putting</b> <b>to</b> death <b>was</b> {{a recipe}} much in vogue with all trades and professions, and {{not least of}} all with Tellson's. Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's? Accordingly, the forger <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; the utterer of a bad note <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; the {{unlawful}} opener of a letter <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; the holder of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; the coiner of a bad shilling <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death. Not that it did the least good {{in the way of}} prevention--it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> a vote by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{were held}} {{during the second}} wave of strikes, when Brendan Barber {{announced}} {{on the afternoon of}} Friday 30 October that proposals had <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> both Royal Mail and the CWU for them to consider over the weekend. Talks resumed on the Monday, however this news was overshadowed by the announcement that a further two days of strikes would be held on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. It was also announced that these would be all out strikes with everybody walking out at the same time rather than the rolling strike action that had been adopted previously, thus leading to a complete stoppage throughout the course of the action. These were later called off in order for further talks to take place.|$|E
5|$|In later life, Hamming became {{interested}} in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, {{when he left the}} Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed {{in the first half of}} his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.|$|E

5|$|Microbes are {{important}} in human culture and health in many ways, serving to ferment foods, treat sewage, produce fuel, enzymes and other bioactive compounds. They are essential tools in biology as model organisms, and have <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> use in biological warfare and bioterrorism. They are a vital component of fertile soils. In the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora. They are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases, and as such are the target of hygiene measures.|$|E
5|$|Since 2000, the ADF's {{expanded}} {{force structure}} and deployment capabilities have <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> the test on several occasions. Following the 11 September 2001 {{terrorist attacks on}} the United States, Australia committed a special forces task group and an air-to-air refuelling aircraft to operations in Afghanistan, and naval warships to the Persian Gulf as Operation Slipper. In 2003, approximately 2,000 ADF personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, took part in the invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|According to custom, pretenders to {{the throne}} had {{historically}} <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death upon the naming of a new sovereign. Radama was opposed to this practice and asked the brothers to help ensure his accession {{to the throne}} with minimum bloodshed {{on the day of}} the queen's death. Rainilaiarivony successfully maintained authority over the palace guards anxiously awaiting the command from either faction to slaughter the other. When the queen's attendant quietly informed him that her final moments were approaching, Rainilaiarivony discreetly summoned Radama and Rainivoninahitriniony from the Prime Minister's palace to the royal Rova compound and ordered the prince crowned before the gathered soldiers, just as the queen was pronounced dead. Ramboasalama was promptly escorted to the palace where he was obliged to publicly swear allegiance to King Radama.|$|E

5|$|On 7 August 1936, France {{unilaterally}} declared non-intervention. Draft declarations had <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> the German and Italian governments. Such {{a declaration}} {{had already been}} accepted by the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, which renounced all traffic in war material, direct or indirect. The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Armindo Monteiro, was also asked to accept, but held his hand. An ultimatum was put to Yvon Delbos by the British: halt French exports to Spain, or Britain would not be obliged to act under the Treaty of Locarno if Germany invaded; on 9 August, exports were duly suspended. However, collections for food, clothing and medical supplies to the Spanish Republicans continued. On 9 August, the Germans informed the British that 'no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will', which was blatantly false. During the blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar by the Spanish Republican Navy one German Junkers was captured {{when it came down}} in Republican territory, and explained as 'merely a transport aircraft'. Its release would be required before Germany signed the Non-Intervention Pact. Portugal accepted the pact on 13 August, unless her border was threatened by the war.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Department of State charges back fees to {{manufacturers}} {{who have}} failed to register previously. Smaller exporters {{who may not have}} been aware of the requirement to register can potentially be charged crippling back fees when they first register.

5000|$|No {{sentence}} {{carries with}} it {{any change in the}} civil status of the convict's family. The Pentateuchal law provides (Deut. xxiv. 16), [...] "The parents shall not <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for the children, neither shall the children <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for the parents; every man shall <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for his own sins," [...] and rabbinic jurisprudence follows this principle both to the letter and in spirit. Nor is a sentence attended by confiscation of the convict's goods. All his possessions descend to his legal heirs (Tosef., Sanh. iv. 6; Sanh. 27b, 48b; see Confiscation).|$|R
25|$|By {{his wife}} Nysa of Cappadocia (who was the {{daughter}} of King Pharnaces I of Pontus) he had six children; but they were all, with the exception of one, killed by their mother, that she might obtain the government of the kingdom.

25|$|During {{the reign}} of Edward III in the 14th century, tournaments were held in {{adjacent}} fields. The dangers were, however, {{not limited to the}} participants: a wooden stand built to accommodate Queen Philippa and her companions collapsed during a tournament to celebrate the birth of the Black Prince in 1330. No one died, but the King was greatly displeased, and the stand's builders would have <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death but for the Queen's intercession.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cichlids}} readily hybridize with related species, both in {{the wild}} and under artificial conditions. Other groups of fishes, such as European cyprinids, also hybridize. Unusually, cichlid hybrids have <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> extensive commercial use, in particular for aquaculture and aquaria. The hybrid red strain of tilapia, for example, is often preferred in aquaculture for its rapid growth. Tilapia hybridization can produce all-male populations to control stock density or prevent reproduction in ponds.|$|E

25|$|The Moon {{itself would}} move uniformly (with some mean motion in anomaly) on a {{secondary}} circular orbit, called an epicycle, that itself would move uniformly (with some mean motion in longitude) over the main circular {{orbit around the}} Earth, called deferent; see deferent and epicycle. Apollonius demonstrated that these two models were in fact mathematically equivalent. However, all this was theory and had not <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> practice. Hipparchus was the first astronomer we know attempted to determine the relative proportions and actual sizes of these orbits.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of closing hours {{was put to}} New South Wales voters in June 1916. The question had previously <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> the vote in December 1913 when {{the results of the}} Local Option Poll were in favour of 11 o'clock closing. The 1916 vote was influenced by a recent riot involving drunken soldiers. In February 1916, troops mutinied against conditions at the Casula Camp. They raided hotels in Liverpool before travelling by train to Sydney, where one soldier was shot dead in a riot at Central Railway station.|$|E
25|$|The {{form of the}} triumphal arch {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> other purposes, notably the {{construction}} of monumental memorial arches and city gates such as the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin or the Washington Square Arch in New York City, or simple welcoming arches such as the Barcelona Triumphal Arch, built as an entrance to the fairgrounds for the 1888 World Fair. Although patterned after triumphal arches, these were built for quite different purposes - to memorialise war dead or to provide a monumental entrance to a city, as opposed to celebrating a military success or general.|$|E
