40|$|Background—Although type B aortic {{dissection}} {{has been}} treated with blockers to lower the arterial blood pressure (BP), {{there has been little}} evidences about reduction in heart rate (HR). We assessed whether tight HR control improved the outcome of medical treatment in patients with aortic dissection. Methods and Results—From 1997 to 2005, 171 patients with acute aortic dissection medically treated and controlled to lower BP under 120 mm Hg were enrolled. Based on the average HR at 3, 5, and 7 days after the onset, patients were divided into tight HR (60 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> control group (32 patients; mean HR of 56. 63. 1 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> and conventional HR (60 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> control group (139 patients; mean HR of 71. 78. 2 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute).</b> We compared the frequency of aortic events including late organ or limb ischemia, aortic rupture, recurrent dissection, and aortic expansion of 5 mm, and surgical requirement between two groups. During a median follow-up of 27. 0 months, late organ or limb ischemia, aortic rupture, recurrent dissection, pathological aortic expansion, and aortic surgery occurred in 0, 8, 14, 39, and 26 patients, respectively. Reduction in aortic events was observed in tight HR control group (12. 5 %) compared to conventional HR control group (36. 0 %), (Odds ratio: 0. 25, C. I. : 0. 08 to 0. 77, P 0. 01). Conclusions—The present study demonstrated that tight heart rate control improved the outcome of medical treatment in patients with aortic dissection. (Circulation. 2008; 118 [suppl 1]:S 167 –S 170.)

40|$|Goal: A {{new method}} for heart rate {{monitoring}} using photoplethysmography (PPG) during physical activities is proposed. Methods: It jointly estimates spectra of PPG signals and simultaneous acceleration signals, utilizing the multiple measurement vector model in sparse signal recovery. Due {{to a common}} sparsity constraint on spectral coefficients, the method can easily identify and remove spectral peaks of motion artifact (MA) in PPG spectra. Thus, it does not need any extra signal processing modular to remove MA as in some other algorithms. Furthermore, seeking spectral peaks associated with heart rate is simplified. Results: Experimental results on 12 PPG datasets sampled at 25 Hz and recorded during subjects' fast running showed that it had high performance. The average absolute estimation error was 1. 28 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> and the standard deviation was 2. 61 <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Conclusion and Significance: These {{results show that the}} method has great potential to be used for PPG-based heart rate monitoring in wearable devices for fitness tracking and health monitoring.

50|$|Influenced by the art {{and music}} of John Cage while {{studying}} at Pratt Institute, O'Connor created abstractions based on chance operations.

Each drawing represented a specific <b>beat</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> played for a specific duration. In the late 1990s, O'Connor begin to explore systematic approaches to art making through drawing. These works were diagrammatic and process based. Though the compositions were simpler in these and other experimental works made in this period, O'Connor was laying the basic groundwork for his future methods and defining his unique conceptual framework, which he expanded at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2000.|$|R
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 <b>beats</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule.

Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|The SA node {{is found}} in all amniotes but not in more {{primitive}} vertebrates. In these animals, {{the muscles of the}} heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium. The rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species, ranging from around 20 <b>beats</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> in codfish to around 600 in hummingbirds and up to 1200 bpm in the ruby-throated hummingbird.|$|E

The embryonic heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165–185 bpm early in the early 7th week (early 9th week after the LMP).
