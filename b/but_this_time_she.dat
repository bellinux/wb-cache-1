5|$|Mulder {{brings a}} {{cockroach}} {{from the hotel}} room to Berenbaum, who thinks it may be mechanical. Mulder then visits the nearby Dr. Ivanov, a wheelchair-bound scientist who works on insect-like robots. The two discuss the possibility that extraterrestrial intelligences could send robotic probes to study other planets. After inspecting the Mulder's specimen, Ivanov is rendered speechless; he informs Mulder that the specimen is, technology-wise, vastly superior to anything he's ever seen. Scully arrives in the town at a convenience store, finding the residents succumbing to panic over the roaches. She attempts to calm the people down, however the store-goers frantically flee after two scuffling patrons knock over a display of chocolate candies, believing {{them to be more}} roaches. Meanwhile, Mulder, while departing Ivanov's lab, catches another roach to bring to Berenbaum, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> concludes that it is a seemingly normal cockroach. Scully finds out that Eckerle was researching dung-derived methane as an alternative fuel source, and had been importing animal dung that may have introduced the roaches to the area. Upon hearing this, Mulder speculates that the roaches are actually extraterrestrial robotic probes that are capable of consuming dung—an abundant resource already exploited by some species of roaches—to generate methane as a source of fuel.|$|E

Bradley Stern of Muumuse gave the song a positive review, saying [...] "American Girl {{might as well be}} the next single in waiting from Teenage Dream or Ke$ha‘s Warrior, full of punchy, guitar-driven hooks, slamming synthesizers and supremely crafted earworm melodies. It’s big, beautiful and bold — just like a song called “American Girl” should sound.

Taraborrelli recalled that Madonna had appropriated every move and mannerisms of Marilyn Monroe for the performance, making it {{a tribute to the}} actress. When she appeared onstage, there was technical difficulty resulting in the mike not appearing from below the ground, and a stage-hand passing it to her. According to Madonna's brother Christopher Ciccone, she was quite nervous during the performance; [...] "Had she been singing to an audience of screaming fans, she wouldn't have been at all nervous. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> was performing in an auditorium full of established actors and actresses, a group of people to which she really didn't belong, who didn't respect her as an actress but whose respect she desperately wanted to win." ...|$|E

During her work on Parasite Eve, Shimomura spent time in America, which was {{where much of the}} game's staff came from. Because of this, Shimomura remembered the game as her most challenging project. She wanted the music to be experimental, not falling into ambient or techno classifications.

Until Parasite Eve, Shimomura had written music in a straightforward manner that reflected her then-current state of mind, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> restrained herself and took a more [...] "emotionless" [...] approach. She felt that this would best represent the game's atmosphere and Aya's stoic attitude. Ultimately, she felt that Parasite Eve was an experimental work in many ways. Due to its prevalence in the story, Shimomura used opera music, but as typical opera music did not translate well into battle themes, Shimomura added different rhythms: these rhythms were inspired when some of the game's American staff took her to a nightclub and she heard the background music there. The music recording took place at the Andora Studios in Los Angeles.|$|E

In April 1913 the offices of The Suffragette were raided by the police and the staff were arrested on charges of conspiring to damage property. Barrett was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment at Holloway. She immediately went on hunger strike, was transferred to Canterbury Prison, and after five days she was released under the [...] "Cat and Mouse Act". She moved into [...] "Mouse Castle", 2 Campden Hill Square, home of the Brackenbury family who were sympathetic suffragists. After three weeks at the house, Barrett emerged and was re-arrested. She went back on hunger strike and after four days was again released to [...] "Mouse Castle". This time she was smuggled out of the house in disguise to allow her to speak at meetings, before being re-arrested for a second time. For the third time Barrett was released after a hunger strike, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> successfully eluded the authorities and fled to a nursing home in Edinburgh where she remained until December 1913. On leaving Scotland she returned in secret to London; she hid at Lincoln's Inn House where she lived in a bedsit. Barrett continued to edit The Suffragette, but she travelled to Paris to discuss the future of the newspaper with Christabel Pankhurst after its offices were raided in May 1914. The result of their meeting was the relocation of The Suffragette to Edinburgh where the printers were at less risk of arrest. Barrett moved to Edinburgh and assumed the pseudonym [...] "Miss Ashworth". Barrett continued to publish the paper until its final edition on the week after the First World War was declared. During the war Barrett was a vocal supporter of British military action, as were the majority of the suffragette movement. She was a contributor to the WSPU 'Victory Fund' which was launched in 1916 to sponsor campaigns against [...] "a compromise peace" [...] and industrial strikes.|$|E

[...] "The Color Honeymooners," [...] as it has since become known, featured Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean in, respectively, the roles of Alice and Trixie, because Audrey Meadows and Joyce Randolph declined to relocate to Miami. Gleason raised no objections to that recasting, but was adamant that the Ed Norton role never be played by anyone other than Art Carney.

Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of The Letter, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees.

[...] "I was a nervous wreck {{due to the fact that}} my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue." [...] The actress retreated to her rented house in Laguna Beach and [...] "flatly refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least.

[...] A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by Katharine Hepburn or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress. Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine Academy Awards, she and Wyler never worked together again.|$|E
