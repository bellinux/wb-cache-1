2500|$|The Game said Jackson {{started the}} {{conversation}} {{by talking about}} music and complimenting him on his records like [...] "Hate It or Love It" [...] and [...] "How We Do" [...] and, [...] " [...] said, 'I don't know how you're gonna feel about this, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you something. I don't want you to judge me, but I don't really know everything that's going on between you and 50 [...] But I {{want to be the}} middleman behind you putting this situation to bed." [...] Jackson had wanted the two to meet, with him serving as a mediator, though according to Game, [...] "It never manifested." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is not that, Polly. It is {{far from}} being that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you a question. You {{remember}} the night of Mr. Mulready's murder? Do you remember whether your father was at home all that evening?" ...|$|E
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see her. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> her <b>to</b> come here.|$|R
60|$|Oh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{hear about}} the {{exquisite}} shapes and glorious colours.|$|R
5000|$|... “It will {{be great}} to reach the final, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{concentrate}} on improving my diving skills.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Captain Westover nodded. [...] "I suppose so. I want to {{beg your}} pardon first for what I am going to say, De Vaux. If I make an ass of myself, don't scruple to say so! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you this! Why, in thunder, did you let Adrea what's-her-name, the dancing girl, come down here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I'm betraying a {{confidence}} in admitting it. Anyway, I felt that one ought {{to help him}} for the family's sake, lest he get into worse trouble; and I could afford the loan. Since I married I've been making some money. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you about this Harding. What kind of fellow is he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It did {{not exist}} then. This is a recent creation,' said the lady. 'I have built a nest in the chink of the hills, that I might look upon Arabia; and the palm tree that invited you to honour my domain was the {{contribution}} of my Arab grandfather to the only garden near Jerusalem. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you another question. What, on the whole, is the thing most valued in Europe?' ...|$|E
60|$|JACK. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know what}} <b>I</b> 'm to do. [Passionately.] I won't be badgered like this.|$|R
5000|$|... {{care about}} it at all. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> come to the Volga, to a {{specific}} place and a specific city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{hold her}} hands while the {{drumming}} takes place. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{hear her voice}} {{at the same time}} with 'Mitchell's.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} going on in Monte Carlo," [...] Lady Hunterleys went on, [...] "which I cannot understand. Mr. Draconmeyer knows about it, I believe, although he is not personally concerned in it. But he will tell me nothing. I only know that for some reason or other your presence here {{seems to be an}} annoyance to certain people. Why it should be I don't know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you about it. Will you tell me the truth? Are you sure that you did not come here to spy upon me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{long way}} to go without {{anything}} to eat," [...] she said, [...] "and we can give you some breakfast. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you something. I am in a good deal of perplexity. Our two servants are out at the front of the house, but they positively refuse to come in; they are afraid that your house may begin sliding again and crush them all, so, I shall have to get breakfast. But what bothers me is trying to find our well. I have been outside, and can see no signs of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Captain Asher, I {{must not}} stay here {{blocking}} up your toll-gate all the morning, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of {{you a very}} great favor. I want you to let your niece come and make me a visit. I want a good visit--at least ten days. You must remember that her father and I, and her mother, too, were very good friends. Now {{there are so many}} things I want to talk over with Miss Olive, and I am sure you will let me have her just for ten short days. There are no guests at Broadstone yet, and I want her. You do not know how much I want her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, yes; I've got to dine {{with these}} fellows at the Railway Hotel at eight, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{speak to you}} first, Wilmet,' said Mr. Audley, sitting down {{as if he were}} weary of his day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Margie is well-bred," [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Wrapp. [...] "We'll admit she hasn't gone to extremes, {{as most of}} {{our girls}} have. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> observe to you {{that she has been}} a wall-flower for a year." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not think}} that her {{information}} was likely to be of any practical use, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make her speak again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm really afraid you're not well, and I think it's too bad {{of us to}} be going," [...] resumed Mrs. Vervain; [...] "but it can't {{be helped}} now: we are all packed, don't you see. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> one favor of you, Don Ippolito; and that is," [...] said Mrs. Vervain, covertly taking a little rouleau from her pocket, [...] "that you'll leave these inventions of yours for a while, and give {{yourself}} a vacation. You need rest of mind. Go into the country, somewhere, do. That's what's preying upon you. But we must really be off, now. Shake hands with Florida--I'm {{going to be the}} last to part with you," [...] she said, with a tearful smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} into {{the country in a}} {{fortnight}} or so. I have been so long accustomed to fields and trees, that I long to be in them again, or, at any rate, out of London. I have nothing to do now, and feel lonely and sad here. It is such a change for Jamie, too, after the open-air life he has had for the last year. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you something. I may, at any moment, have to go far away again, and this time I cannot take him with me. If I come up suddenly, and leave him with you, will you take care of him as your own? It may be for three months--it may be for three years. Of course, I shall pay you; but it is not that. Will you take care of him as your own?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But I {{began this}} letter not for what I have been writing, {{but to say}} {{something}} on that subject which you know to be of such infinite solicitude to me. The immense sufferings you endured from {{the first days of}} September till the middle of February you never tried to conceal from me, and I well understood. You have now been the husband of a lovely woman nearly eight months. That you are happier now than the day you married her I well know, for without you could not be living. But I have your word for it, too, and the returning elasticity of spirits which is manifested in your letters. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a close question, [...] "Are you now in feeling as well as judgment glad that you are married as you are?" [...] From anybody but me this would be an impudent question, not to be tolerated; but I know you will pardon it in me. Please answer it quickly, as I am impatient to know. I have sent my love to your Fanny so often, I fear she is getting tired of it. However, I venture to tender it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean you}} were indelicate, really, Alma, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> warn you. <b>I</b> think Mr. Beaton {{was very much}} in earnest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be an Englishman, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} {{other points}} of view. And <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{get rid of}} a merely English attitude in studies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see it. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{copies of}} all the issues in which there have been {{articles}} upon the International Stores." ...|$|R

40|$|We hear so much {{today about}} raising standards, {{improving}} outcomes, child-centred learning and {{catering to the}} individual; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the question “what about me?!” where do I fit in? I believe {{that in order to}} teach for transformation, we must first address these questions; where do my beliefs and values come from and why do I teach what I teach? I was able to answer these questions through research as transformative learning; I gained radical insight through radical openness and honesty. I ask, is there a hegemony of traditionalism and political opinion in education that prevents teachers from finding their voice in educational research? That prevents us from being open and honest with ourselves and connecting with our students? Research as transformative learning allowed me to critically connect with my experiences as an educator and gave my insights a contributive voice. I believe that only by transforming our thinking, can we learn to truly connect with our students and change the story of education. In this presentation I will 76 ask, how can teacher become researcher? And why must we take charge of the future of education. I will illustrate how a transformation of our own consciousness can pave the way for creative, compassionate and critical learners to shepherd the world into the future...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> help you. You're in such {{an awful}} scrape, and if you'll only marry me it can all be set right.|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA. Yes. I always {{call him}} Horus, because Horus {{is the most}} {{beautiful}} of our gods. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know his real name.|$|R
60|$|Jack. Ay, very likely, if Mistress Rose {{had been}} in his stomach; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> fight Spaniards just then, not to be shark-bitten.|$|R
60|$|KNOX. If Ive {{made any}} mistake I'm ready <b>to</b> apologize. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know where my}} {{daughter}} {{has been for the}} last fortnight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rube laughed. 'I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{get there}} before dusk, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> start at daybreak, and I'll tell you why. You {{remember}} Pepita?' ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{could tell}} just in general that yes, it's him. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to}} tell other people so I {{replicated}} the pose.|$|R
6000|$|AUGUSTA. I--I can't discuss it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be just. I'm {{convinced}} that I did you a wrong--and I'm sorry. Won't you believe me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; tell us,' said Lucilla. 'I {{read all}} your evidence, so like {{yourself}} as it was, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know where you}} were sleeping.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It's very silly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tell it, because I hate to {{have people}} say and think such things about us and Laurie." ...|$|R
60|$|I went in {{farther than}} was {{necessary}} for me to state my errand. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see Sampson's face, to see into his eyes.|$|R
