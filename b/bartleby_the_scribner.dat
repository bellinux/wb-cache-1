40|$|<b>Bartleby,</b> <b>the</b> Scrivener recounts a {{story of}} a scrivener who would prefer not to do anything, whether that be parts of his job, {{changing}} his location, or eating his dinner. The narrator’s reaction to Bartleby’s lazy desires seem to be admirable, but his selfish motivation and false compassion are evident. The way the narrator views and treats Bartleby is consistent with the standards of philanthropy of the wealthy during the mid-nineteenth century. The narrator truly believes he has helped <b>Bartleby</b> to <b>the</b> best of his ability, yet fails to connect with Bartleby outside of offering him money and future assistance if required. This may be blamed on the narrator’s lack of relationship with God. People below the narrator’s socioeconomic status were viewed solely on how they could benefit him and his business and were expected to conform to <b>the</b> narrator’s standards. <b>Bartleby</b> <b>the</b> Scrivener, though a melancholy story leading to Bartleby’s death, can be used to see an accurate picture of philanthropy in the 1850 s...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to reveal the}} {{patterns}} of initiation encoded in the texture of <b>the</b> Melvillean short-story <b>Bartleby</b> <b>the</b> Scrivener. The multivalent concept of initiation is explored in this paper {{against the background of}} the richly symbolic imagery upon which the text is constructed. The emblematic tale of Wall Street opens itself up to an esoteric reading, which unveils its initiatory core and rich underlying spiritual texture. Read as a story of spiritual realization, <b>Bartleby</b> <b>the</b> Scrivener brings to light a multitude of unexpected facets of Melville’s esoteric knowledge and thinking, clearly visible in the configuration of the imaginary circumscribed to his work. The character who undergoes a process of initiation is the Lawyer, whose spiritual adventure is triggered by meeting Bartleby. It is through the agency of the Scrivener that the legal gentleman enters into a dialog with a Higher Reality, invisible to the eyes of the unenlightened. The process of initiatory death and rebirth unfolds under the guidance of a superior intelligence that acts as the intermediary between the High and the Low - this role being performed by Bartleb...|$|R
