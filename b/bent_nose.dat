500|$|Kelly {{had already}} {{established}} himself as a respected songwriter—other Melbourne musicians would go to see him on their nights off. Richard Guilliatt, writing for The Monthly, later described Kelly from a 1979 performance at Richmond's Kingston Hotel, the singer was [...] "a skinny guy with a head of black curls framing a pale face and a <b>bent</b> <b>nose...</b> singing with his eyes closed, one arm outstretched and the other resting on the body of the Fender Telecaster". Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots' gigs and they later married – the relationship is described in [...] "When I First Met Your Ma" [...] (1992). Brown's father supplied Kelly with a gravy recipe – used on [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] (1996). Their son, Declan, was born in 1980.|$|E
5000|$|Curvus, {{which means}} [...] "bent" [...] or [...] "crooked," [...] {{is the first}} cognomen of the Fulvii to occur in history, {{although}} it is not known whether the name was due to some physical peculiarity, such as a <b>bent</b> <b>nose,</b> or crooked leg, or whether the name was bestowed metaphorically or ironically.|$|E
5000|$|Drama critic Martin Gottfried gives {{a general}} {{description}} of Chayefsky's personal traits {{as they may}} have affected his writings:"Chayefsky was a sturdy man of 42, compact and burly in the bulky way of a schoolyard athlete, with thick dark hair and a <b>bent</b> <b>nose</b> that could pass for a streetfighter's. He was a grown-up with {{one foot in the}} boys' clubs of his city youth, a street snob who would not allow the loss of his nostalgia. He was an intellectual competitor, always spoiling for a political argument or a philosophical argument, or any exchange over any issue, changing sides for the fun of the fray. A liberal, he was annoyed by liberals; a proud Jew, he wouldn't let anyone call him a 'Jewish writer'. In short, {{the life of the mind}} was a participant sport for Paddy Chayefsky." ...|$|E
5000|$|The hooked nose {{became a}} key feature in antisemitic Nazi propaganda. [...] "One can most easily tell a Jew by his nose," [...] wrote Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher in a children's story. [...] "The Jewish <b>nose</b> is <b>bent</b> at its point. It {{looks like the}} number six. We call it the 'Jewish six.' Many Gentiles also have <b>bent</b> <b>noses.</b> But their noses bend upwards, not downwards. Such a nose is a hook nose or an eagle nose. It {{is not at all}} like a Jewish nose." ...|$|R

50|$|Four {{tools are}} {{essential}} {{and several other}} tools are useful {{in the construction of}} wire wrapped jewelry. The basic tools are a flush cutter, round nose pliers, flat nose pliers and chain <b>nose</b> or <b>bent</b> chain <b>nose</b> pliers. A flush cutter is a special type of cutter that leaves one end of the cut wire flush or flat, while {{the opposite end of the}} cut wire is sharp or pointed. Round nose pliers are pliers with conical jaws and are used for making loops in wire. Chain <b>nose</b> or <b>bent</b> chain <b>nose</b> pliers have flat smooth jaws and are used for gripping and holding wire and for bending wire. Flat nose pliers are just what the name implies…they are flat on both inside surfaces and are used to keep areas flat or to make 90-degree bends in your wire.|$|R
5000|$|His first {{published}} song, [...] "It's the Falling Apart that Makes You", was written {{after listening to}} Van Morrison's Astral Weeks {{at the age of}} 19, although in an interview with Drum Media he recalled writing his first unpublished song: [...] "It was an open-tuning and had four lines about catching trains. I have got a recording of it somewhere. It was called 'Catching a Train'. I wrote a lot of songs about trains early on, trains and fires, and then I moved on to water". In 1976, Kelly appeared on Debutantes, a compilation album featuring various Melbourne-based artists, and joined pub-rockers The High Rise Bombers from 1977 to 1978. The High Rise Bombers included Kelly (vocals, guitar, songwriter), Martin Armiger (guitar, vocals, songwriter), Lee Cass (bass guitar), Chris Dyson (guitar), Sally Ford (saxophone, songwriter), John Lloyd (drums), and Keith Shadwick (saxophone). Chris Langman (guitar, vocals) replaced Dyson in early 1978. In August, after Armiger left for The Sports and Ford for The Kevins, Kelly formed Paul Kelly and the Dots with Langman and Lloyd. The High Rise Bombers recorded two tracks, [...] "She's Got It" [...] and [...] "Domestic Criminal", which appeared on The Melbourne Club, a 1981 compilation by various artists on Missing Link Records.Kelly had already established himself as a respected songwriter—other Melbourne musicians would go to see him on their nights off.

40|$|Pressure {{distributions}} {{and shock}} shapes on a spherically blunted, 12. 84 deg / 7 deg on axis biconic and a spherically blunted, 12. 84 deg/ 7 deg <b>bent</b> <b>nose</b> biconic at Mach 6 in air were measured. The angle of attack, referenced to {{the axis of}} aft cone, was varied from 0 deg to 25 deg in nominal 5 deg increments. Two values of free stream Reynolds number based on model length were tested. Predictions from simple, theories and from a supersonic, three dimensional, external invsicid code (STEIN) are compared with measured values. Predicted STEIN shock shapes and windward pressures are in agreement with measured values for both biconics over the present range of angle of attack...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHaploinsufficiency of Eu{{chromatin}} histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT 1), a chromatin modifying enzyme, is {{the cause}} of Kleefstra syndrome (KS). KS is an intellectual disability (ID) syndrome, with general developmental delay, hypotonia, and craniofacial dysmorphisms as additional core features. Recent studies have been focused on the role of EHMT 1 in learning and memory, linked to the ID phenotype of KS patients. In this study we used the Ehmt 1 +/− mouse model, and investigated whether the core features of KS were mimicked in these mice. When comparing Ehmt 1 +/− mice to wildtype littermates we observed delayed postnatal growth, eye opening, ear opening, and upper incisor eruption, indicating a delayed postnatal development. Furthermore, tests for muscular strength and motor coordination showed features of hypotonia in young Ehmt 1 +/− mice. Lastly, we found that Ehmt 1 +/− mice showed brachycephalic crania, a shorter or <b>bent</b> <b>nose,</b> and hypertelorism, reminiscent of the craniofacial dysmorphisms seen in KS. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed a significant upregulation of the mRNA levels of Runx 2 and several other bone tissue related genes in P 28 Ehmt 1 +/− mice. Runx 2 immunostaining also appeared to be increased. The mRNA upregulation was associated with decreased histone H 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H 3 K 9 me 2) levels, the epigenetic mark deposited by Ehmt 1, in the promoter region of these genes. Together, Ehmt 1 +/− mice indeed recapitulate KS core features and can be used as an animal model for Kleefstra syndrome. The increased expression of bone developmental genes in the Ehmt 1 +/− mice likely contributes to their cranial dysmorphisms and might be explained by diminished Ehmt 1 -induced H 3 K 9 dimethylation...|$|E
5000|$|A {{young horse}} is first {{introduced}} to the movement when {{coming out of a}} corner or a circle on which the horse is already correctly <b>bent,</b> from <b>nose</b> to tail, along the arc of the corner or circle, as it is usually easier to maintain bend than to establish it from a straight line in the young or green (untrained) horse.|$|R
60|$|She {{dismounted}} {{and threw}} the bridle. Her mustang, used to being petted, rubbed his sleek, dark head against her and evidently expected like demonstration in return, but as none was forthcoming he <b>bent</b> his <b>nose</b> to the grass and began grazing. The girl's eyes were intent upon some waving, slender, white-and-blue flowers. They smiled up wanly, like pale stars, out of the long grass that had a tinge of gold.|$|R
60|$|Up {{went the}} cover, and {{a whiff of}} the freshest {{fragrance}} regaled the seven eager <b>noses</b> <b>bent</b> to inhale it, as a general murmur of pleasure greeted the nest of great, rosy mayflowers that lay before them.|$|R

60|$|Meanwhile Toby, {{putting a}} hand on each knee, <b>bent</b> down his <b>nose</b> to the basket, {{and took a long}} {{inspiration}} at the lid; the grin upon his withered face expanding in the process, as if he were inhaling laughing gas.|$|R
50|$|Describing his treatment, Aamer {{said that}} he was {{strapped}} to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. When MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body: his temples, just under his jawline, in the hollow beneath his ears. They <b>bent</b> his <b>nose</b> repeatedly, pinched his thighs and feet. They inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until he screamed and then they cut off his airway and put a mask over him, so he could not cry out.|$|R
60|$|She was {{as strange}} {{an old woman}} as one could hope {{to see in a}} lifetime. Her <b>nose</b> <b>bent</b> down to meet her chin, and her chin bent up to reach her nose; her face was gray with great age, and her hair was as white as snow. She wore a long red cloak over her shoulders, and a great black cat sat {{on the back of her}} chair.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stranger}} went first. When he {{was satisfied}} that he had moved the mountain, they turned back around. Shonkwaia'tison {{was surprised to see}} that the mountain had indeed moved, although only a little bit. [...] "Now it's my turn," [...] Shonkwaia'tison said, and they turned their backs on the mountain once more. There was a commotion and noise behind them, and, out of curiosity, the stranger turned back around before they had agreed to it. Little did he know that Shonkwaia'tison had moved the mountain so close to the stranger's back that when he turned to look he struck his face on it. The force of the impact <b>bent</b> his <b>nose</b> and left one side of his face crooked. At this, the stranger conceded that Shonkwaia'tison was the more powerful of the two, and that he must also be the creator of the land and everything on it.|$|R
60|$|An {{unimportant}} Baniya[FN#87] (trader), Hiranyadatt, had a daughter, {{whose name}} was Madansena Sundari, the beautiful army of Cupid. Her face was like the moon; her hair like the clouds; her eyes {{like those of a}} muskrat; her eyebrows like a <b>bent</b> bow; her <b>nose</b> like a parrot's bill; her neck like that of a dove; her teeth like pomegranate grains; the red colour of her lips like that of a gourd; her waist lithe and bending like the pards: her hands and feet like softest blossoms; her complexion like the jasmine-in fact, day by day the splendour of her youth increased.|$|R
2500|$|All of {{the primary}} {{structure}} was recovered from the seabed. Controls were trimmed near the neutral position. The flaps were in the [...] "UP" [...] position (i.e., retracted). Investigators {{found no evidence that}} the controls were jammed. The left main landing gear leg had become separated during the impact, and the right gear leg was <b>bent</b> aft. The <b>nose</b> gear was <b>bent</b> aft and to the right. Both propellers were recovered and showed similar damage. Both engines were stripped down and examined. They were found to be in similar condition, with valves and other moving parts in good shape. Both engines could be turned when the spark plugs were removed. Both engines, with propellers attached, were found at the northern end of the debris field.|$|R
500|$|A {{series of}} public demonstrations were planned in Australia {{to assist in}} fund-raising, {{the first of which}} was {{scheduled}} for 5 October 1911 at the Cheltenham Racecourse in Adelaide. During a test flight the day before, excessive pressure in the fuel tank caused it to rupture, almost blinding Watkins. That problem resolved, Watkins took Frank Wild, whom Mawson had hired to command a support base during the expedition, on another test flight the morning of the demonstration. In Watkins' account, which he addressed to Vickers' Aviation Department, he wrote: [...] " [...] about 200 ft. up. I got into a fierce tremor, and then into an air pocket, and was brought down about 100 ft., got straight, and dropped into another, almost a vacuum. That finished it. We hit the ground with an awful crash, both wings damaged, one cylinder broken, and the <b>Nose</b> <b>bent</b> up, the tail in half, etc." ...|$|R
6000|$|As to Captain Lydgate himself, his low brow, his aquiline <b>nose</b> <b>bent</b> on one side, and his rather heavy utterance, {{might have}} been disadvantageous in any young gentleman who had not a {{military}} bearing and mustache to give him what is doted on by some flower-like blond heads as [...] "style." [...] He had, moreover, that sort of high-breeding which consists in being free from the petty solicitudes of middle-class gentility, {{and he was a}} great critic of feminine charms. Rosamond delighted in his admiration now even more than she had done at Quallingham, and he found it easy to spend several hours of the day in flirting with her. The visit altogether was one of the pleasantest larks he had ever had, not the less so perhaps because he suspected that his queer cousin Tertius wished him away: though Lydgate, who would rather (hyperbolically speaking) have died than have failed in polite hospitality, suppressed his dislike, and only pretended generally not to hear what the gallant officer said, consigning the task of answering him to Rosamond. For he was not at all a jealous husband, and preferred leaving a feather-headed young gentleman alone with his wife to bearing him company.|$|R
60|$|I {{should like}} to render the sense of my upward {{progress}} dramatic by pretending that we mounted from a zone of flowers at Monte Carlo into regions where only the hardiest blossoms greeted us, but what I really noticed was that by-and-by the little patches of vineyard seemed to grow less and the olive-trees scraggier. Perhaps even this was partly fancy; as for the flowers, I cannot bring myself to partake of their deceit; for {{they are the most}} shameless fakers, as regards climate, in nature. It is, for instance, perfectly true that they are in bloom along the Riviera all winter long, but this does not prove that the winter of the Riviera is always warm. It merely proves that flowers can stand a degree of cold that nips the <b>nose</b> <b>bent</b> to hale their perfume, and brings tears into the eyes dwelling in rapture on their loveliness. They are like women; they look so fragile and delicate that you think they cannot stand anything, but they can stand pretty much everything, or at least everything they wish to. Throughout that week at Monte Carlo, while we cowered round our fires or went out into a frigid sunshine, the flowers smiled from every garden-ground in a gayety emulous of that of their sisters passing in white serge. So probably I gave less attention to the details of the scenery through which my funicular was passing than to the stupendous prospects of sea and shore which it varyingly commanded. If words could paint these I should not spare the words, but when I recall them, my richest treasure of adjectives seems a beggarly array of color tubes, flattened and twisted past all col-lapsibility. Nothing less than an old-fashioned panoramic show would impart any notion of it, and even that must fail where it should most abound, namely, in the delicacy of that ineffable majesty.|$|R
60|$|The {{hair in the}} rector's {{description}} {{was light}} brown and not plentiful. This woman's hair, superbly luxuriant in its growth, was of the one unpardonably remarkable shade of color which the prejudice of the Northern nations never entirely forgives--it was red! The forehead in the rector's description was high, narrow, and sloping backward from the brow; the eyebrows were faintly marked; and the eyes small, and in color either gray or hazel. This woman's forehead was low, upright, and broad toward the temples; her eyebrows, at once strongly and delicately marked, were a shade darker than her hair; her eyes, large, bright, and well opened, were of that purely blue color, without a tinge in it of gray or green, so often presented to our admiration in pictures and books, so rarely met with in the living face. The nose in the rector's description was aquiline. The line of this woman's <b>nose</b> <b>bent</b> neither outward nor inward: it was the straight, delicately molded nose (with the short upper lip beneath) of the ancient statues and busts. The lips in the rector's description were thin and the upper lip long; the complexion was of a dull, sickly paleness; the chin retreating and {{the mark of a}} mole or a scar {{on the left side of}} it. This woman's lips were full, rich, and sensual. Her complexion was the lovely complexion which accompanies such hair as hers--so delicately bright in its rosier tints, so warmly and softly white in its gentler gradations of color on the forehead and the neck. Her chin, round and dimpled, was pure of the slightest blemish in every part of it, and perfectly in line with her forehead to the end. Nearer and nearer, and fairer and fairer she came, in the glow of the morning light--the most startling, the most unanswerable contradiction that eye could see or mind conceive to the description in the rector's letter.|$|R
