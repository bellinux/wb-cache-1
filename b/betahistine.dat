25|$|Medical {{treatment}} with anti-vertigo medications {{may be considered}} in acute, severe exacerbation of BPPV, {{but in most cases}} are not indicated. These primarily include drugs of the anti-histamine and anti-cholinergic class, such as meclizine and hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine) respectively. The medical management of vestibular syndromes has become increasingly popular over the last decade, and numerous novel drug therapies (including existing drugs with new indications) have emerged for the treatment of vertigo/dizziness syndromes. These drugs vary considerably in their mechanisms of action, with many of them being receptor- or ion channel-specific. Among them are <b>betahistine</b> or dexamethasone/gentamicin for the treatment of Ménière's disease, carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine for the treatment of paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, metoprolol/topiramate or valproic acid/tricyclic antidepressant for the treatment of vestibular migraine, and 4-aminopyridine for the treatment of episodic ataxia type 2 and both downbeat and upbeat nystagmus. These drug therapies offer symptomatic treatment, and do not affect the disease process or resolution rate. Medications may be used to suppress symptoms during the positioning maneuvers if the patient's symptoms are severe and intolerable. More dose-specific studies are required, however, {{in order to determine the}} most effective drug(s) for both acute symptom relief and long-term remission of the condition.|$|E

Different drugs, such as vestibular suppressants for the relief of acute vertigo attacks and vestibular compensation stimulants for rehabilitation treatment, are used to treat vestibular vertigo. Drug therapy in combination with vestibular exercises is effective in patients with vestibular neuronitis, Meniere's disease, so is that with therapeutic maneuvers in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

50|$|<b>Betahistine</b> {{comes in}} both a tablet form {{as well as}} an oral solution, and is taken orally. It is rapidly and {{completely}} absorbed. The mean plasma half-life is 3-4 hours, and excretion is virtually complete in the urine within 24 hours. Plasma protein binding is very low. <b>Betahistine</b> is transformed into aminoethylpyridine and hydroxyethylpyridine and excreted with the urine as pyridylacetic acid. There is some evidence that one of these metabolites, aminoethylpyridine, may be active and exert effects similar to those of <b>betahistine</b> on ampullar receptors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Betahistine</b> {{may also}} cause several digestive-related side effects. The package insert for Serc, a trade name for <b>betahistine,</b> states that {{patients}} may experience several gastrointestinal side effects. These may include nausea, upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramping. These symptoms {{are usually not}} serious and subside between doses. Patients experiencing chronic digestive problems may lower their dose to the minimum effective range and by taking <b>betahistine</b> with meals.

50|$|More importantly, <b>betahistine</b> has a {{powerful}} antagonistic effects at H3 receptors, thereby increasing the levels of neurotransmitters histamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA released from the nerve endings. The increased amounts of histamine released from histaminergic nerve endings can stimulate receptors. This stimulation explains the potent vasodilatory effects of <b>betahistine</b> in the inner ear, that are well documented.|$|E
5000|$|Patients taking <b>betahistine</b> {{dihydrochloride}} {{may experience}} several hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. In the November 2006 issue of [...] "Drug Safety," [...] Dr. Sabine Jeck-Thole and Dr. Wolfgang Wagner reported that <b>betahistine</b> dihydrochloride may cause several allergic and skin-related side effects. These include rash {{in several areas}} of the body; itching and hives; and swelling of the face, tongue and mouth. Other hypersensitivity reactions reported include tingling, numbness, burning sensations, shortness of breath and laboured breathing. The study authors suggest that hypersensitivity reactions may be {{a direct result of}} betahistine's role in increasing histamine levels throughout the body. Hypersensitivity reactions quickly subside after <b>betahistine</b> has been discontinued.|$|E

It was first registered in Europe in 1970 {{for the treatment}} of Ménière's disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Betahistine</b> has two {{mechanisms}} of action. Primarily, it a full agonist on the H1 receptors located on {{blood vessels in}} the inner ear. This gives rise to local vasodilation and increased permeability, which helps to reverse the underlying problem of endolymphatic hydrops.|$|E

[...] These patients {{have not been able}} to undergo vestibular compensation and are left with long-term attacks of vertigo. By administering <b>betahistine</b> to the damaged nerve over a long period of time, the process of vestibular compensation can be accelerated to alleviate symptoms. Patients can also learn strategies to recover their balance through physical therapy.|$|E
50|$|People taking <b>betahistine</b> may {{experience}} several other side effects ranging from mild to serious. The package insert for Serc states that patients {{may experience}} nervous-system side effects, including headache. Some nervous system events may also partly {{be attributable to}} the underlying condition rather than the medication used to treat it. The study by Jeck-Thole and Wagner also reports that patients may experience headache and liver problems, including increased liver enzymes and bile-flow disturbances. Any side effects that persist or outweigh the relief of symptoms of the original condition may warrant that the patient consult their physician to adjust or change the medication.|$|E

Eleven Italian centres enrolled 144 patients: 75 of the patients were treated with <b>betahistine</b> (41 MD/ 34 PPV) and 69 with placebos (40 MD/ 29 PPV). The <b>betahistine</b> dosage was 16 mg twice per day for 3 months. Compared to the placebo, <b>betahistine</b> had a significant effect on the frequency, intensity and duration of vertigo attacks.

40|$|Olanzapine is {{effective}} at treating multiple domains of schizophrenia symptoms. However, it induces serious metabolic side effects. Antipsychotic drug’s antagonistic affinity to histamine H 1 receptors {{has been identified}} as a main contributor for weight gain/obesity side effects. This study therefore investigated whether a combined treatment of <b>betahistine</b> (a H 1 receptor agonist and H 3 receptor antagonist) could reduce the body weight/obesity induced by olanzapine. Female Sprague Dawley rats were treated orally with olanzapine (1 mg/kg, t. i. d.) and/or <b>betahistine</b> (2. 67 mg/kg, t. i. d.), or vehicle for two weeks. Rats treated with olanzapine exhibited significant body weight gain and increased food intake. Co-treatment of olanzapine with <b>betahistine</b> significantly prevented (- 45 %) weight gain and reduced feeding efficiency compared to sole olanzapine treatment. <b>Betahistine</b> treatment alone had no effect on weight gain and food intake. Olanzapine reduced locomotor activity, but not <b>betahistine.</b> These findings demonstrate that olanzapine-induced body weight gain can partially be reduced by co-treatment with <b>betahistine.</b> <b>Betahistine</b> has H 3 receptor antagonistic effects to increase histamine release, which may augment its direct agonistic effects on H 1 receptors. These findings have important implications for clinical trials using <b>betahistine</b> to control antipsychotic-induced obesity side effects...|$|E
40|$|<b>Betahistine</b> is a {{medicine}} {{used to treat}} vestibular disorders that has also been used to treat tinnitus. AIM: To assess the effects of <b>betahistine</b> on tinnitus in patients with vestibular disorders.

Patients included had received <b>betahistine</b> 48 mg/day and clinical outcomes were compared with a control group comprising individuals who were unable to receive <b>betahistine</b> due to gastritis, ulcers, pregnancy, asthma or hypersensitivity to the drug. Patients underwent control of any aggravating factors and also standard vestibular exercises as a basis for treatment. The intensity, frequency and duration of tinnitus were assessed {{on the first day of}} dosing and after 120 days of treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Betahistine</b> is a {{histamine}} H(1) -receptor agonist and H(3) -receptor antagonist that {{is administered}} to treat Menière's disease. Despite widespread use, its pharmacological {{mode of action}} has not been entirely elucidated. This study investigated the effect of <b>betahistine</b> on guinea pigs at dosages corresponding to clinically used doses for cochlear microcirculation. METHODS: Thirty healthy Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs {{were randomly assigned to}} five groups to receive <b>betahistine</b> dihydrochloride in a dose of 1, 000 mg/kg b. w. (milligram per kilogram body weight), 0. 100 mg/kg b. w., 0. 010 mg/kg b. w., 0. 001 mg/kg b. w. in NaCl 0. 9 % or NaCl 0. 9 % alone as placebo. Cochlear blood flow and mean arterial pressure were continuously monitored by intravital fluorescence microscopy and invasive blood pressure measurements 3 minutes before and 15 minutes after administration of <b>betahistine.</b> RESULTS: When <b>betahistine</b> was administered in a dose of 1. 000 mg/kg b. w. cochlear blood flow was increased to a peak value of 1. 340 arbitrary units (SD: 0. 246; range: 0. 933 - 1. 546 arb. units) compared to baseline (p< 0. 05; Two Way Repeated Measures ANOVA/Bonferroni t-test). The lowest dosage of 0. 001 mg/kg b. w. <b>betahistine</b> or NaCl 0. 9 % had the same effect as placebo. Nonlinear regression revealed that there was a sigmoid correlation between increase in blood flow and dosages. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Betahistine</b> has a dose-dependent effect on the increase of blood flow in cochlear capillaries. The effects of the dosage range of <b>betahistine</b> on cochlear microcirculation corresponded well to clinically used single dosages to treat Menière's disease. Our data suggest that the improved effects of higher doses of <b>betahistine</b> in the treatment of Menière's disease might be due to a corresponding increase of cochlear blood flow...|$|E
40|$|<b>Betahistine</b> {{has been}} used to treat several {{vestibular}} disorders of both central and peripheral origin. The objective of this work was to study the action of <b>betahistine</b> in the vestibular endorgans. Experiments were done in wild larval axolotl (Ambystoma tigrinum). Multiunit extracellular recordings were obtained from the semicircular canal nerve using a suction electrode. <b>Betahistine</b> (10 M to 10 mM; n= 32) inhibited the basal spike discharge of the vestibular afferent neurons with an IC 50 of 600 M. To define the site of action of <b>betahistine,</b> its interactions with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (3 M) and with the cholinergic antagonists atropine (10 M; n= 3) and d-tubocurarine (10 M; n= 3) were studied. The action of <b>betahistine</b> when co-administered with these drugs was the same as that in control experiments, indicating that its effects did not include nitric oxide production or the activation of cholinergic receptors. In contrast, 0. 01 – 1 mM <b>betahistine</b> reduced the excitatory action of kainic acid (10 M; n= 6) and quiscualic acid (1 M; n= 13). These results indicate that the action of <b>betahistine</b> on the spike discharge of afferent neurons seems to be due to a post-synaptic inhibitory action on the primary afferent neuron response to the hair cell neurotransmitter.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in Meniere's disease patients who underwent a curative unilateral vestibular neurotomy (UVN). The effects of <b>betahistine</b> treatment were investigated on a broad spectrum of vestibular-induced changes resulting from vestibular loss: body sway, head orientation, ocular cyclotorsion, spontaneous nystagmus, verticality perception, and self-evaluation of the postural stability. The time course of the recovery was compared in 16 patients who received either a placebo or <b>betahistine</b> (24 mg b. i. d.) from 3 days up to 3 months after UVN. Patients were examined before (day - 1) and after UVN (days 7, 30, and 90).
