50|$|The huge {{expanse of}} the Makgadikgadi Pans is bigger than Switzerland. Once a large river-fed lake, the Makgadikgadi Pans now lie saline and empty. The pans are {{littered}} with stone tools and artefacts dated from between 2,000 and 500,000 years old. During the wet season 35-75,000 zebra and wildebeest migrate into the area with regular sightings of lion, cheetah and other predators who follow in their wake. The zebra and wildebeest migration across the pans is southern Africa’s last surviving zebra and wildebeest migration and the second largest in the world. Hundreds of thousands of flamingo also appear to feed {{as long as the}} water lasts. The pans are also a permanent haven for desert species such as the meerkat and the elusive <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena,</b> the third rarest carnivore in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Nile {{crocodiles}} {{on occasion}} prey on big cats, especially lions. Even large male cats are helpless if caught off-guard and {{hit with a}} crippling powerful crocodile bite. Most confirmed attacks on lions and leopards occur within Kruger National Park, where in some studies [...] "several" [...] have reportedly been taken, {{as well as the}} adjacent Londolozi Private Game Reserve, where a male lion who took control with his brother of the oft-televised [...] "Styx pride" [...] was preyed upon by a crocodile. However, felines are usually more intelligent and wary of their surroundings than prey species and are more difficult to catch since they usually avoid waters infested with crocodiles. In order to save energy, crocodiles do not prefer such agile animals, as most attacks will end before they can strike. This might explain why lions are targeted more frequently than the more agile leopards. Thus they usually attack agile prey in the absence of regular prey items. Other large carnivores that dwell in Africa {{near the top of the}} food chain can also on occasion fall prey to crocodiles. Such predators that can find themselves victim to crocodiles include hyenas (3 out of 4 species reported as prey for Nile crocodiles, only the desert-dwelling <b>brown</b> (<b>Hyaena</b> brunnea) being excluded), African wild dogs, jackals, and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus).|$|E

40|$|Interactions between apex and mesopredators {{and their}} impacts on prey populations {{have been well}} documented, while the {{influence}} of apex predators such as lions on carrion availability and the subsequent impacts at lower trophic levels are not fully understood. Here we assess dietary overlap between two sympatric carnivores (<b>brown</b> <b>hyaena,</b> Parahyaena brunnea, and black-backed jackal, Canis mesomelas) in neighbouring reserves with and without apex predators (lions, Panthera leo,and wild dog, Lycaon pictus). We investigate whether apex predators facilitate niche partitioning between mesocarnivores by creating additional scavenging opportunities through predatory activity. We found that <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> density was higher in the area with apex predators, while black-backed jackal density was higher in the area without apex predators. Black-backed jackal scats contained broadly similar dietary items at both sites, while large mammal remains occurred significantly more frequently in <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> scats collected inthe presence of apex predators. In the absence of apex predators there was a markedly higher degree of overlap between <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> and jackal diets, suggesting increased levels of inter-specific competition.

40|$|Brown hyaenas (Hyaena brunnea) were {{introduced}} to Shamwari Game Reserve in the Eastern Cape Province during 2002, but their feeding ecology is poorly understood. Feeding observations of <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> by field guides and the collection of 31 scats from the study area took place over an 11 month period. Standard techniques were used to analyse the scats and identify prey items present. Ten dietary categories were identified from the scats, {{with a mean of}} 3. 2 dietary categories per scat.  Large mammal remains were found in 30 of the 31 scats, with kudu being the most abundant (61. 0 % of scats). Overall the two methods indicated at least 14 mammal species being fed on by the <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena.</b> The presence of mainly large mammal remains and invertebrates (in 38. 7 % of all scats), together with the feeding observations of mainly large mammals by field guides, suggests that <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> in Shamwari are mainly scavengers and that sufficient carrion is available, thereby reducing the need for them to hunt. A 52. 0 % occurrence of plant matter was found in the scats, suggesting that plant material is an important component of their diet.

40|$|As many {{carnivores}} occur outside protected areas, {{they are}} vulnerable to anthropogenic threats. In South Africa, the largest proportion of the distribution range of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) is outside protected areas along the northern border of the country. Lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) have been extirpated from these areas, leaving the depauperate carnivore guild dominated by cheetahs, leopards (Panthera pardus) and <b>brown</b> <b>hyaenas</b> (Hyaena brunnea). To determine how cheetahs use these areas, tracking collars were fitted to nine individuals from September 2003 to July 2009 in the Thabazimbi area, Limpopo, South Africa.

40|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> Hyaena brunnea is a near {{threatened}} large carnivore inhabiting sub-Saharan Africa. Like {{many other}} species of terrestrial carnivores, brown hyaenas often and repeatedly deposit scats at specific latrine sites {{as a means of}} olfactory communication. However, previous studies on <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> latrine use have been constrained to the arid Kalahari region in southern Africa, an area of low resource abundance. To improve our understanding of geographic variation in the biology of this species, we monitored patterns of <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> scat deposition in the Waterberg of northern South Africa, an area of higher net productivity than previous areas for published <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> studies. Defecation rates at latrine sites were low in our study area (median: < 1 defecation in 30 days), but brown hyaenas visited sites significantly more often than they defecated at them (median: 2. 6 visits/ 30 days). The temporal patterns of activity at defecation sites were significantly related to the overall temporal activity patterns of brown hyaenas on the roads within the reserve, and generally confirmed a nocturnal activity pattern in the species. Our result on <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> scat deposition in the Waterberg region indicates a geographic variation in latrine use, and we suggest that such a variation could be linked to resource-driven variation in social and spatial organisation.

40|$|Global {{biodiversity}} {{is declining}} at an unprecedented rate, principally {{as a consequence}} of increasing human population. Effects of this expansion are exemplified by the extent to which many carnivores are now in conflict with humans, particularly in unprotected rangelands. One such species is the <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> (Parahyaena brunnea), classified as 'Near Threatened' (Wiesel et al., 2008). The IUCN SSC hyaenid specialist group identified that <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> are under threat due to human persecution and noted that greater understanding of their distribution and abundance is needed. With the principal aim of assessing the distribution and abundance of <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> in South Africa, this study responds to that challenge. Five specific objectives were established: to utilise local knowledge to map the distribution of carnivores across South Africa; to determine the factors driving attitudes and perceptions of South African farmers to carnivores; to determine differences in relative abundance of carnivores in protected areas compared to unprotected in the North West and Limpopo Provinces; to compare home range estimates and movement patterns of free living <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> inside and outside protected areas in the same provinces; to determine what variables influence <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> home range size. Distribution of <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> and other carnivores, and attitudes to them, were determined using a web-based questionnaire involving multiple stakeholder groups. The results confirmed current knowledge on carnivore distributions but, critically, revealed wider distribution of <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> and other key species than are currently known by IUCN (2013). Responses demonstrated that cultural group and land use type significantly affected attitudes towards all carnivores, with Afrikaans livestock farmers demonstrating the most overtly negative attitudes to all carnivore species. An encouraging finding was that 25 % of land owner respondents had positive attitudes to brown hyaenas and were therefore likely to be well disposed to engaging in conservation activities. Further information on the abundance and movement ecology of <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> was gained through an intensive field study in the North West and Limpopo Provinces, which are under-researched. The study was conducted in protected and unprotected areas since brown hyaenas are found in both but are subject to different pressures. The use of remote camera traps demonstrated that the relative abundance of <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> was four times lower in unprotected areas than in the protected areas. A significant finding was that mesopredators showed higher relative abundances in the unprotected areas. This suggests probable further human-wildlife conflict if mesopredator release continues to occur. Low levels of abundance in the unprotected areas, in conjunction with persecution, led to the conclusion that conservation efforts should be focused here. GPS collars were used to determine differences between <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> home range across the protected and unprotected areas, to gain insights into their habitat use, and to establish their movement patterns through the fragmented landscape. The study demonstrated that home range sizes in the unprotected areas were not only significantly smaller than in the protected areas but also substantially smaller than those found across the entire hyaena’s range. Reasons for the variation are suspected to be higher levels of persecution and greater biomass availability outside the protected areas in conjunction with the relatively high density of apex predators inside the protected areas. In conclusion, large carnivore research is critically required outside protected areas where carnivores are currently involved in the most conflict and are at the greatest risk...|$|E
40|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> (Hyaena brunnea) is {{the least}} known of the large predators of {{southern}} Africa. The current IUCN status of the <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> is “Near Threatened”, and there are conservation concerns related to {{a general lack of}} biological knowledge of the species. For instance, a better knowledge of the responses to environmental and social stressors would improve our abilities to sustainably manage <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> populations in both captive and free-ranging environments. We conducted adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) challenges in one female and one male adult <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> at Lion Park Zoo, South Africa, to validate measurements of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM) in <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> faeces via an enzyme linked immunoassay (EIA). We also measured gastrointestinal transit times (GIT times) and the GCM degradation in faeces left in ambient temperature for up to 32 hours to more reliably assess the use of this assay as a tool for non-invasive glucocorticoid measurements. Intramuscular injections of synthetic ACTH yielded GCM levels of 388 % (female) and 2682 % (male) above baseline with peak increases occurring 25 - 40 hours post injection. The time delay of faecal GCM excretion approximately corresponded with food transit time in the brown hyaenas. Faecal GCM levels declined significantly over time since defecation. Our results provided a good validation that faecal GCM's accurately reflects circulating glucocorticoid stress hormones in brown hyaenas, but we highlight that samples have to be frozen immediately after defecation to avoid bias in the measurements due to bacterial degredation.

40|$|Human {{population}} growth is causing an increase in habitat transformation on a global scale, and this transformation is driven by changes in land-use practices. One consequence of habitat transformation is the negative effect it can have on mammal communities, especially carnivores. Carnivores are important components of ecosystems as they play an essential structuring role, but also often come into conflict with people. I studied the impact of land-use on mammalian diversity, the attitudes of landowners/managers towards carnivores, the distribution of carnivores, and the interactions among carnivore species in the Fish-Kowie corridor (FKC), an area of conservation concern, in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Livestock and game farming are the two dominant land-use types in the FKC. Carnivore distribution data were collected between 2012 and 2014 using a robust camera trap survey that consisted of 432 camera stations (216 on livestock and 216 on game farms). In addition, the attitudes of 55 landowners/managers were assessed using semi- structured questionnaire interviews that were conducted in person. My results revealed that mammal diversity was similar on the two land-use types. However, individual species differed in their distribution on the two land-use types. In general, both livestock and game farmers had negative attitudes towards carnivores in the FKC, due to their depredation of valuable livestock and game species. Black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas), caracals (Caracal caracal), leopards (Panthera pardus), and <b>brown</b> <b>hyaenas</b> (Parahyaena brunnea) were considered the most problematic carnivores, but sensitivity to land-use varied among these four species. Black- backed jackals had the highest occupancy rates of all four predators and were 3. 8 {{times more likely to}} occupy sites on game farms compared to livestock farms. By contrast, leopards and <b>brown</b> <b>hyaenas</b> were only detected on game farms, and caracals {{did not appear to be}} sensitive to the effects of land-use. In general, the interactions among carnivores were weak and were likely driven by carnivore diversity, resource partitioning, and anthropogenic pressures. While there were many subtle differences in the distribution of mammal species and human attitudes towards wildlife on livestock and game farms in the FKC, there were also many similarities. My study has produced results that can be used by the FKC community to better understand how mammals and humans interact across the landscape, information that will ultimately contribute to future conservation planning in the area...|$|R
40|$|We used scat {{analysis}} {{to study the}} diet of two sympatric medium-sized carnivores: <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> and black-backed jackal, in the NorthWest Province of South Africa.

Jackal scats contained a higher proportion of small mammal remains, suggesting that jackals actively hunted more often than brown hyaenas did. The diets differed significantly between the two species, even though diet overlap was fairly high (0. 79). Further analysis, albeit based on small sample sizes, suggests that diet of these mesopredators differ between protected reserves with apex predators and unprotected areas without apex predators, thus confounding generalizations.

40|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> (Parahyaena brunnea) is {{endemic to}} {{southern}} Africa.

Our objectives were to use a stratified approach to collate available data and to collect more data to assess <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> distribution and density across land uses in Botswana. We conducted surveys using track counts, camera traps and questionnaires and collated our results and available data to estimate the <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> population based on the stratification of Botswana for large carnivores. Brown hyaenas occur over 533 050 km² (92 %) of Botswana. Our density estimates ranged from 0 brown hyaenas/ 100 km² in strata of northern Botswana to 2. 94 (2. 16 – 3. 71) brown hyaenas/ 100 km² in the southern stratum of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. We made assumptions regarding densities in strata that lacked data, using the best references available. We estimated the <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> population in Botswana as 4642 (3133 – 5993) animals, with 6. 8 % {{of the population in}} the Northern Conservation Zone, 73. 1 % in the Southern Conservation Zone, 2. 0 % in the smaller conservation zones and 18. 1 % in the agricultural zones. The similar densities of brown hyaenas in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve and the Ghanzi farms highlight the potential of agricultural areas in Botswana to conserve this species. The conservation of brown hyaenas in the agricultural landscape of Botswana is critical for the long-term conservation of the species; these areas provide important links between populations in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Conservation implications: Botswana contains the core of the <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> population in southern Africa, and conflict mitigation on agricultural land is crucial to maintaining connectivity among the range countries. </p...|$|E

However, occupancy surveys offer a potentially efficient and robust means of assessing <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> populations. We evaluate the efficacy of camera trapping for estimating <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> occupancy, and the effect of environmental variables and lures on detection probability. We estimated population density in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa, at 2. 8 / 100 km 2, occupancy at 1. 0 and model-averaged detection probability at 0. 1. Using a fish lure increased detection probability to 0. 2 and significantly increased encounter rates.

40|$|Humans {{and brown}} hyaenas (Hyaena brunnea) {{frequently}} interact within a shifting landscape {{of conflict and}} cohabitation, yet the social and biological dimensions of these relationships, particularly in montane environments, are rarely studied. This interdisciplinary thesis investigates how attitudes and perceptions towards brown hyaenas vary between different socio-economic groups within a postcolonial framework, and how these perceptions relate to <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> occupancy, density, spatial ecology, and diet. This study, {{which is based in}} and around the Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa, uses interviews, participant observation, camera traps, GPS telemetry, and scat analysis. Members of three socio-economic groups ascribe acceptable behavioural and geographic expectations to predators. Violation of these expectations by predators strip power from people and reduce acceptance levels towards them. Regaining power and mimicking concepts of colonial domination over land are key themes in human-predator relationships. Although the brown hyaena’s elusive nature and people’s strong abhorrence towards leopards (Panthera pardus) partially protects hyaenas from attracting attention as a problem animal, anthropogenic threats still abound. The most important factor determining <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> occupancy is avoiding high human activity. Despite anthropogenic risks and due to their large home ranges (95. 04 km 2 – 169. 79 km 2) and dietary adaptability, brown hyaenas occupy 79 % of the area surveyed. Brown hyaenas have a varied diet, which includes 48 different species. All signs suggest food acquisition through scavenging. This finding is corroborated by a high overlap with leopard diet. With lower human activity and plentiful scavenging opportunities, mountains provide a safe haven for brown hyaenas. A robust <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> density between 2. 56 – 3. 63 per 100 km 2 occurs in the Soutpansberg Mountains. Recommendations to promote coexistence with hyaenas include greater education about <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> ecology and their ecosystem services, non-lethal conflict mitigation, and the inclusion of people from diverse socio-economic backgrounds in conservation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was identification and molecular characterisation of piroplasms and rickettsias occurring in brown (Parahyaena brunnea) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) from various localities in Namibia and South Africa.

PCR products of 52 / 62 (83. 9 %) of the specimens hybridized only with the Theileria/Babesia genus-specific probes and not with any of the species-specific probes, suggesting the presence of a novel species or variant of a species. No Ehrlichia and/or Anaplasma species DNA could be detected. Parasite 18 S rRNA gene of brown (n= 3) and spotted hyaena (n= 6) specimens was subsequently amplified, cloned and the recombinants sequenced. Homologous sequence searches of databases indicated that the obtained sequences were most closely related to B. lengau, originally described from cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Observed sequence similarities were subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic analyses which showed that the obtained hyaena sequences formed a monophyletic group with B. lengau, B. conradae and sequences previously isolated from humans and wildlife in the western USA. Within the B. lengau clade, the obtained sequences and the published B. lengau sequences grouped into six distinct groups, of which groups I to V represented novel B. lengau genotypes and/or gene variants. We suggest that these genotypes cannot be classified as new Babesia species, but rather as variants of B. lengau.

40|$|Changing {{land use}} {{patterns}} in southern Africa have potential to dramatically alter {{the prospects for}} carnivore conservation. Understanding these influences is essential for conservation planning. We interviewed 250 ranchers in Namibia to assess human tolerance towards {{and the distribution of}} large carnivores. Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), leopards (Panthera pardus) and <b>brown</b> <b>hyaenas</b> (Hyaena brunnea) were widely distributed on Namibian farmlands, spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) had a narrower distribution, and wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) and lions (Panthera leo) are largely limited to areas near source populations. Farmers were most tolerant of leopards and least tolerant of lions, wild dogs and spotted hyaenas. Several factors relating to land use correlated consistently with carnivore-presence and landowner tolerance. Carnivores were more commonly present and/or tolerated where; wildlife diversity and biomass were higher; income from wildlife was higher; income from livestock was lower; livestock biomass was lower; in conservancies; game fencing was absent; and financial losses from livestock depredation were lower. Efforts to create conditions whereby the costs associated with carnivores are lowest, and which confer financial value to them are likely to be the most effective means of promoting carnivore conservation. Such conditions are achieved where land owners pool land to create conservancies where livestock are replaced with wildlife (or where livestock husbandry is improved) and where wildlife generates a significant proportion of ranch income. Additional measures, such as promoting improved livestock husbandry and educational outreach efforts may also help achieve coexistence with carnivores. Our findings provide insights into conditions more conducive to the persistence of and tolerance towards large carnivores might be increased on private (and even communal) lands in Namibia, elsewhere in southern and East Africa {{and other parts of the}} world where carnivore conservation is being attempted on private lands.

40|$|The {{collecting}} behaviour {{of specific}} animals is increasingly becoming {{of interest to}} a variety of scientific disciplines. Collectors {{can be found in the}} rodent and carnivore mammal populations, as well as certain avian species. Of the carnivores it is hyaenids and leopards (Panthera pardus) that appear to be the most prolific collectors of faunal remains. Of the four species in the hyaena family, three are known to collect various quantities of faunal material in their prospective dens; they are spotted <b>hyaenas</b> (Crocuta crocuta), <b>brown</b> <b>hyaenas</b> (Parahyaena brunnea) and striped hyaenas (Hyaena hyaena). The question surrounding the collector of faunal remains in the archaeological record is as important as it is old. This is an in depth examination of the bone collections of all three extant hyaenids and the related taphonomy corresponding to each species. New collections were made from various dens and locations in southern Africa for both Parahyaena and Crocuta. Additionally previous collections of Parahyaena were reanalysed and data from Hyaena collections in Jordan reviewed. In all a total of 23, 324 bones and bone fragments were examined during this study, specifically looking at species collected, skeletal elements, minimum number of individuals (MNI), number of identified specimens (NISP), fusion data, fragmentation, weathering and an assortment of taphonomic characteristics. Specific taphonomic characteristics recorded were crenulated edges, striations, punctate depressions and punctures, scouring, acid etching and all combinations thereof. The main thrust of this research is to determine if hyaenids in general can be positively identified from other collectors as the collector of a specific assemblage of faunal remains and to determine if the three species of hyaena can be distinguished from one another by studying the faunal collections alone.

40|$|Carnivore survey {{protocols}} that properly address {{spatial sampling}} and detectability issues are seldom feasible at a landscape-scale. This limits knowledge of large-scale patterns in distribution, abundance and their underlying determinants, hindering conservation of globally threatened carnivore populations. Occupancy {{analysis of data}} from logistically efficient sign surveys along consecutive road segments (spatially auto-correlated replicates) offers a potential solution. We adapted and applied this newly-developed method over 62, 979 km 2 of human-modified land in South Africa. Our aims were to (1) generate unbiased estimates of <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> occupancy and abundance (2) investigate two suspected determinants of occupancy {{using a combination of}} biological and socio-economic sampling techniques, and (3) use simulations to evaluate the effort required for abundance and occupancy estimates with acceptable bias, precision and power. <b>Brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> occupancy was estimated at 0. 748 (±SE 0. 1), and estimated overall density in agricultural land (0. 15 / 100 km 2, ±SE 0. 08) was an order of magnitude lower than in protected areas. Positive attitudes to carnivores and presence of wildlife farms exerted strong positive effects on occupancy, so changes in these factors may well exert monotonic impacts on local metapopulation status. Producing reliable occupancy and abundance estimates would requireP 6 replicates andP 12 replicates per site respectively. Detecting 50 % and 30 % declines in <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> occupancy with adequate power would require five annual surveys at P 65 sites and P 125 sites respectively. Our results suggest that protocols based on spatially auto-correlated sign survey replicates could be used to monitor carnivore populations at large, and possibly even country-wide spatial scales...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} scale pattern and cross sectional morphology of hair to identify fossil hairs from Parahyaena brunnea (<b>brown</b> <b>hyaena)</b> coprolites, from Gladysvale cave in the Sterkfontein Valley, South Africa. The coprolites {{are part of a}} <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> latrine preserved in calcified cave sediment dated to the Middle Pleistocene (257 - 195 ka). Forty-eight fossil hairs were extracted from a 75 x 30 x 15 cm block using fine tweezers and a binocular microscope. They were ultrasonic cleaned in analar ethanol and examined using scanning electron microscopy. Hair identification was based on consultation of standard guides to hair identification and comparison with my own collection of samples of previously undocumented guard hairs, from 15 taxa of indigenous southern African mammals. Samples were taken from the back of pelts curated at the Johannesburg Zoo and Ditsong National Museum of Natural History in Tshwane (formerly Transvaal Museum, Pretoria). Based on the fossil hairs identified here, this research has established that brown hyaenas shared the Sterkfontein Valley with warthog, impala, zebra, kudu and black wildebeest. These animals are associated with savanna grasslands, much like the Highveld environment of today. Fossil human hair was also noted in the coprolites. These findings provide a new source of information, on the local Middle Pleistocene fossil mammal community, and insight into the environment in which archaic and modern humans in the interior of the African subcontinent lived. Amid a scarce fossil and archaeological record for this time period, these results make a significant contribution to the ongoing debate about the role of climate change in the evolution and success of modern humans. In accordance with modern <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> feeding behaviour, the presence of medium to large-sized mammal hairs in the coprolites suggests the co-existence of large feline predators in the area, or a period of active hunting, based on the behaviour of modern brown hyaenas when rearing cubs...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of carnivore population status is frequently hindered by insufficient distribution data. For northern South Africa we address this deficit by mapping new records from landscape-scale sign surveys, questionnaire interviews, problem animal records and camera trapping. The black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas and caracal Caracal caracal remain common and widespread. Ranges of the serval Leptailurus serval and <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> Hyaena brunnea were {{much larger than}} previous estimates, {{reducing the risk of}} simultaneous extirpation across all occupied locations. The proportion of range area occupied was larger for several species, notably the leopard Panthera pardus, cheetah Acinonyx jubatus and serval. We conclude that the serval continues to recover from historical threats and is expanding into new areas. A larger <b>brown</b> <b>hyaena</b> range and less fragmented pattern of occurrence probably confers greater resilience to threats than was suggested by previous data. Reduced extinction risk arising from the increased area occupied by the cheetah and leopard is tempered by probable local range contraction. Our maps provide baseline information for monitoring the distribution of these six species, which is essential in managing ecological issues that have a spatial component such as responses to changing land use. Our results also demonstrate the utility of detection/nondetection surveys in rapid {{assessment of}} carnivore populations at large spatial scales. [URL]...|$|E
25|$|The {{striped hyena}} (Hyaena hyaena) may have evolved from H. namaquensis of Pliocene Africa. Striped hyena fossils {{are common in}} Africa, with records going {{back as far as}} the Middle Pleistocene and even to the Villafranchian. As fossil striped hyenas are absent from the Mediterranean region, {{it is likely that the}} species is a {{relatively}} late invader to Eurasia, having likely spread outside Africa only after the extinction of spotted hyenas in Asia at the end of the Ice Age. The striped hyena occurred for some time in Europe during the Pleistocene, having been particularly widespread in France and Germany. It also occurred in Montmaurin, Hollabrunn in Austria, the Furninha Cave in Portugal and the Genista Caves in Gibraltar. The European form was similar in appearance to modern populations, but was larger, being comparable in size to the <b>brown</b> hyena (<b>Hyaena</b> brunnea).|$|R
40|$|Remotely {{operated}} cameras (camera traps) {{have become}} an indispensable tool for many ecologists, particularly those studying rare and elusive animals. A plethora of camera trap makes and models are now commercially available, yet the effects of their varying design features on {{the quality and quantity}} of data recorded remains principally unknown. Better understanding of differing camera trap designs is needed before adequate management policies can be implemented, especially when the aim is to protect vulnerable and endangered species such as many carnivores. Habitat loss and human conflict has prompted worldwide declines of apex predator populations. Following this, many smaller predators have undergone population ‘explosions’ due to the lack of top-down forcing, a phenomenon known as mesopredator release. Land use changes in the Eastern Cape of South Africa have caused extensive degradation and fragmentation of the Subtropical Thicket Biome. In addition, coupled with anthropogenic persecution, apex predators including lions (Panthera leo), leopards (P. pardus), and <b>brown</b> <b>hyaenas</b> (Hyaena brunnea) have been extirpated from large areas of their historic range. Removal of these apex predators may provide opportunity for mesopredators, such as black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) and caracals (Caracal caracal), to be released from top-down forcing and possibly initiate trophic cascade effects. Therefore, using randomly distributed camera traps, my study aimed to explore {{the quality and quantity of}} data collected by different camera trap designs, and to investigate the mesopredator release hypothesis in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. A total of 2, 989 trap nights was used to compare camera trap designs. Camera traps with narrow detection zones and fast trigger speeds (≤ 0. 25 seconds) recorded a higher diversity of carnivores, but there was no significant difference in the relative abundances of carnivore species recorded by different camera trap models. A total of 19, 659 trap nights was used to assess mesopredator relative abundance, occupancy, distribution and daily activity patterns at one site with, and one site without, apex predators. Consistent with the mesopredator release hypothesis, black-backed jackal relative abundance was significantly higher in the absence of apex predators, and this was supported by occupancy analyses. Further, black-backed jackal distribution was significantly concentrated in areas where apex predator activity was low, possibly indicating spatial avoidance. There was no significant difference in caracal relative abundance, occupancy, distribution, or daily activity between sites. These results provide the first indication of mesopredator release of blackbacked jackals in the Eastern Cape. The implications of black-backed jackal release including prey population structure, local extinctions, altered seed dispersal and disease dynamics are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background] Over {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} interest on the chronology, distribution and mammal taxonomy (including hominins) related with the faunal turnovers that took place around the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition [ca. 1. 8 mega-annum (Ma) ] in Europe. However, these turnovers are not fully understood due to: the precarious nature of the period's fossil record; the ???non-coexistence??? in this record of many of the species involved; and the enormous geographical area encompassed. This palaeontological information gap can now be in part bridged with data from the Fonelas P- 1 site (Granada, Spain), whose faunal composition and late Upper Pliocene date shed light on some of the problems concerning the timing and geography of the dispersals. [Methodology/Principal Findings] This rich fossil site yielded 32 species of mammals, among which autochthonous species of the European Upper Villafranchian coexist with canids (Canis), ovibovines (Praeovibos) and giraffids (Mitilanotherium) from Asia. Typical African species, such as the <b>brown</b> hyena (<b>Hyaena</b> brunnea) and the bush pig (Potamochoerus) are also present. [Conclusions/Significance] This assemblage is taxonomically and palaeobiogeographically unique, and suggests that fewer dispersal events than was previously thought (possibly only one close to 2. 0 Ma) are responsible for the changes seen around 1. 9 ??? 1. 7 Ma ago in the fauna of the two continents...|$|R
