Local political bosses were aligned with the Party of Order or the Liberal Party, but these were mostly nominal affiliations. Local oligarchs had vied among themselves for centuries over power. To them, political principles, such as those preached by the national leaders of the Party of Order, meant little or nothing. Their political ambitions focused on patronage and the annihilation of their local rivals. Honório Hermeto found himself embroiled in an ongoing power struggle between the aristocratic planters, who sought to exercise control over provincial affairs.|$|E

Georges Canton and Pierre Unné patented the original engine design in 1909, offering it to the Salmson company; the engine was often known as the Canton-Unné.|$|E

25|$|GC is {{a method}} {{involving}} the separation of different analytes within a sample of mixed gases. The separated gases can be detected multiple ways, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful detection methods for gas chromatography is mass spectrometry. After the gases separate, they enter the mass spectrometer and are analyzed. This combination not only separates the analytes, but gives structural information about each one. The GC sample must be volatile, or able to enter the gas phase, while also being thermally stable {{so that it does}} not break down as it is heated to enter the gas phase. Mass spectrometry ionization techniques requiring the sample to be in the gas phase have similar concerns.|$|E

He has a soft side, is rarely angry, and while acknowledging the life under Number One as unfair, he is happy with what he gets. He grew up in an orphanage and was evicted from a slum due to neglecting bills at the start of the series, and he joined TNT on accident. He is one of the most trusted agents of Number One.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} function {{is essentially a}} measure of how each component in the system contributes to the production of the desired product. The product itself depends on the purpose of the model, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common examples is the study of total biomass. A notable example of the success of FBA is the ability to accurately predict the growth rate of the prokaryote E. coli when cultured in different conditions. In this case, the metabolic system was optimized to maximize the biomass {{objective function}}. However this model can be used to optimize the production of any product, and is often used to determine the output level of some biotechnologically relevant product. The model itself can be experimentally verified by cultivating organisms using a chemostat or similar tools to ensure that nutrient concentrations are held constant. Measurements of the production of the desired objective can then be used to correct the model.|$|E

25|$|Many Shang royal tombs {{had been}} {{tunneled}} into and ravaged by grave robbers in ancient times, {{but in the}} spring of 1976, the discovery of Tomb 5 at Yinxu revealed a tomb that was not only undisturbed, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> richly furnished Shang tombs that archaeologists had yet come across. With over 200 bronze ritual vessels and 109 inscriptions of Lady Fu Hao's name, Zheng Zhenxiang and other archaeologists realized they had stumbled across the tomb of King Wu Ding's most famous consort, Fu Hao, who is mentioned in 170 to 180 Shang oracle bone inscriptions, and who was also renowned as a military general. Along with bronze vessels, stoneware and pottery vessels, bronze weapons, jade figures and hair combs, and bone hairpins were found. Historian Robert L. Thorp states that the large assortment of weapons and ritual vessels in her tomb correlate with the oracle bone accounts of her military career and involvement in Wu Ding's ritual ancestral sacrifices.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, {{through the}} years of World War II American art was {{characterized}} by Social Realism and American Scene Painting (as seen above) {{in the work of}} Grant Wood, Edward Hopper, Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, and several others. Nighthawks (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> recognizable in American art. It is currently {{in the collection of the}} Art Institute of Chicago. The scene was inspired by a diner (since demolished) in Greenwich Village, Hopper's home neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper began painting it immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.|$|E
25|$|Information {{security}} threats come {{in many different}} forms. Some {{of the most common}} threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Most people have experienced software attacks of some sort. Viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the IT field. Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today {{due to the fact that}} most devices today are mobile. Cell phones are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases. Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization′s website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company′s property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware. There are many ways to help protect yourself from some of these attacks <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> functional precautions is user carefulness.|$|E

500|$|Manufacturers {{sometimes}} {{identify the}} products that have received such certification by adding particular graphical symbols to the label. These symbols are known in Judaism as hechsherim. Due to differences in kashrut standards held by different organizations, the hechsheirim of certain Jewish authorities may at times be considered invalid by other Jewish authorities. The certification marks of the various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to list, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> commonly used in the United States of America {{is that of the}} Union of Orthodox Congregations, who use a U inside a circle ("O-U"), symbolising the initials of Orthodox Union.

[...] A single K is sometimes used as a symbol for kosher, but since many countries do not allow letters to be trademarked (the method by which other symbols are protected from misuse), it only indicates that the company producing the product claims that it is kosher.|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign.

Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod {{was chosen as the}} villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, {{we did a lot of}} training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E
