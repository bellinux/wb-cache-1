500|$|Wallace {{wrote on}} other social and {{political}} topics including his support for women's suffrage, and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism. In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: [...] "...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and {{that the results of}} war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens". In a letter published by the Daily Mail in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea [...] "...that this new horror is [...] "inevitable," [...] and that {{all we can do is}} to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>and</b> be in the front rank of the aerial assassins—for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships." ...|$|E

500|$|Lasser {{provided}} {{ideas to}} his authors and commented on their drafts, attempting to improve both {{the level of}} scientific literacy {{and the quality of}} the writing. Some of his correspondence has survived, including an exchange with Jack Williamson, whom Lasser commissioned in early 1932 to write a story based on a plot provided by a reader—the winning entry in one of the magazine's competitions. Lasser emphasized to Williamson the importance of scientific plausibility, citing as an example a moment in the story where the earthmen have to decipher a written Martian language: [...] "You must <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>and</b> make it convincing how they did it; for they have absolutely no method of approach to a written language of another world." [...] On one occasion Lasser's work with his authors extended to collaboration: [...] "The Time Projector", a story which appeared in the July 1931 issue of Wonder Stories, was credited to David H. Keller and David Lasser. Both Lasser and, later, Hornig, were given almost complete editorial freedom by Gernsback, who reserved only the right to give final approval to the contents. This was in contrast to the more detailed control Gernsback had exerted over the content of Amazing Stories in the first years of its existence. Science fiction historian Sam Moskowitz has suggested that the reason was the poor financial state of Wonder Stories—Gernsback perhaps avoided corresponding with authors as he owed many of them money.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, in {{a conference}} in Kyoto {{researchers}} said evidence gathered since July was falling into line with the basic Standard Model more than its alternatives, {{with a range of}} results for several interactions matching that theory's predictions. Physicist Matt Strassler highlighted [...] "considerable" [...] evidence that the new particle is not a pseudoscalar negative parity particle (consistent with this required finding for a Higgs boson), [...] "evaporation" [...] or lack of increased significance for previous hints of non-Standard Model findings, expected Standard Model interactions with W and Z bosons, absence of [...] "significant new implications" [...] for or against supersymmetry, and in general no significant deviations to date from the results expected of a Standard Model Higgs boson. However some kinds of extensions to the Standard Model would also show very similar results; so commentators noted that based on other particles that are still being understood long after their discovery, it may take years to <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>and</b> decades to fully understand the particle that has been found.|$|E
2500|$|When the two steamers {{began their}} journey {{down the coast}} again, it wasn't long before they found three of the prahus. The water was shallow that the Rainbow had the Jolly Bachelor in tow and her captain, the rajah mudah, {{intended}} to release the other ship {{as soon as they}} were in a good firing position. Brooke then asked his Sarawakian followers if the three vessels in front of him were that of pirates, to <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>and</b> they said yes, so as soon as the Sulus realised they were under attack they began killing the captives while fleeing to dangerous waters. Father McDougall later wrote the following; [...] "So we took to our stations, loaded our guns, and prepared for action. The leading boat had already gained on the other two and was going nearly as fast as the steamer herself. I never saw fellows pull so. We put on all steam, cast off the Jolly, and tried to get in between her and the point, but she beat us, and passed inside of us into shallow water, where we could not follow. Then she opened her fire upon us, which we returned with interest. She, like the others, had no heavy guns, but they all carried three long brass swivels, called lelahs, and plenty of rifles and muskets." [...] The bishop went on to say that one of the captured pirates revealed to him that each of their swivels took seven men to lift and there was forty rifles and muskets aboard each boat, or more.|$|E

Shaffer of IGN {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} 8 out of 10, taking [...] "a moment to thank The Hunger Games for {{reminding}} us how awesome Battle Royale really is" [...] and concluding that Battle Royale is [...] "a masterpiece of mayhem, violence and unfettered teen melodrama." [...] J. Hurtado of Twitch Film noted that many [...] "reviews of Battle Royale focus on the violence, which is extreme to <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>and</b> {{not so much on}} the humanity of the film." [...] He stated that [...] "cranking up that already elevated hormonal level of emotional hysteria by throwing these students into a real life-or-death situation is incredibly effective" [...] and that [...] "the story of Battle Royale is the story of those teenage years and just how wrong we all were about the extent of our emotional turmoil." [...] DVD Talk gave the original theatrical cut of the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and 4 out of 5 for the Director's Cut, concluding that it gives [...] "a glimpse into what might very well happen should the rules of society, such as they are, ever do crumble to the point where it's everyone for themselves. There's enough black humor here and enough tense action that the film never quite feels bleak or depressing (though it does come close) – but most importantly it makes you think." [...] Devon Ashby of CraveOnline gave the film a score of 8.5 out of 10, referring to it as [...] "Japanese legend Kinji Fukasaku’s adolescent shooting spree opus" [...] and [...] "a compassionate and technically accomplished masterpiece." [...] Brent McKnight of PopMatters gave the film a score of 9 out of 10, describing it as [...] "savage, sharp, satirical, and brutally funny" [...] and [...] "a bleak commentary on humanity and society." ...|$|E
