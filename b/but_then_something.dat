2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.

30|$|Because {{participants}} sometimes report {{events as}} changes {{that were not}} the changes we were interested in, change detection responses were coded as hits only if participants reported seeing the change and described something that could plausibly be the changing property. In cases where the description was ambiguous (for example, “an object on the screen changed”), responses were coded as change detections. However, in cases where participants reported noticing change <b>but</b> <b>then</b> described <b>something</b> that was identifiably not the changing object (for example, “I saw the screen flash” or “the screen got bigger”), the responses were coded change-misses.|$|R

Many of his sculptures seem to recede into the distance, disappear into the ground or distort the space around them. In 1987, he began working in stone. His later stone works are made of solid, quarried stone, {{many of which have}} carved apertures and cavities, often alluding to, and playing with dualities (earth-sky, matter-spirit, lightness-darkness, visible-invisible, conscious-unconscious, male-female, and body-mind).

50|$|Canadian filmmakers Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg {{elevated}} the genre in the 1990s by producing arthouse erotic thrillers that evolved the form in new directions.

Likewise, Cronenberg’s Dead Ringers (1988) and Crash (1996) propel the genre into the near future, where sex, obsession, and erotic desire are played out in cerebral, hypermodern settings mediated by potentially destructive technologies.|$|R

After a long stint in the third makushita division, he reached sekitori status by winning promotion to the second jūryō division in January 2002. After winning the jūryō division title in July of that year with a 13-2 record, he was promoted to the top makuuchi division for the next tournament. He was injured during his second top division tournament and had to withdraw, resulting in demotion back to the second division.

50|$|One {{theory is}} that because of its dark habitat, the fish embryo saves energy it would {{normally}} use to develop eyes to develop other body parts, and this developmental choice would eventually dominate the population. This is called economical adaptation.However, studies have shown that blind cave fish embryos begin to grow eyes during development <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> actively stops this process and flesh grows over the partially grown eyes.Another {{theory is that}} some Mexican tetra randomly don't develop eyes (which is represented by broken genes in the fish's genome), and this lack of eyes spreads {{to the rest of the}} population despite having no advantage or disadvantage. This is called the unified neutral theory of biodiversity.|$|E

50|$|The {{main point}} of Li Yan’s {{accident}} series {{is to show}} the microcosmic power of violence in an individual setting. When disaster is portrayed as a whole, Li Yan feels {{that much of what}} actually happens is lost to the viewer. For instance, when a news helicopter flies over a burnt down area of a town, the whole picture of the town just looks chaotic, and the viewer only gets a sense of a town burning down. When Li Yan takes a giant disaster, and paints individual parts of the disaster, he feels the actually expression of disaster is portrayed in a better way to the viewer. Yan will paint something as large as the giant disaster itself, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> also <b>something</b> as small as a room where things have been pushed to the floor. With the combination of these elements, the viewer can almost put themselves in the shoes of someone who is at the actual scene.|$|R

Garlanded in tape hiss and captured in flat, boxy/tubby mono—not nearly as distracting to hear as to read about—this performance wings through a half-century with remarkable detail, balance, and clarity.

Edna's hospital surroundings give way to the bright colours of her home life as her memories surface while she writes. She is a devoted housewife, an excellent cook, and in love with her husband Harry (Munro) who often compliments her on her cooking, fills their conversations with his life at work, and they seem quite normal if perhaps a little boring. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>something</b> happens that will change Edna's attitude toward herself, resulting in a hospital stay, and her stubborn unwillingness to talk.|$|E

40|$|Who chooses {{what type}} of pay? The costs and {{benefits}} of “flexible” and “cafeteria-style” benefit plans have been discussed for some time. Additionally, many papers have considered the potential {{costs and benefits of}} certain types of pay plans (e. g. salaries versus piece rates). In this paper, we use detailed data from a specific firm that annually set the total compensation level for each of its employees <b>but</b> <b>then</b> did <b>something</b> extremely unusual. At the start of each pay year, the firm set an exchange rate for the dollar trade-off between cash pay and stock option pay. It then gave every employee nearly complete choice over the fraction of their pay that was contingent (stock options, bonus) versus guaranteed (salary). There are several empirical findings. There is substantial variation in the choice of contingent pay with some workers choosing almost all base pay and others choosing almost entirely stock options. Younger employees, more experienced employees, higher paid employees, and male employees are more likely to allocate a larger fraction of their total compensation to at-risk alternatives. The robustness of these results varies somewhat depending on the empirical specification and set of covariates used...|$|R

Only twice in my life had I been at the seaside before, and then I had gone by excursion to places on the Welsh coast whose great cliffs of rock and mountain backgrounds made the effect of the horizon very different from what it is upon the East Anglian seaboard. Here what they call a cliff was a crumbling bank of whitey-brown earth not fifty feet high.|$|R
