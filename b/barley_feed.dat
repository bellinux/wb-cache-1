40|$|Abstract Barley grain (Hordeum vulgare L.) is {{characterized}} by a thick fibrous coat, a high level of ß-glucans and simply-arranged starch granules. World production of barley is about 30 % of that of corn. In comparison with corn, barley has more protein, methionine, lysine, cysteine and tryptophan. For ruminants, barley is the third most readily degradable cereal behind oats and wheat. Due to its more rapid starch fermentation rate compared with corn, barley also provides a more synchronous release of energy and nitrogen, thereby improving microbial nutrient assimilation. As a result, <b>feeding</b> <b>barley</b> can reduce the need for feeding protected protein sources. However, this benefit is only realized if rumen acidity is maintained within an optimal range (e. g., > 5. 8 to 6. 0); below this range, microbial maintenance requirements and wastage increase. With a low pH, microbial endotoxines cause pro-inflammatory responses that can weaken immunity and shorten animal longevity. Thus, mismanagement in <b>barley</b> processing and <b>feeding</b> may make a tragedy from this treasure or pearl of cereal grains. Steam-rolling of <b>barley</b> may improve <b>feed</b> efficiency and post-rumen starch digestion. However, it is doubtful if such processing can improve milk production and feed intake. Due to the need to process barley less extensively than other cereals (as long as the pericarp is broken), consistent and global standards for <b>feeding</b> and processing <b>barley</b> could be feasibly established. In high-starch diets, <b>barley</b> <b>feeding</b> reduces the need for capacious small intestinal starch assimilation, subsequently reducing hindgut starch use and fecal nutrient loss. With its nutritional exclusivities underlined, barley use will be a factual art that can either matchlessly profit or harm rumen microbes, cattle production, farm economics and the environment. </p...|$|R

Growth to 3 weeks of age was not significantly depressed by cotton cellulose in the corn basal diet, but growth was reduced by cotton cellulose in the barley diet. Hydroxyethyl cellulose reduced growth in both corn and barley diets. Tricboderma reesei cellulase alleviated growth depression by hydroxyethyl cellulose.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study shows}} an average yield {{increase}} of 415 – 1, 338  kg ha− 1 per unit {{increase of the}} Shannon diversity index for feed barley cultivar use. There is a global quest to increase food production sustainably. Therefore, judicious farmer choices such as selection of crop cultivars are increasingly important. Cultivar diversity is limited and, as a consequence, corresponding crop yields are highly impacted by local weather variations and global climate change. Actually, there is little knowledge on the relationships between yields of regional crops and cultivar diversity, that is evenness and richness in cultivar use. Here, we hypothesized that higher cultivar diversity is related to higher regional yield. We also assumed that the diversity-yield relationship depends on weather during the growing season. Our data were based on farm yield surveys of feed and malting barley, Hordeum vulgare L.; spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L.; and spring turnip rape, Brassica rapa L. ssp. oleifera, from 1998 to 2009, representing about 4, 500 – 5, 500 farms annually. We modeled the relationships between regional yields and Shannon diversity indices in high-yielding (south-west) and low-yielding (central-east) regions of Finland using linear mixed models. Our results show that an increase of Shannon diversity index increases yield of feed <b>barley.</b> <b>Feed</b> barley had also the greatest cultivar diversity. In contrast, an average yield decrease of 1, 052  kg ha− 1 per unit increase in Shannon index was found for spring rape in 2006 and 2008.

It focuses on the interactions between Canadian and US spot <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> markets in transition after this policy change in Canada. A brief introduction about world and regional barley markets is provided. The role of the CWB single desk {{and its role in}} Canadian barley marketing are discussed to motivate analysis about the effects of its absence. This study postulates there should be no significant change in Canada–US regional <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> markets, based on conclusions from previous studies. This postulate is broken down into three testable hypotheses under the framework of spatial price analysis. With respect to the Canada–US regional <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> market as single desk marketing was eliminated in Canada; (1) There should not be a significant structural break in the <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> prices; 	(2) There should not be a significant change in market integration; 	(3) There should not be a significant change in the direction of price transmission. To test these hypotheses, the study employs econometric tests on Canadian and US prices spot prices for substitutable <b>feed</b> <b>barley.</b> The hypotheses are tested using a structural break test, a cointegration test, a Granger causality test, and associated impulse response functions. Since structural break tests do not find significant breakpoints in the data, the first hypothesis cannot be rejected. Next, the sample is split into two subsamples at the date when single desk was eliminated. An Engle-Granger procedure and the Johansen procedure are used to test cointegrating relationships between the variables. The results do not allow us to reject the second hypothesis of no significant change in market integration. In contrast, the third hypothesis is rejected, as a significant change is uncovered using the Granger causality test. Simulated impulse responses are also consistent with this finding...|$|R

40|$|Mycotoxins intoxination is an {{emerging}} disorder in Belgium, due to evolution of cultural practices and harvesting weather conditions. These intoxinations {{are difficult to}} diagnose for the vet practioners, since unspecific clinical signs, {{and their impact on}} ruminant disorder remains controversial. Although legal concentrations have been established for mycotoxins in the EU, farm forages are most of the time not tested (EU 2006 / 576 /EC). In January 2015, a 500 calvings cross-bred Belgian blue cattle herd (BVDV free) referred a second (the first was directly sent to the rendering-plant) unexplained fatal case of jaundice on a 2 months-old calf to the Clinic for Ruminants of the University of Liège for necropsy. In 2013, a case of jaundice due to a Salmonella dublin hepatocholecystitis had previously diagnosed in this farm (Ronzoni et al., 2014), but so far preventions measures were implemented. Necropsy revealed generalized icterus, mild bilirubinuria, splenomegaly, but no precise etiology. On February a second 2 month old calf with jaundice is referred, lethargic, normothermic with a mild diarrhea, Calf shown generalized jaundice, anemia, elevation of leukocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes), TGO, bilirubinemia, total biliary acids and Globulins (alpha 2). He had also diminished erythrocytes and albuminemia. Copraemia, leptospirosis serology, leademia, hemoculture and pancreatic enzymes were within normal ranges, ruling out classic causes of jaundice in calf. Abdomen ultrasonography revealed a mild hyperechogenicity of the liver but no gall bladder modifications. Symptomatic treatment was based on symptoms, with fluidotherapy and choleretics. A third calf was referred three days after in a worst clinical condition, with also a severely modified liver enzymes, but no anemia. Three days after, this calf died and a necropsy revealed petechiae and hemorrhages in the abomasum, congestive mucosae in the distal bowel, white depot in the kidney medulla, modified urine and splenomegaly. Bile bacteriology and leptospirosis PCR was negative and liver histopathology revealed a severe histopathological liver degeneration associated with a disruption of the parenchyma and marked hyperplasia of the bile ducts compatible with chronic metabolic disorder. Meanwhile, the anemic calf recovered from anemia without any treatment after 4 days and was discharged from the Clinic for Ruminants. Considering the weird clinical patterns of these jaundice cases, and the fact that only calves from 2 to 3 months were affected, a nutritional origin as etiology was suspected. To test it, eight clinically healthy two to three months-old calves, of two different pens were sampled. TGO, GLDH, GGT or biliary acids were either modified and the values tended to increase with the age of the calves. The water was analyzed for classic toxics, and cultured for total germ content and everything were within recommended values. The calves fed with a milk replacer (30 % milk powder), and a commercial calf starter until one month of age. Then, they were given a mixed feed (containing cereal mix, cocoa, beet pulp, soja, maize), made at the farm from primary product/byproducts bought from different sources. The mix was tested for mycotoxins presence and ranged from 0. 8 to 1. 5 ppm of Desoxynivalenone (DON), and 115 - 215 ppb of Zearalenone (ZEA). The principal source of DON was maize (3. 1 to 6. 2 ppm), as for ZEA (0. 3 - 0. 6 ppm), but several compounds contained small dose of DON (0. 2 - 0. 7 ppm) for <b>Barley</b> <b>feed,</b> Tanned soja. Cacao contained 2. 7 to 5. 9 ppb of Ochratoxine (OTA). Nutritionnal recommendations were immediately given with a change in the source of maize and an addition of clay and yeast at 40 g/calf/day and hay. Since, any other hypothetic origin to this progressive hepatic intoxination was demostrated, and that the doses founded, even if barely legal in the mix, are not accounted for toxic in the EU regulation, we believe that the calves were chronically exposed to these toxins. However, some mycotoxins experts still claim that various clinical signs would be observed in ruminants, if the rumen is partially defaunated, like in our case with the lake of forage. We propose that monitoring of subclinical liver health could be a key to screen DON effects...|$|E

Two surveys were conducted; one on the <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> segment of the market; another on the malt barley segment of the market. These surveys provide an outline of the attributes sought by buyers of <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> in Alberta and by buyers of malt barley in Canada and the United States. A further goal of these surveys {{was to assess the}} extent of motivations for SCM in the barley supply chain. Study methods include scaling, factor analysis and stated preference techniques to analyze purchasers' preferences for specific product attributes, business relationships and product source. The major attributes of <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> sought by Alberta feed manufacturers appear to be physical characteristics such as moisture level, absence of foreign material, high bushel weight and uniform appearance of kernels. Features identified as of moderate importance included levels of certain key amino acids, starch level in the barley sample, as well as such seller characteristics as whether the seller was personally known to the buyer, and willingness of the seller to enter into a long-term supply contract. At the level of the Alberta feed mill industry, results therefore indicate that physical, readily identifiable attributes dominate in the selection of <b>feed</b> <b>barley.</b> As a result, the study identified that SCM is not yet a part of the awareness of <b>barley</b> buyers at <b>feed</b> mills. Among buyers of malt barley, physical or easily assessed attributes such as size of kernel, germination percentage, variety and location where produced ranked highly in a factor analysis as important to malt barley buyers. While results from the sample of Canadian and US buyers did not indicate strong potential for SCM in the malt barley sector, the study found there to be differences in attributes desired by US versus Canadian malt purchasers. Main differences were the concern of US buyers with the region where the barley was grown, and the apparently much higher willingness of US buyers to obtain their malt barley from more than one source. These differences may suggest a potential for SCM in malt barley focused on procuring supplies from regions identified as preferred locations for barley used in malt production.

40|$|Low and {{fluctuating}} yield {{levels of}} barley on stockless farms converted to organic farming shows that organic <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> production in Norway is a challenge. This is {{mainly because of}} insufficient nitrogen (N) supply, but also problems with soil structure in intensive arable cropping systems. The main source of plant nutrients in organic stockless cereal production is from soil organic matter and leguminous green manure crops within the crop rotation. Due to high N concentrations in green manure crops, and current practice with repeatedly mowing and leaving these as green mulch on the stubble, substantial amounts of N from green manure is {{at risk of being}} lost from the cropping system.

The high EE value of naked oats (97 g/kg) might be partly responsible for the high DE value. The 6 -row and 2 -row naked barley cultivars had the highest IVOMD (946 g/kg and 944 g/kg), followed by wheat (910 g/kg), triticale (905 g/kg), naked oats (899 g/kg), 2 -row brewer's barley (882 g/kg), 6 -row <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> (844 g/kg) and oats (671 g/kg). Considerable variation was found between samples within a cultivar for DE and IVOMD. Two-row naked barley had the highest mean CP value (159 g/kg) followed by naked oats (159 g/kg), 6 -row naked barley (154 g/kg), wheat (148 g/kg), triticale (146 g/kg), oats (143 g/kg), 2 -row brewer's barley (136 g/kg) and 6 -row <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> (135 g/kg) on DM basis. Triticale had the highest yield, with naked oats and barley cultivars having the lowest yield. Articl...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by The American Phytopathological Society {{and can be found}} at: [URL] avenae is a cereal cyst nematode that reduces wheat yields in the Pacific Northwest USA. Barley is also susceptible but there were no previous reports of resistance or tolerance to H. avenae in the USA. Spring barley cultivars were assayed in H. avenae-infested fields over two years. Cultivars were planted in plots treated or not treated with aldicarb. Forty-five cultivars were evaluated for the market classes of 2 - and 6 -row <b>feed</b> <b>barleys</b> and 2 - and 6 -row malt barleys. One 2 -row <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> (Lenetah) was ranked as resistant and four were tolerant or very tolerant. One 2 - row malt barley (Odyssey) was very resistant and 10 were tolerant or very tolerant. Two 6 -row feed and two 6 -row malt barleys were tolerant or very tolerant but none were resistant. Seven <b>feed</b> <b>barleys</b> were ranked as having a balance of at least moderate resistance plus moderate tolerance; Champion, Lenetah, Xena, Idagold II, Transit, Millenium and Goldeneye. This is the first report of resistance and tolerance of barley in H. avenae-infested fields in the Pacific Northwest. Barley productivity can be improved by planting resistant plus tolerant cultivars or by using highly resistant and highly tolerant cultivars as parents in barley improvement programs...|$|R

50|$|Since {{subsistence}} agriculture was the dominant economic system {{in most of}} Morocco's history, it's difficult {{to speak of a}} breadbasket region. All regions produced their own wheat and <b>barley</b> to <b>feed</b> themselves and their livestock. With the European commercial penetration {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, Morocco started to export wheat to Europe despite the objection of the ulama (religious establishment). The Chaouia and Doukkala plains became the most important suppliers of wheat for export. This is logical given their proximity to the coast. The ports of Casablanca and Feddala, today's Mohammedia, serviced the Chaouia Plain while the port of Mazagan serviced Doukkala.|$|R
40|$|A {{selection}} strategy {{based on}} agronomic traits was assessed to improve chemical composition of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Two multi-environment datasets were investigated. They consisted of 190 doubled-haploid {{lines of the}} Léger/CI 9831 cross and of 70 covered spike spring barley cultivars. Phenotypic correlations were assessed for four agronomic traits (test weight, seed weight, plant height and grain yield) and three chemical components [starch, acid detergent fibre (ADF), and total β -glucans]. A selection method is proposed {{on the basis of}} principal components analyses using genotype × trait (GT) biplots. Heavier test weight (> 67 g hL − 1) was a better predictor than kernel weight for the selection for lower ADF (< 55 g kg − 1) which is a desirable quality trait in <b>feed</b> <b>barley.</b> The negative correlation measured between test weight and ADF in both datasets has never been reported before in barley. Two-row barley genotypes suitable for improving the quality of <b>feed</b> <b>barley</b> were identified using the GT Biplot method...|$|R
