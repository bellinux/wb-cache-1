[...] He then encounters Warden Elroy (James Patrick Stewert), son of the infamous warden Raymond Elroy, who took sadistic pleasure in torturing inmates through manual labor and solitary confinement. Elroy tells Torque the prison has descended into chaos since {{the appearance of the}} malefactors, and asks for help in restoring order. He is able to convince the guards and prisoners to work together, and with Torque's help they are able to escape, although Torque remains behind.|$|E

60|$|James {{dared not}} see her. It was {{obviously}} best to have destroyed the letter. After all, {{it was probably}} {{nothing more than a}} curt, formal congratulation, and its coldness would nearly have broken his heart. He feared also lest in his never-ceasing thought he had crystallised his beloved into something quite different from reality. His imagination was very active, and its constant play upon those few recollections might easily have added many a false delight. To meet Mrs. Wallace would only bring perhaps a painful disillusion; and of that James was terrified, for without this passion which occupied his whole soul he would be now singularly alone in the world. It was a fantastic, charming figure that he had made for himself, and he could worship it without danger and without reproach. Was it not better to preserve his dream from the sullen irruption of fact? <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>would</b> that perfume come perpetually entangling itself with his memory? It gave the image new substance; and when he closed his eyes, the woman seemed so near that he could feel against his face the fragrance of her breath.|$|E
60|$|Ans. I {{wish there}} were nothing harder, that were good for me to do. But {{what should be the}} reason that our author, with others of his opinion, should stickle so hard to prove [that] all the epistles were wrote to {{particular}} churches? Why, because those members were, as they think, every one baptized; and so the epistles from which we fetch our arguments for the love and concord of saints, to be only proper to themselves.[7] But if this be true, there is virtue indeed, and more than ever I dreamed of, in partaking of water baptism: for if that shall take away the epistles, and consequently the whole Bible, from all that are not baptized; then are the other churches, and also particular saints, in a very deplorable condition. For he asketh me very devoutly, 'Whether any unbaptized persons were concerned in these epistles?' <b>But</b> <b>why</b> <b>would</b> they take from us the Holy Scriptures? Verily, that we might have naught to justify our practice withal: for if the Scriptures belong only to baptized believers, they then belong not to the rest; and in truth, if they could persuade us to yield them this grant, we should but sorrily justify our practice. But I would ask these men, 'If the word of God came out from them? Or if it came to them only?' (1 Cor 14:36). Or, whether Christ hath not given his whole word to every one that believeth, whether they be baptized, or in, or out of church fellowship (James 17:14). Or, whether every saint in some sort, hath not the keys of the kingdom of heaven, which are the Scriptures and their power? Would to God they had learned more modesty, than thus to take from all others, and appropriate to themselves, and that for the sake of their observing a circumstance in religion, so high, and glorious a privilege.|$|E

40|$|In the 1990 s, the UK {{version of}} the women's fashion magazine, New Woman, {{featured}} a small monthly review {{of what might be}} considered the more “outlandish” ensembles from international catwalk shows. These images were then taken to the Lancashire town of Wigan, where public opinion polls were conducted as to whether the women questioned would wear said fashions. Other than the alliteration (“Would they Wear it in Wigan?" sounds rather lovely), but much like the tongue-twisting riddle the phrase imitates, the question was not intended for a serious study. This paper considers why a fashion magazine would deem it necessary to identify “unwearable” fashions and ridicule them, <b>but</b> also <b>why</b> this <b>would</b> be done via the straight talking women of Wigan? Likewise, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> fashion advice be solicited from these women, when their response is already implied?

40|$|In this article, {{we argue}} that {{consumer}} behavior is often strongly influenced by subtle environ-mental cues. Using grocery shopping as an example (or a “leitmotif, ” if you wish), we first ar-gue that the traditional perspective on consumer choice based on conscious information pro-cessing leaves much variance to be explained. Instead, we propose that many choices are made unconsciously and are strongly affected by the environment. Our argument is based on research on the perception–behavior link and on automatic goal pursuit. Picture yourself in a supermarket.
