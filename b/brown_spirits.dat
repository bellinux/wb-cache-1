50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>spirits</b> are diluted with {{demineralized water}} and then aged in oak barrels for three to eight years {{depending}} on the brand. The aged alcohol is then further diluted with demineralized water before bottling. Liquor concentrate alcohol and caramel color are added. The <b>brown</b> <b>spirits</b> are passed through filters and then bottled and packaged. ThaiBev also makes Chinese herb spirits, branded as Chiang-Chun and Sua Dum. These are produced by blending alcohol, white spirits, sugar, caramel, and Chinese herbs, and then further diluting the mixture with demineralized water.|$|E
50|$|A snifter (also called brandy snifter, cognac glass, or balloon) {{is a type}} of stemware, a short-stemmed glass whose vessel has a wide {{bottom and}} a {{relatively}} narrow top. It is mostly used to serve aged <b>brown</b> <b>spirits</b> such as bourbon, brandy, and whisky.|$|E

50|$|Molasses is {{the main}} raw {{material}} used {{for the production of}} ThaiBev's spirits, so that most of the products fall under the category of rum. Molasses is a by-product of the manufacture of raw sugar from sugar cane. As is the case with all distilled spirits, the distillate is crystal clear when first distilled. Amber and dark <b>brown</b> <b>spirits</b> obtain their colour from the extracts from the oak barrel during aging and from caramel, a natural colouring agent.|$|E
50|$|ThaiBev's most famous, but not best selling, {{spirit is}} Mekhong, which {{originated}} in 1941 at the Bangyikhan Distillery west of Bangkok. Originally a state-owned distillery, it dates back over 200 {{years to the}} beginning of the current Chakri Dynasty. The launch of Mekhong was aimed at producing high-quality Thai spirit to stem the increase in the import of foreign liquor and to eventually replace imported brands. SangSom, however, has been the country’s most popular spirit brand for over 29 years, until 2006 holding almost 50 percent share of the entire <b>brown</b> <b>spirits</b> market in Thailand. The company also produces Mungkorn Thong and Hong Thong and brands based on whisky, such as Crown 99 and Blue, as well as Scotch whisky brands such as Hankey Banister and Pinwinnie Royal Scotch Whisky.|$|E

40|$|Clarens as {{literary}} inspiration. The {{depiction of}} space in Elsabe Steenberg’s novel Plek van die bruin geeste (Place of the <b>brown</b> <b>spirits)</b> It is clear that much of Elsabe Steen berg’s artistic work {{was inspired by the}} mountainous Clarens in the Eastern Free State. Such is the case with her 1975 novel for adults - Plek van die bruin geeste (Place of the <b>brown</b> <b>spirits).</b> In this novel a city girl is abducted by a young man, an individualistic, outsider character who wants to get money to leave South Africa for a place like an island in the Pacific where race and colour will not be of such crucial importance as in South Africa. The importance of the possibilities of inner healing of the human being by spending time in nature is represented in this novel in the finest detail in various narrative patterns. The intention of the author is represented in a fundamentalist view of reality, namely that God is the Origin, the Giver of insight into the diversity, interrelatedness and meaning of reality, and that God is the real regenerating Force...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} a {{feasibility study}} focused on filtering American whiskey, matured in new toasted and charred casks, at 25 ºF in order to remove haze which forms when product is diluted from cask strength (62 % ABV) to bottling strength (40 – 50 % ABV). Chill filtration is a process already implemented in the <b>brown</b> <b>spirits</b> industry in order to guarantee the stability of products at different ethyl alcohol concentrations. The filtration trials and cellulose-pad performance were evaluated in terms of economics, turbidity reduction, test time, throughput, color reduction, and shelf life stability. Those trials with satisfactory overall color and stability results were tested {{to determine the best}} performing filtration system. Chill filtration showed better product stability when compared with the current filtration system (consisting of carbon treatment and overnight hold). Two filtration pads were initially tested: a cellulose/diatomaceous earth (DE) pad and a cellulose-only pad. Although the cellulose/DE pad provided excellent stability results, it exhibited low product throughput and excessive color removal. The cellulose-only pads provided overall acceptable product stability, low color removal, and adequate throughput...|$|E

50|$|ThaiBev {{produces}} <b>brown</b> {{and white}} <b>spirits,</b> including rum, which {{is derived from}} distilling cane juice, sugar or molasses until the product is with 60-95% alcohol content. The content is mixed with purified water to produce a satisfactory level of alcohol content before being transferred to age in charred oak barrels {{for at least one}} year. Before being bottled the liquor may be further mixed to adjust for desired colour, aroma and taste, but it has to have at least 40% alcohol content.|$|R
50|$|Whether {{homemade}} {{or commercial}} eggnog is being served, toppings may be added, such as grated nutmeg or ground cinnamon, whipped cream, a cinnamon stick, chocolate shavings or a vanilla pod. Eggnog {{can be served}} in glasses, mugs or stemmed brandy snifters. Eggnog may be served to guests already poured into a glass or other container, {{or it may be}} served in a punch bowl, so that guests can serve themselves. Both homemade and commercial eggnogs are made in alcohol-free versions and recipes in which alcoholic beverages, generally <b>brown,</b> aged <b>spirits</b> such as bourbon, brandy or rum are added during preparation and/or directly to the cup after the nog is poured. For example, for rum, some recipes specify dark rum or spiced rum, for extra flavour. A few recipes suggest Baileys Irish Cream liqueur, apple brandy or even Guinness stout as the alcohol.|$|R
40|$|Out in the wild, far-away {{places of}} the big and still unpeopled west,- in the cañons along the Rocky Mountains, among the mining camps of Nevada and Montana, and on the remote cattle ranches of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona,- yet survives the Anglo-Saxon ballad spirit that was active in secluded districts in England and Scotland even after the coming of Tennyson and <b>Browning.</b> This <b>spirit</b> is {{manifested}} both in {{the preservation of the}} English ballad and in the creation of local songs. Illiterate people, and people cut off from newspapers and books, isolated and lonely,- thrown back on primal resources for entertainment and for the expression of emotion,- utter themselves through somewhat the same character of songs as did their forefathers of perhaps a thousand years ago. In some such way have been made and preserved the cowboy songs and other frontier ballads contained in this volume...|$|R

60|$|When the {{sun shone}} again upon the second day and a wide, open plain let the full heat of Kudu flood the chilled, <b>brown</b> body, Tarzan's <b>spirits</b> rose; {{but it was still}} a sullen, surly brute that moved {{steadily}} onward into the south where he hoped again to pick up the trail of the Germans. He was now in German East Africa and it was his intention to skirt the mountains west of Kilimanjaro, whose rugged peaks he was quite willing to give a wide berth, and then swing eastward along {{the south side of the}} range to the railway that led to Tanga, for his experience among men suggested that it was toward this railroad that German troops would be likely to converge.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Brown was posthumously {{given the}} Spirit of King Award. “The Spirit of King Award celebrates {{the life of}} Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and honors those who have carried his legacy {{throughout}} their lives,” said Eric Wells, assistant director, Employee Relations/OEO department of Port Authority. <b>Brown</b> shared King’s <b>spirit</b> of dedication and perseverance throughout his life to achieve freedom and equality. This award honored Brown’s impact on {{the region and the}} community, but it also gave an opportunity to show appreciation “for the sacrifices made in the past as a reminder for us to work together and continue the movement in the present, as well as the future,” said Chaz Kellum, Manager of Diversity Initiatives for the Pittsburgh Pirates.|$|R

60|$|He {{declared}} himself convinced that Ward far better merited {{to be at}} large than he did, and told of the regard that uniform good conduct was obtaining at last, though not till after considerable persecution, almost amounting to personal danger from the worse sort of convicts, who regarded him as a spy, because he would not connive at the introduction of forbidden indulgences, and always stood by the authorities. Once his fearless interposition had saved {{the life of a}} warder, and this had procured him trust, and promotion to a class where his companions were better conducted, and more susceptible to good influences, and among them Brown was sure that his ready submission and constant resolution to do his work were producing an effect. As to his <b>spirits,</b> <b>Brown</b> had never known him break down but once, and that was when he had come upon a curious fossil in the stone. Otherwise he was grave and contented, but never laughed or joked as even some gentlemen prisoners of more rank and age had been known to do. The music in the chapel was his greatest pleasure, and he had come to be regarded as an important element in the singing.|$|R
5000|$|In 1823, Malcolm Brown, then in {{the trade}} [...] "nearly twenty years" [...] gave {{testimony}} to a British House of Commons inquiry into distilling regulations in Ireland. In his testimony, given in June 1823, Brown stated that his operations had lost money for the preceding two years due to increased competition from illicit unlicensed distillers, which had increased eight- to ten-fold in number in the Dundalk region over the same period. As a result, Brown had ceased distilling at Dundalk the previous December, and that {{had no intention of}} resuming operations until the excise regulations were reformed. At the time, Brown stated that illicit spirits could be obtained for 4 - 5 shillings a gallon, and were the duty reduced to 2 shillings sixpence, licit spirit could be sold at around 5 - 6 shillings a gallon. With reduced duties, Brown stated that the price difference between licit and illicit spirts would narrow, prompting consumers to opt for licit spirits rather than risk a penalty by purchasing illicit <b>spirit.</b> <b>Brown</b> stated that whiskey from Dundalk distillery was principally consumed in nearby counties of Armagh, Cavan and Down, and that some of his matured spirit sold at 12 shillings a gallon.|$|R
60|$|The {{same general}} fact {{will be found}} through the whole of Browning's life and {{critical}} attitude. He adored Shelley, and also Carlyle who sneered at him. He delighted in Mill, and also in Ruskin who rebelled against Mill. He excused Napoleon III. and Landor who hurled interminable curses against Napoleon. He admired all the cycle of great men who all contemned each other. To {{say that he had}} no streak of envy in his nature would be true, but unfair; for there is no justification for attributing any of these great men's opinions to envy. But Browning was really unique, in that he had a certain spontaneous and unthinking tendency to the admiration of others. He admired another poet as he admired a fading sunset or a chance spring leaf. He no more thought whether he could be as good as that man in that department than whether he could be redder than the sunset or greener than the leaf of spring. He was naturally magnanimous in the literal sense of that sublime word; his mind was so great that it rejoiced in the triumphs of strangers. In this <b>spirit</b> <b>Browning</b> had already cast his eyes round in the literary world of his time, and had been greatly and justifiably struck with the work of a young lady poet, Miss Barrett.|$|R
6000|$|When dinner-time came Mr. Dockwrath {{found that}} the party was swelled {{to the number of}} eight, five other undoubted {{commercials}} having brought themselves to anchor at the Bull Inn during the day. To all of these, Mr. Kantwise introduced him. [...] "Mr. Gape, Mr. Dockwrath," [...] said he, gracefully moving towards them the palm of his hand, and eyeing them over his shoulder. [...] "Mr. Gape is in the stationery line," [...] he added, in a whisper to the attorney, [...] "and does for Cumming and Jibber of St. Paul's Churchyard. Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dockwrath. Mr. J. is from Sheffield. Mr. Snengkeld, Mr. Dockwrath;" [...] and then he imparted in another whisper the necessary information as to Mr. Snengkeld. [...] "Soft goods, for Brown Brothers, of Snow Hill," [...] and so on through the whole fraternity. Each member bowed as his name was mentioned; but they did not do so very graciously, as Mr. Kantwise was not a great man among them. Had the stranger been introduced to them by Moulder,--Moulder the patriarch,--his reception among them would have been much warmer. And then they sat down to dinner, Mr. Moulder taking the chair as president, and Mr. Kantwise sitting opposite to him, as being the longest sojourner at the inn. Mr. Dockwrath sat at the right hand of Kantwise, discreetly avoiding the neighbourhood of Moulder, and the others ranged themselves according to fancy at the table. [...] "Come up along side of me, old fellow," [...] Moulder said to Snengkeld. [...] "It ain't the first time that you and I have smacked our lips together over the same bit of roast beef." [...] "Nor won't, I hope, be the last by a long chalk, Mr. Moulder," [...] said Snengkeld, speaking with a deep, hoarse voice which seemed to ascend from some region of his body far below his chest. Moulder and Snengkeld were congenial spirits; but the latter, though the older man, was not endowed with so large a volume of body or so highly dominant a <b>spirit.</b> <b>Brown</b> Brothers, of Snow Hill, were substantial people, and Mr. Snengkeld travelled in strict accordance with the good old rules of trade which Moulder loved so well.|$|R
