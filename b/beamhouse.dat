40|$|Various {{bacterial}} species including potential pathogens {{have been}} isolated from hides and skins. During conventional leather processing, {{due to the}} extreme environmental conditions, the probability of bacteria surviving on hides is reduced. Alternatively, total or partial replacement of the hazardous chemicals with nonhazardous chemicals during best available technologies (BAT) processes may provide suitable conditions for bacterial growth. The aim of the present work {{was to determine the}} effect of conventional and BAT <b>beamhouse</b> operations on certain bacterial species. Decontaminated calf skin samples were inoculated with a known bacterial species found in hides or skins. A conventional and BAT <b>beamhouse</b> processes was carried out with inoculated skin samples, and bacterial growth was determined at various stages of <b>beamhouse</b> through microbial analysis. Analysis of the bacteria during the <b>beamhouse</b> operations showed that some of the stages of the <b>beamhouse</b> process inhibited the bacterial growth whilst other stages promoted the growth of bacteria...|$|E

We examine current practice and challenge the commonly accepted measurements used to gauge optimal soaking of fresh and brine cured hides. We identify differences with respect to removal of the non-collagenous hide component, hyaluronic acid, for various process chemistries on both fresh and cured cattlehides.

40|$|In {{conventional}} <b>beamhouse</b> operations, {{the elimination}} of hyaluronic acid from hides {{takes place in the}} soaking stage {{in the presence of a}} neutral salt. The impact of sodium chloride and sodium silicate (sodium metasilicate salt) -cured hides along with green hides were investigated in terms of removal of hyaluronic acid. Throughout <b>beamhouse</b> operations, the opening up of fibre structure was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The residual hyaluronic acid in hide and pelt samples taken after each <b>beamhouse</b> operation was analysed through bio-chemical analysis assisted by UV-visible spectrophotometry. The interaction of residual hyaluronic acid with chromium (III) was investigated in terms of deposition of chromium(III) in cross-sectional layers of chrome-tanned leather through scanning electon microscope – energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The hydrothermal stability of chrome tanned leather was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). It was found that sodium chloride can remove hyaluronic acid completely in the soaking operation and facilitate good opening and splitting up of fibre structure, which enables good penetration and fixation of chromium(III) species with the purified collagen. In contrast, in the absence of a neutral salt, residual hyaluronic acid existed throughout the <b>beamhouse</b> operations which resulted in poor opening and splitting up of fibre bundles and later inhibited the penetration of chromium(III) species in cross-sectional layers. As a result, comparatively lower hydrothermal stability was observed. Sodium silicate-cured hides did not provide satisfactory results in terms of removing the hyaluronic acid present in the hide, poor opening and splitting up of fibre structure were observed and residual hyaluronic acid was identified even at pickle stage. As a result, the distribution of chromium(III) species at the cross-sectional layers varied widely and poor hydrothermal stability of tanned leather was observed after chrome tanning...|$|E

40|$|The first {{stages of}} the {{transformation}} process of hides into leather (<b>beamhouse</b> process) generate an important waste in the tanning industry, since a considerable fraction of solubilized proteins ends up in waste water with the corresponding increase in contamination parameters, especially when the process is carried out without hair recovery (hair-pulping process). The objective of this work was the valorisation of this waste (the separated protein fraction) which conveniently hydrolyzed to amino acid level constituted the starting material {{for the production of}} biodegradable surfactants. The lipoamino acid surfactants were obtained by acylation of the amino acids from the protein hydrolysate. These surfactants were characterized and their physico-chemical and biological properties evaluated. They exhibit very low cmc values (about 40. mg/L). These surfactants are readily biodegradable and present an aquatic toxicity significantly lower than many common commercial surfactants derived whether from renewable or petrochemical feedstock. The mixtures of surfactants obtained are able to form oil/water emulsions that remain stable for at least 1. year. The results obtained in this work confirmed that it is possible the production of biodegradable and efficient lipoamino acid surfactant mixtures from the protein fraction present in <b>beamhouse</b> process wastewaters. This study constitutes a promising approach for the reduction of the pollution load from industrial tannery wastes and its valorisation as raw material for the production of surfactants with excellent environmental properties and good technical properties.

In a further step, new methodologies to stabilize the new biomaterial were investigated. The biomaterial generation involves the elimination of the heavy water consumption steps in conventional leather manufacture.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{identification}} of toxic compounds in industrial wastewater is presented, consisting of sequential solid phase extraction (SPE), fractionation by HPLC and GC-MS for compound identification. All analytical steps are accompanied by an automated detection of the aquatic toxicity by luminescence inhibition of Vibrio fischeri, which helps to reduce {{the large number of}} samples and subsamples that have to be processed by excluding those without toxic effects. The advantages of this procedure in comparison to previous methods of toxicity directed water analysis are discussed. The procedure was successfully applied to various samples of tannery wastewater, showing that benzothiazoles account for the major toxicity of tanyard wastewater.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} {{attention to the}} environmental impact of the process industries imposes an obligation to constantly improve the global sustainability of the leather tanning process. Among the numerous phases of the tanning process, the <b>beamhouse</b> accounts for most of the total polluting charge, due to the use of sodium sulfide and lime during the manufacturing process of hides. Hence, the authors have recently developed an alternative unhairing process that eliminates the use of sulfides. The actual reduction of {{the environmental impact of}} this process, in relation with the traditional one, was evaluated performing a Life Cycle Assesment (LCA) using SimaPro 6, one of the most used software for LCA analysis. Environmental impacts were finally rated using "EDIP 97 " assessing methodology. Since impact assessment methodologies were mainly developed for the manufacturing field, EDIP 97 was slightly modified and adapted to fit with the tannery industry...|$|E

The feasibility of using reclaimed wastewater in the different wet phases of the tanning process (<b>beamhouse,</b> tanning, re-tanning, dyeing, fatliquoring) was investigated on pilot scale for manufacturing of chrome tanned leathers. The results showed that the combination of MBR and NF processes applied to municipal wastewaters was adequate for recovering water with low hardness, very low Fe, Mn and ammonium levels as required by tanneries. The pilot-scale tanning tests demonstrated that {{there were no significant differences}} between the wet-blue (chrome-tanned) leathers produced using treated wastewater and those produced using softened tap water in terms of physical and sensorial properties.

40|$|Usually, <b>beamhouse</b> {{processes}} {{are carried out}} by varying a medium from strongly alkaline (unhairing-liming) up to strongly acid (pickling). This study is designed to develop a preparation of hide for tanning via processes that avoid a sharp change of hide pH. Enzymes active in acid medium are employed for hide unhairing in a buffer system containing 2. 5 % acetic acid and 0. 3 % sodium acetate. An oxidative treatment with peracetic acid then allows the complete removal of residual hair and scud. During both processes, unhairing and oxidative treatment, {{the opening of the}} derma structure occurs: 13. 3 - 14. 6 g of non-collagen proteins are removed and amount of dermatan sulphate decreases by 35 %.

40|$|The leather {{industry}} employs {{large amounts of}} water in unit operations of the tanning process which occurs in an aqueous medium. Identify strategies to minimize the quantity of water used in the wet stages of the leather processing is {{necessary in order to}} increase the sustainability of this compartment. In the present work, an integrated pilot scale membrane system (membrane bioreactor unit (MBR) coupled to nanofiltration (NF)) was developed for municipal wastewater reclamation. Its performance was evaluated and designed to meet the water quality criteria in view of its reuse in the tanning process. The feasibility of using reclaimed wastewater in the different wet phases of the tanning process (<b>beamhouse,</b> tanning, re-tanning, dyeing, fatliquoring) for manufacturing of calf skins was investigated on pilot scale. The results showed that the combination of MBR and NF treatments applied to municipal wastewaters is adequate for recovering water with low hardness, very low Fe, Mn and ammonium levels as required by tanneries. The pilot-scale tests demonstrated the technical feasibility of using the reclaimed water in the tanning process.

40|$|Fundamental {{elements}} of chrome-collagen interactions and the crosslinking mechanism {{at the molecular}} level have been investigated to gain detailed understanding that can be translated into improvements in the commercial process. Amide group hydrolysis during conventional liming proceeds by two mechanisms: direct hydrolysis with hydroxyl catalysis or intramolecular catalysed hydrolysis that can be measured by the degree of racemisation at L- asparagine. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of limed collagen demonstrated that there was no initial rise in the amount of D-aspartic acid during the first 24 hours of liming, indicating that, within the conventional period of liming, collagen remained intact. Circular dichroism has demonstrated that <b>beamhouse</b> processing has dispersive and relaxing effects on the collagen triple helices, but without disruption. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis provided information regarding changes in the secondary structure of collagen during tanning. Complete breakdown of chrome tanned collagen was achieved by the use of a cocktail of proteolytic enzymes: this allowed an analysis of the isolated crosslinks, which indicated preferred reaction at aspartate sidechain carboxyls. This is supported by chrome tanning studies following treatment of collagen by amidase enzymes. Geometric details of chromium(lll) species involved in the tanning reaction were elucidated by extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Linear tetrameric chromium species were found to be predominant in the tanning process. Direct measurements of the mechanism were made using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. A two-stage reaction mechanism is postulated: physical interaction and chemical complexation, affected by reaction conditions such as pH, temperature and the presence of neutral salts. Nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion measurements confirmed changes in the speciation of chromium(lll) under tanning conditions...|$|E
40|$|Hides and skins {{used as a}} raw {{material}} for leather manufacture may be contaminated with various microbial species including potential pathogens. Many bacterial species such as Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus and Pseudomonas were isolated from raw hides/skins, and hides/skins {{at different stages of}} leather making process. The extreme environmental conditions present during a conventional tanning process due to hazardous chemicals may prevent the growth of bacteria present on hides/skins. On the other hand, partial or total replacement of the hazardous chemicals with non-hazardous chemicals, during a best available technologies (BAT) process, may provide suitable conditions for microbial growth in tannery effluent and hides/skins. Therefore, the aim of the project was to determine the survival and growth of the various bacterial species during the conventional and BAT leather-making processes. The <b>beamhouse</b> and tanning stages were studied, as the majority of the environmental pollution occurs during {{the early stages of the}} leather making process. Both the pre-soaking and soaking stages during the conventional and BAT leather-making processes provided suitable conditions for bacterial (Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus spp.) growth and proliferation. The results showed a significant reduction in the number of B. cereus found during the conventional and BAT unhairing processes. Limited B. cereus growth was observed during the subsequent reliming process. Bacillus cereus growth also occurred during the deliming and bating processes (conventional and BAT), followed by a decrease during the conventional and BAT pickling processes. No B. cereus colonies were isolated during the chrome tanning process. Growth of P. aeruginosa was inhibited during both the unhairing and reliming stages of the conventional and BAT leather making processes. A reappearance and recovery of P. aeruginosa in the subsequent deliming and bating (conventional and BAT) processes, indicated that deliming and bating processes may provide suitable growth conditions for P. aeruginosa. On the other hand, both the conventional and BAT pickling processes, and the chrome tanning processes hindered P. aeruginosa growth. Staphylococcus spp. were present throughout the conventional and BAT leather-making processes. A large reduction in the number of Staphylococcus spp. was observed during the unhairing and reliming processes (conventional and BAT). Growth of Staphylococcus spp. occurred during the subsequent deliming, bating, pickling and chrome tanning stages for both the conventional and BAT leather-making processes. The biochemical assays for bacterial identification confirmed the presence of B. cereus, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus spp. during the leather processing. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method of DNA fingerprinting confirmed that the bacterial species isolated during the leather manufacturing processes were the inoculated B. cereus and P. aeruginosa, and no alteration of the DNA of above-mentioned bacteria occurred during the processing. Overall, the research showed that bacterial species are capable of surviving during both the conventional and BAT leather-manufacturing processes. The bacterial species prefer the environmental conditions during the pre-soaking and soaking processes, while the unhairing and reliming processes did not favour the growth of bacterial species. Bacterial colonies were enumerated during the deliming and bating processes indicating that the unhairing and reliming processes did not cause total destruction of the bacterial cells. Alternatively pickling and chrome tanning processes were found to have suppressed the growth of bacterial colonies...|$|E
