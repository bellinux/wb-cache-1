5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a <b>bill</b> <b>by</b> the end of the special session.|$|E

5|$|After the 2000 election, Fletcher {{crafted a}} {{compromise}} bill that allowed patients to sue their HMOs in federal court, capped {{pain and suffering}} awards at $500,000, and eliminated punitive damage awards. Despite an eventual compromise allowing patient lawsuits to go to state courts under certain circumstances and heavy lobbying in favor of Fletcher's <b>bill</b> <b>by</b> President George W. Bush, the House refused to pass it, favoring an alternative proposal by Georgia's Charlie Norwood that was less restrictive on patient lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{retreat from}} Quebec, {{and in this}} battle, wounded {{soldiers}} were treated at the Ursuline convent in Trois-Rivières. Congress never authorized payment for these services and the convent has retained the <b>bill.</b> <b>By</b> the early 21st century, the original bill of about £26 {{was estimated to be}} equivalent to between ten and twenty million Canadian dollars, if compound interest was applied. On July 4, 2009, during festivities marking the town's 375th anniversary, American Consul-General David Fetter symbolically repaid the debt to the Ursulines with a payment of C$130.|$|E

5|$|Quackenbush {{was born}} on March 2, 1922, in Toronto, Ontario. He was born Hubert George Quackenbush but was given the {{nickname}} <b>Bill</b> <b>by</b> his aunt who disliked his given name. He played hockey on outdoor rinks around Toronto during the Great Depression as a youth, {{and was one of}} the top high school athletes in Canada as a teenager. In addition to hockey, he was a renowned football and soccer player. During the War Years, he played for the famous Canadian soccer club Toronto Scottish. Quackenbush had an opportunity to play football professionally, but he decided to pursue a career in hockey.|$|E
5|$|Service members {{holding a}} blue {{discharge}} {{were subjected to}} discrimination in civilian life. They were denied {{the benefits of the}} G.I. <b>Bill</b> <b>by</b> the Veterans Administration and had difficulty finding work because employers were aware of the negative connotations of a blue discharge. Following intense criticism in the press—especially the black press, because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges—and in Congress, the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable.|$|E

5|$|Funding on the paving project between Buck Hill and the {{boundary}} of the national lakeshore was held up, pending passage of a technical corrections <b>bill</b> <b>by</b> the US Senate. The original funding authorization specified that sections were being repaved; instead they were being paved {{for the first time}} or realigned. A technical corrections bill solved the legal hurdles involved. The road commission used state matching grants from the Michigan Department of Transportation to complete the financing needed to pave the roadway. Local officials received the checks to pay for the projects at a ceremony in August 2008. While the county completed a segment on their own in 2006, the 2008 projects paved segments of the roadway outside of the national lakeshore boundaries from Buck Hill northwards. Construction in 2009 and 2010 completed the roadway inside the park boundaries, including a new bridge over the Hurricane River.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} from office on December 1, 1794, giving Washington two months' notice, {{in the wake of}} his wife Eliza's miscarriage while he was absent during his armed repression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Before leaving his post on January 31, 1795, Hamilton submitted a Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit to Congress to curb the debt problem. Hamilton grew dissatisfied with what he viewed as a lack of a comprehensive plan to fix the public debt. He wished to have new taxes passed with older ones made permanent and stated that any surplus from the excise tax on liquor would be pledged to lower public debt. His proposals were included into a <b>bill</b> <b>by</b> Congress within slightly over a month after his departure as treasury secretary. Some months later Hamilton resumed his law practice in New York to remain closer to his family.|$|E

5|$|In June 1844, the Senate, {{with its}} Whig majority, soundly {{rejected}} the Tyler–Texas treaty. The pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election. In December 1844, lame-duck President Tyler called on Congress to pass his treaty by simple majorities in each house. The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House <b>bill</b> (<b>by</b> the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|E

According to Article 91, the monarch shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a <b>bill</b> <b>by</b> the Cortes Generales. Article 92 invests the monarch {{with the right to}} call for a referendum, on the advice {{of the president of the}} government (commonly referred to in English as the prime minister) and the authorisation of the cortes.|$|E
5|$|On 19 January 1999, the Leader of the House of Commons, Margaret Beckett, {{introduced}} the House of Lords Bill into the House of Commons. The House of Commons passed the <b>bill</b> <b>by</b> {{a vote of}} 340 to 132 on 16 March. The next day it {{was presented to the}} House of Lords, where debate on the bill was far longer. One significant amendment made to the Bill was the so-called Weatherill Amendment, named for the Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of the House of Commons. The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne, and allowed 92 hereditary peers to remain members of the House of Lords.|$|E

The video frequently cuts to Stefani {{back in the}} studio to show her singing and performing in semi-synchronization with her actions within her fantasy world.

5|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's <b>bill</b> <b>by</b> Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, coming into force as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974. The Act establishes a duty of care builders and their sub-contractors owe to the occupiers of property they construct or modify, and also establishes a duty of care landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties who might be injured by their failure to maintain or repair property. The Act received a mixed reaction from critics; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex common rule laws, others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved, and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific.|$|E
5|$|World War II caused {{enrollment}} {{to decline}} {{and the student}} body consisted mainly {{of high school students}} and seminarians. Following the war, new students enrolled, and the school built a temporary facility in 1947 to accommodate them. Students from Illinois began to replace out-of-state students, the percentage of day, or commuting, students rose, and the school employed more lay teachers. After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. <b>Bill.</b> <b>By</b> 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students. Better times and higher birth rates led to growing enrollment at St. Procopius in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
