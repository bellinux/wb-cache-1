40|$|We {{present a}} new data structure, called a random-access list, that {{supports}} array lookup and update operations in O(log n) time, while simultaneously providing O(1) time list operations (cons, head, tail). A closer {{analysis of the}} array operations improves the bound to O(minfi; log ng) in the worst case and O(log i) in the expected case, where i is the index of the desired element. Empirical evidence suggests that this data structure should be quite efficient in practice. 1 Introduction Lists are the primary data structure in every functional programmer 's toolbox. They are simple, convenient, and usually quite efficient. The main drawback of lists is that accessing the ith element <b>requires</b> <b>O(i)</b> time. In such situations, functional programmers often find themselves longing for the efficient random access of arrays. Unfortunately, arrays can be quite awkward to implement in a functional setting, where previous versions of the array must be available even after an update. Since arra [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Treatment for craniocervical {{junction}} lesions {{associated with}} osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) has been described, {{but there are}} divergent views on operative procedures and preoperative and postoperative therapies due to {{the small number of}} cases. It has been suggested that a major procedure such as combined anterior and posterior surgery with concomitant ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting is <b>required</b> for <b>OI</b> associated with basilar impression (BI). However, here we report a case with a good outcome after posterior decompression fusion only. The patient was a 29 -year-old woman with OI (Sillence type-IA) who had neurological symptoms of vertigo, nausea, and shaking during walking. Diagnostic imaging revealed hydrocephalus, severe BI, and Chiari type-II malformation. Preoperative Halo traction led to improvement in symptoms, and posterior decompression fusion from the occipital bone to C 6 was subsequently performed. Lateral mass screws and Nesplon cables as sublaminar wiring for reinforcement for fusion were used in the operation. The patient wore a Halo vest for 4  weeks postoperatively. She experienced no symptoms postoperatively. Bone fusion and improved hydrocephalus were clear on images at 3  years after surgery, and the postoperative course has been good. In craniocervical junction lesions associated with OI, instability with compression of the nerve and bone fragility in multiple sites can become problematic. Anterior odontoid resection and posterior fusion are <b>required</b> for <b>OI</b> with BI to give ideal decompression on images. However, the results of this case suggest that a good postoperative outcome can be achieved by performing not the combination of anterior odontoid resection and VP shunting, but only with posterior decompression fusion, especially for OI cases of Sillence type-I...|$|R
