40|$|The {{effect of}} bearing thermal growth on the {{effectiveness}} of the bearing preload springs on the space shuttle main engine high pressure oxygen turbopump (SSME HPTOP) were examined.

The magnitude of the thermal stresses required to cause high levels of ball wear were calculated. Plots of maximum sheer stress and maximum reversing shear versus the axial load for the 57 mm SSME HPTOP bearing were created. A plot of the bearing thermal growth versus preload spring deflection was generated. It was determined that metallic wear, rather than thermal growth, caused enlargement of the contact zone between ball and races, that high fatigue-inducing shear stresses are generated under increased loads, and that at temperatures between 100 and 150 deg C, the springs bottom out and very high loads are developed in the bearing.

One of the competitions occurs on the market of centrifugal pump for fisherman ship. The SME product, made in Tegal, has a lower price but also has a short lifespan. The imported product is now preferred by the fisherman due to its better performance and its longer lifespan. The main problem of the SME pump comes from the excessive wear at the pump shaft, indicated by a collection of deep scratch at two locations in pump shaft. This paper investigates the cause of the excessive wear at the SME pump shaft and compares the quality of the SME and imported shaft by conducting material characterization, mechanical testing, and design evaluations. The chemical composition, hardness property, tensile strength, geometrical analysis and bearing design of the both shaft products are compared.

The absence of the <b>bearing</b> <b>mounting</b> design on the shaft, the lack of lubricant volume and the low quality of the seals on the SME pump product induce the undesirable wear on the pump shaft.

40|$|A {{dynamically}} optimal {{design is}} essential for a motion system to perform high speed operation without compromising its accuracy, settling time and vibration specification. Good design practice which accounts for dynamic characteristics in the modelling of a motion system warrants higher performance precision machines and cuts down redevelopment effort to ‘patch’ inherent shortcoming of the machine dynamics. This research aimed to accurately describe the non-linear dynamics of a non-mechanical contact aerostatic guideway system {{in order to achieve}} an accurate FEA model of the design stage. The single axis aerostatic guideway is comprised of several machine in¬terfaces that impact the dynamic behaviour of the guideway. Modelling each air bear¬ing pad by a single stiffness element is not adequate to predict the guideway modal behaviour accurately. The aerostatic guideway has been broken down into several key machine interface elements. In-depth investigation of the air film and the air <b>bearing</b> <b>mounting</b> mechanism was carried out. A dedicated air film test rig was designed and built to acquire insight of the air film dynamic characteristics. It is observed that the mounting mechanism of the air bearing constitutes to a signifi-cant dynamic effect to the entire air bearing setup. Based on the findings of the mount-ing mechanism’s stiffness properties, a method was developed to estimate ‘true’ air gap heights which cannot be easily assessed and measured directly in most aerostatic guideway carriages. The estimation method enables a more rigorous FE model of the aerostatic guideway system. The comprehensive dynamic analysis methodology pro-posed in this research greatly increases the confidence and accuracy of the aerostatic guideway’s FE model.

40|$|A {{new test}} rig has been {{developed}} for simulating high-speed turbomachinery shafting using Oil-Free foil air bearing technology. Foil air journal bearings are self-acting hydrodynamic bearings with a flexible inner sleeve surface using air as the lubricant. These bearings {{have been used in}} turbomachinery, primarily air cycle machines, for the past four decades to eliminate the need for oil lubrication. More recently, interest has been growing in applying foil bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines. They offer potential improvements in efficiency and power density, decreased maintenance costs, and other secondary benefits. The goal of applying foil air bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines prompted the fabrication of this test rig. The facility enables bearing designers to test potential bearing designs with shafts that simulate the rotating components of a target engine without the high cost of building actual flight hardware. The data collected from this rig {{can be used to make}} changes to the shaft and bearings in subsequent design iterations. The rest of this article describes the new test rig and demonstrates some of its capabilities with an initial simulated shaft system. The test rig has two support structures, each housing a foil air journal bearing. The structures are designed to accept any size foil journal bearing smaller than 63 mm (2. 5 in.) in diameter. The bearing support structures are mounted to a 91 - by 152 -cm (3 - by 5 -ft) table and can be separated by as much as 122 cm (4 ft) and as little as 20 cm (8 in.) to accommodate a wide range of shaft sizes. In the initial configuration, a 9. 5 -cm (3. 75 -in.) impulse air turbine drives the test shaft. The impulse turbine, as well as virtually any number of "dummy" compressor and turbine disks, can be mounted on the shaft inboard or outboard of the bearings. This flexibility allows researchers to simulate various engine shaft configurations. The bearing support structures include a unique <b>bearing</b> <b>mounting</b> fixture that rotates to accommodate a laserbased alignment system. This can measure the misalignment of the bearing centers in each of 2 translational degrees of freedom and 2 rotational degrees of freedom. In the initial configuration, with roughly a 30. 5 -cm- (12 -in. -) long shaft, two simulated aerocomponent disks, and two 50. 8 -cm (2 -in.) foil journal bearings, the rig can operate at 65, 000 rpm at room temperature. The test facility can measure shaft displacements in both the vertical and horizontal directions at each bearing location. Horizontal and vertical structural vibrations are monitored using accelerometers mounted on the bearing support structures. This information is used to determine system rotordynamic response, including critical speeds, mode shapes, orbit size and shape, and potentially the onset of instabilities. Bearing torque can be monitored as well to predict the power loss in the foil bearings. All of this information is fed back and forth between NASA and the foil bearing designers in an iterative fashion to converge on a final bearing and shaft design for a given engine application. In addition to its application development capabilities, the test rig offers several unique capabilities for basic bearing research. Using the laser alignment system mentioned earlier, the facility will be used to map foil air journal bearing performance. A known misalignment of increasing severity will be induced to determine the sensitivity of foil bearings to misalignment. Other future plans include oil-free integral starter generator testing and development, and dynamic load testing of foil journal bearings...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental behavior and dynamic {{analysis of a}} high speed test rig with rolling element <b>bearings</b> <b>mounted</b> in squeeze film oil damper bearings. The test rotor is a double overhung configuration with rolling element ball <b>bearings</b> <b>mounted</b> in uncentered squeeze-film oil dampers. The damper design {{is similar to that}} employed with various high-speed aircraft HP gas turbines. The dynamic performance of the test rig with the originally installed dampers with an effective damper length of length 0. 23 -inch was unacceptable. The design speed of 40, 000 RPM could not be safely achieved as nonsynchronous whirling at the overhung seal test disk and high amplitude critical speed response at the drive spline section occurred at 32, 000 RPM. In addition to the self excited stability and critical speed problems, it was later seen from FFT data analysis, that a region of supersynchronous dead band whirling occurs between 10, 000 to 15, 000 RPM which can lead to bearing distress and wear. The system was analyzed using both linear and nonlinear techniques. The extended length damper design resulting from the analysis eliminated the rotor subsynchronous whirling, high amplitude critical speed, and the dead band whirling region allowing the system to achieve a speed of 45, 000 RPM. However, nonlinear analysis shows that damper lockup could occur with high rotor unbalance at 33, 000 RPM, even with the extended squeeze-film dampers. The control of damper lockup will be addressed in a future paper...|$|R
40|$|Emphasis on soil {{conservation}} {{in recent times}} has been {{brought about by the}} degradation of soils due to intensive tillage operations. A relatively new tillage philosophy, coined “conservation tillage”, has opened up a new realm of tillage equipment design. The Rotary Tine Aerator (RTA) is new tillage tool that is starting to see commercial applications within the agriculture industry. Being a new tillage tool, very little information has been gathered about the RTA and especially the variables that affect tool loading. For the purpose of improving the design of the soil engaging components of the RTA, an experiment was carried out investigating the effect various settings have on tool loading. A factorial experiment was set up with three factors and two levels. The variables examined were depth, velocity of the tool carriage and tine, and the tine gang angle, with soil density and moisture content maintained constant. Draft and vertical forces on the frame were seen to increase with depth. Side loading on the <b>bearing</b> <b>mounts</b> was seen to be primarily affected by the angle of the tine gang, increasing as the gang angle increased. Tool shape was seen to affect the side loading of the <b>bearing</b> <b>mounts</b> causing the force to change directions when the tool was working and 20 cm depth and the tine gang was set a 0 º. Forward velocity was not seen to be a significant factor affecting forces on the frame. The loading in the X, Y and Z direction on the tine increased as depth increased from 10 cm to 20 cm. A decrease in force on the tine in the X, Y and Z direction was seen with increasing tine velocity. It is suggested that an overlap in soil failure zones could be the cause of this relationship. Opening the gang angle from 0 º to 10 º increased the force in the Z direction and decreased the force in the X direction. Tool shape was also seen to affect the direction of the load on the tine in the Z direction when the tine was tilling at a depth 20 cm with a tine gang of 0 º. From the information gathered in this experiment, statistical models were developed for the loading on the tine and frame. The all possible regressors approach was used to formulate the statistical models. As each regressor was added, the new equation’s fit was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R 2) and the sum of squared error (SSE). If there was a discrepancy as to whether an added regressor significantly contributed to the fit of the equation, a hypothesis test using the F-statistic was used to justify the regressors addition or removal. The models were then compared against the original data. The models developed for the tine loading showed sufficient accuracy. The models for side loading of the <b>bearing</b> <b>mounts</b> and draft loading of the tool frame contained only one significant regressor. The lowest coefficient of correlation was R= 0. 63 for the model of side loading of the <b>bearing</b> <b>mount.</b> The statistical model for the vertical loading correlated well with the test data with a coefficient of correlation of R= 0. 95...|$|R

40|$|A {{decoupled}} {{slow speed}} friction torque {{model has been}} developed to predict the running torque of a double-arched angular contact bearing when operating as a four-point, {{as well as a}} two-point contact bearing. The load distribution model from Amasorrain et al. (2003) and the kinematics model developed by Leblanc and Nelias (2007) have been combined after ignoring centrifugal and gyroscopic effects, a valid assumption for slow speed operation. Results from the model are compared with previous literature data, as well as with tests done on a specially-developed friction torque rig. The comparison with the literature results was done for two specific cases: (i) when only one out of the two contact lines in the four-point contact bearing is active (effectively creating a two-point contact bearing); and (ii) where both contact lines in the four-point contact bearing are active. Further, the comparison was done with a custom-built friction torque rig with FAG QJ 309 bearings, again for two cases: (i) <b>bearings</b> <b>mounted</b> with a specific clearance (two-point contact); and (ii) <b>bearings</b> <b>mounted</b> with larger size balls to obtain interference (four-point contact).
