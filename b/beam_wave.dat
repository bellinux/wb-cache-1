The wave height is estimated with a vertical beam that measures {{the distance to}} the surface using the echo from short pulses and simple peak estimation algorithms. The wave direction is found by cross correlating the along-beam velocity estimates and the wave height measurement from the vertical <b>beam.</b> <b>Wave</b> measurements are typically available for seafloor-mounted instruments but recent improvements permit the instrument to be mounted also on rotating subsurface buoys.|$|E

The research, connected with a full scale capsizing with loss of a life, was conducted on a 1 : 10 scale model equipped with instrumentation to measure roll motion in <b>beam</b> <b>waves.</b> Several different loading condition, within the same displacement, realising centre of gravity values in the interval between the different IMO Intact Stability requests were tested in regular <b>beam</b> <b>waves</b> with steepness ranging from 1 / 30 to 1 / 10.

40|$|The wave guide using {{dielectric}} lenses as {{phase shifter}} {{is one of}} the fundamental methods of <b>beam</b> <b>wave</b> transmission. The main losses in this system are reflection, diffraction and dielectric ones. Among them, the first is most dominant. But, as for reflection, we know the existence of Brewster angle for plane wave incidence upon plane boundary surface. We may, therefore, expect that the reflection loss will be considerably diminished if lenses are set at Brewster angle with the direction of propagation of the <b>beam</b> <b>wave.</b> To discuss this problem quantitatively we deal, in this paper, with the case when lenses of a kind are set at an arbitrary but constant angle. The beam modes of this system are obtained solving an integral equation. From this the reflection loss is easily calculated if surfaces of lenses are approximated with plane. The results show as expected that the loss is almost neglected. Diffraction loss can also be obtained...|$|E

40|$|The bounded <b>beam</b> <b>wave</b> {{nature of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation emanating from a finite size aperture is considered for diffraction-based link power budget calculations for an optical communications system. Unlike at radio frequency wavelengths, diffraction effects {{are very important}} at optical wavelengths. In the general case, the situation cannot be modeled by supposing isotropic radiating antennas and employing the concept of effective isotropic radiated power. It is shown here, however, that these considerations are no more difficult to treat than spherical-wave isotopic based calculations. From first principles, a general expression governing the power transfer for a collimated <b>beam</b> <b>wave</b> is derived and from this are defined the three regions of near-field, first Fresnel zone, and far-field behavior. Corresponding equations for the power transfer are given for each region. It is shown that although the well-known linear expressions for power transfer in the far-field hold for all distances between source and receiver in the radio frequency case, nonlinear behavior within the first Fresnel zone must be accounted for in the optical case at 1550 nm with typical aperture sizes at source/receiver separations less that 100 km...|$|E

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations {{are performed}} {{to investigate the}} generation of internal waves in a linearly stratified fluid by oscillating barotropic flows over a model continental shelf-slope topography. The presence of a third wave-beam emitted from an abrupt shelf break and transverse to the topography, {{which has not been}} adequately interpreted, is now explained in terms of a geometric constraint provided by the topography. This explanation applies to <b>wave</b> <b>beam</b> selection at any abrupt topographic junction point, no matter whether it is convex or concave, or its nearby slope is subcritical or supercritical. One exception is that, at an abrupt concave point with a nearby supercritical slope, the blocking effect leads to the presence of "dead water" (i. e., no flow) and thus no <b>wave</b> <b>beam</b> is emitted. On a critical slope, two beams with opposite directions are emitted from an amphidromic point that has a distinct distance from the shelf break. In addition to the internal wave dispersion relation that restricts possible <b>wave</b> <b>beam</b> directions to form an X-pattern, the geometric constraint proposed in the present work serves as a second selection mechanism that further restricts <b>wave</b> <b>beam</b> directions. The reflective direction of a <b>wave</b> <b>beam</b> incident onto a slope can also be explained by this geometric constraint. The present work provides an updated explanation of internal <b>wave</b> <b>beams</b> emitted at abrupt topographic junction points and unifies the explanation of the <b>wave</b> <b>beam</b> direction for both wave generation and reflection processes.
