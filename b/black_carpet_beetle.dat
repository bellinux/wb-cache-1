5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> (Attagenus unicolor) is a 3 - 5 mm beetle {{that can}} be a serious {{household}} pest. The larvae grow to 7 mm in length, are reddish brown in colour and covered with bristles. The larval form feeds on natural fibres, damaging carpets, furniture and clothing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> Attagenus megatoma, is {{a widely}} known stored product pest {{and one of the}} most {{destructive}} because of its potential damage to household products containing keratin, which is a protein found in animal hair and feathers. They are also able to burrow through various types of food packaging, allowing passage for other insects.|$|E
30|$|Wool {{and other}} hair fibres used for {{producing}} carpets, blanket and shawl etc. due to having properties like warmth, softness and flame retardancy. Specially, wool-based materials {{due to its}} protein content are prone to attack of moth and other insects. Moth is an insect and its larvae eat the protein present in wool. Cloths moth (Tineola bisselliella) and <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> (Anthrenus verbasci) are common moths attacking the wool materials. DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), permethrin, permethrin/hexahydro pyrimidine derivative, cyhalothrin, etc. {{are some of the}} chemicals used as antimoth finishing agents. Nano TiO 2 particles were also utilized as an antifeeding compound on wool fabric against larvae of the <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> Anthrenus verbasci, feeds on protein fibers [133]. All the chemicals used for antimoth finishing are associated with ecological disturbance and so, natural colorants may be perfect substitutes for them. Shakyawar et al. screened saffron flower waste, onion skin, henna, myrobolan, silver oak leaf, madder, walnut, dholkanali and yellow root natural dye sources for antimoth finishing and found best results for silver oak leaves, walnut husk and pomegranate rind [134]. Natural dyes cochineal, madder, and walnut (quinines) and chestnut, fustic, indigo, and logwood (flavonoids) were applied on wool and tested for antimoth properties against <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles.</b> All of the dyes, except indigo, increased the insect resistance of the wool fabric but flavonoid dyes were not so effective in enhancing insect resistance. Metallic mordants were found not having significant effect on insect resistance with all natural dyes used. The anthraquinone dyes including cochineal, madder, and walnut were found to be quite effective in protecting wool fabric against <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> [135].|$|R
50|$|Anthrenus sarnicus, the Guernsey <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> {{is a type}} of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle.</b> It can be {{generally}} found in Great Britain. Its suborder is Polyphaga, the infraorder is Bostrichiformia, the superfamily is Bostrichoidea, and the family is Dermestidae. The <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> is shaped like an oval and {{about the size of a}} pin.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} predators like ants and spiders will feed on <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae. No predators will {{exclusively}} eat <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> and the larvae will hide in dark places to avoid them.|$|R
50|$|Actual book-borers are uncommon. Two moths, {{the common}} clothes moth and the brown house moth, will attack cloth bindings. Leather-bound books attract various beetles, such as the larder beetle and the larva of the <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> and Stegobium paniceum. Larval death watch beetles and common {{furniture}} beetles will tunnel through wood and paper (if it is nearby the wood).|$|E
5000|$|Beetles {{start out}} white but darken with age. They {{typically}} do not eat, although they will sometimes eat flower pollen in the wild, but not indoors. Adults live {{for a few}} weeks, {{just long enough to}} mate and lay more eggs. They are eventually black in colour, hence the name <b>Black</b> <b>Carpet</b> <b>Beetle.</b> Females are capable of laying 50 to 100 eggs.|$|E
50|$|Females can lay up to 90 {{eggs and}} they hatch in about 8 to 15 days. Generally, this species only has one {{generation}} a year. The {{time it takes}} to become an adult varies from six months to a year. In addition, an adult <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> can live for an additional two months. The average adult size is about 2.8 to 5 mm long and they are oval, dark brown to shiny-black in color, and have brown legs.|$|E
50|$|All <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> will {{go through}} {{metamorphism}} during their lives. They will pass through the egg, larval, and pupal points to reach full maturity. This can take two months to many years. Female <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> can lay over 100 eggs which can hatch after 7-35 days. Four generations of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> can develop every year. It can take 9 months to 2 years for a <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> to become a full adult. However, adults only survive {{for a couple of}} weeks. On the plus side for the beetles, the adults are skillful fliers and can live for many weeks without food.|$|R

5000|$|The {{carpet beetle}} larvae start to feed {{as soon as}} they hatch. They are carrot shaped and heavily covered with setae, {{especially}} on their posterior end. The number of instars differ from 5-11 and in some cases reach up to 20. Larvae of the <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> Attagenus megatoma may grow up to 1/2 inch (12 mm) and be yellow to brown in color. Other types of carpet beetle are regularly 1/4 to 1 inch (6 to 25 mm) long and covered with dark setae. Certain species have distinctive tufts of setae extending from their posterior end. These beetles are attracted to soiled fabrics and crevices where dead insects may serve as a food source. The larvae of the carpet beetle are often referred to as [...] "woolly bears" [...] or [...] "buffalo moths".|$|E

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} chemical composition of essential oils obtained from Zanthoxylum dissitum leaves and roots and their insecticidal activities against several stored product pests, namely the cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne), red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) and <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> (Attagenus piceus). The analysis by GC-MS {{of the essential}} oils allowed the identification of 28 and 22 components, respectively. It was found that sesquiterpenoids comprised a fairly high portion of the two essential oils, with percentages of 74. 0 % and 80. 9 % in the leaves and roots, respectively. The main constituents identified in the essential oil of Z. dissitum leaves were δ-cadinol (12. 8 %), caryophyllene (12. 7 %), β-cubebene (7. 9 %), 4 -terpineol (7. 5 %) and germacrene D- 4 -ol (5. 7 %), while humulene epoxide II (29. 4 %), caryophyllene oxide (24. 0 %), diepicedrene- 1 -oxide (10. 7 %) and Z,Z,Z- 1, 5, 9, 9 -tetramethyl- 1, 4, 7 -cycloundecatriene (8. 7 %) were the major components in the essential oil of Z. dissitum roots. The insecticidal activity {{results indicated that the}} essential oil of Z. dissitum roots exhibited moderate contact toxicity against three species of storage pests, L. serricorne,T. castaneum and A. piceus, with LD 50 values of 13. 8, 43. 7 and 96. 8 µg/adult, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of an Introduction, a Discussion (divided into 6 sections) and an Experimental chapter (for sections 1 to 5 of the Discussion). The Introduction contains the justification for this work, the aim {{of which is to}} prepare new potentially valuable biologically active compounds from the readily available but highly toxic alkaloid nicotine (1). The chemistry, biological activity and metabolism of nicotine in man and animals is described. Section 1 of the Discussion reports the synthesis of alkylnicotines, prepared with the aims (a) to obtain new compounds but preserve the electronic and stereochemical parameters considered necessary for nicotine-like insecticidal activity, and (b) to prevent or reduce the rate of metabolic oxidative degradation of nicotine to the non-toxic nicotinic acid and cotinine (2). Nicotine analogues (3), (5) and (7) have been prepared by reduction of the corresponding carbonyl compounds (4), (6) and (8), which were synthesised from nicotine. The n. m. r. spectra of (3) to (8) are discussed and corroborate Craig's assignments for the n. m. r. spectrum of nicotine, a double irradiation n. m. r. spectrum of (3) supporting these assignments. The mass spectra of (3) to (8) have been recorded and interpreted with regard to the fragmentation modes for nicotine (1) and cotinine (2) as discussed by Djerassi. Compound (6) undergoes a double McLafferty rearrangement in the mass spectrometer. The 1 ′-oxo analogue (9) of 2 ′-methylnicotine has been prepared by cyclization of (10) with hydrobromic acid. Myosmine (11) and methyl magnesium iodide have given 4 -methylmyosmine (12) and its mass spectrum and n. m. r. spectrum are interpreted in terms of those obtained for (11). 1 -(3 -Pyridyl) ethylidenemethylamine (13) has been prepared from 5 -acetylpyridine and methylamine, but attempts to convert it to 2 ′-methylnicotine failed. Section 2 deals with oxidised nicotines. Nicotyrine (14) has been coupled with the diazonium compounds obtained from anthranilic acid and from p -nitroaniline to give (15) and (16) respectively. Although (16) appears to be active against <b>black</b> <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae neither (15) nor (16) showed useful activity in our screens. Nicotine with plenyl chloroformate gave Δ 3 - 1 -methyl- 1 -phenoxycarbonyl- 5 -(3 -pyridyl) butylamine (17). The structure of pyrazole obtained from nicotine and nitric acid is discussed with reference to its mass spectrum and i. r. spectrum, the latter showing a strongly hydrogen bonded N-H stretching absorption implying structure (18 b) and not (18 a) as earlier supposed. Monobromo compound (19) has likewise been investigated. Nicotine and sulphur react to give dithiodinicotyrine (20) and not thiodinicotyrine as alleged earlier. A satisfactory computer simulation of the pyridine protons of (20) has been performed. Desulphurization of (20) with Raney Nickel has given nicotyrine (14). The reactions of 2 - (21) and 6 -aminonicotine (22) are considered in section 3. As some ureas have diuretic properties and cause reduction of intracranial and intraocular pressure compounds (25) to (29) were synthesised from (2 l) and (22) with the appropriate isocyanites and isothiocyanates.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the ability of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) to detect the scent of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae (Anthrenocerus australis). These insects were introduced to New Zealand and are now a pest of woollen carpets and fabrics in this country. The use of detector dogs can help with earlier discovery and identification of infested areas and thus reduce the use of pesticides. Sixteen harrier hounds were available for this study, however only six dogs were selected for the actual trials after initial training. There were four trials, in which the dogs had to detect four different stimuli (dog food A, <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae, cockroaches and dog food B). Each run evaluated whether the dog could identify the target pottle out of six pottles. The other five pottles were empty. A dog completed six runs each day over five days for food A and over three days for the other three stimuli. Therefore there were a total of 30 runs for food A and 18 runs {{for the rest of}} the stimuli. A run was considered successful when the dog found the target pottle on the first try (i. e. first pass around the circle) without any false positives (sitting at a pottle that did not contain the stimulus). The dogs were able to identify dog food A and B with an average success of 74. 5 % and 78. 9 % respectively. The detection rate for dog food was significantly higher than would be expected if the dogs were selecting pottles at random (z ≥ 1. 64, p < 0. 05). However they were unable to identify either the <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae or cockroaches, with an average success of only 27. 7 % and 45. 5 % respectively. These results indicate that the dogs were incapable of detecting <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae. This could be due to several reasons such as dog breed, learning inflexibility, handler influences and methodology. The dogs used may have not been the best choice for this experiment, however they were chosen based on availability. The dogs were trained first on food before the insect trials, hence they may not have been able to create a new association between the reinforcer and insect stimuli. The handler and her techniques may have influenced the dogs to select the target pottle unintentionally (e. g. longer pauses at the target pottle) as there was a higher success rate for formal tests compared to blind tests (in which the handler did not know where the target pottle was) (Z = - 3. 5, p = 0. 0005). Future studies could look at the ability of other dog breeds to detect <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles.</b> More research should be done on the effects of temperament in scent detection dogs. Future research could investigate if detector dogs can differentiate between different <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> species and if they are able to detect <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> in the field (i. e. in museums or houses) ...|$|R
