5|$|The Fundamental Duties {{are defined}} as the moral {{obligations}} of all citizens to help promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India.

50|$|Briefly, aspects {{are ways}} of being {{meaningful}} and are the 'law side' of created reality. All that occurs does so <b>by</b> 'answering to' <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of each aspect (i.e. being subject to their laws). e.g. physical waves or particles occur <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of <b>the</b> physical aspect, poetry occurs <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> of <b>the</b> aesthetic aspect. Thus, each aspect or 'law sphere' {{may be seen as}} defining a distinct kind of possibility.|$|R

The bill, which {{proposed}} to remove legal immunity was approved by six out of nine sultans—but saw stiff opposition from three, two of which included the Ismail Petra, the Sultan of Kelantan and the Sultan Iskandar himself. Sultan Iskandar took up the initiative to obtain more royal support to stall {{the implementation of the}} proposed bill. The bill, which proposed to strip rulers and members of the royal families of legal immunity, would make them prosecutable <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> in any cases of proven criminal wrongdoings.|$|E

5|$|A {{person can}} obtain more {{or all of}} the {{categories}} at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E

5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E

5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000s, Cloverleaf {{tried to}} sell Rosecroft {{multiple}} times. In mid-2002, several buyers {{became interested in the}} track, but Cloverleaf was involved in lawsuits, so the track could not be sold. One bidder was Peter Angelos, the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, but he withdrew in 2005. All the lawsuits were resolved in 2006, and only one remaining bidder was left—Penn National Gaming. Maryland passed a casino bill in 2007, but Rosecroft was not one of the locations sanctioned for expanded gambling <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> As a result, Penn National lost its interest in Rosecroft and decided not to purchase the track. From the gambling revenue, 7 percent goes to the horse-racing industry.|$|E

After escaping and smuggling himself as a corpse, the Joker kills Gambol and takes over his gang. The mob ultimately decides to take the Joker up on his offer.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{chromate}} {{is produced}} industrially by the oxidative roasting of chromite ore with calcium or sodium carbonate.

The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of potassium chromate. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex oxyanions of chromium is possible.|$|E

CBO estimated that subsidies paid under the law in 2016 averaged $4,240 per person for 10 million individuals receiving them, roughly $42 billion. For scale, the subsidy for the employer market, {{in the form of}} exempting from taxation those health insurance premiums paid on behalf of employees by employers, was approximately $1,700 per person in 2016, or $266 billion total in the employer market. The employer market subsidy was not changed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
