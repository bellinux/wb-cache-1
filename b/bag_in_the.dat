25|$|A {{inverter}} or capsizing {{line can}} {{be attached to the}} top of the bag. This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the <b>bag</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. An inverter line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.|$|E

500|$|Mendes' {{dominating}} visual {{style was}} deliberate and composed, with a minimalist design that provided [...] "a sparse, almost surreal feeling—a bright, crisp, hard edged, near Magritte-like take on American suburbia"; Mendes constantly directed his set dressers {{to empty the}} frame. He made Lester's fantasy scenes [...] "more fluid and graceful", and Mendes made minimal use of steadicams, feeling that stable shots generated more tension. For example, when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnhams' dinner table, he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters. He {{wanted to keep the}} tension in the scene, so he only cut away when Jane left the table. Mendes did use a hand-held camera for the scene in which Col. Fitts beats Ricky. Mendes said the camera provided the scene with a [...] "kinetic off-balance energy". He also went hand-held for the excerpts of Ricky's camcorder footage. Mendes {{took a long time to}} get the quality of Ricky's footage to the level he wanted. For the plastic-bag footage, Mendes used wind machines to move the <b>bag</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. The scene took four takes; two by the second unit did not satisfy Mendes, so he shot the scene himself. He felt his first take lacked grace, but for the last attempt, he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground. Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag.|$|E

40|$|Sodium {{chlorite}} {{increased the}} degradability of fibre {{from a range}} of mature grass forages including barley straw by 40 – 50 digestibility units when comparisons were made using ground (1 mm sieve) material incubated either in vitro with cellulase or <b>in</b> nylon <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rumen. However, when fed to sheep, chlorite-treated barley straw was digested to a similar degree to untreated straw (49 and 57 % respectively), but intake was significantly reduced (385 and 790 g/day respectively). <b>The</b> poor <b>in</b> vivo utilization of chlorite-treated straw coincided with high proportions of propionic to acetic acid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rumen (0 – 85, cf. 0. 28 with untreated feed) and absence of rumen fungi. Rumen pH and ammonia concentrations were not significantly different between diets. When incubated <b>in</b> nylon <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rumen of animals fed the corresponding diet, both untreated and treated straw (< 1 mm) were well colonized with microorganisms, as measured by cystine accumulation which showed peaks on the fibres after 24 and 72 h. While large numbers of fungal sporangia were observed after 24 h incubation on digests from untreated forage, no fungi could be detected on the chlorite-treated material. Cystine accumulation on the untreated straw after 72 h was not associated with a secondary growth of fungi. Although barley straw chaff, ground (< 1 mm) after treatment with chlorite, was highly degraded <b>in</b> nylon <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rumen and with cellulase in vitro, larger particles (1 cm) suspended <b>in</b> nylon <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> an animal fed chlorite-treated straw actually gained weight, probably due <b>in</b> part to <b>the</b> degree of microbial colonization...|$|R

The French have a similar word, malle for a trunk or large box, and mála is the Irish term for a <b>bag.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, the word mail began to appear as a reference for a bag that contained letters: [...] "bag full of letter" [...] (1654). Over the next hundred years the word mail began to be applied strictly to the letters themselves, and the sack as the mailbag. In the 19th century the British usually referred to mail as being letters that were being sent abroad (i.e. on a ship), and post as letters that were for localized delivery; in the UK the Royal Mail delivers the post, while in the U.S. the U.S. Postal Service delivers the mail.
