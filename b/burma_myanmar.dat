5|$|Linda {{weakened}} further {{over the}} mountainous terrain of the Malay Peninsula, and the storm emerged into the Andaman Sea with winds of 50mph (85km/h). This made Linda the first tropical cyclone since Tropical Storm Forrest in 1992 to cross {{from the western}} Pacific Ocean into the Indian Ocean. Additionally, upon reaching the Indian Ocean, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the storm as Cyclonic Storm BOB 08, with winds of 40mph (70km/h). With warm waters, Tropical Storm Linda gradually re-intensified as it slowed down, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. On November 6, it again attained typhoon status while located off the southwest coast of <b>Burma</b> (<b>Myanmar).</b> Initially, it was expected to cross the Bay of Bengal and make landfall near the India/Bangladesh border. The cyclone only maintained peak strength for 18hours, due {{to an increase in}} wind shear from a mid-latitude trough. Linda's motion became nearly stationary, and it gradually weakened for several days. On November 9, Linda dissipated about 375 miles (600km) southwest of Yangon, Burma. That day, the IMD also terminated advisories.|$|E
