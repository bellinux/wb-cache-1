25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the human milk supply, thus farmers must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E
500|$|He {{formed a}} company to sell {{products}} related to his teachings called Eckhart Teachings. [...] He created a website called Eckhart Tolle TV, with streaming video of monthly group meditations and other videos. [...] He gives speeches and workshops in English and occasionally in German or Spanish. He also travels for various speaking engagements, such as seminars and retreats. In a 2003 interview with the Telegraph Magazine, Tolle indicated {{that he had no}} intention of creating [...] "a heavy commercial structure", [...] nor of setting up an ashram or centre. He believes one [...] "could develop organically" [...] and said [...] "one needs to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> the organization doesn’t become self-serving".|$|E
500|$|For {{the guitar}} sound, the group tried to balance Grohl's [...] "playing the rhythm {{straight}} up the middle", Shiflett's [...] "sharp and clean sense of melodic playing", and Smear's more aggressive sound, with Grohl declaring that [...] "with three guitars, {{you have to}} <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> it doesn't become a huge fucking mess. But when everybody's playing their thing really well, it sounds perfectly orchestrated." [...] Smear would usually play his parts on a baritone guitar, which would both contrast with Grohl and Shiflett and add a heavier sound - as Grohl declared, [...] "if we ever felt like a section wasn't heavy enough, we put the fuckin' baritone on it, and it became huge." [...] Hawkins added many buzz rolls to his drum fills {{at the suggestion of}} Vig, as buzz rolls were a trademark of one of the producer's favorite drummers, Ian Paice.|$|E

500|$|The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster {{was used}} as the {{location}} for the wedding. The scenes were shot in the old nave of the church, which was surrounded by [...] "rough-hewn sandstone and glowing stained glass windows." [...] Liz Guiver, the former vicar's secretary and administrator, revealed that many of the church's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set. Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age, Guiver recalled [...] "The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, so we had to <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday. Then we waited for months until the episode was aired, and most parishioners were glued to the set." [...] Scenes featuring the character's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively. Recalling the shoot, Donovan told the Herald Suns Nui Te Koha, [...] "I don't remember that particular day well, but when you do set ups like weddings it takes a long, long time to put things together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Individuals must <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> their {{physical}} endowments, such as brawn and stamina, {{are similar in}} number, or the borrowed brawn may literally tear the body apart (for example). This could happen to individuals who choose poorly {{in the balance of}} endowments or who have only certain forcibles available, but the more usual cause is the death of one or more dedicates, resulting in the loss of their attributes. Such individuals are sometimes referred to as [...] "warriors of unfortunate proportion." ...|$|E
2500|$|For the film's opening crawl, Lucas {{originally}} wrote {{a composition}} consisting of six paragraphs with four sentences each. He said, [...] "The crawl {{is such a}} hard thing {{because you have to}} <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem." [...] Lucas showed his draft to his friends. Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: [...] "The crawl at the beginning looks like it was written on a driveway. It goes on forever. It's gibberish." [...] Lucas recounted what De Palma said {{the first time he saw}} it: [...] "George, you're out of your mind! Let me sit down and write this for you." [...] De Palma helped to edit the text into the form used in the film.|$|E

[...] Her face was glowing. She {{was full of}} odd, {{delightful}} fancies to-night. She kissed her hand to the gloaming; no, not to the gloaming--to the little hunted, anxious girl she had been.|$|R

60|$|Mr Mountchesney blamed her for {{not taking}} him. He liked music, singing, {{especially}} female singing; when there was so little to amuse him, he was surprised that Lady Maud had not <b>been</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> {{he should have been}} present. His sister-in-law reminded him that she had particularly requested him to drive her over to Mowbray, and he had declined the honour as a bore.|$|R
50|$|Amir Barid {{was very}} clever. He put Mahmud's son Ahmad on the throne. Amir Barid <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> king should {{not leave the}} palace {{and set out to}} spoil his life and morals. The new Sultan was forced to break up the ancient crown of the Bahmanis, worth 15 lakhs of Rupees and sell the jewels to provide himself with the means of ease and pleasure. He died on Dec 15, 1520.|$|R

He retained the name Pyu for his kingdom although it was {{under the leadership of}} the Burmans. He showed regard for the Mons, and encouraged his people to learn from the Mons.|$|R

50|$|The British who governed Hong Kong {{remained}} {{mindful of}} the nearby People's Republic of China (PRC), which not only had substantial business entities located in the city, but also controlled its water supply. Accordingly, de Silva <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> the CIA not upset the delicate, prevailing balance the British had constructed. Nonetheless the CIA conducted espionage activities that targeted the mainland. These met with little success, the PRC then being territory very difficult for foreign intelligence to penetrate.|$|R

60|$|Melbury <b>was</b> <b>careful</b> <b>that</b> {{the turnout}} should be seemly. The gig-wheels, for instance, {{were not always}} washed during winter-time before a journey, the muddy roads {{rendering}} that labor useless; but they were washed to-day. The harness was blacked, and when the rather elderly white horse had been put in, and Winterborne was in his seat ready to start, Mr. Melbury stepped out with a blacking-brush, and with his own hands touched over the yellow hoofs of the animal.|$|R

60|$|There {{was nothing}} that she could say to comfort him. She had {{altogether}} mistaken {{the nature of the}} man's regard, and had even mistaken {{the very nature of the}} man.

Now she could only wait till he should again have got strength to hide his suffering under the veil of his own manliness.|$|R
