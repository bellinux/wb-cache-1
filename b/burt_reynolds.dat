5|$|It was {{initially}} decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner {{was hired as}} director. Robert Redford was offered a large sum, but felt he was too famous. <b>Burt</b> <b>Reynolds</b> also turned down the role, while Sylvester Stallone was interested, but nothing ever came of it. Paul Newman was offered his choice of roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4million, turning down all three roles.|$|E

5|$|Tightrope (1984) had Eastwood {{starring}} opposite Geneviève Bujold in {{a provocative}} thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism. Tightrope {{was a critical}} and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat (1984) alongside <b>Burt</b> <b>Reynolds,</b> a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E
5|$|Casting {{the film}} proved troublesome, {{particularly}} for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned Robert Mitchum as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind. Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with Dustin Hoffman, who eventually departed over differences in vision. Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the Star Wars films, Ford's interest in the Blade Runner story, and discussions with Steven Spielberg who was finishing Raiders of the Lost Ark {{at the time and}} strongly praised Ford's work in the film. Following his success in films like Star Wars (1977) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth. According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including Gene Hackman, Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Al Pacino, and <b>Burt</b> <b>Reynolds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following Rhoda, Kavner had a guest {{appearance}} on Taxi and {{appeared in the}} 1985 comedy Bad Medicine {{as well as the}} 1987 film Surrender, both of which were box office failures. She appeared in the television movies Revenge of the Stepford Wives, No Other Love and A Fine Romance, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had to be You at a dinner theater in Canada, Particular Friendships in New York City in 1981, and Two for the Seesaw, directed by <b>Burt</b> <b>Reynolds.</b> Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while he was watching Rhoda in the 1970s. He thought that she was remarkable and later offered her a role in his 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli and Saltzman {{tried to}} {{convince}} Sean Connery to return as James Bond, but he declined. At the same time United Artists approached both Batman actor Adam West and <b>Burt</b> <b>Reynolds.</b> Reynolds told the studios that Bond should be played by an Englishman and turned the offer down. Among the actors to test for the part of Bond were Julian Glover, John Gavin, Jeremy Brett, Simon Oates, John Ronane, and William Gaunt. The main frontrunner for the role was Michael Billington. United Artists was still pushing to cast an American to play Bond but producer Albert R. Broccoli insisted that the part should be played by a British actor and put forward Roger Moore. After Moore was chosen, Billington remained {{on the top of}} the list in the event that Moore would decline to come back for the next film. Billington ultimately played a brief role in the pre-credit sequence of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Moore, who had been considered by the producers before both Dr. No and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was ultimately cast. He tried not to imitate either Connery's or his own prior performance as Simon Templar in The Saint, and Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay into Moore's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light-hearted approach to Bond.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, <b>Burt</b> <b>Reynolds</b> and Mick Jagger were {{considered}} to portray Fletch but these suggestions were rejected by Mcdonald.
