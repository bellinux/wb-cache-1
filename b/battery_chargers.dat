5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, <b>battery</b> <b>chargers,</b> miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E
25|$|The General Electric Tungar {{rectifier}} was a mercury vapor (ex.:5B24) or argon (ex.:328) gas-filled electron tube {{device with}} a tungsten filament cathode and a carbon button anode. It operated similarly to the thermionic vacuum tube diode, but the {{gas in the}} tube ionized during forward conduction, giving it a much lower forward voltage drop so it could rectify lower voltages. It was used for <b>battery</b> <b>chargers</b> and similar applications from the 1920s until lower-cost metal rectifiers, and later semiconductor diodes, supplanted it. These were made up to a few hundred volts and a few amperes rating, and in some sizes strongly resembled an incandescent lamp with an additional electrode.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the episode}} relied on props. The waterbed, which was {{purchased}} by Morris Fletcher earlier in the sixth season episode [...] "Dreamland" [...] while in Mulder's body, {{proved to be the}} hardest prop to locate. Stepeck searched Los Angeles and was unable to find a suitable bed. He had to order the bed from a specialized furniture store in San Francisco. Mulder's paycheck and envelope were created after several calls to the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. The checks were made to be as realistic as possible without looking too convincing. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, the police cruisers were all turned off, because the combined noise of the cars would drown out dialogue.

30|$|Customer {{satisfaction}} of BSS {{is closely related}} with the swapping service ability and fee. The quantity of the <b>batteries,</b> <b>chargers</b> and the swapping robots affect BSS capability to meet the swapping demand.

30|$|The model {{combines}} both long-term facilities configuration {{and short-term}} operation strategies optimization with maximizing profit of BSS under different stochastic scenarios of BSS operation environments. Though, coordinated operation and facilities configuration optimization model for EV charging stations are already published on some studies such as [19] and [20], {{there are few}} published works specifically on swapping stations. Previous component capacity planning works for swapping station only consider and deal with battery configuration problem. The jointed configuration problem for both <b>batteries</b> and <b>chargers</b> are investigated recently, such as models in [13] and [21]. This paper further conducts on configuration problems for <b>batteries,</b> <b>chargers</b> and swapping robots together.|$|R
500|$|Initially {{there were}} two {{services}} per hour, but this quickly {{turned out to be}} too little. However, because of World War I and problems receiving supplies from Germany, it was not until November that all five trams were delivered and a 15-minute headway could be introduced. The company also started purchasing land to allow a future double track and widening of the loading gauge to allow for the wide trams used on the Holmenkollen Line. Also four services per hour proved to be too little. The company had chosen to electrify the line at 1,200 volts instead of the 600 volts used {{in the rest of the}} tram network, so the company could not operate rented trams from other operators. The junction between the two networks at Oslo Hospital had a [...] section without overhead wires. This allowed both of the pantographs to not touch their wire when the current was switched. When changing between the currents, the lighting, heating, compressor and <b>battery</b> <b>chargers</b> all had to be manually changed with a switch.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases where}} ripple voltage is insignificant, like <b>battery</b> <b>chargers,</b> the input filter {{may be a}} single series {{resistor}} to adjust the output voltage to that required by the circuit. [...] A resistor reduces both output voltage and ripple voltage proportionately. [...] A disadvantage of a resistor input filter is that it consumes power {{in the form of}} waste heat that is not available to the load, so it is employed only in low current circuits.|$|E
2500|$|These {{consisted}} of a resonant reed, vibrated by an alternating magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet, with contacts that reversed {{the direction of the}} current on the negative half cycles. [...] They were used in low power devices, such as <b>battery</b> <b>chargers,</b> to rectify the low voltage produced by a step-down transformer. [...] Another use was in battery power supplies for portable vacuum tube radios, to provide the high DC voltage for the tubes. [...] These operated as a mechanical version of modern solid state switching inverters, with a transformer to step the battery voltage up, and a set of vibrator contacts on the transformer core, operated by its magnetic field, to repeatedly break the DC battery current to create a pulsing AC to power the transformer. [...] Then a second set of rectifier contacts on the vibrator rectified the high AC voltage from the transformer secondary to DC.|$|E

30|$|The {{planning}} model objective for a BSS is {{to maximize}} the net profit for providing battery swapping services, which can be calculated by income, fixed cost and variable cost. The income includes the swapping service fees. The fixed cost includes the expenses to allocate facilities like <b>batteries,</b> <b>chargers</b> and swapping robots. The variable cost includes the energy charge paid for the electricity {{which is used to}} charge batteries mainly, these electricity can come from power system or the PV supplier.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the general}} life {{term for the}} two way radio is 5 to 7 years and 1 to 2 years for its {{accessories}} but still the usage, atmosphere and environment {{plays a major role}} to decide its life term (radios are often deployed in harsh environments where more fragile communication equipment such as phones and tablets may fail). There are so many speculations on the life term of two way radios and their accessories i.e. <b>batteries,</b> <b>chargers,</b> head set etc.|$|R
2500|$|In 1895, {{he founded}} the Lincoln Electric Company in Cleveland, Ohio with a capital {{investment}} of $200.00. Lincoln used the facilities of his company to do research and to experiment with the electrical devices which he invented. The main product of the company was electric motors of his own design. He was directly responsible for 55 patents which gained him national fame as an industrialist. Lincoln helped finance the education of his brother James F. Lincoln who joined him upon his graduation in 1907, as the sales director of the company. The product line of the company expanded and included <b>battery</b> <b>chargers</b> for electric automobiles. In 1914, James F. Lincoln headed and supervised the company as general manager. This in turn gave Lincoln {{the time that he}} needed to continue with his research, experiments and inventions. The first variable voltage, single operator, portable welding machine in the world was introduced by the Lincoln Electric Co. in 1911. Lincoln created and patented [...] a flux. The flux made a weld as flexible as steel. The shielded arc welding process developed by Lincoln [...] {{played an important role in}} the manufacture of merchant ships in World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Thermionic diode {{rectifiers}} {{were widely}} used in power supplies in vacuum tube consumer electronic products, such as phonographs, radios, and televisions, for example the All American Five radio receiver, to provide the high DC plate voltage needed by other vacuum tubes. [...] "Full-wave" [...] versions with two separate plates were popular because they could be used with a center-tapped transformer to make a full-wave rectifier. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers were made for very high voltages, such as the {{high voltage power supply}} for the cathode ray tube of television receivers, and the kenotron used for power supply in X-ray equipment. [...] However, compared to modern semiconductor diodes, vacuum tube rectifiers have high internal resistance due to space charge and therefore high voltage drops, causing high power dissipation and low efficiency. [...] They are rarely able to handle currents exceeding 250mA owing to the limits of plate power dissipation, and cannot be used for low voltage applications, [...] such as <b>battery</b> <b>chargers.</b> Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that the configuration number of robots, <b>batteries</b> and <b>chargers</b> are all larger under multi-swapping demand scenarios and the annual profit when considering multi-scenarios is lower compared to typical daily scenario configuration solution. But it should be concerned that the optimal configuration while considering multi-swapping demand scenarios in our model is much more flexible because the extreme swapping demand like more concentrated in the temporal dimension and larger swapping demand in festival days is taken into account. The difference of configuration means {{that in order to}} meet the demand in extreme scenarios, more facilities should be equipped in BSS which results in there are a large number of <b>batteries</b> and <b>chargers</b> idled on other days like workdays. Therefore, how to use a good mechanism such as time of use price for swapping service fee to shape swapping demand more smooth to avoid these low-utilized facilities investment and improve BSS economic is an essential and meaningful problem needed to be investigated.|$|R
