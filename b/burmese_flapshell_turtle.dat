5000|$|The <b>Burmese</b> <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> {{lives in}} the Irrawaddy and Salween rivers of Myanmar, and occurs in northeastern Thailand, and {{possibly}} in Yunnan Province, China (Kuchling, 1995). It has an olive-brown to brown carapace with some dark spotting (in juveniles) or reticulations (in adults), and the first peripheral is smaller than the second. The head is olive to brown with an indistinct dark stripe extending backward from each orbit and another passing backward between the orbits. Some experts {{believe it to be}} a subspecies of Lissemys punctata rather than its own species.https://web.archive.org/web/20110717025939/http://ip30.eti.uva.nl/bis/turtles.php?menuentry=soorten&id=222 ...|$|E

50|$|The Indian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Lissemys punctata) is a {{freshwater}} {{species of}} turtle found in South Asia. The “flap-shelled” name {{stems from the}} presence of femoral flaps located on the plastron. These flaps of skin cover the limbs when they retract into the shell. It is unclear what protection the flaps offer against predators. Indian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtles</b> are widespread and common in the South Asian provinces.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle</b> {{is known}} to be omnivorous. Its diet {{consists}} of frogs, fishes, shrimp, snails, aquatic vegetation, plant leaves, flowers, fruits, grasses, and seeds.|$|R
50|$|The Zambezi <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Cycloderma frenatum) is {{a species}} of {{softshell}} turtle (family Trionychidae). Within its family, {{it belongs to the}} smaller and exclusively Old World subfamily, the Cyclanorbinae.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle</b> {{was placed}} in Appendix II of CITES in 1975 {{at the request of}} Bangladesh. However, L. p. punctata was the taxon listed, not L. p. andersoni. Subsequent reviews of the {{literature}} and available data could find no evidence to support this endangered status. Some scientists now classify L. p. punctata and L. p. andersoni as a single subspecies. This subspecies is the most common aquatic turtle in India. Consequently, the Indian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle</b> was removed from the endangered species list in 1983 (48 FR 52740). This action, however, did not affect the turtle's status on Appendix II of CITES.|$|R

40|$|Spotted <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> Lissemys punctata {{was found}} in all types of {{habitats}} of Bangladesh. Of the 9 categories of habitats studied, the highest number (17. 42 %) of the turtle species {{was found in}} marshland followed by puddles (17. 26 %), agriculture fields (17. 12 %), streams (12. 1 %), canals (10. 54 %), tanks (10. 39 %), derelict ponds (9. 18 %) and domestic ponds (6. 08 %). Most {{of the time the}} turtle was found in burrowing condition (55. 83 %), rarely it was observed in feeding (7. 2 %) condition. The turtle seem to have a considerably higher tolerant in all types of environment, so {{it may be possible to}} set-up turtle farm commercially in Bangladesh.

Around 10 species of mammals, 90 species of birds, 25 species of reptiles and amphibians, 56 species of butterflies, 20 different dragonflies and 30 species of fish have been identified so far.|$|R
50|$|In many South Asia provinces, {{freshwater}} turtles and their eggs {{are commonly used}} {{as a source of}} food. As a result, these turtles are often exploited as a source of profit. In Bangladesh and India, this is especially evident as the Indian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle</b> is larger and has more meat than other turtles in the area. The value of this meat along with the efforts in the conservation of this species has driven the price of meat higher and has led to an increase in the illegal international exploitation and killing of these animals. Changes to the turtle's natural habitat by the construction of dams and barrages, cultivation along river banks, and pollution are also major threats to the survival of this turtle.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the breeding season, gonadal development, egg laying period, clutch size and other biological aspects of spotted <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtle,</b> Lissemys punctata, of Bangladesh between January 1997 and December 2001. The egg laying period of L. punctata, was found between August and March. The nesting sites were elevated fallow lands in secluded areas. The female turtle laid all the mature eggs at a time for each clutch at night. A gravid female turtle laid three clutches of eggs in each year and the mean clutch size was 13. 0 ± 1. 9 eggs and mean weight of each egg was 10. 3 ± 1. 3 g. The eggs are spherical in shape and whitish in color. The mean incubation period was 173 ± 34 days (range 119 – 225 days). The incubation period of first clutch was the longest than the second and third clutches. Hatching success was found 41 %. Maximum hatching was observed in June. The present investigation was made to explore the possibility to raise turtle farming in captive condition. The findings would, hopefully, help to rear the species and to assess the commercial potentiality of turtle farming in captive condition, that is, in the eco-climatic condition of Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{patterns}} of shell reduction in turtles is relevant when examining both fossils and living forms. The soft-shelled turtles (Trionychidae) are characterized by the general reduction of the peripheral bony elements of the carapace, and some species possess structures of contested homology. By examining Remane's ‘principal criteria’, we addressed the primary homology of the prenuchal and the posterior peripheral ossicles (= PPOs) of the Asian <b>flapshell</b> <b>turtles,</b> Lissemys spp., thus evaluating their topological equivalence, their structural quality, {{and the presence of}} intermediate forms in ontogeny and phylogeny. We conducted an analysis of gross morphology, bone histology, and ontogeny of these elements in a large sample of living and fossil trionychids and their sister-group, the carettochelyids. We conclude that the prenuchal comprises a neomorphic structure that does not fulfil any of the homology criteria examined. The assessment of the homology of PPOs is less straightforward {{because of the presence of}} partly conflicting evidence. Nevertheless, PPOs and standard peripherals share an antero-posterior polarity of the ossification pattern, which we interpret as a significant shared underlying developmental pattern. Depending on the phylogenetic position of Lissemys in trionychid phylogeny, the hypothesis of PPOs homology with standard peripherals is a straightforward one or, alternatively, one involving homologous developmental processes at other levels of the hierarchy, resulting in similar microstructural characteristics of these bony shell features. In this respect, we consider the antero-posterior polarity of the ossification pattern of both PPOs and standard peripherals as providing potential evidence for the homology of the genetic control regulating the expression of both these structures, and therefore we interpret these structures as homologues on the basis of a deeply homologous underlying developmental process...|$|R
