40|$|The {{advent of}} iteratively decodable codes has allowed a {{decrease}} in tolerable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in magnetic recording systems, which typically translates into {{an increase in the}} recording densities. However, at such low SNRs, conventional timing recovery loops suffer from frequent cycle slips. Typical timing recovery loops in magnetic recording applications perform data detection, timing error detection, and loop filtering in a sequential manner. This sequence of operations in the timing recovery loop performs well if the timing error is {{a small fraction of the}} <b>bit</b> <b>interval.</b> However, in the cycle-slip regions, the timing error is comparable to the <b>bit</b> <b>interval,</b> and the loop fails. In this paper, we represent the timing error in magnetic recording systems by using a Markov model that does not confine the timing error to only small fractions of the <b>bit</b> <b>interval.</b> By utilizing such a model, we give a trellis representation of the timing error process. The trellis representation permits the formulations of two optimal baud-rate timing recovery loops, according to two optimality criteria. We prove that both optimality criteria lead to solutions similar to the classical first-order phase-locked loop. The new loops do not perform data detection, timing error detection, and loop filtering in a sequential manner. Instead, the loops perform data detection and timing error detection jointly on a trellis, without the need for a loop filter. Simulation results show that the new timing recovery loops outperform the standard second-order baud-rate Mueller and Müller phase-locked loop with fine-tuned loop parameters. This performance gain is substantial if the timing error process is extremely noisy or if there is residual frequency offset resulting from inaccurate acquisition from the sector preamble on a disk drive.

However, Multi-h codes exhibiting a long constraint length invariably also exhibit a large denominator q. Since traditional methods for synchronising Multi-h signals utilises a q-th power law device, where the frequency spectrum of the qth power of the signal renders all the necessary frequencies for synchronisation, we suspect that a large q could be detrimental. When simulated, {{it turns out that}} the qth power law device fails to deliver distinct (and useable) frequency components at a q size of about 8. Unfortunately, the most useful codes have denominators starting at a size of q equals 32. This called for a novel approach to synchronisation. One device that shows much potential is the new Massey-Hodgart coherent MSK demodulator. In a significant departure from standard quadrature structures, this MSK demodulator uses matched filter detection with a pair of reference signals at the two MSK signaling frequencies; an optimal maximum-likelihood bit decision is then formed over two <b>bit</b> <b>intervals.</b> The reference signals are recovered by a pair of decision-switched Costas loops, which are tightly integrated with the demodulator structure.

We propose two MBDD schemes {{that are based on}} a recent continuous phase modulation interpretation of SOQPSK. We show that the performance of these MBDD schemes approaches that of coherent detection (CD) as the multiple-bit observation window N increases. The first scheme uses a detection window that spans the full N-bit observation window (F-MBDD), and is shown to require very large values of N to approach the performance of CD. This presents a practical problem since the complexity of MBDD grows exponentially with N. The second scheme is an improved version (I-MBDD) with a detection window that is shortened to N − 2 <b>bit</b> <b>intervals.</b> Although the complexity of I-MBDD also increases exponentially with N, it represents a significant improvement since only modest values of N are needed for high performance. These performance characteristics are identified via a detailed performance analysis, which provides asymptotic formulas for the bit error probability that are confirmed with computer simulations. The analysis is also used to find the symmetric frequency pulse shapes with the best and worst error performance.

40|$|A 2 D RAKE {{receiver}} for a direct-sequence {{spread spectrum}} communications {{system is a}} space-time processor that cancels strong multi-user access interference while optimally combining multipath for the desired user.

The interference alone space-time correlation matrix is estimated during that portion of the <b>bit</b> <b>interval</b> away from the “fingers”. The weight vector yielding the optimum signal to interference plus noise ratio for bit decisions is the “largest” generalized eigenvector of the resulting matrix pencil. However, even when the number of elements comprising the array is relatively small, this space-time correlation matrix pencil is of very large dimension. In addition to detracting from the real-time applicability of the scheme, this also causes a slow convergence rate. A reduced dimension blind space-time 2 D RAKE receiver is presented based on a novel frequency domain implementation of a RAKE receiver and a data adaptive transformation to a lower dimension beamspace that contains most of the desired user 2 ̆ 7 s energy. An adaptation of the scheme for the IS- 95 uplink is then presented. We present a decision directed variation of the aforementioned blind 2 D RAKE receiver that reliably estimates which Walsh function was sent for every six transmission bits.

Schemes for the joint angle-of-arrival and time delay estimation of the dominant multipaths are also proposed.

To fully exploit the energy beamforming gain at the energy transmitter (ET), the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is essential, which, however, is difficult to be obtained in practice due to the hardware limitation of the energy receiver (ER).
