5|$|Specifically, {{the video}} {{opens with a}} <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{basketball}} in his bag walking out of a car park. The basketball then begins to bounce out of the bag, {{jumps out of the}} city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} any variation {{that might}} occur {{due to the}} type of assessment and source used to assess them, the prevalence of 7 anxiety disorders were investigated in a sample of 140 <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 50 non-ASD (NASD) boys via the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory and the KIDSCID Clinical Interview. <b>Boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD were significantly more anxious than their NASD peers. Data collected from the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD themselves showed differences in the severity and diagnostic criterion of anxiety disorders to data collected from the boys’ parents. There were age-related variations to the pattern of anxiety disorder differences across reports from the <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD and reports from their parents...|$|R

Over its 100-year existence, it has been referenced in stories and songs, as well as having a music contest and a microbrew named after it.|$|E
5|$|The {{developer}} and {{producer of the}} original Metroid for the Nintendo Entertainment System – Nintendo Research & Development 1 (Nintendo R) and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Metroid II. The developers of the game added round metal shoulders on Samus' Varia Suit to differentiate it from her Power Suit, since both looked similar on the Game Boy's limited greyscale display. The updated suit has since been {{a staple of the}} series, appearing in all subsequent games. A unique color palette for Metroid II was added to the Game Boy Color console, a successor to the original Game <b>Boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> color screen.|$|E

5|$|A cold open shows Trey Atwood (Bradley Stryker) and {{his brother}} Ryan {{stealing}} a car. The police chase and arrest the boys, resulting in a prison term for Trey and a short stay in juvenile hall for the underage Ryan. A conversation between Ryan and his public defender, Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), establishes Ryan as a smart <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rough upbringing; he has three truancies and two suspensions, but his SAT I scores are in the ninety-eighth percentile. When Ryan's mother, Dawn (Daphne Ashbrook), collects Ryan, Sandy gives his business card to the boy. At home in Chino, Dawn asks Ryan to leave, and her boyfriend, A.J. (Ron Del Barrio), expels him from the house. Standing at a payphone with nowhere to go, Ryan calls Sandy for help. As Sandy drives Ryan to his house in Newport Beach, the opening credits and the theme tune play—unlike the other episodes, there is no title sequence.|$|E
5|$|A hunchback {{fisherman}} finds a {{young girl}} tied to a mast, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, and raises her into womanhood {{with the intention of}} making her his wife. Ten years pass and the woman, out of gratitude, promises to marry him. The hunchback hires a handsome stranger, the boy. The boy and the girl fall in love, but the girl refuses to marry him. The hunchback sees the two embrace and threatens the <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> knife. The next day, the three go fishing in the boat and an argument breaks out. During the argument the boat tips over and the girl is washed away. The hunchback and the boy search for her, until the boy becomes exhausted and collapses on the shore. The hunchback finds the girl on a rock and brings her ashore. As the two reunite, he sees how happy they are together and takes his leave.|$|E
5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree {{on his chest and}} back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters a little <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
40|$|In this master thesis I have {{examined}} three <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good relationship <b>with</b> reading and three <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bad relationship <b>with</b> reading, and studied {{factors that can}} contribute to either a good or <b>a</b> bad relationship <b>with</b> reading. The survey is based on qualitative interviews with the six informants, complementing <b>with</b> information from <b>a</b> reading test named Carlsten and information from the boys' teachers. The main topics studied were reading at home, reading at school, the boys' own thoughts about reading, communicating with others about reading and how the boys develop as readers. I focused on factors distinguishing <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good relationship <b>with</b> reading and <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bad relationship <b>with</b> reading – primarly among fifth to seventhgrade pupils in primary school. One {{of the most prominent}} results in the study is that boys are being socialized into different cultures of masculinity. Which culture of masculinity a boy is socialized in to, depends on his previous experiences with reading and the reading culture that he has at home, in school and in his social environment. The <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> good relationship <b>with</b> reading are socialized into a culture where reading is normalized and accepted as <b>an</b> activity. The <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bad relationship <b>with</b> reading are socialized into a culture where reading is valued inferior to other activities. This {{is one of the main}} reasons why boys in primary school have different relationships with reading...|$|R

5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E

25|$|Depictions of {{the five}} {{traditional}} senses as allegory became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among Dutch and Flemish Baroque painters.

40|$|To {{determine}} the relative validity of parent-assessed and self-assessed symptoms of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 140 <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were assessed for GAD {{by their parents}} and by themselves, and gave a sample of cortisol during the afternoon of these assessments. There were significant differences between self-assessments and parents’ assessments for the total GAD score and on four of the eight individual GAD symptoms. Using cortisol concentrations as a validation index, the two key GAD items were most validly assessed via boys’ self-ratings. Key GAD symptoms in <b>boys</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD may be best assessed from their self-reports rather than by their parents’ reports. Implications for clinical practice are discussed...|$|R
