A carpet-bag was on one side of him, and a box on the other. Books, papers, and {{articles}} of wearing apparel were scattered about the room. On a table, at one side of the door, stood the cage, so well known to me by description, which contained his white mice. The canaries and the cockatoo were probably in some other room. He was seated before the <b>box,</b> <b>packing</b> it, when I went in, and rose with some papers in his hand to receive me. His face still betrayed plain traces of the shock that had overwhelmed him at the Opera. His fat cheeks hung loose, his cold grey eyes were furtively vigilant, his voice, look, and manner were all sharply suspicious alike, as he advanced a step to meet me, and requested, with distant civility, that I would take a chair.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Puzzle Processor Project {{seeks to}} develop a {{special-purpose}} processor for efficiently solving {{a certain kind of}} puzzles. The puzzles are packing problems where a collection of pieces and a box are given with the goal to fit the pieces into the <b>box.</b> <b>Packing</b> problems appear both in recreational and in more serious settings, such as scheduling. First, we reformulate these packing problems in terms of set partitioning. Next, we derive an instruction set for the puzzle processor by transforming a backtrack program for set partitioning. Finally, we present and analyze a design for the puzzle processor expressed in Tangram, a VLSI-programming language developed at Philips Research Laboratories. Conclusions: We have shown how a general-purpose backtrack program for solving packing puzzles can be transformed systematically into a puzzlespecific program involving just a few computational primitives. This transformation can even be automated...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA natural {{generalization}} {{of the classical}} online bin packing problem is the dynamic bin packing problem introduced by Coffman et al. (1983) [7]. In this formulation, items arrive and depart and {{the objective is to}} minimize the maximal number of bins ever used over all times. We study the oriented multi-dimensional dynamic bin packing problem for two dimensions, three dimensions and multiple dimensions. Specifically, we consider dynamic packing of squares and rectangles into unit squares and dynamic packing of three-dimensional cubes and boxes into unit cubes. We also study dynamic d-dimensional hypercube and hyperbox packing. For dynamic d-dimensional <b>box</b> <b>packing</b> we define and analyze the algorithm NFDH for the offline problem and present a dynamic version. This algorithm was studied before for rectangle packing and for square packing and was generalized only for multi-dimensional cubes. We present upper and lower bounds for each of these cases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a combination of}} Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Tuning algorithm, for optimizing Three Dimensional (3 D) arbitrary sized heterogeneous <b>box</b> <b>packing</b> into a container, by considering practical constraints facing in the logistics industries. Objective {{of this research is}} to pack four different shapes of boxes of varying sizes into a container of standard dimension, without violating various practical constraints. Inorder to obtain a real time feasible packing pattern, Genetic Algorithm is developed to maximize the container volume utilization and inturn profit [9]. It significantly improves the search efficiency with less computational time and loads most of the heterogeneous boxes into the container by considering its optimal position and orientation. Tuning algorithm is used to decode the genetic output into user understandable sequential packing pattern and to fill the left-out empty space inside the container. In general, GA in conjunction with the tuning algorithm is substantially better than those obtained by applying heuristics to the bin packing directly...|$|E

Methods/Statistical Analysis: The Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA) is used to solve the 3 D single bin packing problem by getting the user input data such as number of bins, its size, shape, weight, and constraints if any along with standard container dimension. These inputs were stored in the database and encoded to string (chromosomes) format which were normally acceptable by AGA. Findings: The performance of the hybrid GA the Tuning algorithm is satisfactory and gives the feasible solution {{when compared with the}} other standard search algorithms. The minimum number of boxes left unloaded by using this algorithm will helps to validating the developed bin packing system. The developed Adaptive Genetic Algorithm was validated using the mathematical function. This research work is the good background of further development and analysis in this transportation domain of the following cases - Case 1 : Homogenous boxes of same dimensions: all the <b>boxes</b> <b>packed</b> without gap. Case 2 : Homogenous boxes of arbitrary dimensions: all the <b>boxes</b> <b>packed</b> with small gaps. Case 3 : Homogenous/Heterogeneous boxes of arbitrary dimensions: all the <b>boxes</b> <b>packed</b> with gaps.
