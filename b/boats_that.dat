5|$|Inshore {{lifeboats}} (ILBs) {{are smaller}} <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> operate {{closer to the}} shore and in shallower waters than ALBs. There are two classes, inflatables and RIBs capable of 25–40 knots. The RNLI's Inshore Lifeboat Centre at Cowes, Isle of Wight, has been building lifeboats since the 1960s and by 2015 had produced over 1,600.|$|E

5|$|Although widely {{praised by}} Canadian explorers, Halkett's designs had a limited market, {{and he was}} unable to persuade the Royal Navy that they would serve any useful purpose in general naval service. Efforts to market them as {{platforms}} for fishing and duck shooting failed, and they were commercially unsuccessful. Only two Halkett <b>boats,</b> <b>that</b> of Orcadian explorer John Rae, and one held in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum are known to survive today.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian Armistice in September 1943, two boats were scuttled by their crews. The four {{surviving}} Italian boats were taken over by German forces and commissioned in the Kriegsmarine (German Navy), serving largely in the Aegean Sea until they were finally scuttled in October 1944 as the Germans withdrew from Greece. The two <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> had escaped to the Allies in 1941 returned to Yugoslavia after the war. They were commissioned in the new Yugoslav Navy and remained in service until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|By sea: Banton is {{accessible}} via wooden launches and motorized <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> regularly travel from Lucena City, Quezon. Tourists and visitors {{can also take}} RORO vessels that ply the Manila-Odiongan, Batangas City-Odiongan, or the Roxas-Odiongan route. From Odiongan, Banton {{can be reached by}} jeepney and motorized boat via Calatrava, Romblon. Another RORO route is from Lucena City to Boac or Mogpog in Marinduque. From these towns, travelers can take jeepneys to Buenavista, which is only three hours away from Banton. Another alternative route is through Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro by motorized boats.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical blue men include {{that they may be}} a {{personification}} of the sea, or originate with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> might have resembled kayaks. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E

5|$|The first rescue {{resources}} {{to approach the}} crash site were CCGA volunteer units. These units were mostly privately owned fishing <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> operated out of Peggys Cove, Bayswater, and other harbours on St. Margaret's Bay and the Aspotogan Peninsula. They were soon joined by the dedicated Canadian Coast Guard SAR vessel CCGS Sambro, CH-124 Sea King helicopters flown by Airforce crews from 423 Maritime Helicopter Squadron (MHS) and 406 Maritime Operational Training Squadron (MOTS) out of CFB Shearwater and CH-113 Labrador SAR helicopters flown by the 413 Squadron from CFB Greenwood.|$|E
5|$|Total {{damage from}} Cyclone Althea {{amounted}} to just under A$120 million (1971), and the normalised damage total for 2012, {{which accounts for}} growth and inflation, was estimated at $648 million. Throughout the affected region, 257 people were treated for storm-related injuries, mostly inflicted by airborne debris; three people were killed. In Townsville, ten people were reported missing during the cyclone: nine on three <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> were unaccounted for, and one whose car {{was found in a}} swollen creek. They were all found safe.|$|E
5|$|A {{tenth of}} the city's {{workforce}} is employed at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, which is directly linked to the city's biggest industry, defence, with the headquarters of BAE Systems Surface Ships located in the city. BAE's Portsmouth shipyard has been awarded {{a share of the}} construction work on the two new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, with both aircraft carriers set to enter Portsmouth Harbour upon completion. A £100 million contract was signed to develop the facilities at Portsmouth that will be necessary to support the vessels. There is also a major ferry port that handles both passengers and cargo, and the city has a dedicated fishing fleet consisting of 20 to 30 <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> operate out of the camber docks in Camber Quay, Old Portsmouth. They land fresh fish and shellfish daily, most of which is sold at the quayside fish market.|$|E

5|$|Eight German-built s were {{purchased}} from Nazi Germany in the mid-to-late 1930s. Two escaped during {{the invasion of}} Yugoslavia in April 1941, and {{became part of the}} KJRM-in-exile. The remaining six were captured by the Italians and put into service by them under new designations. Two were scuttled by their crews {{at the time of the}} Italian capitulation in September 1943, and the remaining four were captured by the Germans and renamed. All four were scuttled at Salonika in October 1944. The <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> had escaped were transferred to the Yugoslav Navy at the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Eight former Austro-Hungarian s were {{transferred}} to the KJRM in 1921, and were the KJRM's only modern sea-going warships when it was formed. Two were lost or scrapped prior to World War II, and the rest were captured by the Italians during the 1941 Axis invasion and put into service by them. After the Italian capitulation, two were returned to the KJRM-in-exile. A further ship was sunk by German aircraft while still in Italian hands, and another was scuttled by her Italian crew. Of the remaining two, one {{was transferred to the}} Navy of the Independent State of Croatia and was sunk in 1944, and the other served in the German Navy as TA48 and was sunk in early 1945. The two <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> were returned to the KJRM-in-exile {{were transferred}} to the Yugoslav Navy {{at the end of the}} war and served as Golešnica and Cer.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August, one {{day after}} sinking Rosalie, Steinbrinck and the crew of UB-10 bettered their 30 June {{activities}} by sinking ten fishing smacks off Cromer. All ten ships, which ranged in size from 41 to 62 tons, were boarded and sunk by explosives. With these ten ships, the August tally for Steinbrinck and UB-10 was 7,309 tons, which accounted for {{nearly all of the}} 7,709 tons sunk by Flanders Flotilla <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> month. In addition, counting the ships sunk at the end of July, UB-10 sank 23 ships in a 13-day span, nearly half the 55 ships sunk by the flotilla in both July and August.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{passages}} were cleared, engineers had to construct ten heavy bridges (using MTU bridgelayers, TMM bridgelayers and pontoon bridges), five light bridges, ten pontoon bridges and 35 ferries. The passages {{had to be}} opened in five to seven hours, immediately followed by the ferries, then the bridges two hours later, all the while under enemy fire. Of the heavy bridges, the Egyptians had only two Soviet-made PMP heavy folding bridges, which could be erected in a shorter time than most other bridges in their inventory, saving a few critical hours. These bridges were also much easier to repair. The speed with which the engineers cleared {{the passages}} and laid the bridges and ferries would affect {{the course of the}} entire operation. Engineers also had to man the <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> would cross the assault infantry initially. Finally, they had to breach the minefields around Israeli defenses for the assault infantry.|$|E
5|$|Some of the ferry's six {{proposed}} routes {{were originally}} {{supposed to be}} operational in June 2017, but the implementation date was later moved to May 1. Under the 2015 plan, the whole system is expected to come into full service by 2018. The system includes routes that were formerly under NY Waterway, most notably the East River route. There {{would be at least}} 18 boats needed for rush-hour operation. Twelve boats would be deployed in 2017, while the other six would be put in service the next year. The number of boats was later revised slightly to 20, including three <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> would be upgraded later.|$|E
5|$|The main {{cargo carried}} was coal. In 1788, {{a group of}} {{shareholders}} set up a coal committee, and began trading. At first, the product came from the Staffordshire coalfields, travelling via the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, or from the Shropshire coalfields, but this was later supplemented by coal from the south Gloucestershire mines and then the Forest of Dean. This profitable business continued until 1833. <b>Boats</b> <b>that</b> worked the canal included Severn Trows, a type of sailing boat which was fitted with ketch, cutter or sloop rigging. Many were later converted for use as dumb barges by removing the masts, but none {{are known to have}} survived to the present day.|$|E

5|$|Attacks on the German {{submarines}} {{continued for}} the next six days. On the morning of 18 July a German reconnaissance aircraft spotted the Home Fleet, but the German Naval Command Norway assessed that it was heading north-east to launch another attack. Accordingly, Group Trutz was ordered to sail north, and four more submarines sortied from Narvik to guard the approaches to Alten and Vest fjords. In the evening , one of the four <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> had sailed from Narvik, was attacked twice by Liberators; she shot down the first attacker but was damaged by the second and had to return to port. U-716 also suffered severe damage from a Liberator attack at 19:15 on 18 July but managed to return to Hammerfest. At about 23:00 that day U-716 was seriously damaged by a Short Sunderland but also survived. Three other submarines were attacked on 20 July but only one suffered any damage. Following these actions the commander of submarines in the Norway area decided to dissolve Group Trutz as it was too vulnerable to air attack; all but four of the surviving submarines returned to port and the remaining boats were ordered to sail north so that they were out of range of the British aircraft. The final attack on the submarines of the former Group Trutz was made on 23 July when a No. 330 Squadron Sunderland damaged U-992 near Vestfjord.|$|E
5|$|Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons, and {{physicians}} were suspected {{because of the}} manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the City Police, indicates that the alibis were investigated of local butchers and slaughterers, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry. A report from Inspector Swanson to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months. Some contemporary figures, including Queen Victoria, thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. The cattle boats were examined but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Shackleton {{returned}} to New Zealand from the Ross Sea, having {{picked up the}} survivors of the winter party, Worsley travelled to England aboard the RMS Makura. As an RNR officer, he wanted to join in the fight against Imperial Germany. After arriving in Liverpool, {{he made his way to}} London and was quickly assigned to HMS Pembroke, the shore station at Chatham. Here, for three months, he learned about fighting U-boats, which were causing considerable damage to supply convoys crossing the Atlantic. Several tactics were deployed against the U-boats. One of these involved the use of Q-ships, small merchant vessels fitted out with hidden armament that could be deployed against any U-boats which surfaced and approached the seemingly unarmed ship. Another tactic was the use of P-boats, which were patrol <b>boats</b> <b>that</b> carried out convoy escort duties and anti-submarine work. The P-boats had a distinctive profile, and their effectiveness wore off as U-boat commanders began to recognise and avoid them. The later built P-boats were designed with a more conventional profile approximating that of a merchant ship, and thus were similar to Q-ships.|$|E
