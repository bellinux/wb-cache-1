500|$|... "Today the Sun's on Us" [...] was {{released}} as a CD single by Fascination {{as the third}} single from Trip the Light Fantastic. Issued on 6 August 2007, the single included the radio edit of the song and Ellis-Bextor's cover of [...] "Duel" [...] by Propaganda. Ellis-Bextor stated that she released the song because [...] "it {{was important to me}} with this single to push boundaries a little bit and part of that is explore a few musical directions that are a bit more unexpected, so it's <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> release a ballad".|$|E
500|$|Sean Malone {{said that}} he enjoyed playing on the album, but that [...] "it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> work out parts with Mike as they were being {{recorded}} rather than after the fact". He took a [...] "session approach" [...] to the album, [...] "trying {{as much as possible}} to create parts that fit what Jim et al had created, versus trying to impose anything upon it". He was sent MIDI bass parts for each song which served as a guideline. For the particularly sparse and texture-heavy tracks, Malone did lots of doubletracking to create [...] "a natural kind of chorusing" [...] he prefers to any digital effects.|$|E

500|$|It was {{the absence}} of Symonds, sent home from the 2008–09 series against Bangladesh for {{skipping}} a team meeting to go fishing, that gave White another opportunity in the ODI team. Although stand-in captain Clarke mirrored the action of Ponting by bringing himself on before the Victoria captain, White claimed a career-best three wickets for five runs off the 10balls he bowled. After the match, White admitted he had to prove he could deal with the pressures of international cricket, but was upbeat, saying [...] "it was nice {{to get a few}} wickets but it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> get a few overs under the belt as well." [...] He claimed two more wickets in the second match and, after not being required to bowl in the third, finished the series with an average under 10.|$|E
500|$|His {{first goal}} of 2011–12 {{came with the}} winner in Grimsby's 1–0 away win over Forest Green Rovers on 3 September 2011 after capitalising on a {{defensive}} mistake. Coulson was handed a one-match suspension after accumulating five yellow cards, missing the home match against Newport County on 19 November. He made an immediate return to the Grimsby line-up, starting in their 1–0 home win over League Two team Port Vale in the FA Cup first round on 22 November 2011. His first two-goal haul of the season came in a 3–0 victory at home to Darlington in the FA Trophy first round on 10 December 2011, scoring Grimsby's first and third goals. It was announced on 23 April 2012 that Coulson had rejected a new two-year contract on reduced terms with Grimsby, meaning he would leave the club {{at the end of}} the season. Having been left out of the squad for Grimsby's final two matches of the season, Coulson spoke that he was saddened by the manner of his departure, saying [...] "It would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> go out on a high". He finished his final season at Grimsby with 52 appearances and 10 goals.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, MTV Unplugged {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Ryan Jones from Alternative Addiction gave the album four stars out of five, writing that [...] "the final product has been touched up perfectly {{and the four}} songs on the EP are the perfect selections." [...] He described both [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] and [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] as [...] "chilling", but concluded his review saying that [...] "it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> get a few more songs."

[...] Alex Easton of AltSounds called the show [...] "emotional, powerful and stunning." [...] He praised Leto's vocals and wrote that the album [...] "not only brings a different element to some classic songs, but cements Thirty Seconds to Mars' place {{as one of the}} finest acts of this generation." ...|$|E

500|$|Sunderland {{opened the}} month with a 1–0 defeat away to Manchester United on 1 September, Louis Saha scored the winner 18minutes from full-time. Roy Keane said [...] "I'm {{delighted with the}} overall performance. It would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> test their goalkeeper a bit more but overall I'm delighted with the players' efforts." [...] about the team's display. Jack Pelter signed for Sunderland on 8 September, from New Zealand team Canterbury United, on a free {{transfer}} in an original one-month deal. Two weeks after the defeat to Manchester United, Sunderland beat Reading 2–1 on 15 September. Kenwyne Jones and Ross Wallace scored the Sunderland goals in a game which was overshadowed by the tribute paid to 1973 FA Cup Final scorer Ian Porterfield who died on 11 September 2007. Sunderland met Middlesbrough on 22 September in their first north east derby of the season. Grant Leadbitter scored in the 2nd minute to put Sunderland in front, but two ex-Sunderland players; Julio Arca and Stewart Downing put Middlesbrough into the lead. Liam Miller scored an 89th minute volley to save a point for Sunderland. Grant Leadbitter scored his second goal in as many games on 29 September as Blackburn Rovers beat Sunderland 2–1.|$|E
500|$|Benfica opened March {{with the}} quarter-finals of the Portuguese Cup. They played Beira-Mar {{at home and}} won 1–0 with a goal from João Pereira in the 25th minute. Trapattoni {{analysed}} the game, saying, [...] "Everybody knew this match was an revenge for the league defeat. In the first half we dominated, in the second we were dominated. Beira-Mar was fresher – {{it is not easy}} to play every three days. Still, we deserved to win." [...] Three days later, on 6 March, Benfica played at Estádio da Madeira against Nacional and won 1–0 with a goal from Nuno Gomes. Near the end, Quim brought down Wendel Geraldo inside the box but failed to convert the penalty, hitting the woodwork. Trapattoni praised his team's commitment saying their victory was deserved and they were lucky with the missed penalty. On 12 March, Benfica played at home against Gil Vicente. With the chance to open a three-point lead over Porto, Benfica won 2–0 with an opening goal from Mantorras and a second from Miguel. After the game, Trapattoni argued with a fan after the second goal; he said, [...] "I argued with a fan, not fans. I was not nice to him, but since the first game, he has not <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] He added that the win was very important and that Benfica had not won anything yet. Benfica closed March with an away game against Vitória de Setúbal. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first, with Geovanni doubling the lead in the second half in a 2–0 win.|$|E
500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> get a piece of silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E

500|$|Krause {{deemed the}} revelation of Adele's moving on [...] "an {{interesting}} twist, with unexpected repercussions", whereas Stevens' offering Bailey the money to open the free clinic, was negatively reviewed; looked upon as the most predictable event of the episode. Krause noted that both medical cases were confusing, assessing that [...] "it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> {{learn more about the}} severe dehydration that caused the runner's legs to swell." [...] In addition, Krause explained how the Amish angle was unexpected, but significantly helpful to the entertainment level, while a lack of realism in the medical case was highlighted: [...] "No one bothered to really mention {{that it would have been}} nice, had it been caught earlier. It was, but she allowed herself to deteriorate." [...] The fight between Grey and Shepherd was deemed [...] "a tiff that Derek was entirely responsible for", but also a proof of [...] "how damaged Meredith really is". Krause expressed disappointment in the storyline involving O'Malley proposing to Torres: [...] "Callie certainly didn't look thrilled. If she believes George is proposing as a means to get over his grief, she's probably right and should likely run in the opposite direction." [...] Considering each of the attending physcians' chances of becoming the chief of surgery, Krause noted the possibility of Sloan being chosen as [...] "hilarious, but a tad unbelievable", whereas assessing that Montgomery's [...] "great traits" [...] might suffer, due to her relationship with Karev, which was described as [...] "certainly bringing into question her ability to stay on the straight and narrow". Krause characterized the whole as [...] "one of those guilty pleasures that many may not admit to".|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as I had {{hoped it would}} be. I mean, {{if you were going}} to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sri Lanka batted {{first and}} scored 251, before Ponting—batting at number five due to Steve Waugh's absence through injury—arrived at the crease with Australia at a {{comfortable}} 3/422. He started nervously, edging his first ball past first slip for a boundary from off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. When Ponting reached 96, Chaminda Vaas hit Ponting high on his thigh and was given out leg before wicket. Many members {{of the crowd and}} media argued it was an incorrect decision due to excessive height. He combined with Stuart Law, also playing on debut, for a partnership of 121. This was only the ninth ever century partnership by debutants in Test cricket. [...] "I've got mixed emotions about my knock at the moment. 96 is a good score but it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> get a 100", Ponting said after the innings. [...] "Once I struck a few {{in the middle of the}} bat, and I spent some time in the middle I tried to relax and enjoy it, just savour the moment." [...] Australia won the match by an innings. In the second Test in Melbourne on Boxing Day, he scored a [...] "compact" [...] 71 in his only innings, combining for a century stand with Steve Waugh.

2500|$|Burt Shevelove invited Sondheim to a party; Sondheim arrived before him, {{and knew}} {{no one else}} well. He saw a {{familiar}} face: Arthur Laurents, who had seen one of the auditions of Saturday Night, and they began talking. Laurents {{told him he was}} working on a musical version of Romeo and Juliet with Leonard Bernstein, but they needed a lyricist; Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who were supposed to write the lyrics, were under contract in Hollywood. He said that although he was not a big fan of Sondheim's music, he enjoyed the lyrics from Saturday Night and he could audition for Bernstein. Sondheim met Bernstein the following day, played for him and Bernstein said he would let him know. The composer wanted to write music and lyrics; after consulting with Hammerstein, Bernstein told Sondheim he could write music later. In 1957, West Side Story opened; directed by Jerome Robbins, it ran for 732 performances. Sondheim has expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, saying that they do not always fit the characters and are sometimes too consciously poetic. While Bernstein was working on Candide, Sondheim reportedly wrote some of [...] West Side Storys music; Bernstein's co-lyricist credit disappeared from West Side Story during its tryout, possibly as a trade-off. Sondheim insisted that Bernstein told the producers to list him as the sole lyricist. He described the division of the royalties, saying that Bernstein received three percent and he received one percent. Bernstein suggested evening the percentage at two percent each, but Sondheim refused because he wanted the credit. Sondheim later said he wished [...] "someone stuffed a handkerchief in my mouth because it would have <b>been</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> get that extra percentage".|$|E
