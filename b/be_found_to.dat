For example, some doors require the player to defeat all the enemies in the area, while others may require a specific key. Although the player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies, health-recovery gems and ammunition crates can be collected throughout the world to increase the player's resources.

5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice {{it is unlikely}} that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts.

It is unlikely that anyone would <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP.

5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare a prosecution to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if a prosecution is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed.

This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J.

There was also competition for staff and resources from the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York.

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be valid and constitutional.|$|E

5|$|In 1876 the {{zoologist}} Joel Asaph Allen {{discovered the}} remains of Canis mississippiensis (Allen 1876) and associated these with C.dirus (Leidy 1858) and Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought it best to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> reveal their relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 {{he had found a}} skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name C.dirus (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, C.dirus. In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared C.indianensis a synonym of C.dirus. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos, terrible and cyon, wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, but not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of C.dirus by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of C.dirus in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.|$|E
