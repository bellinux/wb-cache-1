Despite being among the virus' first victims, Paltrow believed that Elizabeth was [...] "lucky", as she thought the disease's survivors were being left {{to deal with the}} newly difficult conditions of everyday life, such as finding food and potable water. When on location in Hong Kong, Paltrow was instructed by Soderbergh to take photographs {{to be used in the}} film, and admitted she was apprehensive about the assignment. [...] "I was just another tourist taking pictures", she said, and added, [...] "I did feel a little pressure.

2500|$|In 1971, Lindsay and {{his wife}} cut ties with the Republican Party by {{registering}} with the Democratic Party. Lindsay said, [...] "In a sense, this step recognizes the failure of 20 years in progressive Republican politics. In another sense, it represents the renewed decision to fight for new national leadership." [...] Lindsay then launched a brief and unsuccessful bid for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination. He attracted positive media attention and was a successful fundraiser. Lindsay did well in the early Arizona caucus, coming in second place behind Edmund Muskie of Maine and ahead of eventual nominee George McGovern of South Dakota. Then in the March 14 Florida primary, he placed a weak fifth place, behind George Wallace of Alabama, Muskie, Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, and Scoop Jackson of Washington (though he did edge out McGovern). Among his difficulties was New York City's worsening problems, which Lindsay was accused of neglecting; a band of protesters from Forest Hills, Queens, who were opposed to his support for a low income housing project in their neighborhood, followed Lindsay around his aborted campaign itinerary to jeer and heckle him. His poor showing in Florida effectively doomed his candidacy. New York City politician Meade Esposito called for Lindsay to end his campaign with the much-publicized comment [...] "I think the handwriting is on the wall; Little Sheba <b>better</b> <b>come</b> home." [...] After a poor showing in the April 5 Wisconsin primary, Lindsay formally abandoned the race.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Nutting {{recalled}} that Eden told him, [...] "What's all this nonsense about isolating Nasser or 'neutralising' him {{as you call}} it? I want him destroyed, can't you understand? I want him murdered, and if you and the Foreign Office don't agree, then you'd <b>better</b> <b>come</b> to the cabinet and explain why." [...] When Nutting pointed out {{that they had no}} alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, [...] "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt." [...] At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal and get rid of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, [...] "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. This {{has nothing to do with}} the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone." [...] Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, [...] "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp of our generation, mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it. It is impossible to read the record now and not feel that we had a responsibility for always being a lap behind ... Always a lap behind, a fatal lap." ...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{problems}} with using passwords to prove identity is that passwords that are easy to remember are also easy for an attacker to guess, and vice versa. Nevertheless, passwords are cheap to implement and well understood, so despite the mounting evidence that they are often not very secure, until something <b>better</b> <b>comes</b> along they are likely to remain the main mechanism for proving identity.

2500|$|After {{the highly}} {{promoted}} but vastly inferior 1976 remake of King Kong, Elliot Stein wrote a nostalgic fan homage essay to King Kong called [...] "My Life with Kong" [...] in Rolling Stone magazine.

In the essay Stein talks about the contexts in which he has seen King Kong during his life, including in the 1930s in New York picture palaces like Radio City Music Hall, and the RKO Roxy and in Paris with Jean Boullet in the 1950s. There was an art deco retrospective of King Kong at the Radio City Music Hall in the 1974 and a King Kong homage was staged for the Telluride Film Festival in the 1970s. King Kong was also mentioned by name by Kermit the Frog in lyrics from the song [...] "I Hope that Something <b>Better</b> <b>Comes</b> Along" [...] from The Muppet Movie: [...] "She made a monkey out of old King Kong/I hope that something <b>better</b> <b>comes</b> along." ...|$|R
