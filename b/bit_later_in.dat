500|$|Andrew Nurnberg, Littell's {{literary}} agent, {{said that}} a possible one-line description of the novel would be: [...] "The intimate memoirs of an ex-Nazi mass murderer." [...] When asked why he wrote such a book, Littell invokes a photo he discovered in 1989 of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, a female Soviet partisan hanged by the Nazis in 1941. He adds that a <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> <b>in</b> 1992, he watched the movie Shoah by Claude Lanzmann, which left an impression on him, especially the discussion by Raul Hilberg about the bureaucratic aspect of genocide.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{increasing}} case mergers, nominative and accusative forms seem to {{have remained}} distinct for much longer, since they are rarely confused in inscriptions. Even though Gaulish texts from the 7th century rarely confuse both forms, {{it is believed that}} both cases began to merge in Africa {{by the end of the}} empire, and a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> parts of Italy and Iberia. Nowadays, Romanian maintains a two-case system, while Old French and Old Occitan had a two-case subject-oblique system.|$|E
5000|$|The main plot loosely echoes Lord Cochrane's {{setting up}} and {{commanding}} the Chilean Navy from 1818 {{to the early}} 1820s. [...] A historical figure from Chile's independence movement, Don Bernardo O'Higgins, also features in the book. O'Higgins captured the Spanish frigate Esmeralda <b>in</b> 1820, a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> than <b>in</b> this novel.|$|R

2500|$|Voldemort {{uses the}} Tournament for an {{elaborate}} scheme to lure Harry into a deadly trap. During the Tournament's final challenge, Harry and Cedric are transported to a graveyard, using a portkey, where Cedric is killed by Peter Pettigrew, and Voldemort, aided by Pettigrew, uses Harry's blood in a gruesome ritual to resurrect his body. When Harry duels Voldemort, their wands' magical streams connect, forcing the spirit echoes of Voldemort's victims, including Cedric and James and Lily Potter, to be expelled from his wand. The spirits briefly protect Harry as he escapes to Hogwarts with Cedric's body. For Rowling, this scene {{is important because}} it shows Harry's bravery, and by retrieving Cedric's corpse, he demonstrates selflessness and compassion. Says Rowling, [...] "He wants to save Cedric's parents additional pain." [...] She added that preventing Cedric's body from falling into Voldemort's hands is based on the classic scene in the Iliad where Achilles retrieves the body of his best friend Patroclus from the hands of Hector. Rowling also mentioned that book four rounds off an era in Harry's life, and the remaining three books are another, [...] "He's no longer protected. He's been very protected until now. But he's very young to have that experience. Most of us don't get that until a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> life. He's only just coming up to 15 and that's it now." ...|$|E

I suppose," [...] said Ginger, putting two and two together, [...] "he had really come {{with her to the}} office and had happened to hang back for a minute or two, to talk to somebody or something... well, of course, he was considerably fed to see me apparently doing jiu-jitsu with his wife. Enough to rattle any man, if you come to think of it," [...] said Ginger, ever fair-minded. [...] "Well, he didn't say anything at the time, but a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> the day he called me in and administered the push." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{generally accepted}} echinoderm fossils appeared a little <b>bit</b> <b>later,</b> <b>in</b> the Late Atdabanian; unlike modern echinoderms, these early Cambrian echinoderms were not all radially symmetrical.|$|E

50|$|On this occasion, {{or perhaps}} a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> (possibly <b>in</b> 589), Comentiolus was raised to the supreme title of patricius.

In 587, Comentiolus assembled a 10,000 strong army at Anchialus. He prepared an ambush for the Avar khagan in the Haemus mountains, but it failed.|$|R

50|$|The {{numerous}} {{contradictions of}} his rulings {{have also been}} objected to, e.g. when he affirms that Horman was arrested during a routine inspection in 1973, but, a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> his verdict, he assures that he was arrested thanks to the intelligence information provided by then (1987) CNI Director, Gen. Hugo Salas Wenzel.|$|E

Among his earliest works were two Thomas Ince productions, Stepping Out and The Cup of Life, followed in rapid succession by Miss George Washington, with Marguerite Clark; The Courage of Marge O'Doone, with Pauline Starke; and The Gulf Between (1917) with Grace Darmond, the first feature film produced in the short-lived additive version of Technicolor.

Telegames never advertised its compatibility with the SG-1000.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{source for}} the Instructions of Kagemni is the Prisse Papyrus. This text dates to the much later twelfth dynasty of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (perhaps by the reign of Amenemhat II from 1929 BC to 1895 BC, or a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>in</b> the twelfth dynasty). It is written in the Middle Egyptian language and in an archaic style of cursive hieratic.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "At 21, Murray already had {{remarkable}} technique and these explorations with bassist Fred Hopkins and drummer Phillip Wilson are quite adventurous... None of the compositions themselves are that memorable and some listeners may find Murray's screams and screeches (which he would modify a <b>bit</b> <b>in</b> <b>later</b> years) to {{be a bit}} too emotional, but this was a strong first effort.".|$|R

Harry Demetriou, {{who had been}} playing in the event, objected to the change in format citing that a shootout should be 9, 10 or 11 handed, yelling about the unfair change in structure. Harry was eventually ejected from the tournament and was later refunded his money. Daniel Negreanu missed the event completely because he assumed that the event would be a full table {{and he would be}} able to come into the tournament a little <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> after sleeping <b>in.</b> However, by the time he showed up David Singer had won his table after blinding off Negreanu's stack.|$|R

The alcohol use in not seen as a problem, however people are facing daily negative results of extensive use of alcohol, like car accidents, injuries at work, consequences on relationships, health problems, income and housing problems, etc. The results of the ESPAD survey shows {{that the percentage of}} those who had drunk a glass of alcohol has been increasing from 1995 to 2007. At the same time we can observe some trends toward reducing of alcohol use among youth as well among adults. The results show that children have first drink according to data from 2006 a <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> than <b>in</b> the year 2002. Comparing to EU we can conclude that Slovene youngsters start drink approximately half of a year later than EU average.

[...] He thinks more highly of Carlos Santana's playing than of McLaughlin's, which he suggests lacks feeling and relies on technicality: [...] "Here, at his most inspired, McLaughlin is exhilarating if a <b>bit</b> monolithic."
