25|$|Other major {{problems}} concern {{the labor force}} and the pricing system. There is large-scale underemployment in both urban and rural areas, {{and the fear of}} the disruptive effects of major, explicit unemployment is strong. The prices of certain key commodities, especially of industrial raw materials and major industrial products, are determined by the state. In most cases, <b>basic</b> <b>price</b> ratios were set in the 1950s and are often irrational in terms of current production capabilities and demands. Over the years, large subsidies were built into the price structure and these subsidies grew substantially in the late 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1990s, these subsidies began to be eliminated, in large part due to China's admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, which carried with it requirements for further economic liberalization and deregulation.|$|E
25|$|There {{had already}} been a very {{substantial}} investment in the Herald project, such that the management held a meeting to discuss continuation. Handley Page decided to press ahead with the Herald project, {{in an effort to}} recover the investment; announcing a new uprated version powered by the Rolls-Royce Dart. The revised aircraft, now designated the HPR.7 Dart Herald, was powered by 1,910shp Dart 527 engines driving 12ft 6in (3.81m) variable pitch four-blade Dowty Rotol propellers, and the fuselage was lengthened by 20in (51cm), while other improvements included increased fuel capacity. The first prototype was converted to Dart Herald standard, making its maiden flight on 11 March 1958, with the first production aircraft flying on 30 October 1959. The initial Series 100 version of the Dart Herald was certified in April 1958. The <b>basic</b> <b>price</b> in 1960 was around £185,000.|$|E
2500|$|Under the Wilson {{administration}} during World War I, the U.S. Food Administration, {{under the}} direction of Herbert Hoover, set a <b>basic</b> <b>price</b> of $2.20 per bushel. The end of the war led to [...] "the closing of the bonanza export markets and the fall of sky-high farm prices," [...] and wheat prices fell from more than $2.20 per bushel in 1919 to $1.01 in 1921. The McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill failed in Congress and was followed by the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, the establishment of the Federal Farm Board, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933.|$|E

50|$|The sum of COE, GOS and GMI {{is called}} total factor income; {{it is the}} income {{of all of the}} factors of {{production}} in society. It measures the value of GDP at factor (<b>basic)</b> <b>prices.</b> The difference between <b>basic</b> <b>prices</b> and final prices (those used in the expenditure calculation) is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production. So adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts GDP at factor cost to GDP(I).|$|R
