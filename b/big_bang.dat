5|$|The <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> as {{the origin}} of the {{universe}}: One of the common misconceptions about the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model is the belief that it was {{the origin of}} the universe. However, the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.|$|E
5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it {{has become one of the}} liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion. Some believe the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> implies a creator, and some see its mention in their holy books, while others argue that <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.|$|E
5|$|Electrons {{are thought}} {{to exist in the}} Universe since early stages of the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang.</b> Atomic nuclei forms in {{nucleosynthesis}} reactions. In about three minutes <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> nucleosynthesis produced most of the helium, lithium, and deuterium in the Universe, and perhaps some of the beryllium and boron.|$|E

5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E
5|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> lattice model, {{states that}} the {{universe}} {{at the moment of}} the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> consists of an infinite lattice of fermions, which is smeared over the fundamental domain so it has rotational, translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{observations}} of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are {{in agreement with the}} current state of the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang,</b> and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.|$|E

5|$|Large {{particle}} accelerators can replicate {{the conditions that}} prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement {{of the details of}} the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into high energy regimes. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> theory. The <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E

5|$|After the Planck epoch and {{inflation}} came the quark, hadron, and lepton epochs. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang.</b> The observed abundance {{of the elements}} {{can be explained by}} combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, {{in the early part of}} the matter-dominated era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei through nuclear reactions. This process, known as <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> nucleosynthesis, led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> nucleosynthesis ended about 20 minutes after the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang,</b> when the Universe had cooled enough so that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the photon epoch, lasted about 380 thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is rare}} on Earth, helium is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} element in the known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. The vast majority of helium was formed by <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang.</b> As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|Brane {{cosmology}} models, {{in which}} inflation {{is due to}} the movement of branes in string theory; the pre-Big Bang model; the ekpyrotic model, in which the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> {{is the result of a}} collision between branes; and the cyclic model, a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.|$|E

Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang,</b> during <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> nucleosynthesis.|$|E
