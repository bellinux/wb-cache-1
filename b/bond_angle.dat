The 5-methoxytriazole precursor to this carbene {{was made by the}} treatment of a triazolium salt with sodium methoxide, which attacks as a nucleophile. This may indicate that these carbenes are less aromatic than imidazol-2-ylidenes, as the imidazolium precursors do not react with nucleophiles due to the resultant loss of aromaticity.|$|E

However, it has an unfixed puckered shape that undulates up and down. The unstable half-chair conformation has angle strain in the C-C-C angles which range from 109.86° to 119.07°.|$|R
5|$|When {{deoxyhemoglobin}} {{picks up}} an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached {{to form a}} hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges {{that would lead to}} electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than myoglobin in the low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue, resulting in oxygen transfer. This is further enhanced by the concomitant Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), in which lowered pH (as occurs when carbon dioxide is released in the muscles) further lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.|$|E

25|$|In highly {{branched}} alkanes, the <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> {{may differ}} significantly from the optimal value (109.5°) {{in order to allow}} the different groups sufficient space.

25|$|As an example, when {{optimizing}} {{the geometry}} of a water molecule, one aims to obtain the hydrogen-oxygen bond lengths and the hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> which minimize the forces {{that would otherwise be}} pulling atoms together or pushing them apart.|$|E
25|$|In acetylene, the H–C≡C bond angles are 180°. By {{virtue of}} this <b>bond</b> <b>angle,</b> alkynes are rod-like. Correspondingly, cyclic alkynes are rare. Benzyne is highly unstable.

50|$|For a {{theoretical}} planar cyclopentane the C-C-C <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> would be 108 degrees, {{very close to}} the measure of the tetrahedral angle. Actual cyclopentane molecules are puckered, but this changes only the <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> slightly so that angle strain is relatively small. The eclipsing interactions are also reduced, leaving a ring strain of about 25 kJ/mol.|$|R

25|$|As {{predicted}} by the VSEPR model of electron pair repulsion, the molecular geometry of alkenes includes bond angles about each carbon in a double bond of about 120°. The angle may vary because of steric strain introduced by nonbonded interactions between functional groups attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, the C–C–C <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> in propylene is 123.9°.|$|E
25|$|Ethers are {{slightly}} polar. The C–O–C <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> in the functional group is about 110°, and the C–O dipoles do not cancel out. Ethers are more polar than alkenes {{but not as}} polar as alcohols, esters, or amides of comparable structure. The presence of two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms makes hydrogen bonding with water molecules possible.|$|E
25|$|The ammonia {{molecule}} has a trigonal pyramidal {{shape as}} {{predicted by the}} valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> of 106.7°. The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one {{lone pair of electrons}}. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a lone electron pair, which makes ammonia a base, a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a dipole moment and makes it polar. The molecule's polarity and, especially, its ability to form hydrogen bonds, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are protonated. Temperature and salinity also affect the proportion of NH4+. The latter has the shape of a regular tetrahedron and is isoelectronic with methane.|$|E
50|$|When the {{substituent}} (X) atoms {{are not all}} the same, {{the geometry}} is still approximately valid, but the <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> may be slightly different from the ones where all the outside atoms are the same. For example, the double-bond carbons in alkenes like C2H4 are AX3E0, but the <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> are not all exactly 120°. Likewise, SOCl2 is AX3E1, but because the X substituents are not identical, the X-A-X angles are not all equal.|$|R
50|$|Molecules with a {{high amount}} of ring strain consist of three, four, and some five-membered rings, including: cyclopropanes, cyclopropenes, cyclobutanes, cyclobutenes, 1,1,1propellanes, 2,2,2propellanes, epoxides, aziridines, cyclopentenes, and norbornenes. These {{molecules}} have <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> between ring atoms which are more acute than the optimal tetrahedral (109.5°) and trigonal planar (120°) <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> required by their respective sp3 and sp2 bonds. Because of the smaller <b>bond</b> <b>angles,</b> the <b>bonds</b> have higher energy and adopt more p-character to reduce {{the energy of the}} bonds. In addition, the ring structures of cyclopropanes/enes and cyclclobutanes/enes offer very little conformational flexibility. Thus, the substituents of ring atoms exist in an eclipsed conformation in cyclopropanes and between gauche and eclipsed in cyclobutanes, contributing to higher ring strain energy in the form of Van der Waals repulsion.|$|R
5000|$|In cycloalkanes, each carbon is bonded nonpolar covalently to two carbons and two hydrogen. The carbons have sp3 hybrization {{and should}} have ideal <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> of 109.5°. Due to the {{limitations}} of cyclic structure, however, the ideal angle is only achieved in a six carbon ring [...] - [...] cyclohexane in chair conformation. For other cycloalkanes, the <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> deviate from ideal. In cyclopropanes (3 carbons) and cyclobutanes (4 carbons) the C-C bonds are 60° and ~90° respectively.|$|R
25|$|The bond angles in {{aziridine}} {{are approximately}} 60°, {{considerably less than}} the normal hydrocarbon <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> of 109.5°, which results in angle strain as in the comparable cyclopropane and ethylene oxide molecules. A banana bond model explains bonding in such compounds. Aziridine is less basic than acyclic aliphatic amines, with a pKa of 7.9 for the conjugate acid, due to increased s character of the nitrogen free electron pair. Angle strain in aziridine also increases the barrier to nitrogen inversion. This barrier height permits the isolation of separate invertomers, for example the cis and trans invertomers of N-chloro-2-methylaziridine.|$|E

[...] This [...] "median hexagon" [...] representation made it easy to see that the cyclol fabric planes can be joined correctly if the dihedral angle between the planes equals the tetrahedral <b>bond</b> <b>angle</b> δ = arccos(-1/3) ≈ 109.47°.|$|E

Polane (polonium hydride) is a more covalent compound than most metal hydrides because polonium straddles the border between metals and metalloids and has some nonmetallic properties: it is intermediate between a hydrogen halide like hydrogen chloride (HCl) and a metal hydride like stannane (SnH4).

This phenomenon, dubbed [...] "supervalent hybridization", is not particularly uncommon in non-relativistic regions in the periodic table; for example, molecular calcium difluoride has 4s and 3d involvement from the calcium atom. The heavier livermorium dihalides are predicted to be linear, but the lighter ones are predicted to be bent.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the structural parameters, i. e. bond lengths and <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> of chiral tubes of various chiralities. The procedure used {{is based on}} helical and rotational symmetries and Tersoff potential. The results indicate that at ambient condition, there are equal bond lengths and three unequal <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> {{in the structure of}} chiral tubes. The bond length depends much more on the chirality and very slightly on the tube radius. Length of the tubes does not play very significant role on bond length and <b>bond</b> <b>angles.</b> These C-C <b>bonds</b> were recalculated under hydrostatic pressure. The bond length compresses with pressure while the <b>bond</b> <b>angles</b> remain practically unchanged. We also carry out analysis regarding the cross sectional shape of chiral tubes and its pressure dependence. It is found that at some pressures, transition from circular to oval cross section takes place. The transition pressure is found to strongly depend on the radius and chirality of tube. At this transition, corresponding to given elliptical cross section, the bond length for all chiral tubes is identical. This behavior of bond length is different from achiral tubes.
