500|$|Manning is a Christian. At age 13, he said, [...] "I {{committed}} {{my life to}} Christ, {{and that}} faith has been most important to me ever since." [...] Manning said his priorities ranked in order are [...] "...faith, family, friends, and football." [...] Manning said he prays every night and before games and added, [...] "I hope (and pray) I don't do too many things that displease Him <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Heaven myself. I believe, too, that life is much better and freer when you're committed to God in that way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{can change}} again, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Tripataly," [...] she said. [...] "I should {{not like to}} appear before your mother, for the first time, dressed as a boy." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{bad night}} made it {{late in the}} morning, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Franklin Blake. I found him {{stretched}} on the sofa, breakfasting on brandy and soda-water, and a dry biscuit.|$|R
60|$|D. Yes, I can swim; but if I should {{attempt to}} swim off to you, I should have a {{thousand}} arrows and javelins sticking in me <b>before</b> <b>I</b> should <b>get</b> <b>to</b> your boat.|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} one o'clock <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the hotel to-day. The visit, {{even in my}} {{shattered}} condition, {{proved to be a}} most amusing one--thanks entirely to the presence on the scene of Gabriel Betteredge.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{literally}} haven't {{a minute}} to spare," [...] he said, offering her his hand for a second time; [...] "for I've {{two or three people}} to see <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “This {{goes in the}} St. Louis, so I {{hope you}} will have it before many days, and I hope, too, it won’t be long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see you. I think this terrific defeat must go far toward ending things.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, there's enough {{here for}} a start," [...] she decided, {{slipping}} them into her bosom. [...] "No one shall rob me of these <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the shops. Better come with me, Philip. I'm {{not going to leave}} you alone with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “When she was {{extremely}} ill, her physician said, ‘Madam, you are [...] {{near the bottom}} of the hill, but we will endeavour <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you up [...] again.’ She answered, ‘Doctor, I fear I shall be out of breath [...] <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> up <b>to</b> the top.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, no! But {{everything}} {{must come}} to an end some day; and as I must make one or two short visits <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> town, <b>I</b> might as well go on Wednesday. Indeed, I have made it as late as I possibly could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Knees," [...] he repeated, quietly. [...] "It came {{slowly down}} the path, and half way to the house it stopped, and in a frightened sort of voice called out my name. I was surprised, naturally, but <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> it-- to reassure it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I, master; {{it was a}} good beast, but I {{think that}} either of these is as good, though it will be long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> like them as I did Scotty. We shall want {{housings}} for this second horse, master." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh God, don't let him die <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> him--don't--don't--don't!" [...] {{she prayed}} desperately {{with more of}} {{defiance}} than entreaty in her voice. Then, realizing this, she cried out in horror. Surely some fearsome punishment would come upon her for her wickedness--she would find her husband lying dead.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little girl}} softly pressed her hands together. [...] "I hope she'll {{let me stay}} up! I feel so excited, and I hate to lie and think so long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> sleep. Couldn't you just hint a little to her that I might stay up? It's Sunday night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{and it is}} {{time for}} me to go. I have still work <b>to</b> do <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> bed. Ah, well; I suppose the day will come at last when I need not leave you as soon as my hour of rest is over." ...|$|R
60|$|FITZSIMMONS. [Exultantly.] A bit tight! Why, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> you <b>to</b> bed you {{insisted on}} {{telling me the}} story of your life.|$|R
50|$|I {{was drunk}} {{the day my}} mom got out of prisonAnd I went to pick'er up in the rainBut <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the station in my pickup truckShe got runned over by a damned ol' trainGoodman and Prine's {{versions}} had a different list in the final verse.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{now it will}} be so long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{know any}} thing certain about him, and I am sick of waiting. Martin, do see him, and give him Caroline Helstone's regards, and say she wished to know how he was, and if {{anything}} could be done for his comfort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I should care even {{about being a}} colonel, Hallett. Long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> that rank, I am sure that I should have had quite enough of {{fighting}} to last for a lifetime, and would be quite content to settle down in some little place at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gone into Norwich to dine at {{the barracks}} with some stupid men. Not that I mind his going," [...] she added, hastily. [...] "I wish he'd stay {{away for a}} month. Of course he's a very good sort, and all that, but he's deadly monotonous. Uncle, really, {{as a matter of}} curiosity, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> be an old woman I should like to see one other young man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{that will}} I; but he'll have {{two of you}} floored, another strangled, and the fourth half-skinned <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> him <b>to</b> stop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In bed," [...] said he, {{looking up}} with some little pride from his Greek book; [...] "I've {{one hundred and fifty}} lines <b>to</b> do <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> bed. It'll be two, I suppose. I've got to mug {{uncommon}} hard these holidays. I have only one more half, you know, and then--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'There's {{enough of}} you doing that,' I says. 'I've got my room to put {{straight}} and three hours needlework <b>to</b> do <b>before</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> bed. But don't let me 'inder you. You might forget what work was like, if you didn't take an opportunity of watching {{it now and}} then.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell you, Feemy, {{there are}} reasons why I couldn't be married <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Cashel. There,--to tell you the whole, they wouldn't let a man take his rise from one rank to another if he's married. They can't prevent the {{officers}} in the force marrying, but they don't like it; and it's a rule that they won't promote a married man. You see I couldn't marry till after I was settled at Cashel." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here I am {{again in}} the land of freedom and potatoes. I need not [...] trouble you with writing about home news, as I shall see you the [...] day after to-morrow. All to-morrow and Wednesday morning I must [...] stick close to my guns here. After one on Wednesday I shall be [...] free. I will drive over to Lahinch, and come round in the boat. [...] I must come back here the same night, but I suppose it will be [...] the next morning <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> bed. I sha'n't mind that if I [...] get {{something}} for my pains. My love to your mother. Your own, ...|$|E
60|$|I {{obey the}} first {{clause of the}} {{injunction}} by trying once more, but am not so successful with the second, for I am very stupid. I tumble down <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the old place, {{at a point where}} I was all right before, and stop to think. But I can't think about the lesson. I think of the number of yards of net in Miss Murdstone's cap, or of the price of Mr. Murdstone's dressing-gown, or any such ridiculous problem that I have no business with, and don't want to have anything at all to do with. Mr. Murdstone makes a movement of impatience which I have been expecting for a long time. Miss Murdstone does the same. My mother glances submissively at them, shuts the book, and lays it by as an arrear to be worked out when my other tasks are done.|$|E
40|$|The {{two great}} Commandments" It's been my {{intention}} {{to talk to}} you (for a number of weeks) about those particular rules which are called the Commandments. But <b>before</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>get</b> <b>to</b> that topic, <b>I</b> ought to straighten (in your minds) some popular (but twisted) concepts regarding the laws that God lays down [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven and earth!" [...] said Augustus at last, {{pulling out}} his watch. [...] "It only wants {{three minutes to}} seven. I shall have a dozen {{messages}} from the judge <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> down, <b>to</b> know whether he shall come and help me change my boots. I'll see you again <b>before</b> <b>I</b> go to bed. Good-bye, old fellow." [...] And then Graham was again alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he {{said with}} a laugh, [...] "I shall be acting commander. That gives one the honorary rank of captain, but it may be a long time <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> {{appointed}} <b>to</b> that rank. The admiral has been awfully kind, but the people at home are not likely to regard my age and appearance as in any way suitable for such a position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort, my dear; I am {{as strong}} as a horse. The other night, I {{was waiting for the}} {{carriage}} in a draught (one of the most perfect private concerts of the season, ending with a delightfully naughty little French play)--and I caught a slight cold. A glass of water is all I want. Thank you. Romayne, you are looking shockingly serious and severe; our ball will cheer you. If you would only make a bonfire of all those horrid books, you don't know how it would improve your spirits. Dearest Stella, I will come and lunch here to-morrow--you are within such a nice easy drive from town--and I'll bring my visiting-book, and settle about the invitations and the day. Oh, dear me, how late it is. I have nearly an hour's drive <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> my garden party. Good-by, my turtle doves good-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{individual}} {{was one of}} a type radically different from the first. There was more of the commonplace in his manner, and a certain jovial cosmopolitanism sat upon his features. He was several years older than the first arrival, his hair being slightly frosted, his eyebrows bristly, and his whiskers cut back from his cheeks. His face was rather full and flabby, and yet it was not altogether a face without power. A few grog- blossoms marked the neighbourhood of his nose. He flung back his long drab greatcoat, revealing that beneath it he wore a suit of cinder-gray shade throughout, large heavy seals, of some metal or other that would take a polish, dangling from his fob as his only personal ornament. Shaking the water-drops from his low-crowned glazed hat, he said, 'I must ask for a few minutes' shelter, comrades, or I shall be wetted to my skin <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Casterbridge.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but I {{want you}} all to bear it in mind, for it will explain a {{discovery}} I have made. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> that, however, I {{want to say that}} at one time the island of Ceylon supplied the world with its most famous pearls. The early Egyptians discovered them there, {{as well as on the}} Persian and Indian coasts. The pearl which Cleopatra is said to have dissolved in wine and swallowed was worth about four hundred thousand dollars in our money; but of course pearls were scarce in her day. A single pearl was cut in two and used for earrings for the statue of Venus in the Pantheon at Rome, and the sum paid for it was equal to about a quarter of a million dollars. Sir Thomas Gresham, in the days of Queen Elizabeth, had a pearl valued at about seventy-five thousand dollars which he treated in the same manner Cleopatra did, dissolving it in wine and boasting he had given the most expensive dinner ever known." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} rectory-gate. Mr. Finch intercepted me <b>before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> round <b>to</b> {{our side of}} the house. He held up before me, in solemn triumph, a {{manuscript}} of many pages.|$|R
60|$|As soon as <b>I</b> <b>get</b> {{back from}} Haleakala (pronounced Hally-ekka-lah) I will sail for Honolulu again and thence to the Island of Hawaii (pronounced Hah-wy-ye,) {{to see the}} {{greatest}} active volcano in the world--that of Kilauea (pronounced Kee-low-way-ah)--and from thence back to San Francisco--and then, doubtless, to the States. I have been on this trip two months, and {{it will probably be}} two more <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> California.|$|R
60|$|<b>Before</b> <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> {{the door}} the Count stopped me, by {{a request for}} a cup of tea. I gave him the cup of tea, and tried a second time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away. He stopped me again--this time by going back to the piano, and {{suddenly}} appealing to me on a musical question in which he declared that the honour of his country was concerned.|$|R
