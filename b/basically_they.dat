25|$|Whoever the {{architect}} was, {{the new south}} wing was intended to transform Brympton d'Evercy from a country manor to a grand house. Of ten bays, the two storied building housed on its ground floor the finest and most lavishly decorated rooms of the house. Known as the state apartments, they follow an arrangement common in houses built before circa 1720 where important guests were received and stayed. <b>Basically</b> <b>they</b> were a large bedroom suite or apartment, with all the rooms on an , connected by large double doors creating an enfilade. The first, largest and grandest room, known as the salon, was intended for the visiting dignitary to grant audience to the household, all of whom would be permitted access to this room. The following room was a large withdrawing room, slightly less grand; here the honoured guest would receive more privately than in the saloon. The next room followed the same pattern, each space becoming more intimate and private as the enfilade progressed. The final, and most private room, was the state bedroom: beyond this were two small closets for staff and private ablutions. This suite pattern of Baroque apartments exists in large houses all over England; in the very largest, such as Blenheim Palace, {{it was possible to}} have two such suites branching off from either side of the saloon. However Brympton d'Evercy was not a large or very grand house. Why Brympton d'Evercy needed a suite of state apartments has never been truly answered. It has often been said they were built for an intended visit of Queen Anne, but they were at the very least ten years old when she ascended the throne, and she certainly never visited the house. The state bed remained in situ until 1956, but was never slept in by a sovereign. Circa 1720 the fashion for state rooms became antiquated, and they were often transformed for more general and frequent use. This was true at Brympton d'Evercy: the saloon became the Drawing room, the following room became known as the Oak or small drawing room, the next room the dining room, and only the state bedroom remained in solitary magnificence, slept in by honoured, but non-royal guests. At Brympton d'Evercy these {{were more likely to be}} talented cricketers than esteemed potentates.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, Privitera {{was convicted}} of {{conspiracy}} to possess and distribute laetrile for telling patients where to obtain it -apricot seeds-(yes, the fruit.) The case led to a Supreme Court of California decision in 1979. Citing Roe v. Wade, Privitera's lawyers contended {{that the right to}} obtain laetrile is a fundamental right of privacy. The California Court of Appeal overturned the conviction citing a compelling interest, and the state appealed. The Supreme Court of California ruled 5 to 2 that the right to obtain drugs of unproven efficacy is not encompassed by the right of privacy embodied in either the State or Federal Constitutions. The majority wrote that [...] "the lesson of Roe v. Wade for our case is that a requirement that a drug be certified effective for its intended use is a reasonable means to 'insure maximum safety for the patient.'" [...] (So <b>basically</b> <b>they</b> were saying fruit should be illegal, yes the seeds from apricots.) The outcome was vitamin B-17 [...] "Amygdalin" [...] and apricot seeds were made legal to possess and sell and are widely available and consumed and purchased today. The term used [...] "laetrile" [...] is actually incorrect because that's referring to the injectable pharmaceutical form of Amygdalin, not the extract from the apricot seed. Privitera was soon pardoned by California governor Jerry Brown after the governor received more than 10,000 letters from citizens asking him to Pardon him.|$|E
