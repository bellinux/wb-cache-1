5|$|By 1843, public {{dissatisfaction with}} him had reached crisis {{proportions}} {{and there were}} demands for a Constitution. Initially Otto refused to grant a Constitution, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> Bavarian troops were withdrawn from the kingdom, a popular revolt was launched.|$|E
5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend remembered that the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the lights came on he would rush home {{to see if he could}} duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many of the victims of Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he became leader, Brezhnev began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E

5|$|Dot and Abi make a rum {{cake for}} Patrick's {{birthday}} <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> Abi leaves {{the house for}} Exeter, Dot trips over Dave and nobody knows she is seriously injured until another step-granddaughter Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) finds her. Dot is then taken to hospital and Sonia blames the residents for not looking out her and scolds Sharon and Ian. Dot is left worried when the doctor tells her that she will need an operation after her fall has caused problems to her hip. Dot refuses physio and loses her temper with the doctors when they won't let her have a cigarette. Dot is heartbroken when Sonia and Robbie inform her that Dave has died but is relieved when Dave {{shows up at the}} hospital alive.|$|E
5|$|However, Rainbow Dash {{is still}} {{apart from the}} group and without her, the Elements will not activate. They find Rainbow Dash {{protecting}} a cloud, believing it to be her home of Cloudsdale. They start to give chase, but Rainbow flies away. They quickly use a hot-air balloon, pulled along by Fluttershy, {{to catch up to}} Rainbow. At first, it seems that Rainbow has the upper hand, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> Twilight reminds Fluttershy that if she gets away Discord will win, Fluttershy puts on an enormous burst of speed and the ponies eventually catch Rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for Twilight to cast her memory spell. The ponies share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord's influence.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 7th Marines {{opened the}} road between Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri by {{capturing}} {{the high ground}} surrounding the road. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the Marines pulled out, the 77th Division returned to the peaks and attacked the column. Chaotic fighting broke out within the column and the retreat was slowed to a crawl. The Marine night fighters, however, returned to subdue the Chinese forces, and the fighting destroyed most of the blocking troops. On 7 December, {{the rest of the}} column managed to reach Koto-ri with little difficulty with the last elements arrived at Koto-ri that night.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Eurypontid King of Sparta Eudamidas III, son of Agis IV, died. Pausanias, the Greek writer, {{claims that}} Cleomenes had him poisoned. In order to {{strengthen}} his position against the ephors, who {{were opposed to}} his expansionist policy, Cleomenes recalled his uncle Archidamus V from his exile in Messene to ascend the Eurypontid throne, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> Archidamus returned to the city, he was assassinated. Cleomenes' involvement in the plot is unclear, since ancient sources contradict each other: Polybius claims that Cleomenes ordered the murder, but Plutarch disagrees.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{story about}} an aloviti man, who is {{described}} as unusually tall, thin, bony-faced, and with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was nice, he worked and behaved like the other people in his village, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the dark clouds covered the sky, he used to close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone and in a trance as long as the bad weather and thunder lasted. Historical persons believed to be aloviti men are Stefan Nemanja, and Stefan Dečanski.|$|E

5|$|After an {{interlude}} {{of several}} months in which the Peloponnesians constructed new ships and the Athenians besieged cities and raised money throughout the Aegean, the next major sea battle took place the spring of 410 BC at Cyzicus. Alcibiades {{had been forced to}} flee from Sestos to Cardia to protect his small fleet from the rebuilt Peloponnesian navy, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the Athenian fleet was reunited there its commanders led it to Cyzicus, where the Athenians had intelligence indicating that Pharnabazus and Mindarus, the Peloponnesian fleet commander, were together plotting their next move. Concealed by storm and darkness, the combined Athenian force reached the vicinity without being spotted by the Peloponnesians. Here the Athenians devised a plot to draw the enemy into battle. According to Diodorus Siculus, Alcibiades advanced with a small squadron in order to draw the Spartans out to battle, and, after he successfully deceived Mindarus with this ploy, the squadrons of Thrasybulus and Theramenes came to join him, cutting off the Spartans' retreat.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E
5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E

5|$|Diogenes {{had been}} married to an {{anonymous}} daughter of Basil Argyros, brother of Emperor Romanos III Argyros (r. 1028–1034), but in 1029 he was accused, along with other prominent Balkan generals such as Eustathios Daphnomeles, of conspiring against the emperor with the porphyrogennete princess Theodora. He was transferred east as strategos of the Thracesian Theme <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> his complicity in the affair was confirmed, was recalled to Constantinople. There he was imprisoned, beaten and publicly paraded in the Mese {{along with the other}} conspirators, and later tonsured and forced to enter the Stoudios Monastery. Theodora herself was placed in a convent, but she apparently continued to conspire with Diogenes, who planned to take advantage of Romanos's absence on campaign in the East in 1032 to escape to the Balkans. The plot was leaked to Romanos by Theophanes, metropolitan of Thessalonica, and the conspirators were arrested. Diogenes was brought to the Palace of Blachernae for interrogation by John the Orphanotrophos, but he committed suicide, throwing himself off a wall, rather than confess under torture and implicate his fellow conspirators.|$|E
5|$|Following this disaster, Sayf al-Dawla {{needed time}} to recover his strength, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> Nikephoros Phokas {{returned}} victorious from Crete in summer 961, he resumed the offensive in the east. The Byzantines captured Anazarbus in Cilicia, and followed a deliberate policy of devastation and massacre to drive the Muslim population away. Sayf al-Dawla's attempts to halt the Byzantine advance in Cilicia failed, and Nikephoros Phokas, with an army reportedly 70,000 strong, took Marash, Sisium, Duluk and Manbij, securing the western passes over the Anti-Taurus Mountains. Sayf al-Dawla sent his army north under Nadja to meet the Byzantines, but Nikephoros ignored them. Instead, the Byzantine general led his troops south and in mid-December, they suddenly appeared before Aleppo. There they defeated an improvised army before the city walls. The Byzantines stormed the city and plundered it, except for the citadel, which continued to hold out. The Byzantines departed in early 963, taking much of the populace with them as captives.|$|E
5|$|Henry re-granted Pevensey Castle to Gilbert I de l'Aigle but {{continued}} {{to use it for}} his own purposes, as happened in 1101 when he spent the summer at Pevensey to deter a threatened invasion by Duke Robert of Normandy. Pevensey was confiscated again by the Crown under King Stephen, with Gilbert's family also losing the rest of their possessions. It was subsequently re-granted to Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who switched his allegiance to Stephen's cousin and rival, the Empress Matilda, in 1141. Although Gilbert changed his loyalty back to Stephen the following year, he was taken hostage by the king in 1147 after a revolt by Gilbert's uncle, Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. A promise to surrender the Clare family's castles secured Gilbert's release <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he was freed, he too rebelled. In response, Stephen undertook the second siege of Pevensey Castle with a land and sea blockade. The castle once again proved impervious to direct assault but the garrison was eventually starved out.|$|E

60|$|The Baxters {{were hiding}} behind {{a clump of}} bushes, <b>but</b> now, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> discovered, they took to their heels, {{making sure that the}} bushes and trees should keep them screened, so {{that there would be no}} danger from a fire such as had brought down their unlucky companion.|$|R

5|$|In 1032, Barbolano {{himself was}} deposed {{by those who}} wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge lay dying in Constantinople {{and was unable to}} return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, {{attempted}} to seize the throne without waiting for the formality of an election, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne simply because {{he was the son of}} Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely checked, and Domenico Flabanico, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election of a son of a Doge.|$|E
5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E
