25|$|Protected {{areas in}} {{developing}} countries, where probably {{as many as}} 70–80 percent of the species of the world live, still enjoy very little effective management and protection. Some countries, such as Mexico, have non-profit civil organizations and landowners dedicated to protecting vast private property, {{such is the case}} of Hacienda Chichen's Maya Jungle Reserve and <b>Bird</b> <b>Refuge</b> in Chichen Itza, Yucatán. The Adopt A Ranger Foundation has calculated that worldwide about 140,000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transition countries. There are no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment, but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50% short This means {{that there would be a}} worldwide ranger deficit of 105,000 rangers in the developing and transition countries.|$|E
