Another early one developed by Malthus is the population principle, now called the Malthusian principle. Freud also wrote on principles, especially the reality principle necessary to keep the id and pleasure principle in check. Biologists use the principle of priority and principle of <b>Binominal</b> <b>nomenclature</b> for precision in naming species. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in cosmology which observes the mediocrity principle, the anthropic principle, the principle of relativity and the cosmological principle. Other well-known principles include the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics and the pigeonhole principle and superposition principle in mathematics.|$|E
40|$|The older {{system for}} {{classification}} of ribbed calcareous Early Cretaceous aptychi {{consisted of two}} genera: Punctaptychus and Lamellaptychus. Later, I. Turculet divided Lamellaptychus into several subgenera. Within the framework of both the genera, species and subspecies were distinguished, which resulted in <b>binominal</b> and trinominal <b>nomenclature.</b> With regard to the richness of newly described species and subspecies in recent years, {{is not possible to}} continue using the original system. It is the basic ribbing that plays the decisive role in the generic and subgeneric classification of ribbed aptychi. In the case of subspecies systematics, all details on the valve surface are used {{with the exception of the}} sigmoidal bend (fractocostatus) and radial lines (radiatus). The ribbed aptychi are newly divided into the following families: Punctaptychidae fam. nov. and Lamellaptychidae fam. nov. Within the family Punctaptychidae we are able to distinguish two genera: Punctaptychus Trauth, 1927 and Cinctpunctaptychus gen. nov. The family Lamellaptychidae includes five genera differing in the basic arrangement of the ribs: Lamellaptychus Trauth, 1927, Beyrichilamellaptychus Turculet, 1994, Mortilletilamellaptychus gen. nov., Thorolamellaptychus Turculet, 1994 and Didayilamellaptychus Turculet, 1994. Eight species and one subspecies are established as new: Cinctpunctaptychus undulatus, Beyrichilamellaptychus pseudostuderi, Mortilletilamellaptychus mortilletioides, M. submortilleti noricus, M. stanislavi, Didayilamellaptychus hennigi, D. andrusovi and D. renzi...|$|R
5000|$|Binomial {{nomenclature}} (also called <b>binominal</b> <b>nomenclature</b> or binary nomenclature) is {{a formal}} system of naming species of living things by giving each a name {{composed of two}} parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just [...] "binomial"), a binomen, binominal name or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The {{first part of the}} name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens. The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book Pinax theatri botanici (English, Illustrated exposition of plants) many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.|$|E

30|$|Cl. bifermentans {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Tissier and Martelly in 1902. A taxonomic relationship to Cl. sordelli, isolated first in 1922, {{resulted in the}} symptomatic fact that both strains were identified as one species (Brooks & Epps 1958). As late as in 1963, Cl. bifermentans and Cl. sordelli were distinguished as separate species of the genus Clostridium. As a main factor whose influence was taken into consideration here was pathogenicity: Cl. sordelli {{was described as a}} pathogenic variant of non-pathogenic Cl. bifermentans. Additionally, these two bacterial species can be distinguished one from another in the urease-production test. By 1955, the idea of separating Cl. bifermentans and Cl. sordelli gained acceptance of researchers. The original isolate of Clostridium bifermentans was named Bacillus bifermentans sporogenes (Clark and Hall 1937), and later re-named B. bifermentans (Bergey et al. 1923), in accordance with the principle of <b>binominal</b> <b>nomenclature</b> (Brooks & Epps 1958). The main sources of Cl. bifermentans occur in water, soil, sewage (Nachman et al. 1989), sludge, and animal faeces (Wang et al. 2003).|$|E
40|$|The {{etymology}} of the reptiles, {{especially the}} lizards of Iran {{has not been}} completely presented in other published works. Iran is a very active geographic area for any animals, and more especially for lizards, due to its wide range deserts and ecology. We have attempted to ascertain, as much as possible, {{the construction of the}} Latin binomials of all Iranian lizard species. We believe that a review of these names is instructive, not only in codifying many aspects of the biology of the lizards, but in presenting a historical overview of collectors and taxonomic work in Iran and Middle East region. We have listed all recorded lizards of Iran according to the order of the scientific names in the book of Anderson, The Lizards of Iran. All lizard species and types have been grouped under their proper Families, and then they have been alphabetically ordered based on their scientific <b>binominal</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> We also examined numerous published works in addition to those included in the original papers presenting each binomial...|$|E
40|$|When {{speaking}} of the Scientific concepts, as the scientific concepts are well understood {{in the context of}} their definition, many words and definition are explained in a few lines in Hindi or in English. A bench mark has been fixed with the Molluscan biology to explain the fisheries contexts. The generic, species names and international concepts have been retained as such and rendered in Devanagari script; in certain cases of <b>binominal</b> <b>nomenclature,</b> taxonomical reference with common names are given. Words and expressions of common interests have also been compared with other fisheries departmental glossaries to bring in equilibrium of words. Selected common fish names have been adopted from regional languages and so also the pan Hindi usages like kayal, kattamaram, chakara, pokkali, bheri etc. We have also tried to add latest and most up to date English words on fisheries to make it acceptable to educational circles and Government departments. In fact this glossary is a compilation of more than eight thousand technical referral terms which we were referring and adding for more than the last 2 decades while enriching the Hindi literature on fisheries...|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{available}} reference sequences on the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD), {{it was impossible}} to assign the majority of OTUs to formally described species with <b>binominal</b> <b>nomenclature</b> with our assignment criteria. For our 35 most common OTUs, 7 OTUs matched to reference sequences only at family, 14 OTUs to genus, and 14 OTUs to species level (see Additional file 5 for all details). Furthermore, it is notable that the reference sequences with the best matches for OTU 2 (99.52 %), OTU 138 (97.36 %), OTU 466 (98.06 %), and OTU 316 (98.32 %) all bear the same species name Brillia bifida. The same case was observed for OTU 20 and 29, which best match to reference sequences belonging to Polypedilum convictum with a match of 99.52 and 100 %, respectively. Whereas only one OTU bearing the name B. bifida was obtained when clustering was based on a 5 % threshold, still, two separate OTUs were found for P. convictum (99.52 % and 100 % similarity to reference sequences, respectively). When statistically reanalyzed the one B. bifidia, OTU responded {{the same way as the}} individual separate OTUs, i.e., being insensitive to manipulation in the streambed and decreasing in the leaf litter with reduced flow velocity (ANOVA, flow velocity, p[*]<[*] 0.01; partial η 2 [*]=[*] 0.251). In addition, the individual response patterns of both P. convictum OTUs were unaffected by the different clustering thresholds.|$|E
30|$|The {{comparison}} of OTU sequences with the Barcode of life database (BOLD) suggests {{that only a}} very small fraction of OTUs can be assigned reliably to formally described species with <b>binominal</b> <b>nomenclature</b> at this time. Even though this situation will improve in the future, when more reference sequences are released, assigning species names to chironomid OTUs will be an ongoing problem as comparisons with sequence databases might provide contradicting and puzzling results (as observed for Chironomidae, [7]. It needs to be considered if studying autecology is sufficient on OTU level in case a species name cannot be assigned. The potential of studying ecology on OTU level is maybe best being demonstrated not by the case, where no species can be assigned to an OTU, but by the reverse cases of several OTUs being assigned to the same species. In this study, the sequences of four OTUs (2, 138, 316, and 466) match best to reference sequences on BOLD that all bear the name Brillia bifida. For other Chironomidae species, a comparably high species delineation threshold (e.g., for the genus Tanytarsus; [39]) has been suggested and all four OTUs here might very well represent B. bifida from a morphological point of view. Thus, one could treat these four OTUs as one response variable in the stressor analysis. While two of the four OTUs (2 and 466) were only analyzed in the streambed and were both insensitive to the experimental manipulation, all four OTUs in the leaf litter responded negatively to flow reduction. In this case, pooling the four OTUs prior to stressor analysis would have delivered the same result, which was confirmed by a second statistical analysis based on the 5 % clustering data. In contrast, OTU 20 and OTU 29, which both correspond to Polypedilum convictum, show a different response to flow reduction in the leaf litter and pooling these according to a different threshold would have changed the biological interpretation. While our study cannot clarify species status of these OTUs, the data can reveal differences between closely related OTUs.|$|E
