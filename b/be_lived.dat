5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} religious {{language and}} experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should <b>be</b> <b>lived.</b>|$|E
5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should <b>be</b> <b>lived</b> with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E
25|$|In Sikh thought, Hell and Heaven are not {{places for}} living hereafter, {{they are part}} of spiritual {{topography}} of man and do not exist otherwise. They refer to good and evil stages of life respectively and can <b>be</b> <b>lived</b> now and here during our earthly existence. For example, Guru Arjan explains that people who are entangled in emotional attachment and doubt are living in hell on this Earth i.e. their life is hellish.|$|E

For example, during one show {{it was unclear whether}} the show <b>was</b> <b>live</b> or prerecorded. Ken persuaded {{listeners}} the show was prerecorded and Andy persuaded the listeners the show <b>was</b> <b>live.</b> The fatal flaw was Ken kept quoting a live poll on the website to see whether listeners thought the show <b>was</b> <b>live</b> or not, thus proving it <b>was</b> <b>live</b> and leaving little material {{for the rest of the}} show.|$|R
25|$|As per Sikh thought, Heaven and Hell are not {{places for}} living hereafter, {{they are part}} of spiritual {{topography}} of man and do not exist otherwise. They refer to good and evil stages of life respectively and can <b>be</b> <b>lived</b> now and here during our earthly existence. For example, Bhagat Kabir rejects the otherworldly Heaven in Guru Granth Sahib and says that one can experience Heaven on this Earth by doing company of holy people.|$|E
25|$|The shared {{beliefs of}} Orthodoxy, and its theology, exist within the Holy Tradition and cannot be {{separated}} from it, for their meaning is not expressed in mere words alone. Doctrine cannot be understood unless it is prayed. To be a theologian, one must know how to pray, and one who prays in spirit and in truth becomes a theologian by doing so. Doctrine must also <b>be</b> <b>lived</b> {{in order to be}} prayed, for without action, the prayer is idle and empty, a mere vanity, and therefore the theology of demons. According to these teachings of the ancient church, no superficial belief can ever be orthodox. Similarly, reconciliation and unity are not superficial, but are prayed and lived out.|$|E
500|$|Chrysippus {{taught that}} ethics {{depended}} on physics. In his Physical Theses, he stated: [...] "for {{there is no}} other or more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness than from the nature of all things and the administration of the universe." [...] The goal of life, said Chrysippus, is to live in accordance with one's experience of the actual course of nature. A person's individual nature is part {{of the nature of the}} whole universe, and thus life should <b>be</b> <b>lived</b> in accordance with one's own human nature as well as that of the universe. Human nature is ethical, and humanity is akin to the Divine, emanating from the primal fire or aether, which, though material, is the embodiment of reason; and people should conduct themselves accordingly. People have freedom, and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires (lust, riches, position in life, domination, etc.) and in subjecting the will to reason. Chrysippus laid the greatest stress on the worth and dignity of the individual, and on the power of will.|$|E

500|$|The old [...] "Painter's Passage", {{parallel}} to the South Drawing Room was renovated after the Second World War when glass cases were installed along its length to showcase the Spencer crockery, {{with a range of}} porcelain including Meissen, Sèvres, Kangxi, Chelsea and Derby pieces. Charles Spencer remarked that his grandfather Albert was trying to say, [...] "This part of Althorp will never <b>be</b> <b>lived</b> in again; so we may as well use it to show off the treasures in an orderly way". Today, most of the collection has been moved to the China Museum which lies {{on the east side of}} the house, between the Sutherland Room and the Great Dining Room, and the passage now contains a series of busts and paintings in its place, including a self-portrait of Sofonisba Anguisciola, and portraits of the dramatist Molière and the actor David Garrick. Charles Spencer highlights a pair of late 17th century blue and white tulipieres, special vases to hold tulips which were fashionable at the time, as his favourite in the museum.|$|E
500|$|August Strindberg was {{familiar}} with Either/Or and this book made him [...] "forever a champion of the ethical as juxtaposed to the aesthetic life conception and he always remained faithful {{to the idea that}} art and knowledge must be [...] to life, and that life itself must <b>be</b> <b>lived</b> as we know best, chiefly because we are part of it and cannot escape from its promptings." [...] Strindberg was obviously attracted to Either/Or Part II where Kierkegaard developed his categorical imperative. He wrote the following in Growth of a Soul published posthumously in 1913 about Kierkegaard’s Either—Or: [...] "it was valid only for the priests who called themselves Christians and the seducer and Don Juan were the author himself, who satisfied his desires in imagination". Part II was his [...] "Discourse on Life as a Duty, and when he {{reached the end of the}} work he found the moral philosopher in despair, and that all this teaching about duty had only produced a Philistine." [...] He then states that Kierkegaard's discourses might have led him closer to Christianity but he didn't know if he could come back to something [...] "which had been torn out, and joyfully thrown into the fire". However, after reading the book he [...] "felt sinful". Then another writer began to influence his life. This is how he described Either/Or: ...|$|E
500|$|The booklet {{contains}} outdated {{discussions of}} health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, {{seem to be more}} personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one ("I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I {{just wanted to tell you}} the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me."). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>lived.</b> An example is the poem typed on the [...] "Aye Davanita" [...] page. The song's subtitle is [...] "The song without words", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of [...] "intruder words" [...] is on the [...] "Not for You" [...] lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth ("Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock"). The lyrics to [...] "Whipping" [...] are written on a copy of a petition to Bill Clinton against [...] "pro-life" [...] killings of abortion doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for [...] "Corduroy".|$|E

30|$|A PN {{is said to}} <b>be</b> <b>live</b> if {{and only}} if, from any node in its {{reachability}} graph, {{it is possible to}} find a directed path having this node as origin. In other words, the PN <b>is</b> <b>live</b> when each node of its directed graph is the origin of at least one arc. If we consider the coverability graph of Figure 7, we notice that each node contains at least one arc as origin; thus, this coverability graph <b>is</b> <b>live.</b> Likewise, for the proposed PN model of Figure 6, we can clearly see that each transition contains at least one arc to reach its next state until the spectrum sharing process arrives to its end. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed PN <b>is</b> <b>live.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Camus {{states in}} The Myth of Sisyphus: [...] "Thus I {{draw from the}} absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere {{activity}} of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide." [...] "Revolt" [...] here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; [...] "Freedom" [...] refers {{to the lack of}} imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; [...] "Passion" [...] refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must <b>be</b> <b>lived</b> fully.|$|E
2500|$|The {{outlines}} of the Cistercian reform were adumbrated by Alberic, but it received its final form in the Carta caritatis (Charter of Charity), which was the defining guide on how the reform was to <b>be</b> <b>lived.</b> [...] This document governed [...] {{the relations between the}} various houses of the Cistercian order, and exercised a great influence also upon the future course of western monachism. From one point of view, it may be regarded as a compromise between the primitive Benedictine system, in which each abbey was autonomous and isolated, and the complete centralization of Cluny, where the Abbot of Cluny was the only true superior in the entire Order.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{only will}} the believers spend eternity with God, {{they will also}} spend it with each other.

[...] 'Heaven' will be the place where life will <b>be</b> <b>lived</b> to the full, {{in the way that the}} designer planned, each believer 'loving the Lord their God with all their heart and with all their soul and with all their mind' and 'loving their neighbour as themselves' (adapted from Matthew 22:37–38, the Great Commandment)—a place of great joy, without the negative aspects of earthly life.

A dairy (since demolished) was designed by Robert Adam, 1776-77. The house was given Gothic castellations and extended further about 1820 to designs by John Foster, William Burn (who provided a boathouse and bridges in the park) and other architects.
