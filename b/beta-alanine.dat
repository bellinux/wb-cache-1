50|$|The first sting is {{delivered}} to the prothoracic ganglion (mass of nerve tissue) which causes 2-3 minute paralysis of the front legs. This sting injects significant quantities of gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) and complementary agonists taurine and <b>beta-alanine.</b> The concoction temporarily blocks the motor action potentials in the prothoracic ganglion by depressing cholinergic transmission through the increased chloride conductance across nerve synapses. Individually, all of these substances induce short-term paralysis of the cockroach. When they are injected together in a ratio of 1:0.7:0.4, the effect was longer lasting. GABA activates ligand-gated chloride channels by binding to GABA receptors. Taurine and <b>beta-alanine</b> likely extend {{the duration of the}} paralytic affect by slowing the uptake of GABA by the synaptic cleft. Combined, this cocktail of compounds prevents the cockroach from moving and defending itself while the wasp administers the second sting/series of stings.|$|E
50|$|N-Acetylcarnosine (NAC) is a {{naturally}} occurring compound chemically {{related to the}} dipeptide carnosine.
