5|$|Quantico {{continues}} to be popular in Australia, Canada, France and India. The premiere episode had 2.6 million viewers in Canada, the largest audience for a new television series that year. It was the most-watched episode, behind The <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>Theory</b> (which had 2.8 million). Averaging 2.17 million viewers, Quantico was Canada's most-watched drama series, most-watched new series and second-most-watched series (after The <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>Theory)</b> in 2015. It was the most-watched drama series of 2015 in Australia and the second-most-watched series overall (after The <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>Theory).</b> In France, the series premiered to 4.9 million viewers (a 21-percent audience share) and averaged 3.1 million viewers during its first season. According to a Business Insider report (with 2.1million views per month), Quantico was the 12th-most-popular TV show of 2016 based on ratings, peer-to-peer sharing, social-media chatter and viewer demand.|$|E

5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>theory.</b> Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>theory</b> still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E

5|$|According to the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>theory,</b> the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>theory.</b> The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E
5|$|The 11.73 {{million people}} tuned into the episode marked a 3percent viewership {{increase}} from the season eight finale (11.44 million), and a 13percent {{increase from the}} previous season premiere (10.38million). The episode's 4.4 Nielsen rating in the 18–49demographic was a 7percent increase from the season eight finale and previous season premiere, which both received 4.1 18–49 ratings. The Nielsen score additionally registered the show as the week's highest rated drama and third-highest rated scripted series in the 18–49demographic, placing behind CBS's The <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>Theory</b> (5.0) and ABC's Modern Family (5.5). Seven days of time-shifted viewing added on an additional 1.5 rating points in the 18–49demographic and 3.28 million viewers, bringing the total viewership for the episode to 15.01 million viewers with a 5.9 Nielsen rating in the 18–49demographic.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>theory</b> is the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E
50|$|At Imperial College London on July 2, 2015, Corral {{presented}} a model that, using relativistic equations, predicted very low entropy at the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang.</b> Her <b>theory</b> {{disagreed with the}} phase-space volume posited by Stephen Hawking, who, Corral said, did {{not take into account}} the asymmetrical component of time when calculating the entropy in the <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> singularity.

2500|$|Don Page {{criticized the}} entire theory of cosmic {{inflation}} as follows. He emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic arrow {{of time in}} a universe with a <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the entropy of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. Paul Davies rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle. While Davies accepted {{the premise that the}} initial state of the visible universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value—due to random quantum fluctuations—to account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any [...] "ad hoc" [...] hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> <b>theories</b> require.|$|R
