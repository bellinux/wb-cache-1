5|$|Cathodoluminescence (CL) — light {{emission}} excited by electron beam — {{is a process}} commonly observed in TV screens. An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material. This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It would <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> apply this technique to carbon nanotubes. However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain (n,m) indices, has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{a sacrament}} {{signifying}} the baptized person's union with Christ, or {{becoming part of}} Christ and being treated {{as if they had}} done everything Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments are believed to have their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> those who have faith in Christ.|$|E
5|$|In {{further studies}} {{conducted}} by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> cardiovascular health.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays {{a crucial role}} in the immune system. The microorganisms that make up the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are seen to <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{letter was}} written in {{response}} to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the letter is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> the Irish people. The tone of the letter is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E

5|$|Beetles can <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> human {{economics}} {{by controlling}} {{the populations of}} pests. The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are pests. Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect pests, including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{workers are}} gamergates, meaning they can {{reproduce}} with winged males. With workers {{taking over the}} reproductive role, queens are relatively insignificant and are rarely produced in colonies. Nuptial flight begins in spring, with males mating {{with one or two}} females. Queens that establish their own colonies are semi-claustral, going out and forage to support their young. Another way colonies are formed is through budding, where a subset of the colony leaves the main colony for an alternative nest site. The green-head ant is known for its painful and venomous sting that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive humans. However, they can also <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> humans, acting as a form of pest control by preying on agricultural pests such as beetles, moths and termites.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Washington {{traveled}} to Barbados with Lawrence, who {{was suffering from}} tuberculosis, {{with the hope that}} the climate would <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> Lawrence's health. Washington contracted smallpox during the trip, which left his face slightly scarred but immunized him against future exposures to the dreaded disease. Lawrence's health failed to improve, and he returned to Mount Vernon where he died in the summer of 1752. Lawrence's position as Adjutant General (militia leader) of Virginia was divided into four district offices after his death. Washington was appointed by Governor Dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in February 1753, with the rank of major in the Virginia militia. During this period, Washington became a Freemason while in Fredericksburg, although his involvement was minimal.|$|E

Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce that it is a date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl about the dead member, and she implies that others believe that something happened to her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten years would <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on the couch. Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her with knowledge of a lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E
5|$|Snowfall can <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> {{agriculture}} {{by serving}} as a thermal insulator, conserving {{the heat of the}} Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth, both directly and via runoff through streams and rivers, which supply irrigation canals. The following are examples of rivers that rely on meltwater from glaciers or seasonal snowpack as an important part of their flow on which irrigation depends: the Ganges, many of whose tributaries rise in the Himalayas and which provide much irrigation in northeast India, the Indus River, which rises in Tibet and provides irrigation water to Pakistan from rapidly retreating Tibetan glaciers, and the Colorado River, which receives much of its water from seasonal snowpack in the Rocky Mountains and provides irrigation water to some 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares).|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} rodent are monogamous, {{with an adult}} male and female forming a lasting pair bond. Monogamy can come in two forms; obligate and facultative. In obligate monogamy, both parents care for the {{offspring}} and play {{an important part in}} their survival. This occurs in species such as California mice, oldfield mice, Malagasy giant rats and beavers. In these species, males usually mate only with their partners. In addition to increased care for young, obligate monogamy can also <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female. In facultative monogamy, the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed. Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy, with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity.|$|E

5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this would <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans {{a chance to see}} what an opposition can or cannot do. When the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament. The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities {{in the area of}} phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> <b>to</b> make use of nutrients.|$|E
