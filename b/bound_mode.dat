The pattern of Aharonov-Bohm resonances is significantly different from the case of noninteracting electrons. The origin of the difference includes charging effects of excess charges, charge relaxation between the <b>bound</b> <b>modes,</b> the capacitive interaction between the <b>bound</b> <b>modes</b> and the extended edge channels nearby the antidot, and the competition between the single-particle level spacing and the charging energy of the antidot.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the current excited on an {{infinite}} microstrip line by a gap voltage source or a vertical probe feed at high frequency is examined. At high frequency the continuous-spectrum current excited on the line may become quite significant, due to both leaky-mode excitation as well as direct radiation from the source. However, even at arbitrarily high frequency the amplitude of the <b>bound</b> <b>mode</b> that is excited may be calculated from simple formulas for limiting cases.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{excitation}} {{of a physical}} leaky mode in a covered microstrip structure at low frequencies. We calculate the current excited in the line by a delta-gap voltage source via a full wave analysis based on a mixed potential integral equation scheme. The current in the line is decomposed into its <b>bound</b> <b>mode</b> and continuous spectrum components. The <b>bound</b> <b>mode</b> component {{is associated with the}} propagation effects whereas the continuous spectrum component is associated with reactive and/or radiative effects and contains the contribution of the leaky mode. Our analysis also includes a detail study of the dispersion relations of the bound and leaky modes along with their corresponding electric fields. At low frequencies, in the covered microstrip structure with a low top cover height, we have found that the <b>bound</b> <b>mode</b> role is superseded by the leaky mode, {{in the sense that it}} is the leaky mode which partially or totally carries the signal energy. Therefore, the spurious effects associated with the excitation of a leaky mode, which usually appear at high frequencies in open microstrip lines, appear here in the low frequency range. This effect may have very relevant practical consequences in the performance of such systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—By closely {{examining}} the resonant phenomena of a suspended, flat wire resonator, this paper speculates {{the existence of}} the fast-wave mode causing the anomalous resonance that cannot possibly be explained by the well-known <b>bound</b> <b>mode.</b> Followed by proposing a guiding structure model that allows the assessment of the effects of ground plane and sidewalls (external objects) on the guiding properties, the numerical accuracy of the full-wave spectral-domain approach method for the electrically large model is validated by performing the rigorous convergence study. A series of measurements on the resonator are conducted for the same guiding structure of various lengths, confirming that the anomalous resonance is indeed caused by a fast-wave {{in the form of a}} space-wave type leaky mode which also exhibits almost identical modal currents to those of the <b>bound</b> <b>mode.</b> Index Terms—Fast-wave, leaky mode, resonance, space-wave.

The expressions for the <b>bound</b> <b>modes</b> of the radiation field are derived in both interior and exterior regions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the localization and mass spectra of bulk matter fields on a Gergory-Rubakov-Sibiryakov-inspired braneworld. In this braneworld model, there are one thick brane {{located at the}} origin of the extra dimension and two thin branes at two sides. For spin 1 / 2 fermions coupled with the background scalar ϕ via ηΨ̅ϕ^pΨ with p a positive odd integer, the zero mode of left-hand fermions can be localized on the thick brane for finite distance of the two thin branes, and there exist some massive <b>bound</b> <b>modes</b> and resonance modes. The resonances correspond to the quasi-localized massive fermions. For free massless spin 0 scalars, the zero mode can not be localized on the thick brane when the two thin branes are located finitely. While for a massive scalar Φ coupled with itself and the background scalar field ϕ, {{in order to get a}} localized zero mode on the thick brane, a fine-tuning relation should be introduced. Some massive <b>bound</b> <b>modes</b> and resonances also will appear. For spin 1 vectors, there is no <b>bound</b> KK <b>mode</b> because the effective potential felt by vectors vanishes outside the two thin branes. We also investigate the physics when the distance of the two thin branes tends to infinity. Comment: 30 pages, 14 figures, typos corrected, accepted by JAC...|$|R

40|$|Traveling wave antennas for the {{millimeter}} {{wave range}} face two main problems: higher metal loss {{at the higher}} frequencies, and fabrication difficulties due to the smaller wavelengths. These two problems are addressed here by {{a new type of}} leaky wave antenna, in which the fabrication problem is minimized by employing a longitudinally continuous aperture, and the higher loss reduced by basing the antenna on a low-loss waveguide, the groove guide. A longitudinally continuous asymmetric metal strip provides the mechanism that transforms the initially <b>bound</b> <b>mode</b> into a leaky mode. An accurate analysis, based on a transverse equivalent network, is presented here for the properties of this leaky structure that takes into account the mode conversion from the <b>bound</b> <b>mode</b> to the leaky mode. All the constituents of this transverse equivalent network are obtained in closed form, thus yielding a dispersion relation in closed form. Part I of these two companion papers describes the new antenna and its principle of operation, and then derives the parameters of the complete transverse equivalent network. Part II is concerned with the properties of the leaky mode and their relations to leaky wave antenna performance; design considerations together with a variety of numerical results are contained in Part II...|$|E

40|$|Optical {{waveguide}}s carry <b>bound</b> <b>modes</b> which {{consist of}} a core E and H field, winch is oscillatory across the waveguide and evanescent in the waveguide cladding. Both the core and cladding component of each mode has the same frequency and propagation constant. When {{the frequency of the}} light earned by the waveguide matches an absorption transition of the material of the cladding, the mode loses optical power as it propagates due to the attenuation of the evanescent cladding portion of the mode. This process is called attenuated total reflection spectroscopy (ATR) or evanescent wave spectrophotometry. As in simple transmission spectrophotometry the absorbance of the mode is related to the interaction length of the waveguide with the absorbing cladding, the concentration of the absorbing species of the cladding and the fraction of the optical power in the evanescent waves of the various modes. This work firstly represents a theoretical analysis of the <b>bound</b> <b>modes</b> that can exist in a step index hollow cylindrical waveguide, their evanescent power fraction and the effective length of such a waveguide when located in an absorbing cladding material. The waveguide is found to have a normalized frequency or effective V number whose magnitude determines the total number of <b>bound</b> <b>modes</b> and influences the mean evanescent power fraction between modes. This effective V number reduces to that of the solid step index fiber waveguide in the limit of a zero radius inner cavity Likewise the expression for the mean evanescent mode power fraction becomes - in the limit of zero inner radius - identical to that of the fiber waveguide. The evanescent absorbance of such a hollow waveguide located in an absorbmg fluid is modeled in terms of the bulk absorption coefficient of the fluid and the waveguide dimensions. In {{the second part of the}} thesis a set of experimental absorbance values for ATR spectrophotometry using a hollow silica waveguide probe are reported. Good correspondence is found between the theoretical model and the experimental data...|$|R

The beamwidth of the <b>bound</b> <b>mode</b> spin waves is almost independent from the frequency and is smaller than 24 nm. For a low-frequency excitation, we further investigate the appearance of two other spin beams in the lateral of the channel.

40|$|The {{accepted}} {{model for}} light emission and propagation in organic LEDs (OLED) {{which consists of}} several optically thin functional layers deposited on a thick substrate is a classical dipole located in the emitting layer.
