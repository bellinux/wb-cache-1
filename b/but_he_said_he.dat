5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She made a conscious effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
25|$|Pritchett {{published}} five novels, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> did {{not enjoy}} writing them. His reputation was established by {{a collection of short}} stories, The Spanish Virgin and Other Stories (1932).|$|E
25|$|Smith {{made his}} first start for eight months in Manchester United's 2–1 away win over Crewe Alexandra in the fourth round of the League Cup. However, he was still not fully match-fit and made only one {{substitute}} appearance {{in the next four}} months. As he continued his training, both Cardiff City and former club Leeds United expressed an interest in signing Smith on loan, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> intended to fight for his place in the Manchester United team.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, Davis was {{starring}} in Golden Boy {{at night and}} shooting his own New York-based afternoon talk show during the day. When {{he could get a}} day off from the theater, he recorded songs in the studio, performed at charity events in Chicago, Miami, or Las Vegas, or appeared on television variety specials in Los Angeles. Davis felt he was cheating his family of his company, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was incapable of standing still.|$|E
25|$|Constitutional law expert Mario Amoretti, while {{agreeing that}} the ruling should be final, remarked {{that the state}} conceivably could file a challenge, {{claiming}} some constitutional violation, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> didn't see grounds for such an appeal. Berenson was required to remain in Peru on supervised parole until her 20-year sentence ended in 2015, unless the sentence was commuted by the President. When he was President, Alan Garcia said he would consider a commutation only after the legal case had run its course.|$|E
500|$|A month later, Cleveland {{brought in}} Romeo Crennel {{as the head}} coach, signing him to a five-year deal worth $11 million. Crennel was the {{defensive}} coordinator for the New England Patriots, who had just won the Super Bowl. His style was described as [...] "quiet, reserved and gentlemanly", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> wanted to stock the team with tough, physical players. Before the start of training camp, the Browns acquired veteran quarterback Trent Dilfer from the Seattle Seahawks. In the draft that year the Browns took wide receiver Braylon Edwards with the third pick in the first round.|$|E

500|$|Leopard Trek {{entered the}} Giro with limited aspirations. Squad leader Wegmann {{was a former}} Giro {{mountains}} classification winner, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would not target that award in the 2011 Giro and instead hoped for a stage win. He said the squad would aim to finish eighth or better in the opening team time trial and that Zaugg was the squad's general classification rider, though it would be unlikely for him to finish higher than 15th. The squad came in 14th in the team time trial, finishing with eight riders together at a deficit of 42 seconds to the winners [...] Weylandt was ninth in the field sprint to finish stage 2 the next day.|$|E
500|$|Shankly {{emphasised}} {{the importance}} of communication with the supporters. At Carlisle he used to speak to them over the public address system before matches. Rather than just putting a few lines in the match programme, he preferred to speak and explain his team changes and his views about the previous match. At Workington, he would answer supporters' letters in person, using an old typewriter. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> preferred to phone business-people as he would put {{as little as possible}} in writing when dealing with them. He would readily obtain match tickets for fans whom he considered to be deserving cases and wrote in his autobiography that he [...] "would give people anything within reason".|$|E
500|$|Many in {{the airline}} {{industry}} were critical of the book, and asserted that it contained factual inaccuracies. In 1998, Instructor Darryl Jenkins of George Washington University decided to assign a class project in a graduate course he was teaching on airline economics for students to fact-check statements made by Schiavo in the book. Edmund Pinto, a former Federal Aviation Administration spokesman and publisher of the newsletter Aviation Daily, later co-authored a report with Jenkins on their findings. In some instances the authors agreed with Schiavo's conclusions, but argued that what they saw as discrepancies detracted from Schiavo's position. In response Schiavo commented that the report by Jenkins and Pinto was [...] "hardly the sort of unbiased reporting which warrants my response", and an article on the matter in The Washington Post noted that: [...] "Jenkins occasionally does economic consulting work for airlines and for airline unions, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> took on the book project on his own." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{reason of}} his refusal was not (says his biographer) {{as some have}} imagined, his having taken the solemn league and covenant; for that he never did, and often {{declared}} that he ever thought it an unlawful oath: <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> could not say, for those that had taken the oath, that no obligation lay upon them, but feared there might." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{performance}} of the song [...] "Embraceable You" [...] impressed songwriter Jule Styne and his partner, Sammy Cahn, and they recommended her for a role in Romance on the High Seas (1948). Day got the part after auditioning for Michael Curtiz. She was shocked at being offered the role in that film, and admitted to Curtiz {{that she was a}} singer without acting experience. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> liked that [...] "she was honest," [...] not afraid to admit it. And he wanted someone who [...] "looked like the All-American Girl," [...] which he felt she did. She was the discovery he was most proud of during his career.|$|E

I opened the gates at ten minutes to six, and just as the fust man come on and walked down the wharf we slipped in and drove away.|$|R

2500|$|Abbott {{promised to}} [...] "tie {{outcomes}} to funding" [...] for pre-K programs if elected governor, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would not require government standardized testing for 4-year olds, as Davis has {{accused him of}} advancing. When defending his education plan, Abbott cited Charles Murray: [...] "Family background has the most decisive effect on student achievement, contributing to a large performance gap between children from economically disadvantaged families and those from middle class homes." [...] A spokesman for Abbott's campaign {{pointed out that the}} biggest difference in spending is that Davis has proposed universal pre-K education while Abbott wants to limit state funding to only programs that meet certain standards. Davis' plan could reach 750 million in costs and Abbott has said that Davis' plan is a [...] "budget buster" [...] whereas Abbott's education plan would cost no more than 118 million.|$|E
2500|$|In January, Blair took up {{the place}} at Wellington, where he spent the Spring term. In May 1917 a place became {{available}} as a King's Scholar at Eton. He remained at Eton until December 1921, when he left midway between his 18th and 19th birthday. Wellington was [...] "beastly", Orwell told his childhood friend Jacintha Buddicom, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "interested and happy" [...] at Eton. His principal tutor was A. S. F. Gow, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who also gave him advice later in his career. Blair was briefly taught French by Aldous Huxley. Steven Runciman, who was at Eton with Blair, noted {{that he and his}} contemporaries appreciated Huxley's linguistic flair. Cyril Connolly followed Blair to Eton, but because they were in separate years, they did not associate with each other.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Vishnuvardhan {{mentioned}} that he had [...] "twice missed out on the chance to direct him [...] The third time when I {{got a chance to}} direct him, I made sure that I would not miss it. I was all ready to write a good script for him <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> wanted me to remake Billa", confirming it was Ajith Kumar's idea. The film was originally announced, provisionally after the release of the Bollywood film, [...] – which was a remake of the yesteryear film with the same name from 1978. Also from the 1978 version of Don, a remake was made in 1980 into Tamil, called Billa. 2007's Billa drew inspirations from these three versions. Suresh Balaji, who had acted in the yesteryear version of Billa, acquired the rights to produce the film. The film became the second Tamil film to be remade from its yesteryear version after Naan Avanillai.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 October 2013, it was {{announced}} that Danny Dyer had been cast in the role of Mick Carter, the younger brother of Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), who joined EastEnders in 2006, and Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White), whose casting {{was announced}} 12 days earlier. Dyer was asked to be in EastEnders, and said that production staff [...] "told me how brilliant I was" [...] and [...] "I felt really honoured", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> [...] "thought long and hard" [...] about accepting the role, doing so because it was [...] "at the right time in my career." [...] He also said he accepted the role because it was not [...] "too obvious" [...] and would be a double act with Mick's wife Linda Carter, saying, [...] "it was a big deciding factor when they [...] that my screen wife Linda was going to be played by Kellie Bright." [...] It was reported that Dyer signed a one-year contract to appear on the show. He began filming later in October, along with Bright. The character was to be the new landlord of the [...] "iconic" [...] Queen Victoria public house (also known as The Vic), appearing from Christmas Day, 25 December 2013.
