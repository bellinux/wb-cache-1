40|$|The {{electrolytic}} codeposition of SiC with nickel from {{a nickel}} Watts bath was investigated by codeposition experiments of SiC particles on a rotating disk electrode and by thin-film rupture experiments. From the rotating disk experiments {{it was found}} that the codeposition of SiC depends strongly on the presence of a surface oxide. A few monolayers of oxide impede the codeposition. Removing the surface oxide by HF or NaOH greatly increases the codeposition of SiC particles with nickel. The influence of surface oxidation on the codeposition of <b>SiC</b> particles with <b>Ni</b> <b>was</b> correlated with thin-film rupture results. Thin liquid films of nickel Watts solutions on SiC were investigated by microinterferometry. The effect of surface pretreatment on the stability and rupture of the thin films was studied. It was found that the stability of thin films on SiC is strongly influenced by the solvation force. A strong correlation was established between the stability of the thin films and the codeposition results. Our results demonstrate that thin-film rupture experiments can be used to analyze and even predict the codeposition behavior of a material.

40|$|In this work, MgH 2 –SiC–Ni was {{prepared}} by magneto-mechanical milling in hydrogen atmosphere. Scanning electron microscope mapping images showed a homogeneous dispersion of both <b>Ni</b> and <b>SiC</b> among MgH 2 particles.

40|$|The temperature-induced {{shift of}} the Raman G line in {{epitaxial}} graphene on <b>SiC</b> and <b>Ni</b> surfaces, {{as well as in}} graphene supported on SiO 2, is investigated with Raman spectroscopy. The thermal shift rate of epitaxial graphene on 6 H-SiC(0001) is found to be about three times that of freestanding graphene. This result is explained quantitatively as a consequence of pinning by the substrate. In contrast, graphene grown on polycrystalline <b>Ni</b> films <b>is</b> shown to be unpinned, i. e., to behave elastically as freestanding, despite the relatively strong interaction with the metal substrate. Moreover, it is shown that the transfer of exfoliated graphene layers onto a supporting substrate can result in pinned or unpinned layers, depending on the transfer protocol.

Immunoreactivity of the neuroplasticity marker GAP- 43, and the neurotrophic-chemoattractant factors Artemin and nerve growth factor (NGF), was quantified in colon cancer and pancreatic cancer nerves.
