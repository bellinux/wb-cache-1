50|$|A {{pseudoscope}} is a <b>binocular</b> <b>optical</b> <b>instrument</b> that reverses depth perception. It is used {{to study}} human stereoscopic perception. Objects viewed through it appear inside out, for example: a box on a floor would appear as a box shaped hole in the floor.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} system for {{increasing}} <b>optical</b> <b>instrument</b> calibration and prediction accuracy {{within and across}} different <b>optical</b> <b>instrument</b> platforms can comprise two main submethods or routines. The first routine can include one for correcting differences among <b>optical</b> <b>instruments</b> of different model types regardless of the manufacturer and correcting differences among <b>optical</b> <b>instruments</b> of the same model type. The second main routine or sub-method can include one for analyzing new samples of a product over time and maintaining prediction accuracy as compared to a reference method over time. The first routine can include a "TRANS" procedure, a "MIN" procedure, and checkcell tests. The second main routine provides techniques on how a product database can be cleaned, condensed, and expanded automatically as it is used {{by one or more}} different <b>optical</b> <b>instruments...</b>|$|R
