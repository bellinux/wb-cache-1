2500|$|The Chennai Port Trust {{plans to}} develop a barge {{handling}} facility inside the port {{at a cost of}} [...] 260 million in Bharathi Dock through public-private partnership to meet the increase in demand for <b>bunkering</b> – <b>fuel</b> oil used aboard ships.

2500|$|An {{oil spill}} is {{the release of}} a liquid {{petroleum}} hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. [...] The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. [...] Oil spills may be due to releases of crude oil from tankers, offshore platforms, drilling rigs and wells, as well as spills of refined petroleum products (such as gasoline, diesel) and their by-products, heavier fuels used by large ships such as <b>bunker</b> <b>fuel,</b> or the spill of any oily refuse or waste oil.|$|E

40|$|Ranch-reared mink (Mustela vison) {{were used}} as a model in an {{experimental}} trial to investigate the potential effects of exposure to two petroleum products on sea otters (Enhydra lutris). Mink were exposed either dermally on one occasion 60 days prior to breeding or via low level contamination of their diets daily from 60 days prior to breeding (January 1994) until weaning of kits (June 1994). For dermal exposure, we placed mink in either a slick of Alaskan North Slope crude oil (n = 24) or <b>bunker</b> C <b>fuel</b> oil (n = 24) on sea water or sea water alone (n = 10) for 1 min. For dietary exposure, we fed mink rations containing 500 ppm of either Alaskan North Slope crude oil (n = 24) or <b>bunker</b> C <b>fuel</b> oil (n = 24; control, n = 15). The number of liveborn kits {{did not differ significantly}} among mink exposed dermally (5. 0 kits/female for crude oil and 6. 5 kits/female for <b>bunker</b> C <b>fuel</b> oil) and unexposed controls (5. 3 kits/female). However, only 2. 3 and 0. 7 kits were produced per female for those exposed through the diet to crude oil and <b>bunker</b> C <b>fuel</b> oil, respectively. Females with reduced reproductive success had no clinical signs of toxicosis or behavioral abnormalities. In addition, kits of females exposed through the diet had poor survival to weaning. Once mature, kits born to females exposed to <b>bunker</b> C <b>fuel</b> oil in the diet had significantly reduced reproductive success (3. 4 kits/female) although their only exposure to the petroleum products was in utero or during nursing. Therefore, it is possible that sea otter populations consuming contaminated food sources or colonizing previously oiled habitats will have reduced reproductive success.
