In {{the case of}} a strong wind leading to a net erosion of the sand <b>bed,</b> <b>ripples</b> obey the Benney equation.

In the most frequent case where erosion is counterbalanced by deposition, we derive a new one-parameter nonlinear equation.

40|$|Results from {{a series}} of field experiments, {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of infragravity waves (from wave groups), ripple type and location relative to the breaker line on cross-shore suspended sediment flux close to the sea bed in nearshore environments, are presented. The field data were collected from Cable Beach (Broome) and Mullaloo Beach in Western Australia and Chilaw in Sri Lanka. These beaches experience different incident wave, tidal and morphological conditions, with Cable Beach having a 10 -m spring tidal range, whilst the other two beaches have tidal ranges < 1. 0 m. Measurements included simultaneous records of surface elevation, two-dimensional horizontal current velocities and suspended sediment concentrations, together with half-hourly observations of the seabed topography. Although most of the data sets were obtained just outside of the surf zone, a few results from inside of the surf zone were also included. A significant correlation between wave groups and suspended sediment concentration was found at all of the measurement sites, either with or without <b>bed</b> <b>ripples.</b> The direction and magnitude of cross-shore suspended sediment flux varied with location with respect to the breaker line; however, other parameters, such as <b>bed</b> <b>ripples</b> and velocity skewness, could have influenced this result. In Broome, where the measurement location with respect to the breaker line varied with the tidal cycle, the cross-shore sediment flux due to swell waves was shoreward inside and just outside of the surf zone and seaward farther offshore of the breaker line. Further, sediment flux due to swell waves was onshore when the seabed was flat and offshore over post-vortex ripples. Sediment flux due to swell waves was onshore when the normalised velocity skewness towards the shore was high (positive); the flux was offshore when the skewness was lower, but positive, suggesting the influence of other parameters, such as ripples and grain size. The net cross-shore sediment flux was onshore when the Dean number was less than 1. 67 and offshore when the Dean number was greater than 1. 67. Nevertheless, the Dean number did not account for the influence of ripples or velocity skewness. The cross-shore sediment flux at the infragravity frequency was mainly offshore outside of the surf zone, whereas it varied between onshore and offshore inside of the surf zone...|$|E
40|$|Field {{observations}} often show {{a considerable}} variation in mean grain size along the coastal profile. Under high waves in shallow water, <b>bed</b> <b>ripples</b> are washed out, and sheet flow becomes the dominant transport mode: {{large amounts of}} sand are transported in a thin layer close to the bed, i. e., the sheet flow layer. This paper focuses on grain size influences on transport processes in oscillatory sheet flow. Experiments were {{carried out in the}} Large Oscillating Water Tunnel (LOWT) of Delft Hydraulics, in which near-bed orbital velocities in combination with a net current can be simulated at full scale. Three uniform sands with different mean grain size were used. It was found that in contradiction to expressions found in literature, both the erosion depth and the sheet flow layer thickness are larger for fine sand (D 50 = 0. 13 mm) than for coarser sand (D 50 ≥ 0. 21 mm). Measured time-averaged velocity and concentration profiles indicate that the presence of a sheet flow layer leads to an increased flow resistance and to damping of turbulence and that these effects are stronger for a thicker sheet flow layer (i. e., for fine sand). These mobile-bed effects are analyzed further by comparing the measurements with the results of a one-dimensional vertical advection-diffusion boundary layer model. Simulating the mobile-bed effects in the model by introducing an increased roughness height and a reduced turbulent eddy viscosity showed that the roughness height is of the order of the sheet flow layer thickness and that turbulence damping increases for a decreasing grain size...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{surface profile}} of water waves {{propagating}} in shoaling water approaches the solitary waveform before wave breaking. The {{effect of the}} high non-linearity of solitary waves may be very significant on bed forms induced in the nearshore zone. In this study, experiments on bed form generation beneath solitary waves are carried out in a 10 -m-long flume used in resonant mode. Solitary waves are generated in shallow water on the background of a standing harmonic wave. One solitary wave (soliton) propagates in each direction of the flume on the time period of the flow, above an initially flat sandy <b>bed.</b> <b>Ripples</b> form rapidly {{on the bed and}} a strong interaction with the free surface occurs. The amplitude of the soliton and the phase shift between the soliton and the harmonic wave decrease with time, while the ripple amplitude increases. The amplitude of the harmonic wave is not affected by the ripples. The final ripple wavelength is about 1000 times the sand median diameter. Bars with superimposed ripples appear, with bar crests being positioned beneath the nodes of the standing wave, when bars form with crests beneath the antinodes of surface wave for standing waves without solitons. The Eulerian drift distribution in the flume is not affected by the propagation of solitons. We propose an energy balance for solitons propagating in shallow water above flat beds in which a term for the dissipation due to sand ripples is introduced, which defines a coefficient of interaction between solitons and ripples...|$|E
40|$|Sheet flow {{corresponds}} to the high velocity regime when small <b>bed</b> <b>ripples</b> are washed out and sand is transported in a thin layer close to the bed. Therefore, it is often assumed that sand transport in oscillatory sheet flow behaves quasi-steady: time-dependent transport rates {{are assumed to be}} instantaneously related to the near-bed orbital velocity. However, new experimental results show that even in sheet flow, phase lags between sediment concentration and near-bed velocity can become so large that they lead to a reduction of the net (wave-averaged) transport rate. A phase lag parameter is defined, which shows that phase lags become important for fine sand, high velocities and short wave periods. A semi-unsteady model is developed that includes the effects of phase lags on the net transport rate. New experiments were carried out in a large oscillating water tunnel with three different sands (D 50 = 0. 13, 0. 21 and 0. 32 mm) for a range of prototype, combined wave–current flow conditions. Measured net transport rates were compared with predictions of a quasi-steady model and the new semi-unsteady model. This comparison indicates that net transport rates are reduced if phase lags become important: the quasi-steady model overestimates the net transport rates and the semi-unsteady model gives better agreement with the data. Time-dependent measurements of velocities and concentrations show that the reduced net transport rates can indeed be explained by phase lag effects, because for tests with smaller net transport rates than predicted by the quasi-steady model, considerable phase lags between velocities and concentrations were observed, even inside the sheet flow layer. Verification of the semi-unsteady model against a larger data set confirms the occurrence of phase lag effects in oscillatory sheet flow. Also for the larger data set the semi-unsteady model yields better agreement with the data than the quasi-steady model. ...|$|E

Ripples increase the exchange of materials between the sediment and the water column, enhance sediment transport rates, and act to increase the dissipation of waves by increasing the hydraulic roughness of the seafloor. Previous research has, however, failed {{to take into account}} the substantial spatial and temporal variation <b>rippled</b> <b>beds</b> display when formed under real sea conditions. Based on a set of laboratory experiments a spectral method to predict and model <b>rippled</b> <b>beds</b> has been developed. Through the use of the rippled surface's spectral density function the spatial and temporal variability of the rippled surface can be taken into account with greater efficiency. A prediction method for the equilibrium ripple spectrum was developed based on a nondimensional spectral form, which utilised the peak orbital excursion diameter and the 50 th percentile grain size diameter of the sediment bed. The method provided an effective technique to predict ripple parameters with the same degree of accuracy achievable at small scale as more accepted ripple prediction methods. A new method was derived to model the changes a <b>rippled</b> <b>bed</b> undergoes as it actively evolves between two given equilibrium states due to a change in surface wave conditions. The evolution of a <b>rippled</b> <b>bed</b> can be described mathematically in exactly the same way as a <b>rippled</b> <b>bed</b> growing from a flat bed condition. The method allows any bed to be modelled through time if the flow conditions and sediment properties are known. There is little advantage in using the spectral method to predict <b>rippled</b> <b>beds</b> when they are in equilibrium with the flow conditions. The main benefit of the spectral method comes when attempting to model <b>rippled</b> <b>beds</b> evolving under changed flow conditions. In the same way as the parameterisation of surface waves in terms of their spectral density function has increased the ability to model wind generated wave fields, studies of <b>rippled</b> <b>beds</b> would benefit from the increased detail and ease the spectral method brings.

Acoustic measurements were made of water velocities, bed forms, and suspended sediment concentration over plane and <b>rippled</b> <b>beds.</b> During each <b>rippled</b> <b>bed</b> experiment, measurements were taken over the crests of steep sided ripples, above which flow separation was considered likely to occur.

The irregular waves were parameterized with a significant wave height H-s and a significant orbital diameter d(0 s). Thus, during irregular wave conditions and over steep ripples where d(0 s) /lambda > 1. 2, vortex shedding was deemed as the dominant sediment entrainment process. Furthermore, the percentage of wave half cycles where vortex shedding was observed, was found to scale as 26 d(0 s) /lambda.

The observations were made over two sandy <b>rippled</b> <b>beds,</b> classified as ‘medium’ and ‘fine’ {{in terms of}} sand grain size, under slightly asymmetric regular waves. For the medium sand, the ripples that formed had relatively steep slopes, while for the fine sand, the slopes were roughly half that of the medium sand. In the medium sand case, {{the form of the}} sediment diffusivity profiles was found to be constant with height above the bed, to a height equal approximately to the equivalent roughness of the bed, ks, while above this the sediment diffusivity increased linearly with height.

To understand the difference between the respective diffusivity profiles, advantage has been taken of the high temporal-spatial resolution available with acoustic systems. Using intra-wave ensemble averaging, detailed images have been built up of the variation in concentration with both the phase of the wave and also height above the bed.

This process is represented by means of a strongly time-varying eddy viscosity, with peaks occurring just ahead of flow reversal. Above this near-bed layer, the flow is represented by a conventional One-equation turbulence-closure scheme. The model results are compared with data obtained in a large-scale flume. Here suspended sand concentration profiles, and the bed form dimensions, were measured with considerable accuracy using acoustic techniques. The model results are compared with the measured mean concentration profiles, and a multiple grain size approach is used to predict the observed height-variation in the suspended sediment grain size. In addition, a comparison is presented with field data for suspended sand concentrations, obtained in wave-current flow, which demonstrates the improved agreement achieved by the new <b>rippled</b> <b>bed</b> model in comparison with a standard flat-bed modelling approach...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} version of the mild-slope equation is derived and its predictions of wave scattering by two-dimensional topography compared with those of other equations and with experimental data. In particular, the modified mild-slope equation is shown to be capable of describing known scattering properties of singly and doubly periodic <b>ripple</b> <b>beds,</b> for which the mild-slope equation fails. The new equation compares favourably with other models of scattering which improve on the mild-slope equation, in that it is widely applicable and computationally cheap. 1...|$|R
