5|$|Southeast of Theta and {{southwest}} of Eta lies the open cluster ESO 281-SC24, which {{is composed of}} the yellow 9th magnitude star GSC 7914 178 1 and five 10th to 11th magnitude stars. Halfway between Theta Coronae Australis and Theta Scorpii is the dense globular cluster NGC 6541. Described as between magnitude 6.3 and magnitude 6.6, it is visible in <b>binoculars</b> <b>and</b> small telescopes. Around 22000 light years away, it is around 100 light years in diameter. It {{is estimated to be}} around 14 billion years old. NGC 6541 appears 13.1 arcminutes in diameter and is somewhat resolvable in large amateur instruments; a 12-inch telescope reveals approximately 100 stars but the core remains unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Within the Perseus Arm lie two open {{clusters}} (NGC 869 and NGC 884) {{known as}} the Double Cluster. Sometimes known as h and Chi (χ) Persei respectively, they are easily visible through <b>binoculars</b> <b>and</b> small telescopes. Both lie more than 7,000 light-years from Earth and are several hundred light-years apart. The Double Cluster was first recorded {{during the reign of}} the Chinese king Tsung-K'ang, who reigned during the Xia dynasty (2858–2146 BCE). Both clusters are of approximately magnitude 4 and 0.5 degrees in diameter. The two are Trumpler class I 3 r clusters, though NGC 869 is a Shapley class f and NGC 884 is a Shapley class e cluster. These classifications indicate that they are both quite rich (dense); NGC 869 is the richer of the pair. The clusters are both distinct from the surrounding star field and are clearly concentrated at their centers. The constituent stars, numbering over 100 in each cluster, range widely in brightness.|$|E

25|$|To {{the south}} of Epsilon Cygni is the Veil Nebula (NGC 6960, 6962, 6979, 6992, and 6995), a 5,000-year-old {{supernova}} remnant covering approximately 3 degrees of the sky - it is over 50 light-years long. Because of its appearance, it is also called the Cygnus Loop. The Loop is only visible in long-exposure astrophotographs. However, the brightest portion, NGC 6992, is faintly visible in <b>binoculars,</b> <b>and</b> a dimmer portion, NGC 6960, is visible in wide-angle telescopes.|$|E
25|$|After reading Rupert Gould's The Loch Ness Monster and Others, Edward Mountain financed a search. Twenty {{men with}} <b>binoculars</b> <b>and</b> cameras {{positioned}} themselves around the loch from 9am to 6pm for five weeks, beginning on 13 July 1934. Although 21 photographs were taken, none was considered conclusive. Supervisor James Fraser remained by the loch filming on 15 September 1934; {{the film is}} now lost. Zoologists and professors of natural history concluded that the film showed a seal, possibly a grey seal.|$|E

The local fishing trawler Pacific Gull, skippered alone by Albert Barnett, made the first discovery near Coledale, being the body of Captain Bell, still wearing his <b>binoculars</b> <b>and</b> cap. His wristwatch had stopped at 10:15. Barnett spotted more bodies closer to shore, but the conditions made it too dangerous to attempt to retrieve them. Further searching was carried out the next day, including by a Tiger Moth aircraft of South Coast Aviation Services, but {{the bodies of the}} remaining ten men were never found.|$|E

25|$|Hydra has {{one bright}} binary star, Epsilon Hydrae, which is {{difficult}} to split in amateur telescopes; it has a period of 1000 years and is 135 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 3.4 and the secondary is a blue star of magnitude 6.7. However, there are several dimmer double stars and binary stars in Hydra. 27 Hydrae is a triple star with two components visible in <b>binoculars</b> <b>and</b> three visible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.8, 244 light-years from Earth. The secondary, a binary star, appears in binoculars at magnitude 7.0 but is composed of a magnitude 7 and a magnitude 11 star; it is 202 light-years from Earth. 54 Hydrae is a binary star 99 light-years from Earth, easily divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is a purple star of magnitude 7.4. N Hydrae (N Hya) {{is a pair of}} stars of magnitudes 5.8 and 5.9. Struve 1270 (Σ1270) consists of a pair of stars, magnitudes 6.4 and 7.4.|$|E
25|$|The city {{is home to}} some internationally {{active and}} well known enterprises. The Buderus company {{was created in the}} year 1731 {{and is one of the}} oldest still {{existing}} (large) enterprises. As BBT Thermotechnik, now part of the Bosch group, Buderus was for many decades one of the largest employers in the central Hessian area with more than 10,000 persons employed in Wetzlar alone (worldwide over 16,000), working in the areas casting (with cement), high-grade steel and heating technologies. Economic changes, repeated shifts of the stock majority as well as close-downs and sales of various divisions have strongly changed the company in the meantime. However, it ranks among the largest enterprises in Hesse. Wetzlar is apart from Jena and Oberkochen a German centre for optics as well as the most important German location for the precision engineering industry. The manufactured products have gained worldwide reputation. One of the most important companies in the area of microscopy is Leica Microsystems (formerly known as Ernst Leitz), which in its peak times employed over 7000 people in the city. Small format (35mm) photography was invented in Wetzlar, and Leica cameras are well known for their excellent quality. In addition there are cameras of the companies Leidolf and Minox, <b>binoculars</b> <b>and</b> telescopes made by the company Hensoldt AG (now Carl Zeiss), part of the Zeiss group (over 2,000 people employed in peak times). Other well-known firms are Philips (with about 1,200 employed at times) or Siemens AG and Siemens VDO, since 2007 Continental AG or the Sancura BKK, a supraregional health insurance company, which is fusioned with the Taunus BKK. The Business park Spilburg, former barracks, became home to a number of innovative enterprises, particularly in the area of optics/precision mechanics, information technology and services. Additionally, areas in the Westend as well as the Hörnsheimer Eck and the Dillfeld are available for new businesses to set up.|$|E

Sagmeister proceeded to create not only an image for the cover, but an entire three-dimensional model for the house, which was later released as the deluxe edition packaging. Upon repeated listenings to the album, he became convinced that there was a sinister element to the setting and provided clues to the [...] "darkedge" [...] of the scene, such as a discarded condom wrapper in the gutter, a man looking out the window with <b>binoculars,</b> <b>and</b> a gasoline canteen in the kitchen.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1907, Irwin became a scout for the New York Highlanders. In 1909, New York manager George Stallings rented an {{apartment}} overlooking Hilltop Park and sent Irwin up to steal signs from the opposing team. Using a system of <b>binoculars</b> <b>and</b> mirrors, Irwin read the signs and flashed them back to Stallings {{so they could be}} relayed to the batter. By 1912, almost the entire Highlanders roster had been scouted by Irwin. In a newspaper interview covering his scouting career, Irwin asserted that he preferred signing young prospects over expensive stars. [...] "The chances are better with a young player, for by getting him early you can gradually break him into the style of play the team is using", he said.|$|E
500|$|Retired Test umpires Col Hoy and Les Townsend were {{watching}} {{at the ground}} when Meckiff was called.

He described Meckiff's action as [...] "slightly different" [...] but attributed this to an accentuated wrist action used in an attempt to get more life out of dead pitches, rather than his elbow. Townsend watched the paceman through <b>binoculars</b> <b>and</b> deemed all of his 12 deliveries to be identical. Townsend regarded Meckiff's arm action as [...] "peculiar" [...] but felt he did not throw. Former Test spinners Ian Johnson and Doug Ring said Meckiff's action was fair.|$|E
