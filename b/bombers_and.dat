5|$|The Royal Navy {{launched}} the Operation Goodwood series in late August. Goodwood I {{took place on}} 22 August, with 38 <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> 43 fighters from five carriers. The attackers failed to score any hits. Goodwood III followed two days later, with 48 <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> 29 fighters from , Furious, and Indefatigable. The bombers made two hits on the ship, which did only minor damage. The last Royal Navy operation, Goodwood IV, followed on 29 August. Thirty-four <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> 25 fighters, launched from Formidable and Indefatigable, attacked the ship, though fog prevented them from scoring any hits.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1936, {{the ship}} was used to {{evaluate}} a dozen Aichi D1A dive <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> dive-bombing tactics. She also embarked at that time 24 A4N1 fighters, plus four and eight spare aircraft respectively. In September, Ryūjō resumed her role as flagship of First Carrier Division, now commanded by Rear Admiral Saburō Satō. Her air group now consisted of a mixture of B3Y1 torpedo bombers, D1A1 dive <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> A2N fighters, but her torpedo bombers were transferred after fleet maneuvers in October demonstrated effective dive bombing tactics. Captain Katsuo Abe assumed command of the ship on 16 November.|$|E

5|$|After {{the devastating}} bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe, the Germans {{threatened}} to bomb other Dutch cities if the Dutch forces refused to surrender. The General Staff {{knew it could}} not stop the <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> ordered the Dutch army to cease hostilities. The last occupied parts of the Netherlands were liberated in 1945.|$|E

25|$|The de Havilland factory at Leavesden was {{responsible}} for the manufacture of the Mosquito fighter <b>bomber</b> <b>and</b> the Halifax <b>bomber</b> <b>and</b> later became Leavesden Aerodrome, to the north of Watford. No longer operational, it was converted into Leavesden Film Studios, now famously the home of the Harry Potter films.|$|R

5|$|At 13:00, Kondo's Advanced {{force and}} Abe's Vanguard force {{warships}} together headed directly towards the last reported {{position of the}} U.S. carrier task forces and increased speed to try to intercept them for a warship gunfire battle. The damaged carriers Zuihō and Shōkaku, with Nagumo still on board, retreated from the battle area, leaving Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta {{in charge of the}} Zuikaku and Junyō aircraft forces. At 13:06, Junyō launched her second strike of seven torpedo planes and eight Zeros, and Zuikaku launched her third strike of seven torpedo planes, two dive <b>bombers,</b> <b>and</b> five Zeros. At 15:35, Junyō launched the last Japanese strike force of the day, consisting of four <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> six Zeros.|$|E
5|$|Attacking and {{destroying}} the radar chain was also difficult. The stations were indeed vulnerable to dive <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> low flying aircraft, however the British had mobile units {{which could be}} moved around to cover any gaps. Rapid repair services were also quick. Rarely were radar stations out of action {{for more than a}} few days.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen Ju 87D dive <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> a few Ju 87R-2 {{extended}} range dive bombers {{are known to}} have been supplied to the HZL, and six of these were flown operationally against Soviet troops in the late summer of 1944.|$|E

5|$|Glorious {{could carry}} up to 48 aircraft; when first recommissioned, she carried Fairey Flycatcher fighters, Blackburn Dart and Blackburn Ripon torpedo <b>bombers,</b> <b>and</b> Fairey IIIF {{reconnaissance}} planes of the Fleet Air Arm. From 1933 until Glorious {{returned to the}} United Kingdom in April 1940, aside from a period when refitting in the mid-1930s, she carried 802 Squadron which flew a mixture of nine Hawker Nimrod and three Hawker Osprey fighters, until re-equipping with a dozen Gloster Sea Gladiators in May 1939. 812 and 823 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-ship attack missions. They flew the Blackburn Ripon, the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> as well as Fairey IIIF and Fairey Seal reconnaissance aircraft. When Glorious recommissioned after her refit in 1935, 825 Squadron was embarked, initially with Fairey IIIFs, but the squadron converted to Fairey Swordfish in May 1936.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with Japanese carrier doctrine at the time, Admiral Nagumo had kept {{half of his}} aircraft in reserve. These comprised two squadrons each of dive <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> torpedo bombers. The dive bombers were as yet unarmed. The torpedo bombers were armed with torpedoes should any American warships be located.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, RAF Mosquitos were {{conducting}} large tactical {{air raids}} against German positions inside Berlin on the nights of 15 April (105 bombers), 17 April (61 bombers), 18 April (57 bombers), 19 April (79 <b>bombers),</b> <b>and</b> 20 April (78 bombers).|$|E

5|$|On 26 September {{the carrier}} went to Sasebo for reprovisioning.

5|$|The Aéronautique Militaire Belge (Belgian Air Force - AéMI) {{had barely}} begun to modernise their {{aircraft}} technology. The AéMI had ordered Brewster Buffalo, Fiat CR.42, and Hawker Hurricane fighters, Koolhoven F.K.56 trainers, Fairey Battle and Caproni Ca.312 light <b>bombers,</b> <b>and</b> Caproni Ca.335 fighter-reconnaissance aircraft, {{but only the}} Fiats, Hurricanes, and Battles had been delivered. The shortage of modern types meant single-seat versions of the Fairey Fox light bomber were being used as fighters. The AéMI possessed 250 combat aircraft. At least 90 were fighters, 12 were <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> 12 were reconnaissance aircraft. Only 50 were of reasonably modern standard. When liaison and transport aircraft from all services are included, the total strength was 377; however only 118 of these were serviceable on 10 May 1940. Of this number around 78 were fighters and 40 were bombers.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{operated}} out of {{bases in}} Austria, Romania and Bulgaria during {{the invasion of}} Yugoslavia. In total, the Germans had over 809 aircraft available to support the invasion of Yugoslavia, {{more than half of}} which were positioned in Bulgaria to support the simultaneous invasion of Greece. In total, the Germans fielded 296 fighter aircraft, 89 light bombers, 26 medium <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> 23 reconnaissance aircraft, and more than 318 dive <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> 57 heavy fighters. In addition, a reconnaissance squadron equipped with Henschel Hs 126 two-seater reconnaissance aircraft was attached to most of the corps headquarters and every panzer division of the German ground forces. Luftwaffe anti-aircraft units were also attached to the German land forces.|$|E
5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were within range of escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories further north in daylight. Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of <b>bombers</b> <b>and</b> fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E
