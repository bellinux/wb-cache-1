5000|$|<b>Stand</b> <b>oil</b> is {{generated}} by heating linseed oil near 300 °C {{for a few days}} in the complete absence of air. Under these conditions, the polyunsaturated fatty esters convert to conjugated dienes, which then undergo Diels-Alder reactions, leading to crosslinking. The product, which is highly viscous, gives highly uniform coatings that [...] "dry" [...] to more elastic coatings than linseed oil itself. Soybean oil can be treated similarly, but converts more slowly. On the other hand, tung oil converts very quickly, being complete in minutes at 260 °C. Coatings prepared from <b>stand</b> <b>oils</b> are less prone to yellowing than are coatings derived from the parent oils.|$|R

50|$|Linseed oil is {{a common}} carrier used in oil paint. It {{can also be used}} as a {{painting}} medium, making oil paints more fluid, transparent and glossy. It is available in varieties such as cold pressed, alkali refined, sun bleached, sun thickened, and polymerised (<b>stand</b> <b>oil).</b> The introduction of linseed oil was a significant advance in the technology of oil painting.|$|R
60|$|Mr. John <b>Blows</b> <b>stood</b> {{listening}} to the foreman {{with an air of}} lofty disdain. He was a free-born Englishman, and yet he had been summarily paid off at eleven o'clock in the morning and told that his valuable services would no longer be required. More than that, the foreman had passed certain strictures upon his features which, however true they might be, were quite irrelevant to the fact that Mr. Blows had been discovered slumbering in a shed when he should have been laying bricks.|$|R
5000|$|Bryden’s {{method for}} these pieces was {{inspired}} by the “crust of paint” on impressionist Claude Monet’s work “Water Lilies.” Bryden developed his own textured sculptural-style technique to create the surface texture for his Boardwalk paintings. To “mimic the atmospheric conditions of a hot summer day,” Bryden mixes Neo Megilp with 50% <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> to coat his canvas. He then adds pigment and varnish, “as much as the canvas will take.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Boiled {{linseed oil}} is a {{combination}} of raw linseed <b>oil,</b> <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> (see above), and metallic dryers (catalysts to accelerate drying). In the Medieval era, linseed oil was boiled with lead oxide (litharge) to give a product called boiled linseed oil. The lead oxide forms lead [...] "soaps" [...] (lead oxide is alkaline) which promotes hardening (polymerisation) of linseed oil by reaction with atmospheric oxygen. Heating shortens its drying time.|$|R

5000|$|The nut, eaten raw, has {{a bitter}} taste {{comparable}} to that of kola nut and is considered tonic. [...] The fresh nuts are used as snake antivenin. [...] The nuts can also be roasted and eaten in the general diet, or added to cakes. The nuts are oil-bearing yielding 48-60% of a light golden coloured oil with a taste resembling linseed oil. The oil is edible, although it not suitable for frying or soap manufacture, due to its quick drying property. [...] The oil has thus been found useful in the formulation of wood vanish, <b>stand</b> <b>oil,</b> vulcanized oil for leather and rubber substitute.|$|R
50|$|Although tempera {{has been}} out of favor since the Late Renaissance and Baroque eras, it has been {{periodically}} rediscovered by later artists such as William Blake, the Nazarenes, the Pre-Raphaelites, and Joseph Southall. The 20th century saw a significant revival of tempera. European painters who worked with tempera include Giorgio de Chirico, Otto Dix, Eliot Hodgkin, Pyke Koch, and Pietro Annigoni, who used an emulsion of egg yolks, <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> and varnish.|$|R

30|$|The {{detection}} of Pinaceae resin in Ripolin paints is perhaps surprising, as critical reading of period technical literature seems {{to imply that}} oil-based enamels including resins in their formulations were considered of lower quality, and Ripolin cans, on the contrary, {{were among the first}} and highest quality enamel paints available in the French market [39]. Historically, the highest quality enamels consisted of only <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> as vehicle. It {{is important to note that}} in the sample set studied, the only non-Ripolin sample analysed, Bengaline bleu outremer (HP 019), was the one for which the highest levels of resin diterpenes were detected.|$|R

First, linseed oil was thermally polymerized in bulk at 300 °C under an inert atmosphere. Next, the obtained <b>stand</b> <b>oil</b> was functionalized in a two-step one-shot process without solvent {{in order to}} graft on some photopolymerizable groups. The first step consisted of a bulk reaction with maleic anhydride at 220 °C under an inert atmosphere. The grafted anhydride groups were then used in the second step as an anchor for grafting 2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate at room temperature. Finally, the materials were prepared by UV-curing of the modified linseed oil and then characterized. The obtained materials are flexible, hydrophobic and not biodegradable, and may have potential applications in flexible coatings...|$|R
