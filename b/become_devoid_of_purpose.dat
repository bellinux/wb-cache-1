The statements are derived from the analysis of scientific literature, relevant legislation, practice of the European Union Court of Justice (CJEU) and the European Union General Court (EUGC). Useful information has also been obtained from the opinions of general advocates of the CJEU. The article of TFEU 265, which governs the action for failure to act, is very abstract. For this reason, a whole procedure under the article 265 TFEU {{was developed by the}} EU courts. The original <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> the action for failure to act was to constitute whether European Union (EU) institution properly fulfilled its obligations under the EU legislation. However, in the course of case-law, a mere EU institution’s express refusal to fulfill its duties became sufficient to constitute that the EU institution acted and therefore action for failure to act <b>became</b> <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose.</b> This article analyzes whether the action for failure to act has lost its purpose and become an ineffective legal remedy in the system of judicial review in the EU. Additionally, the action for failure to act is compared to similar national actions...|$|R

Early the next day, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Cyclone 02A while the system was located about 740 km (460 mi) south of Masirah Island. The IMD only briefly monitored the system as a weak depression, designating it as ARB 01. Upon being classified a tropical cyclone, 02A reached its peak intensity. The speed of its winds was 65 km/h (40 mph). Soon, it began to dissipate due to increasing vertical wind shear.

Maximum intensity was reached at 1500 UTC 5 December as a Category 5 system. As the cyclone tracked away from Cocos Island, it encountered less favorable conditions. By 0000 UTC 8 December, the low-level circulation became fully exposed on the northwest side of the deep convection.

5000|$|Isserson {{concentrated}} on depth {{and the role}} it played in operations and strategy. According to his view strategy had moved on from Napoleonic times and the strategy of a single point (the decisive battle) and the Moltke era of linear strategy. The continuous front that developed in the First World War would not allow the flanking moves of the pre-1914 period. Isserson argued that the front had <b>become</b> <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> open flanks and military art faced a challenge to develop new methods to break through a deeply echeloned defence.

5|$|After peak intensity, Nadine began {{weakening}} {{once again}} and deteriorated to a tropical storm at 1200UTC, on October1. Northwesterly winds began to increase on October3, after an upper-level trough that was causing low wind shear moved eastward. A few hours later, the low-level center became partially exposed, before becoming fully separated from the convection by 1500UTC. Due to strong wind shear and cold sea surface temperatures, showers and thunderstorms rapidly diminished, and by late on October3, Nadine <b>became</b> <b>devoid</b> <b>of</b> any deep convection. At 0000UTC on October4, Nadine transitioned into an extratropical low-pressure area, while located about 195miles (315km) southwest of the central Azores.
