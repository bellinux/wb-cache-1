5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) and Bolander (Ned Beatty) {{respond to}} a corpse found in the woods, next to a van full of low-quality marijuana. Munch proves to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> on hemp, and {{discusses}} how the plant was grown by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle man for a drug dealer, and Bolander finds a neighbor who saw Jones holding a gun to the victim's head {{the night before the}} murder. Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes. Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot, but he refuses to answer. That night, Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home.|$|E

25|$|When {{decision}} making is emphasized, the objective of solving a multi-objective optimization problem is referred to supporting a decision maker in finding the most preferred Pareto optimal solution according to his/her subjective preferences.

The DM is expected to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> in the problem domain.|$|E
25|$|Physicians like al-Razi {{wrote about}} the {{importance}} of morality in medicine, and may have presented, together with Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis, the first concept of ethics in Islamic medicine. He felt that it was important not only for the physician to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> in his field, but also to be a role model. His ideas on medical ethics were divided into three concepts: the physician's responsibility to patients and to self, and also the patients’ responsibility to physicians.|$|E

25|$|The {{committee}} structure permits {{members of}} Congress {{to study a}} particular subject intensely. It is neither expected nor possible that a member <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> on all subject areas before Congress. As time goes by, members develop expertise in particular subjects and their legal aspects. Committees investigate specialized subjects and advise the entire Congress about choices and trade-offs. The choice of specialty {{may be influenced by}} the member's constituency, important regional issues, prior background and experience. Senators often choose a different specialty from that of the other senator from their state to prevent overlap. Some committees specialize in running the business of other committees and exert a powerful influence over all legislation; for example, the House Ways and Means Committee has considerable influence over House affairs.|$|E
25|$|The Government House Leader {{works on}} the government's behalf by {{negotiating}} with the House Leaders of the Opposition parties.

The holder of the position must <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> in parliamentary procedure in order to argue points of order before the Speaker of the House of Commons as well as be a good strategist and tactician in order to outmanoeuvre the opposition parties.|$|E

25|$|Modern-day {{authorities}} disagree as to {{how much}} of Gerard's Herball was original. Garret made a chance visit to the Norton publishing shop, where he discovered the proofs of the Herball, and alerted the Nortons as both to errors he discovered in the proofs and to the incorporation of some of L'Obel's material in Gerard's new book. This story is recounted by L'Obel in his Stirpium illustrationes (1655) in which he accuses Gerard of plagiarism. Although they were not concerned about plagiarism, the Nortons, fearing errors in a book that was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> reference guide, hired L'Obel, as an internationally recognized expert on plants (who had as Gerard’s friend, unwittingly contributed to his book) to proof the translations, fix the mismatched illustrations, and right its textual wrongs. When Gerard discovered L'Obel's thankless efforts, he had him dismissed. Although Gerard was an experienced collector and plantsman, unlike L'Obel he lacked scholarship, as is evident in his dedication to Burghley, where he paints a picture of himself as a gardener. Gerard dismissed L'Obel's criticisms as being due to his unfamiliarity with English idioms. Norton decided to proceed with publication despite these difficulties. He decided against using Dodoens' original illustrations since this would have revealed the actual source of the material, but instead rented woodblocks from Nicolaus Bassaeus in Frankfurt, about 1,800 in all, only 16 being original. However, Gerard was then faced with the difficulty of matching them to the text and frequently mislabelled them.|$|E

500|$|After Wyatt Earp {{first arrived}} in Tombstone, his {{business}} efforts yielded little profit, {{and he took a}} job as a stagecoach shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo, guarding shipments of silver bullion. On July 28, 1880 Wyatt was appointed Pima County Deputy Sheriff. He held this position for only three months until after the election of November 9, 1880, when he resigned. When Virgil was maimed by an assassination attempt, Wyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in his place. He held that position until he left Cochise County in April 1882. Wyatt Earp was an imposing, handsome man: blond, [...] tall, weighing about , broad-shouldered, long-armed, and muscular. He had been a boxer and was reputed to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> with a pistol. According to author Leo Silva, Earp showed no fear of any man.|$|E

500|$|Raymond Bernard's silent {{feature film}} The Chess Player (The Chess Player, France 1927) weaves {{elements}} {{from the real}} story of the Turk into an adventure tale set {{in the aftermath of the}} first of the Partitions of Poland in 1772. The film's [...] "Baron von Kempelen" [...] helps a dashing young Polish nationalist on the run from the occupying Russians, who also happens to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> chess player, by hiding him inside a chess playing automaton called the Turk, closely based on the real Kempelen model. Just as they are about to escape over the border, the Baron is summoned to Saint Petersburg to present the Turk to the empress Catherine II. In an echo of the Napoleon incident, Catherine attempts to cheat the Turk, who wipes all the pieces from the board in response.|$|E
500|$|During the 2010 Asia Cup, a Sri Lankan band {{performed}} [...] "O Podu" [...] at the India vs. Pakistan cricket match held in Dambulla. In July 2011, Vikram inaugurated [...] "Liver 4 Life", {{an initiative}} launched by MIOT Hospitals to create {{awareness of the}} Hepatitis B virus. As the campaign was targeted at school and college students, the organisers tweaked the term [...] "O Podu" [...] into [...] "B Podu" [...] and made it the event's tagline to capitalise on the song's immense appeal. In a comical sequence in the film, Dhamu's character claims to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> of a martial art form named [...] "Maan Karate" [...] (Maan means [...] "Deer"), which is actually the art of running away like a deer when in danger. The phrase became famous and was used to name the 2014 comedy film Maan Karate because whenever {{there is a problem}} in his life, the hero (played by Sivakarthikeyan) fails to face them and runs for cover instead.|$|E
500|$|Martin Smith, {{a millionaire}} with a finance background, was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} ENO board in 2001. He proved to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>expert</b> fund-raiser, and personally donated £1M {{to the cost of}} refurbishing the Coliseum. He and Payne came into conflict over the effect on revenue of the [...] "director's opera" [...] productions that Payne insisted on commissioning. The most extreme case was a production of Don Giovanni directed by Calixto Bieito in 2001, despised by critics and public alike; Michael Kennedy described it as [...] "a new nadir in vulgar abuse of a masterpiece," [...] and other reviewers agreed with him. Payne insisted, [...] "I think it's {{one of the best things}} we've done. ... It's exceeded my expectations." [...] In the arts pages of the Financial Times, Martin Hoyle wrote of Payne's [...] "exquisite tunnel vision" [...] and expressed [...] "the concern of those of us who value the true people's opera". Payne remained adamant that opera lovers who came to the ENO for a [...] "nice, pleasant evening ... had come to the wrong place." [...] The differences between Smith and Payne became irreconcilable, and Payne was forced to resign in July 2002.|$|E
