In addition, there are two separated reduction peaks after 10, 000 cycles instead of the initial overlapping one. These two observations are in agreement with a similar reported case for Ni(OH) 2 electrode [11] and can be explained based on <b>Bode’s</b> <b>diagram</b> of the electrochemical phase transformation of nickel hydroxide in alkaline solution [24]. One of the <b>Bode’s</b> <b>diagram</b> findings is that the redox potential of β-Ni(OH) 2 /β-NiOOH is {{higher than that of}} α-Ni(OH) 2 /γ-NiOOH. Analogous to <b>Bode’s</b> <b>diagram,</b> our Ni–Cu–OH electrode may have α-Ni(OH) 2 /γ-NiOOH and α-Cu(OH) 2 /γ-CuOOH-coupled phases in the initial cycles and then they may be transformed to β-Ni(OH) 2 /β-NiOOH and β-Cu(OH) 2 /β-CuOOH-coupled phases due to prolonged cycling in alkaline electrolyte (KOH). Similar CV behavior is also observed for Ni–Co–OH electrode as seen in Fig.  3 d. However, three separated reduction peaks are observed after 10, 000 cycles, which supports our prediction of the phase transformations from α-Ni(OH) 2 γ-NiOOH and α-Co(OH) 2 /γ-CoOOH in the initial cycles to β-Ni(OH) 2 /β-NiOOH and β-Co(OH) 2 /β-CoOOH in the final cycles.|$|R
