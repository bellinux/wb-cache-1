25|$|Adult tapirs {{are large}} enough to have few natural predators, and the thick skin {{on the backs of}} their necks helps to protect them from threats such as jaguars, crocodiles, anacondas, and tigers. The creatures are also able to run fairly quickly, {{considering}} their size and cumbersome appearance, finding shelter in the thick undergrowth of the forest or in water. Hunting for meat and hides has substantially reduced their numbers and, more recently, habitat loss has resulted in the conservation watch-listing of all four species; both the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapir</b> and the Malayan tapir are classified as vulnerable, and the Baird's tapir and the mountain tapir are endangered.|$|E
25|$|The Malayan tapir, {{the species}} most {{isolated}} geographically {{from the rest}} of the genus, has a significantly smaller number of chromosomes and has been found to share fewer homologies with the three types of American tapirs. A number of conserved autosomes (13 between karyotypes of Baird's tapir and the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapir,</b> and 15 between Baird's and the mountain tapir) have also been found in the American species that are not found in the Asian animal. However, geographic proximity is not an absolute predictor of genetic similarity; for instance, G-banded preparations have revealed Malayan, Baird's and Brazilian tapirs have identical X chromosomes, while mountain tapirs are separated by a heterochromatic addition/deletion.|$|E

2500|$|A tapir ( [...] , [...] , or [...] ) is a large, herbivorous mammal, {{similar in}} shape to a pig, with a short, prehensile nose trunk. Tapirs inhabit jungle and forest regions of South America, Central America, and Southeastern Asia. The five extant species of tapirs are the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapir,</b> the Malayan tapir, the Baird's tapir, the kabomani tapir, and the {{mountain}} tapir. The four species that have been evaluated (the Brazilian, Malayan, Baird's and mountain tapir) are all classified as endangered or vulnerable. Their closest relatives are the other odd-toed ungulates, which include horses, donkeys, zebras and rhinoceroses.|$|E
2500|$|The zoo {{was quite}} popular {{when it opened}} on May 17, 1863. [...] Though the {{population}} of Hamburg was only 300,000, around 54,000 people visited the zoo in its first week of operation. [...] Annual attendance at the zoo in its first ten years of operation was between 225,000 and 355,000 visitors. [...] The zoo's first director Alfred Edmund Brehm invested heavily in building up a large collection, even larger {{than that of the}} Berlin Zoo for much of its history. [...] The zoo had several remarkable breeding successes—it was the first to breed the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Tapir</b> in 1868, the Malayan Tapir in 1879, and the now-extinct Schomburgk's Deer in 1870. [...] The zoo's aquarium, or the Marine Aquarium Temple, was among the best ever built. [...] In 1865, a German national journal, Die Gartenlaube, declared an [...] "Ocean Fairy Castle" [...] superior to the aquarium of London. [...] The first Sumatran Rhinoceros ever seen in Europe was acquired by the Hamburg Zoological Garden in 1868.|$|E
2500|$|Tapirs are {{generally}} shy, but when scared they can defend themselves with their very powerful jaws. In 1998, a zookeeper in Oklahoma City was mauled {{and had an}} arm severed after {{opening the door to}} a female tapir's enclosure to push food inside. (The tapir's two-month-old baby also occupied the cage at the time.) In 2006, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez Echandi (who was then the Costa Rican Environmental Minister) became lost in the Corcovado National Park and was found by a search party with a [...] "nasty bite" [...] from a wild tapir. In 2013, a two-year-old girl suffered stomach and arm injuries after being mauled by a <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapir</b> in Dublin Zoo during a supervised experience in the tapir enclosure. Dublin Zoo pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety regulations and were ordered to pay €5,000 to charity. However, such examples are rare; for the most part, tapirs are likely to avoid confrontation in favour of running from predators, hiding, or, if possible, submerging themselves in nearby water until a threat is gone.|$|E

50|$|Lowland tapirs are {{excellent}} swimmers and divers, but also move quickly on land, even over rugged, mountainous terrain. They {{have a life}} span of approximately 25 to 30 years. In the wild, their main predators are crocodilians (only the black caiman and Orinoco crocodile, the latter of which is critically endangered, are large enough to take these tapirs, as the American crocodile only exists {{in the northern part}} of South America) and large cats, such as the jaguar and cougar, which often attack tapirs at night when they leave the water and sleep on the riverbank. <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapirs</b> are also attacked by green anacondas. They are known to run to water when scared to take cover.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to species involved in Species Survival Plans, the zoo {{is home to}} other threatened or endangered species, including African dwarf crocodile, American crocodile, American black bear, Bengal tiger, black howler monkey, <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapir,</b> Galapagos tortoise, lowland anoa, Nile crocodile, Palawan peacock pheasant, red-handed tamarin, and red kangaroo.|$|E
50|$|Major {{species of}} animals that are hunted by the Aguaruna include the sajino, the huangana, the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapir</b> (sachavaca), the little red brocket, the ocelot and the otorongo (jaguar).

50|$|The South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapir</b> (from the Tupi tapi'ira), lowland tapir or (in Portuguese) anta, {{is one of}} five {{species in}} the tapir family, along with the Mountain tapir, the Malayan tapir, the Baird's tapir, and the kabomani tapir. The lowland tapir is the largest {{surviving}} native terrestrial mammal in the Amazon.|$|E
25|$|The {{proboscis}} of the tapir is {{a highly}} flexible organ, able to move in all directions, allowing the animals to grab foliage {{that would otherwise be}} out of reach. Tapirs often exhibit the flehmen response, a posture in which they raise their snouts and show their teeth to detect scents. This response is frequently exhibited by bulls sniffing for signs of other males or females in oestrus in the area. The length of the proboscis varies among species; Malayan tapirs have the longest snouts and <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapirs</b> have the shortest. The evolution of tapir probosces, made up almost entirely of soft tissues rather than bony internal structures, gives the Tapiridae skull a unique form in comparison to other perissodactyls, with a larger sagittal crest, orbits positioned more rostrally, a posteriorly telescoped cranium, and a more elongated and retracted nasoincisive incisure.|$|R
5000|$|Work {{continued}} on new enclosures {{for the animals}} with meerkats, otters, <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapirs,</b> red pandas and European grey wolves joining the existing collection. Major work was undertaken to create new sections; [...] "Squirrel Monkey Island", [...] "Wonders of the Rainforest", [...] "Cheetah Retreat" [...] and [...] "Toucan House". The Animal Resource Centre (ARC) is a new development which houses a veterinary and recovery room, animal food preparation areas, an animal records and research room, and large staff facilities. There has been extensive work completed on the paddock areas to improve drainage; overflow car parking facilities have been added; and improvements to the water supply were also made. Included in the upgrade were an electricity sub-station and back-up generator. [...] "The Special Place'", a brand new play area adapted for use by children with disabilities, was also added.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Lowland Tapir (Tapirus terrestris) is {{the second}} largest South American land mammal. It is {{strictly}} herbivorous and its exposure to Toxoplasma gondii should be indicative of environmental contamination by oocysts. In the present study antibodies to T. gondii in 47 <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapirs</b> maintained ex situ in 10 Brazilian and in one Paraguayan institution were sought in serum samples by the modified agglutination test (MAT ≥ 25). None of the animals presented clinical signs during the study. From 47 animals 35 (74. 5 %) were positive with titers of 25 in 8, 50 in 6, 100 in 12, 200 in 5, 400 in 1 and 800 in 3. One animal had samples collected on twice, and 19 were born in captivity. There was no association between occurrence of T. gondii antibodies and gender, and positive animals were reported in all institutions. The high occurrence of seropositive tapirs born ininstitutions (54. 3 %) confirmed the high exposure of these mammals to T. gondii in captivity. Only two cases ofabortion were reported, {{but it was not}} possible to correlate these abortions to T. gondii infection...|$|R

40|$|Picture {{frame and}} tapir’s nose. The tapir (Brazilian- from Tupi language) is any of several large hoglike mammals {{of the genus}} Tapirus, of {{tropical}} America (South America and Central America) and the Southeast Asia- Malayan peninsula. Tapirs have a long flexible snout (proboscis), and four toes to the fore feet and three to the hind ones. They feed on plants and move about night. Due to its large size, the tapir has few natural predators in its environment. The human {{is believed to be}} the most common predator of the tapir as they have been hunted for food and even domesticated in some areas. The four species of <b>tapirs</b> are: the <b>Brazilian</b> or South American tapir, Tapirus terrestris, the Malayan tapir, Baird’s tapir and the Mountain tapir. All four are classified as endangered or vulnerable. Their closest relatives are the other odd-toed ungulates, including horses and rhinoceroses. The South American tapir is the size of a small ass, with a brown, nearly naked skin. The proboscis of the tapir is a highly flexible structure, able to move in all directions, allowing the animals to grab foliage that would otherwise be out of reach. The length of the proboscis varies among species; Malayan tapirs have the longest snouts and <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tapirs</b> have the shortest.
