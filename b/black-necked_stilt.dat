5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is a habitat for shellfish including oysters. Finfish such as the redfish and black drum are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen. Birds common to the bay include the wood ibis, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, great-tailed grackle, Louisiana heron, willet, <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt,</b> caracara and the black vulture.|$|E
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt,</b> marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|E

25|$|The {{parasitic}} cyclocoeline flatworm Neoallopyge americanensis {{was described}} {{from the air}} sacs of a <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> from Texas. Its genus is presently monotypic {{and seems to be}} closely related to the similar genus Allopyge, found in Old World cranes.|$|E
25|$|Particularly the North American {{populations of}} the <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> have {{somewhat}} declined in the 20th century, mainly due to conversion of habitat for human use and pollution affecting both the birds directly {{as well as their}} food stocks. But altogether, the population is healthy and occurs over a large range. This stilt is therefore classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. The Hawaiian stilt, separated with the <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> in a distinct species by some (including the IUCN), is very rare however and numbers less than 2,000 individuals. Predation by the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus auropunctatus), introduced to hunt rats, is suspected to have contributed to its decline.|$|E
50|$|Bird Island Basin, on the Laguna Madre {{side of the}} park, may be {{periodically}} dry {{during the}} summer or during periods of extended drought.

50|$|The {{two most}} popular places for bird {{watching}} on the island are at the causeway and near the Fielding Garr Ranch. Along the shoreline of the island, mallard, Canada goose, avocets, <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilts,</b> willets, long-billed curlews, sanderlings, American white pelicans, pied-billed grebes, killdeer, great blue herons, snowy egrets, white-faced ibis and many migratory birds can be observed.|$|R
25|$|The <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> is {{distinguished}} from non-breeding vagrants of the Old World black-winged stilt {{by the white}} spot above the eye. Vagrants of the northern American form in turn {{is hard to tell}} apart from the resident Hawaiian stilt, in which only the eye-spot is markedly smaller. But though many stilt populations are long-distance migrants and during their movements can be found hundreds of miles offshore, actual trans-oceanic vagrants are nonetheless a rare occurrence.|$|E
25|$|It also breeds along lake shores {{in northeastern}} California and southeastern Oregon {{as well as}} along the Colorado River. In North America outside California, the <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> rarely breeds inland, but it {{is known as a}} {{breeding}} bird in riparian locales in Arizona and elsewhere in the southern USA. In Arizona, black-necked stilts may be seen along artificially created lakes and drainage basins in the Phoenix metropolitan area, in remnant riparian habitat.|$|E
25|$|The <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> (Himantopus mexicanus) is {{a locally}} {{abundant}} shorebird of American wetlands and coastlines. It is found from the coastal areas of California {{through much of}} the interior western United States and along the Gulf of Mexico as far east as Florida, then south through Central America and the Caribbean to Ecuador and the Galápagos Islands. The northernmost populations, particularly those from inland, are migratory, wintering from the extreme south of the United States to southern Mexico, rarely as far south as Costa Rica; on the Baja California peninsula it is only found regularly in winter.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International mainly because, between April and September, it is an important nesting and roosting site for least terns. Other wetland birds which breed at the site include white-cheeked pintails, <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilts,</b> snowy plovers and willets. Breeding land birds include restricted-range green-throated caribs and Caribbean elaenias.|$|R
40|$|<b>Black-necked</b> <b>Stilts</b> (Himantopus mexicanus) have {{increased}} {{throughout much of}} the mid-continent in recent decades (Will 1999, Brinkley 2003, Brinkley and Baicich 2004). Prior to 1970 there were fewer than ten Nebraska records (Sharpe et al. 2001). Reports {{have increased}} since 1970 and are now annual. Breeding was first recorded in Nebraska in 1985 at Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge (Heisinger 1985). Breeding has been more or less regular in the western Sandhills since then (Sharpe et al. 2001) and additional breeding records have occurred in Scotts Bluff (Silcock 2002 b), Keith, and Hall Counties (Silcock 2000 b). In the Rainwater Basin, there was only one record prior to 1996, a specimen collected in Adams County 12 May 1956 (Sharpe et al. 2001). From 1996 through 2004, there were fourteen additional reports. This includes apparent successful breeding at Funk Waterfowl Production Area (WPA), Phelps Co., in 2003 (Silcock 2003). The Rainwater Basin has been experiencing persistent drought since 2000. While drought has been a general theme, occasional localized heavy precipitation events have filled wetlands. Such was the case on 11 – 12 May 2005 when 3 – 82 ̆ 2 inches of rain fell in portions of the Eastern Rainwater Basin, including Adams, Fillmore, and York Counties. Not long after, <b>Black-necked</b> <b>Stilts</b> were found at multiple wetlands, and several pairs attempted nesting. Below, we summarize observations of nesting <b>Black-necked</b> <b>Stilts</b> in the Eastern Rainwater Basin during 2005...|$|R
50|$|Saba Island, {{three miles}} south of Charlotte Amalie, has the largest colony of seabirds in the Virgin Islands Archipelago with more than 30,000 sooty terns and smaller populations of roseate terns, an {{endangered}} species, as well as brown noodies, bridled terns, low-crowned night herons, <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilts</b> and yellow warblers. Another popular area for bird watching, particularly during winter time, is Francis Bay on Saint John, which is {{home to more than}} 160 species of birds.|$|R
25|$|It {{is often}} {{treated as a}} {{subspecies}} of the common or black-winged stilt, using the trinomial name Himantopus himantopus mexicanus. However, the AOS has always considered it a species in its own right, and the scientific name Himantopus mexicanus is often seen. Matters are more complicated though; sometimes all five distinct lineages of the Common Stilt are treated as different species. But the white-backed stilt from southern South America (H. melanurus when the species is recognized), parapatric and intergrading to some extent with its northern relative where their ranges meet, would warrant inclusion with the <b>Black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> when this is separated specifically, becoming Himantopus mexicanus melanurus. Similarly, the Hawaiian stilt, H. m. knudseni, is likely {{to belong to the}} American species when this is considered separate; while some treat it as another distinct species, the AOS, BirdLife International and the IUCN do not.|$|E

500|$|Copano Bay {{serves as}} a nursery for shrimp, which attracts {{a large number of}} redfish. Abundant {{collections}} of black drum, flounder and trout, can also be found in the bay. Oysters grow in large numbers to form elongated reefs [...] "oriented perpendicular to tidal flow" [...] in the estuary. The reefs provide habitat for fish and sustenance {{for a wide variety of}} birds including the black-bellied whistling-duck, <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt,</b> brown pelican, gull-billed tern, reddish egret, roseate spoonbill, seaside sparrow, white-faced ibis and the whooping crane. The dominant species of gastropod in the bay is Eulimastoma harbisonae.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the island's acreage is composed of salt marsh. The island's maritime forest features cabbage palm, Southern Live Oak, Red Cedar, Red Bay, Southern Magnolia and pines; often draped in Spanish Moss. Little St. Simons is host to more than 334 species of birds; some are temporary residents who include the island in their migrations, while others are permanent residents. Species of note include: Bald Eagles, Red Knots, Painted Buntings, Roseate Spoonbills, <b>Black-necked</b> <b>Stilts,</b> and Wood Storks.|$|R
50|$|More than {{a hundred}} species of birds have been spotted at Lake Perris. Many are migratory, and stop at the park briefly during their travels, while others make their {{permanent}} residence here. Meadowlarks, loggerhead shrikes, roadrunners, California thrashers, quail, wrens, sparrows, hummingbirds, golden eagles, several varieties of hawks, ospreys, and even bald eagles may be seen. Many varieties of waterfowl use the lake including pintails, widgeons, teals, mallards, shovelers, various geese, and sometimes tundra swans and pelicans. <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilts,</b> avocets, killdeer, willets, kingfishers, egrets, and herons are attracted to the water’s edge.|$|R
25|$|The {{wetlands}} {{surrounding the}} Great Salt Lake {{account for nearly}} 80% of the wetlands in Utah. The lake and surrounding wetlands are home to over 250 species of birds and form a stop over on the Pacific Flyway between South and North America. Between four and six million birds nest and feed on the lake every year. The worlds largest populations of white-faced ibis and California gulls make their homes near the lake. A large population of <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilts,</b> American avocets and newborn pelicans are also found on and near the Great Salt Lake. Many of the birds come to Antelope Island State Park to feed on the abundant quantities of brine flies and brine shrimp.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> {{is found}} in estuarine, lacustrine, salt pond and {{emergent}} wetland habitats; it is generally a lowland bird but in Central America has been found up to [...] ASL and commonly seen in llanos habitat in northern South America. It {{is also found in}} seasonally flooded wetlands. Use of salt evaporation ponds has increased significantly since 1960 in the USA, and they may now be the primary wintering habitat; these salt ponds are especially prevalent in southern San Francisco Bay. At the Salton Sea, the <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> is resident year-round.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> forages by probing and {{gleaning}} {{primarily in}} mudflats and lakeshores, {{but also in}} very shallow waters near shores; it seeks out a range of aquatic invertebrates [...] mainly crustaceans and other arthropods, and mollusks [...] and small fish, tadpoles and very rarely plant seeds. Its mainstay food varies according to availability; inland birds usually feed mainly on aquatic insects and their larvae, while coastal populations mostly eat other aquatic invertebrates. For feeding areas they prefer coastal estuaries, salt ponds, lakeshores, alkali flats and even flooded fields. For roosting and resting needs, this bird selects alkali flats (even flooded ones), lake shores, and islands surrounded by shallow water.|$|E
2500|$|This stilt chooses mudflats, {{desiccated}} lacustrine verges, and levees for nest locations, {{as long as}} {{the soil}} is friable. Reproduction occurs from late April through August in North America, with peak activity in June, while tropical populations usually breed after the rainy season. The nests are typically sited within [...] of a feeding location, and the pairs defend an extensive perimeter around groups of nests, patrolling in cooperation with their neighbors. Spacing between nests is approximately , but sometimes nests are within [...] of each other and some nests in the rookery are as far as [...] from the nearest neighbor. The <b>black-necked</b> <b>stilt</b> is actually classified as semicolonial since the nests are rarely found alone and colonies usually number dozens, rarely hundreds of pairs. The nests are frequently established rather close to the water edge, so that their integrity is affected by rising water levels of ponds or tides. This is particularly a hazard in the case of managed salt ponds where water levels may be altered rapidly in the salt pond flooding process.|$|E
2500|$|There are 239 {{species of}} birds {{that live in the}} area or migrate through the Warner Valley.
