This situation also occurs in mice, hamsters, puppies, monkeys, chickens and pigeons (Glasser, Weiner and Lack, manuscript in preparation). The proximal small intestine does {{not participate in the}} entero-hepatic circulation of guinea pigs in vivo (Weiner and Lack, 1962). This work suggested the possi-bility of altering the steroid economy by blocking this active intestinal absorption. <b>Benzmalecene</b> has been shown to inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol in vitro (Huff and Gilfillan, 1960), and to lower plasma cholesterol in experimental animals and in man (Bergen et at., 1960). Observations by the original workers indicated that the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis could not explain all the actions of this substance. Thus, <b>benzmalecene</b> was more effective orally than parenterally (J. W. Huff, personal communication). Fecal bile salts represent major catabolic excretory products of body cholesterol (Wilson and Siperstein, 1959). It might be anticipated that an increase of this fecal excretion secondary to inhibition of the intestinal bile salt transport system would result in increased conversion of cholesterol to bile salts. Thus, in effect a drain on the cholesterol pool would result. The present study demonstrates that benz-malecene is capable of inhibiting the intestinal transport of bile salts in vivo and in vitro, sug-gesting that this action may contribute to its hypocholesterolemic action. In addition the mechanism of the inhibition has been explored Received for publication September 20, 1962...|$|E
