5|$|<b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> land {{once held}} in common by the Székely {{community}} had gradually become divided into {{smaller and smaller}} units; thus {{a vast number of}} the free warrior-peasants had to enter the service of their more prosperous fellow Székelys. This social stratification was formally recognized by a royal decree in 1473. Thereafter those who performed mounted military service were differentiated from those who fought as foot-soldiers; those who were unable to finance themselves even as foot-soldiers were legally reduced to servitude.|$|E
5|$|Mikhail Vorontsov was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Novorossiya in May 1823.

5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being that Ronald Reagan was {{originally}} chosen to play Rick.

5|$|The Intertropical Convergence Zone {{produced}} {{an area of}} convection in the southeastern Arabian Sea {{toward the end of}} October 2011. The overall system moved west-northwestward, developing a distinct low pressure area on October27. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> thunderstorm activity was still disorganized and associated with a weak circulation. Environmental conditions were unfavorable initially, consisting of strong wind shear and dry air. An anticyclone over the system caused the shear to decrease by October28, amid warm water temperatures of , both more favorable conditions. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> circulation became well-defined, although still elongated, and the convection was still scattered. On October29, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression ARB 02 about 885km (550mi) east of the Yemeni island of Socotra.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} persisted {{toward the end}} of April between Diego Garcia and the equator. It developed a spiral area of convection on April24, which preceded the development of a tropical disturbance the next day. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> system was already at tropical storm status and was given the name Karla. Moving southwest, the storm strengthened and organized. A ridge to the south steered Karla to the east on April27, although an approaching trough turned it to the southeast on the following day. Enhanced atmospheric instability helped the storm strengthen to tropical cyclone status on April29. On the next day, Karla attained peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) after developing a well-defined eye. Increased wind shear and progressively cooler waters weakened the cyclone as it turned more to the south. By May3, the storm weakened to tropical depression status and dissipated the next day within the westerlies.|$|E
5|$|Advance {{elements}} of the 24th Infantry were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on 5 July, the first encounter between American and North Korean forces. For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment. The regiments of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon, Chonan, and Pyongtaek. The 24th made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon, where it was almost completely destroyed but delayed North Korean forces until July 20. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> 8th Army′s force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.|$|E

5|$|After Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines {{suffered}} from constant civil strife early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but this occurred much {{later on in}} the 15th century, <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines were too weak to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the civil strife of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341–71) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and at the mercy of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted to nothing.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its intensity for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall at peak intensity near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California Sur. Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification, despite moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of California. After weakening slightly, Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiacán. Upon moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as the forward speed increased. Rachel dissipated several hours later on October3. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h). The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and were last noted over Texas.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Taiwan, Rananim made {{landfall}} at peak intensity around 1300UTC on August12, near Wenling in Zhejiang province in China.

Moving over land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status as it turned toward the west. Early on August13, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> circulation was over Jiangxi.

5|$|After redevelopment, {{wind shear}} {{continued}} to be a problem, with convection located southwest of the center. Early on August17, a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed the system to become better organized. The convection became more concentrated and the circulation less exposed. As a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong early on August18, still in the central South China Sea. Around that time, the storm began moving more quickly to the northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast. Although the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of only 75km/h (45mph), the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph), early on August19. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> storm was near Hainan, and at 1240UTC that day, Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong. It quickly weakened over land, dissipating early on August20 to the west of Guilin.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the morale of the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
5|$|Although the Panzer IV was {{deployed}} to north Africa with the German Afrika Korps, until the longer gun variant began production, the tank was outperformed by the Panzer III {{with respect to}} armor penetration. Both the Panzer III and IV had difficulty in penetrating the British Matilda II's thick armor, while the Matilda's 40-mm QF 2 pounder gun could knock out either German tank; its major disadvantage was its low speed. By August 1942, Rommel had only received 27 Panzer IV Ausf. F2s, armed with the L/43 gun, which he {{deployed to}} spearhead his armored offensives. The longer gun could penetrate all American and British tanks in theater at ranges of up to , <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> most heavily armored {{of which was the}} M3 Grant.

5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather persisted as of 9 April to {{the southeast}} of Diego Garcia. The system moved generally westwards, steered by a ridge, and a low-level circulation gradually became more defined. Limiting factors to faster development included poor inflow and moderate wind shear, although associated convection became more organized. At 06:00UTC on 11 April, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center Météo-France in La Réunion (MFR) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 8 about 600km (375mi) south of Diego Garcia. Six hours later, the agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression. At 13:00UTC on 11 April, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, noting the increased organization of the convection, circulation, and outflow. Later that day, the MFR upgraded the depression to Moderate Tropical Storm Fantala, and the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 19S. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> convection was quickly consolidating around the center, organizing into a circular central dense overcast.|$|E
5|$|As a {{strengthening}} tropical storm, Fanapi developed deeper convection {{near the}} center. A passing trough {{to the north}} weakened the ridge and caused the storm to slow, turning northeastward by September16. That day, Fanapi developed an eye feature, becoming a typhoon at 18:00UTC. As the ridge built into the East China Sea, the storm responded by turning to the northwest, {{and at the same}} time, outflow improved to the north. The eye organized further as it contracted to a diameter of 19km (12mi). <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> typhoon was moving due westward toward Taiwan, steered by a ridge over northeastern China. At 06:00UTC on September18, the JTWC estimated that Fanapi attained peak 1minute winds of 195km/h (120mph). Around the same time, the JMA estimated peak 10minute winds of 175km/h (110mph).|$|E

Higos passed very near Tokyo around 1200UTC that day, becoming the third strongest typhoon to affect the city since World War II, according to the JTWC. The typhoon weakened into a tropical storm while crossing Honshu. Higos briefly emerged over waters, before making a second landfall on Tomakomai, Hokkaidō at 2100UTC on October1. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> storm was beginning to transition into an extratropical cyclone, and at 0600UTC on October2 Higos completed the transition.
