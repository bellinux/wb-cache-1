5|$|A prophecy {{states that}} a female {{child with a}} special {{birthmark}} will herald {{the downfall of the}} evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda. Bavmorda imprisons all pregnant women in her realm to prevent fulfillment of the prophecy. When the prophesied child Elora Danan is born, the mother begs the midwife to hide the infant and smuggle her to safety. The midwife reluctantly accepts and leaves Nockmaar castle unnoticed. The mother is executed, the midwife is hunted down and eventually found. Knowing she cannot escape, she sets the <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> a makeshift raft of grass and sends her down the river hoping for fate to run its course. The midwife is killed by Nockmaar hounds. Bavmorda, furious about the escape, summons her daughter Sorsha and her army's commander, General Kael, to find the baby.|$|E
5|$|Early {{into the}} 2008–09 season, Lucic {{recorded}} his first career NHL hat-trick and added an assist in a 5–4 win against the Atlanta Thrashers on October 25, 2008.

Will, tired of his wife Terri's (Jessalyn Gilsig) refusal to let him participate in the pregnancy, sets up an appointment with Terri's OB/GYN so he can see their own <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> the ultrasound. With {{the help of her}} sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri blackmails her doctor into faking the sonogram using Quinn's ultrasound DVD, in order to continue hiding the fact she isn't really pregnant. Meanwhile, Quinn angrily confronts Rachel about her relationship with Finn and threatens her. Rachel confronts Quinn about being a spy in the glee club for Sue and tells her that she will be kicked of the Cheerios once Sue finds out about her pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre {{piece in the}} tondo of both bowls. As the same image was used for both bowls, the {{implication}} is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one woman with a <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> her shoulders – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. The engraving is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un mariage, chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E
