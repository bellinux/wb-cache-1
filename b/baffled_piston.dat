40|$|A fast {{method for}} {{computing}} the acoustic field of ultrasound transducers is presented with application to rectangular {{elements that are}} cylindrically focused. No closed-form solutions exist for this case but several numerical techniques have been described in the ultrasound imaging literature. Our motivation is the rapid calculation of imaging kernels for physics-based diagnostic imaging for which current methods are too computationally intensive. Here, the surface integral defining the acoustic field from a <b>baffled</b> <b>piston</b> is converted to a 3 -D spatial convolution of the element surface and the Green's function. A 3 -D version of the overlap-save method from digital signal processing is employed to obtain a fast computational algorithm based on spatial Fourier transforms. Further efficiency is gained by using a separable approximation to the Green's function through singular value decomposition and increasing the effective sampling rate by polyphase filtering. The tradeoff between accuracy and spatial sampling rate is explored to determine appropriate parameters for a specific transducer. Comparisons with standard tools such as Field II are presented, where nearly 2 orders of magnitude improvement in computation speed is observed for similar accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The Source Simulation Technique is {{a general}} tool for calculating the sound {{radiation}} or scattering from complex-shaped structures into the three-dimensional space. The basic idea of the method consists in replacing the structure by a system of acoustical sources placed {{in the interior of}} the structure. By definition, these source functions have to satisfy the Helmholtz equation and the radiation condition. For solving the radiation or scattering problem completely or approximately, the source system also has to fulfil or minimize the boundary conditions {{on the surface of the}} body. In most cases, spherical wave functions e. g. monopoles, dipoles, quadrupoles etc. with different source locations are used as sources, since they can be calculated easily. If the coordinates of the source positions are shifted from real values into the complex plane, the corresponding monopoles show a similar behaviour like surface waves or possess a distinctive directivity pattern, depending on the values of the imaginary parts of their coordinates. Therefore, by adding such complex source point solutions to the system of equivalent sources, a strongly focused sound field should be computed in a more efficient and stable way. The capacity of the extended source simulation technique is investigated and represented by applying it to calculate the sound field radiated from a circular <b>baffled</b> <b>piston...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{imaging system}} {{evaluation}} is {{often based on}} models of the transducer as a distribution of <b>baffled</b> <b>piston</b> sources, and of the tissue as a homogeneous, linear acoustic medium, e. g., Jensen’s Field code. In reality, these are fairly gross idealizations, since the transducer exhibits more complicated response modes and real tissue is inhomogeneous and nonlinear. Greater model fidelity would be useful, especially {{in the context of}} transducer design qualification, second harmonic imaging, and acoustic power indices. To this end we combine 2 D finite element models of transducer dynamics with highly accurate 2 D finite difference propagation models in the large-scale inhomogeneous tissue crosssections. Transducer models employ the time-domain code, PZFlex, and tissue models utilize a new pseudospectral solver to be included in PZFlex. The pseudospectral algorithm solves the inhomogeneous acoustic wave equation using FFTs for high order approximation of the spatial differential operator and a fourth-order, explicit time integrator. Second-order (B/A) nonlinearity and frequency-accurate, causal absorption are included. We describe the algorithmic and modeling issues, and present a suite of simulations in lossy, nonlinear abdominal cross sections and tissue showing coupling of the 1 D medical array to the tissue model and scattering from deeper inhomogeneities and back to the transducer. In contrast to paraxial schemes, like the KZK method, details of the field transmitted from the transducer and all backscatter within the model are included. However, models are currently limited to 2 D (plane or axisymmetric) on readily available hardware...|$|E
40|$|Computing the {{transient}} {{pressure field}} generated by large phased arrays is helpful in designing ultrasound imaging systems. Methods for computing the transient near-field pressure of a planar aperture include the point-source method [1] and the spatial impulse response (SIR) method [2, 3, 4]. Recently, a rapid single integral {{approach has been}} developed for computing the time domain pressure generated by a <b>baffled</b> circular <b>piston</b> [5]. This solution is applied to a 129 element focused phased array and compared to a similar computation made using Field II [6]. 2. THEORY A time domain solution to the lossless wave equation can be derived subject to an input pulse v(t), which models the uniform normal velocity of the <b>piston.</b> Consider a <b>baffled</b> rigid <b>piston</b> with radius a radiating into a homogeneous fluid with density p 0 and sound speed c. Solving the wave equation in cylindrical coordinates (r,z) yields the single integral solution: p 0 ac 7 r cosp- a p(r, z t) J V E I-r r *...|$|R
40|$|For the {{localisation}} {{of sound}} sources, usually the acoustic pressure is propagated {{by means of}} acoustic holography techniques. In this paper {{the merits of the}} propagation of sound intensity instead of acoustic pressure are addressed. A newly developed theory based upon Planar Nearfield Acoustic Holography (PNAH) is described which propagates cross-spectra directly. Using this theory, called cross-spectral NAH, it is possible to propagate, in approximation, sound intensity spectra directly without the need to propagate the acoustic pressure and acoustic particle velocity spectra individually. In this paper, the cross-spectral PNAH theory is applied to an acoustical set-up with four <b>baffled</b> <b>pistons,</b> which can be solved analytically. The sound intensity is propagated towards the source by means of cross-spectral NAH and is compared with both the more commonly used indirectly propagated sound intensity and with the analytical sound intensity. It is shown that an accurate reconstruction of the sound intensity can be obtained by means of cross-spectral NAH, which is less sensitive to measurement noise in comparison with the indirect propagation of sound intensity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn noise control, {{identification}} of the source velocity field remains a major problem open to investigation. Consequently, methods such as nearfield acoustical holography (NAH), principal source projection, the inverse frequency response function and hybrid NAH have been developed. However, these methods require free field conditions that are often difficult to achieve in practice. This article presents an alternative method known as inverse patch transfer functions, designed to identify source velocities and developed {{in the framework of}} the European SILENCE project. This method is based on the definition of a virtual cavity, the double measurement of the pressure and particle velocity fields on the aperture surfaces of this volume, divided into elementary areas called patches and the inversion of impedances matrices, numerically computed from a modal basis obtained by FEM. Theoretically, the method is applicable to sources with complex 3 D geometries and measurements can be carried out in a non-anechoic environment even in the presence of other stationary sources outside the virtual cavity. In the present paper, the theoretical background of the iPTF method is described and the results (numerical and experimental) for a source with simple geometry (two <b>baffled</b> <b>pistons</b> driven in antiphase) are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{generation}} from a vibrating circular piston is {{a classical}} acoustic problem. The {{goal of this}} paper is to simulate numerically the sound radiation produced by oscillating <b>baffled</b> <b>pistons,</b> using both linear and nonlinear model, and to consider the interplay between wave propagation and geometric complexities. The linear solution, based on the linear Euler equations, will be compared to the Rayleigh integral approximation. The nonlinear solution, based on the Navier-Stokes equations, will be compared against linear model for low speed (less than 0. 01 of sound speed). A main practical interest in this problem is to capture the behavior of the waves resulting from the source pistons with other solid objects or waves. The wave's properties in terms of frequency, amplitude and wavenumber are influenced by the initial frequencies and coordinates of the pistons, and the geometry. The wave equations in Cartesian coordinate with cut-cell and local grid refinement technique are employed along with the Optimized Prefactored Compact finite volume (OPC-fv) scheme for spatial discretization, the Low-Dispersion Low-Dissipation Runge-Kutta (LDDRK) scheme for time discretization. Problems for the waves around different geometries, and with varied frequencies and amplitudes are considered and presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of quiet zones in a {{diffuse sound field}} due to a multipole spherical primary source {{by means of a}} radially vibrating surface set in the side of a rigid sphere (secondary source) is investigated in this article. The formulation utilizes the appropriate wave field expansions along with the translational addition theorems for spherical wave functions to develop a closed-form solution {{in the form of an}} infinite series. The numerical results reveal that using a <b>baffled</b> spherical <b>piston</b> model as a secondary source instead of a monopole control source will obviously improve the sound minimization efficiency of such noise-control systems in all cases, especially for a dipolar primary source...|$|R
40|$|An exact {{study of}} {{radiation}} of an acoustic field due to radial/axial vibrations of a <b>baffled</b> cylindrical <b>piston,</b> eccentrically positioned within a fluid-filled thin cylindrical elastic shell, into an external fluid medium is presented. This configuration, {{which is a}} realistic idealization of a liquid-filled cylindrical acoustic lens with a focal point inside the lens when used as a sound projector, is of practical importance with a multitude of possible applications in underwater acoustics and ocean engineering. The formulation utilizes the appropriate wave field expansions along with the translational addition theorems for cylindrical wave functions to develop a closed-form solution {{in the form of}} an infinite series. Numerical results reveal the key effects of excitation frequency, cap angle, radiator position (eccentricity), dynamics of the elastic shell, and cap surface velocity distribution on sound radiation...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{estimating}} acoustic intensity has recently been developed {{in an effort to}} improve the acoustical measurements of launch vehicles. This new method, known as the phase and amplitude gradient estimation (PAGE) method, improves upon the traditional ﬁnite difference p-p {{method of estimating}} acoustic intensity. The advantages and limitations of the PAGE method are investigated experimentally using measurements of loud speaker arrays. The measured data is compared qualitatively to the acoustic intensity ﬁeld determined by modeling the loudspeakers as <b>bafﬂed</b> circular <b>pistons</b> using an extension of the Rayleigh integral. The primary advantage of the PAGE method is that it allows for accurate intensity measurements over a larger frequency band. When measuring smoothly varying broadband sources, it is possible to unwrap the phase component of the PAGE method, allowing for accurate intensity estimates well above previous limitations.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{orthogonal}} polynomial (Zernike) expansions of functions on a disk, {{as used in}} the diffraction theory of optical aberrations, is applied to obtain (semi-) analytical expressions for the spatial impulse responses arising from a non-uniformly moving, <b>baffled,</b> circular <b>piston.</b> These expressions are {{in terms of the}} expansion coefficients of the non-uniformity and the responses of the orthogonal expansion functions. The latter impulse responses have a closed formas finite series involving Legendre functions and the sinc function. The method is compared with a similar method, proposed in P. R. Stepanishen, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 70, 1176 - 1181, 1981 where zero-th orderorthogonal Bessel functions, rather than Zernike polynomials, are used as expansion functions. The method is also considered for retrieval of a non-uniform velocity profile from measured spatial impulseresponses on the level of expansion coefficients, which can be applied to acoustic holography for loudspeakers...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{orthogonal}} (Zernike) expansions of functions on a disk, {{as used in}} the diffraction theory of optical aberrations, is applied to obtain (semi-) analytical results for the radiation of sound due to a non-uniformly moving, <b>baffled,</b> circular <b>piston.</b> For this particular case, a scheme for retrieval of the radially symmetric part of the velocity profile from on-axis, near-field measurements {{on the level of}} expansion coefficients of the profile has been developed and demonstrated previously with simulation results and with results obtained from measured pressure data of a loudspeaker. In this contribution, (semi-) analytic expressions for transient responses, valid on the whole half-space in front of the baffle, including the axis, are presented. It thus appears that the radially symmetric part of the velocity profile on the disk is reproduced in warped form at any on-axis point as an impulse response. This offers an alternative method in present holography to estimate the velocity profile from on-axis pressure data. ...|$|R
40|$|The causal impulse {{response}} of the velocity potential for the Stokes wave equation is derived for calculations of transient velocity potential fields generated by circular pistons in viscous media. The causal Green’s function is numerically verified using the material {{impulse response}} function approach. The causal, lossy impulse response for a <b>baffled</b> circular <b>piston</b> is then calculated within the near field and the far field regions using expressions previously derived for the fast near field method. Transient velocity potential fields in viscous media are computed with the causal, lossy impulse response and compared to results obtained with the lossless impulse response. The numerical error in the computed velocity potential field is quantitatively analyzed {{for a range of}} viscous relaxation times and piston radii. Results show that the largest errors are generated in locations near the piston face and for large relaxation times, and errors are relatively small otherwise. Unlike previous frequency-domain methods that require numerical inverse Fourier transforms for the evaluation of the lossy impulse response, the present approach calculates the lossy impulse response directly in the time domain. The results indicate that this causal impulse response is ideal for time-domain calculations that simultaneously account for diffraction and quadratic frequency-dependent attenuation in viscous media...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} fields radiated by <b>baffled</b> circular <b>pistons</b> {{have been}} studied extensively by the acoustics community [1]. Since many realistic transducers have a velocity profile that varies in the radial direction, the field generated by axisymmetric radiators is an important application [2, 3]. In an earlier work, the authors derived a fast nearfield method (FNM) for pistons that have a spatially uniform velocity [4]; and in this paper, the FNM is extended to radiators with a radially varying normal velocity. This fast nearfield method is implemented and compared with the standard Rayleigh integral approach. 2. THEORY Consider a circular piston of radius a lying in the x-y plane surround by an infinite, rigid baffle. Assume a lossless, homogeneous medium with density p and sound speed c. The single-frequency pressure Pa (r, z; 6) generated by this piston with a spatially uniform velocity of unity is given by the fast nearfield method (FNM) P a (r,z; 6) = — J n I r cos /- a r + a- 2 arc o s / e ~ j k ^ r 2 + a 2 +z 2 - 2 a r cos / jk z d / (1) where r and z are the radial and axial observation coordinates, respectively. Eq. (1) is derived and analyzed in terms of error and speed in [4]. To extend Eq. (1) to the more general apodized piston, define an apodization function q(s) the gives the normal velocity of the piston as function of radius s. As noted by [5], the pressure field generated by this apodized piston is synthesized by decomposing the circle of radius a into evenly spaced concentric annuli. Fig 1 illustrates this concept. By allowing the number of annuli to approach infinity, the following expression is derived: u P(r, z; 6) = J- 8 Ps (r,z;a>...|$|R
