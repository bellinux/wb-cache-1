40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In this thesis, {{performance}} of the single structural <b>break</b> <b>tests</b> is examined. Since it has proved superiority of Sequential F test on other single <b>break</b> <b>tests,</b> it is chosen as single <b>break</b> <b>test.</b> Monte Carlo simulation is run for different scenarios and performances of the test with respect to estimating break points, and parameters, and rejecting or accepting the joint null hypothesis is observed. For all cases small sample bias is observed. The test estimates parameters correctly for large samples but for small samples it underestimates or overestimates parameters. Another common problem is about joint null hypothesis. When test rejects the joint null, it doesn’t identify which of the joint hypothesis is rejected. Therefore in this study, we utilize the t-statistic of the parameters to determine the individual hypothesis rejected. In addition to these common problems we illustrate other scenario specific problems in this study. We examine the implications of our Monte Carlo findings by applying the <b>break</b> <b>test</b> to real life data and investigate the efficient market hypothesis using stock market data on SP& 500.

Empirical evidence in this domain has been mixed. We use the standard method of <b>testing</b> for <b>breaks</b> in the mean of the inflation series to conclude whether possible unit root findings are the result of neglected breaks. Then, we build standard autoregressive representations of inflation, using an automatic general-to-specific approach. We conclude against inflation persistence in the sample period, and the point estimates of persistence we obtain are several percentage points below those achieved with other <b>break</b> <b>tests</b> and model selection methods. Moreover, our final model is congruent. Secondly, we provide the first empirical application of the new impulse saturation <b>break</b> <b>test.</b> The resulting estimates of the break dates are in line with other literature findings and have a sound economic meaning, confirming the good performance the test had revealed in theoretical and simulation studies. Finally, we also illustrate the shortcomings of the Bai-Perron test when applied to a small sample with high serial correlation. Indeed, we show the Bai- Perron break dates’ estimates would not allow us to build a congruent autoregressive representation of inflation.

As the number of contaminants in bushings increases, the electric fields on the fuse element surface rise to a critical level, triggering corona discharge. A fuse element material that is more resistant to corona discharge than the Ag element is desired. A new type of current-limiting fuse made of stainless steel wires, which is low-cost and simple in design has been developed. Characteristics tests, including a blocking test with a high surge current when a voltage is applied, have been conducted. Using a model fuse, it was confirmed that this new type of fuse possesses similar performance characteristics to those with an Ag element.

The originality {{of this study is}} that it extended to very short times (less than 1440 min). Rise in pH tests was implemented and dissolution kinetics was analysed. The results showed that calcium was the major element released by the aggregates. It has also been found that dissolution had an influence on the final morphology of aggregates. Polyamine emulsifier adsorption onto aggregates has been assessed using electrophoresis. Finally, the rise in pH and electrophoretic tests were compared to the <b>breaking</b> <b>test</b> traditionally performed to characterise bitumen emulsions. It was found that breaking values were controlled by both the surface area and the surface charge of the particles. Results may be correlated to polyamine adsorption on aggregates. Adsorption seemed to be efficient for gneiss and diorite: at pH 2, their charge turned from slightly negative to highly positive. At this pH value, limestone particles were dissolved and polyamine adsorption must be less efficient than with gneiss and diorite, for which the emulsion breaking was facilitated by the high attraction of particles for the emulsifier, due to their negative surface charge...|$|E

Four successive samples of grass leaves were taken from pure stands of third-year swards during July to September, 2004 in Obihiro, Japan. Tensile strength was measured using a 100 N load cell of the <b>breaking</b> <b>test</b> machine. Shear strength was measured about 5 mm apart from a broken point in the tensile test using a pair of the scissors. Cross-sectional area, DM weight and width of leaves were significantly higher in tetraploid perennial and festulolium than in diploid perennial. Shearing strength reached a peak at the central deflection, coinciding with shearing point of main vein. In shearing fracture pattern, a multi-ridged outline of leaf cross section at the adaxial side corresponded to each small peak. Tensile strength, shearing strength and work of fracture were significantly higher in tetraploid perennial and festulolium than in diploid perennial, but tensile stress and stiffness were significantly lower in tetraploid perennial and festulolium than in diploid perennial.

40|$|Osteoporosis {{has become}} a growing health threat with rising social and {{economic}} consequences. The {{understanding of the relationship}} between bone mechanical strength and bone structural quality is important for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and the evaluation of osteoporosis treatments. A novel cancellous bone segmentation method was developed to separate cancellous bone from cortical bone automatically. The segmentation was based on the three-dimensional images. The basic idea of the method is that a contiguous three-dimensional non-bone region that is located inside the whole bone region of interest can be defined as the marrow region. Any bone material that is surrounded by the marrow region is considered cancellous bone while bone that is outside of the marrow region is cortical bone. This method is more objective, more accurate and more precise than a manual method and an established computer method (Helterbrand method). Twenty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats, 7 - 8 weeks old, were used in a study of various osteoporosis drugs. After 8 weeks drug treatment, alendronate had more positive effects on cancellous bone volume fraction than 17 ß-Estradiol 2, raloxifene and PTH. This striking result may be explained by the age of the rat model because the young animals are still growing rapidly and {{it is possible that the}} ovariectomy (OVX) operation results in higher remodeling rate in young animals. When an anti-resorptive drug is given, the individuals with high baseline remodeling rate have more positive response than those with low baseline remodeling rate. 120 female Sprague-Dawley rats, 5. 5 months or 6 months old, were used in three studies of experimental drugs. In the Pradama studies, sensitivity analyses and linear regression analyses were conducted. Drug effect analyses were also conducted, but this research did not focus on that. A new mechanical indentation test was developed. The three-point <b>breaking</b> <b>test</b> and the calculation of volume fraction were also established during the research. By focusing on only Sham group and OVX group, the sensitivity analyses showed that these three new methods were much more sensitive than more traditional methods (Archimedes 2 ̆ 7 density measurements and three-point bending tests). The linear regression analyses were conducted to explore if the image processing methods can be correlated to the mechanical test methods, such as indentation testing and three-point breaking testing. The analyses showed that the volume fraction calculated from image processing methods explained most of the bone strength, but not all. The R 2 of the correlation between the indentation force and the cancellous bone volume fraction (0. 542) was a little lower than that between the indentation force and the whole bone volume fraction (0. 588). The correlations between the mechanical results from three-point breaking testing and the volume fractions (cancellous bone and whole bone) were in the range of 0. 504 0. 552. So it is better to combine both image analysis and mechanical tests to understand osteoporosis in bone properties and structures...|$|E

Since 2007, an extensive series of experimental works were successfully carried out, including large break {{loss of coolant accident}} <b>tests,</b> small <b>break</b> loss of coolant accident <b>tests</b> at various <b>break</b> locations, steam generator tube rupture <b>tests,</b> feed line <b>break</b> <b>tests,</b> and steam line <b>break</b> <b>tests.</b> These tests contributed toward {{an understanding of}} the unique thermal-hydraulic behavior, resolving the safety-related concerns and providing validation data for evaluation of the safety analysis codes and methodology for the advanced pressurized water reactor, APR 1400. Major discoveries and lessons found in the past integral effect tests are summarized in this paper. As the demand for integral effect tests is on the rise due to the active national nuclear R&D program in Korea, the future prospects of the application of the ATLAS facility are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we examine the {{persistent}} nature of the 3 -month UK real interest rate for the period 1957 :Q 2 to 2008 :Q 2. We employ unit root and cointegration tests, confidence intervals for {{the sum of the}} Autoregressive (AR) coefficient, fractional integration <b>tests,</b> structural <b>break</b> <b>tests</b> and threshold modelling. Evidence from both unit root tests and AR modelling support the view that the real rate is nonstationary. Similarly, and in contrast to previous literature, the fractional integration test supports covariance nonstationarity, although there is evidence of mean reversion. Evidence from structural <b>break</b> <b>tests</b> support stationary behaviour, but only if we allow for three or more breaks, which may not be defendable on economic grounds. Finally, stationary behaviour is supported by a nonlinear exponential smooth transition model, which suggests that the real rate behaves in a random walk fashion when the rate is close to equilibrium but exhibits strong mean reversion when the disequilibrium becomes large. ...|$|R
