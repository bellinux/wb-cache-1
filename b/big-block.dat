Heffner, who won the <b>big-block</b> modified championship at Lebanon Valley Speedway twice; Jeff Babcock, who won an American Late Model Series race at the track during 2013; and Joe Cobb, a dirt modified racer and the father of Truck Series regular Jennifer Jo Cobb. Cup Series drivers Dave Blaney, Ken Schrader and Ryan Newman, along with Nationwide Series drivers Austin Dillon, Kenny Wallace and Kyle Larson also ran in the event. Babcock, Blaney, Bloomquist, Hines, Schrader and Wallace had all won races at Eldora in various disciplines. Jason Bowles was later announced as the driver of the No. 5 for Wauters Motorsports, while Chris Jones was originally listed as the driver of the No. 93 for RSS Racing, but eventually withdrew.|$|E
25|$|Pontiac engines {{were not}} {{available}} in Canada, however, but were replaced with Chevrolet engines of similar size and power, resulting in such interesting and unusual (at least to American car fans) models as the Beaumont SD-396 with a Chevrolet <b>big-block</b> 396 cubic inch V8.|$|E
25|$|The GSX and <b>big-block</b> V8 {{were dropped}} after 1974. In 1974, the GSX {{consisted}} of a trim package on Buick's small, X-bodied Apollo. Three engines were available on the 1974 GSX: the Chevrolet supplied 250 6-cyl.,and two Buick engines:the 350 2 barrel and 350 4 barrel versions.|$|E
50|$|Of all the GM 350 CID L engines, the Buick 350 has {{the longest}} piston stroke. This design {{characteristic}} made the Buick 350 significantly {{wider than the}} other GM 350s — essentially the same width as the Buick <b>big-blocks,</b> which have the shortest stroke of the GM <b>big-blocks.</b> At a glance, the Buick 350 can be mistaken for the larger 455 engine; {{this is due to}} the over-sized intake manifold atop the engine and conventionally-angled valve covers that resemble those of the 400/430/455.|$|R
25|$|The frame {{hugs the}} engine tightly, giving 'Tonti' <b>big-blocks</b> a low {{center of gravity}} and compact overall dimensions. Unladen, 'Tonti' Guzzis are very small, low and easy to handle. Detachable lower-frame tubes {{accommodate}} engine access and can be modified for specific applications such as floorboards and pegs.|$|R
5000|$|All Chevrolet V8s, {{from the}} <b>big-blocks</b> to today's LS7 and LS9, {{evolved from the}} 265/283 cu in small-block family. Of the three engines in this family, two of them, the 265 and the 283, have gone down in {{automotive}} history. The first of this family was the 265, introduced in 1955. The 265 had a [...] bore. The stroke of the 265 was , like the 283.

25|$|The C3 fifteen-year run {{shows an}} extreme contrast. The list {{price for the}} Corvette in 1968 was $4,663. By 1982, mostly due to inflation, the base price had {{increased}} to $18,290. In 1968 there were six engines, two small-block V8s and four <b>big-block</b> V8s. By 1982 {{there was only one}} small block V8 engine available. In '68 there were five transmissions, including four manual choices. By '82 there was one, a four-speed automatic. Although refined, emission standards and fuel economy concerns had changed America's only sports car.|$|E
25|$|The <b>big-block</b> 455 {{was gone}} forever. The base engine {{was now the}} Buick 350 with a 4-barrel {{carburetor}} until 1979. The Oldsmobile 403 was optional from 1977 to 1979. Oldsmobile's 350 diesel {{was added to the}} option list beginning in 1980, along with an Oldsmobile-sourced 307. The Buick 350 was now optional, with the base engine being the Buick 4.1 L V6 for improved fuel economy. In 1981, the then-optional Buick 350 was dropped. That same year, the Electra gained the new THM200-4R automatic transmission, which featured a lock-up torque converter and a 0.67:1 overdrive ratio. With the new transmission, the Electra could be equipped with a numerically higher rear axle ratio for better performance, while offering improved fuel economy with the overdrive range.|$|E
500|$|Manufacturing a car {{powered by}} a competitor's engine was {{unacceptable}} to the new owner, but Chrysler's own 273 small-block V-8 was too large to fit under the Tiger's bonnet without major modifications. Compounding the problem, the company's small-block V8 engines had the distributor positioned at the rear, unlike the front-mounted distributor of the Ford V8. Chrysler's <b>big-block</b> V8 had a front-mounted distributor but was significantly larger. Shortly after the takeover Chrysler ordered that production of the Tiger was to end when Rootes' stock of Ford V8 engines was exhausted; Jensen assembled the last Tiger on 27 June 1967. Chrysler added its pentastar logo to the car's badging, and in its marketing literature de-emphasised the Ford connection, simply describing the Tiger as having [...] "an American V-8 power train".|$|E
50|$|Moving to Old Forge, New York to race dirt modifieds, Friesen raced <b>big-blocks</b> with {{widespread}} {{success in}} the Northeast United States, advancing to the 2010 World Finals at Charlotte Motor Speedway. He {{was one of the}} top competitors in the SuperDIRT Series in the mid-2010s, and he also has triumphed in the World of Outlaws sprint car series. Eventually, he met Chris Larsen, who gave Friesen his first NASCAR ride at Eldora Speedway, which {{was supposed to be a}} one-time deal. However, the partnership blossomed in to a full-time ride. Sometimes, Friesen runs NASCAR and dirt on the same day.|$|R
5000|$|The National Hot Rod Association Pro Stock class {{emerged from}} the production-based Super Stock in 1970 with a more liberal set of rules and an absence of handicaps.

The Gen-1 engine is physically the size of a <b>big-block</b> Ford or GM engine, and is sometimes called a [...] "big-block". The Gen-2 is closer to the physical size of U.S. made small-block V8s except for the bore centers, which are the same as some <b>big-block</b> engines. There are no shared parts between the AMC Gen-1 and Gen-2/3 engines.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] LS-4 <b>big-block</b> V8 {{engine was}} offered {{delivering}} [...] and 15% {{of the cars}} were ordered so equipped. “454” emblems adorned the hood of <b>big-block</b> equipped Corvettes. All models featured a new cowl induction domed hood, which pulled air in through a rear hood intake into the engine compartment under full throttle, increasing power (but didn't {{show up in the}} horsepower ratings). 0-60 times were reduced by a second while keeping the engine compartment cooler. The new tire size was GR70-15 with white stripes or raised white letters optional. An aluminum wheel option was seen on 1973 and 1974 pilot cars, and a few 1973s were so equipped, but withheld for quality issues, and wouldn't be available until 1976.|$|E
2500|$|The second-generation Barracuda, {{though still}} a [...] {{wheelbase}} A-body sharing many components with the Valiant, was given Barracuda-specific styling {{and its own}} range of models including convertibles and fastback and notchback hardtops.

2500|$|Hot Rod {{magazine}} in its March 1986 issue selected the 1973-74 Corvette LS4 454 {{as one of}} the [...] "10 most collectable muscle cars" [...] in the company of the 1968-70 Chevelle, 1970 'Cuda, 1970 Challenger, 1966-67 Fairlane, 1968-70 AMX, 1970 Camaro Z28, 1968-70 GTO, 1968–69 Charger, and 1967-68 Mustang. The <b>big-block</b> Corvettes were the only muscle cars produced after 1970 worthy of the list.|$|E
2500|$|GM {{mandated}} {{all divisions}} design their engines {{to run on}} lower-octane regular, low-lead or unleaded gasoline. To permit usage of the lower-octane fuels, all engines featured low compression ratios (9:1 and lower; well below the 10.25-11.25:1 range on high-performance engines of 1970 and earlier). This move reduced horsepower ratings on the <b>big-block</b> engines to 300 for the 402 cubic-inch V8 but the LS5 454 option got an [...] "advertised" [...] five-horsepower increase to 365.|$|E
2500|$|There was an {{extended}} production {{run for the}} 1969 model year due a lengthy labor strike, which meant sales were down on the 1970 models, to 17,316. 1970 small-block power peaked with the optional high compression, high-revving LT-1 that produced [...] The 427 <b>big-block</b> was enlarged to [...] with a [...] rating.

2500|$|The {{previous}} economy {{engine and}} standard 350hp 400CID V8 remained, while the [...] 400HO was upgraded to the Ram Air III, rated at [...] at 5,100rpm. The top option was the [...] Ram Air IV, which featured special header-like high-flow exhaust manifolds, high-flow cylinder heads, a specific high-rise aluminum intake manifold, larger Rochester QuadraJet four-barrel carburetor, high-lift/long-duration camshaft, plus various internal components capable of withstanding higher engine speeds and power output. Unlike the highest RPM <b>big-block</b> Chevy and Hemi engines, the Ram Air IV utilized hydraulic lifters.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973 and 1974, the Luxus {{high-end}} {{trim level}} was offered for the Century, but for 1975 that line was renamed the Century Custom. Also beginning in 1975, the new [...] 231 V6 was installed as standard equipment, and the optional <b>big-block</b> 455 was now exclusive {{to the station}} wagon. After the 455's demise, the Oldsmobile 403 was available on 1977 Century wagons. In 1976, the US government legalized square headlights (long commonplace in Europe), and so GM promptly added them to the midsized A-body line (the Century also gained a taller, more formal grille).|$|E
2500|$|For the 1966 Corvette, the <b>big-block</b> V-8 came in two forms: [...] on 10.25:1 compression, and 425bhp via 11:1 compression, larger intake valves, {{a bigger}} Holley four-barrel {{carburetor}} on an aluminum manifold, mechanical lifters, and four- instead of two-hole main bearing caps.

Of course, all power ratings in the sixties were also done in SAE Gross Horsepower, which is measured based on an engine without accessories or air filter or restrictive stock exhaust manifold, invariably giving a significantly higher rating than the engine actually produces when installed in the automobile. SAE Net Horsepower is measured with all accessories, air filters and factory exhaust system in place; this is the standard that all US automobile engines have been rated at since 1972. With <b>big-block</b> V-8s being the order of the day, there was less demand for the 327, so small-block offerings were cut from five to two for 1966, and only the basic 300- and 350-bhp versions were retained. Both required premium fuel on compression ratios well over 10.0:1, and they didn't have the rocket-like thrust of the 427s, but their performance was impressive all the same. As before, both could be teamed with the Powerglide automatic, the standard three-speed manual, or either four-speed option.|$|E
2500|$|Only 200 regular {{production}} 1965 Z16 Chevelles {{were built}} at the Kansas City plant. The Z16 option included the convertible boxed frame, a narrowed rear axle and brake assemblies from the contemporary Impala, heavy-duty suspension, plus virtually all Chevelle comfort and convenience options. [...] The Z16 standard <b>big-block</b> 396 Turbo-Jet V8 (fitted with hydraulic lifters instead of the solid lifters of the same motor used in the Corvette) came only with the Muncie wide-ratio four-speed manual transmission. [...] The rear panel of the Z16 had unique black and chrome trim which framed untrimmed Chevelle 300-style taillights (Malibu and Malibu SS models had bright silver-painted lens trim).|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, to {{accommodate}} regular low-lead fuel with lower anti-knock properties, the engine compression ratios were lowered {{which resulted in}} reduced power ratings. The power rating for the [...] L48 base engine decreased from 300 to 270 horsepower and the optional special high performance LT1 engine decreased from 370 to 330 horsepower. [...] The LS5 454 cu in (7.4 L) motor was carried over and produced 365hp (272kW).

Rare options: ZR1 special engine package (25), shoulder belts in convertibles (475), LT-1 engine (1,287).|$|E
2500|$|The Nova Super Sport was {{transformed}} from a trim option to a performance package for 1968. [...] One of the smallest muscle cars ever fielded by Detroit, the Nova SS now included a [...] V8 engine along with a heavy-duty suspension and other performance hardware, priced at US$312.

In a magazine article many years later, one of the drivers involved in the chase sequence remarked that the Charger [...] with a larger engine (<b>big-block</b> 440 cu. in. versus the medium-block 390 cu. in.) and greater horsepower (375 versus 325) [...] were so much faster than the Mustang that the drivers had to keep backing off the accelerator to prevent the Charger pulling away from the Mustang.|$|E
2500|$|Chevrolet {{specifications}} for 1971 included both [...] "gross" [...] and [...] "net" [...] horsepower figures for all engines. The standard Chevelle SS engine was a two-barrel 350-cubic-inch V8 rated at 245 gross (165 net) horsepower. Optional was a four-barrel carbureted {{version of the}} 350 V8 rated at 275 gross (200 net with dual exhaust and 175 net with single exhaust) horsepower. The 402 cid <b>big-block</b> engine continued to be optional as the SS 396 but was only available in one horsepower rating, 300 gross (260 net) horsepower, and was not available with cowl induction. The base LS5 454 V8 produced 365 gross and 285 net horsepower, but cowl induction was available that produced more power because of the air induction and louder exhaust system. The LS6 454 option, which was originally announced as a regular production option on the Chevelle SS for 1971, was dropped early in the model year and no official records indicate that any 1971 Chevelles were assembled with the LS6 engine.|$|E

All models also featured a revised [...] "Astro Ventilation" [...] system utilizing vents in the doorjambs that replaced the troublesome 1971 version that used vents in the trunklid and {{turned out to be a}} major source of complaints to Chevy (and other GM divisions) dealers from customers. 6-way power seats, 8-track tape players, and air conditioning were optional.|$|E
2500|$|In Canada, the post-World War II Pontiac brand sold well. General Motors of Canada {{offered a}} line of {{full-size}} Pontiac cars that were styled like U.S market models, but were actually Chevrolets under their skins. Model lineup during this period included the base Strato-Chief, mid-range Laurentian, and top-of-the-line Parisienne series. Under their exteriors, however, these cars featured Chevrolet frames, engines, and even dimensions. Interiors (except for instrument panels which were Pontiac-based) were a combination of Chevy and Pontiac styling. During the early 1960s, Pontiacs featured the controversial [...] "X" [...] frame used on the big Chevys, {{as well as the}} complete Chevy lineup of OHV straight Sixes, small-block 283 and 327 cubic inch V8s, and the <b>big-block</b> 348 and 409 V8s. This scheme was used well into the 1980s, and the Caprice-based 1984 and later Parisienne made it into U.S. Pontiac showrooms to replace the recently discontinued Bonneville. This strategy helped keep the price of the cars to a minimum, as was needed in the then less-affluent Canadian marketplace. GM of Canada was already building Chevrolets in Ontario; they only needed to stamp Pontiac-styled body skins (these were styled like, but not interchangeable with, US Pontiac body parts) and import Pontiac-specific trim from the United States, to convert these Chevys to Pontiacs. It also reduced the cost of tariffs GM would have needed to pay, had they imported U.S.-market Pontiacs Up North.|$|E

In 1977, Thunderbird outsold the Oldsmobile Cutlass to become America's top selling personal luxury sedan. It was Ford's first effort at downsizing the Thunderbird, reflecting rising demand for more fuel efficient cars. In essence, this generation was a continuation of the 1974–76 Ford Elite, Ford's first attempt at competing in the market created by the Pontiac Grand Prix and Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Compared to the previous generation Thunderbird, the new car lost nearly 8 inches of overall length at 217.7 and [...] of weight, although height and width were relatively unchanged. A substantial component of the weight reduction was in the drivetrain, where a small-block V8 replaced the heavier <b>big-block</b> V8s of previous years and proved to be an outstanding performer. The standard engine outside California was the [...] Windsor V8, while the larger [...] 351M and [...] and T-tops were available as options along with the 351W. In California, the 351 was required, and the 400 optionally available. For the first time, a wide fixed [...] "B" [...] pillar was used, reflecting Detroit's abandonment of pillarless hardtops in the mid- and late-1970s. However, the door window glass remained frameless.|$|E

The new optional Turbo Hydramatic 3-speed automatic transmission (RPO M40) replaced the two-speed Powerglide. The L30, a [...] small-block [...] V8 engine rated at [...] and a 3-speed manual transmission were standard, but only a few hundred 3-speed manual equipped cars were sold. The 4-speed manual was available in M20 wide-ratio or M21 close-ratio transmission versions. The M22 “Rock Crusher”, a heavy duty, close-ratio 4-speed gearbox, was also available for certain applications. The engine line-up included the L79, a [...] high performance version of the [...] small-block.

[...] "Stingray" [...] script nameplates appeared on front fenders, now one word, in contrast to the “Sting Ray” name used previously. Exterior door handles were redesigned so the finger plate would actuate the door, eliminating the separate release button. Backup lights were integrated into the inboard taillights, headlight washers were added, and front grilles were made all black. Side mounted exhausts and front fender vent trim were options for this year only. On the inside, revised door panels provided additional shoulder room in the C3's tighter cabin and headrests became standard. Steering wheel diameter was reduced from 16 to 15inches to permit easier entry and exit, the ignition switch was moved from the dash to the steering column, and map pockets were added to the dash area in front of the passenger seat. Accounting for 57% of the cars, coupes with their removable roof panels, began a trend of outselling roadsters. An extended production cycle due to a labor dispute increased '69 volume. This was the last year for the L88 engine and the only year for the ZL1 option, which offered an all-aluminum [...] <b>big-block</b> engine listed at [...] Rare options: ZL1 aluminum block (2), J56 heavy-duty brakes (115), L88 engine (116), L89 aluminum heads (390).|$|E
50|$|The larger engines, {{known as}} <b>big-block</b> V8s, {{were used in}} the {{full-size}} cars. Big-blocks generally had displacements in excess of 360 CID L. <b>Big-block</b> displacement reached its zenith with the 1970 Cadillac Eldorado's 500 CID L 500. During the 1970s, due to the oil crises and the gradual tightening of emission-standards, <b>big-block</b> V8s were affected and as a result their use in passenger cars decreased as manufacturers began to phase them out over more efficient designs. However, in trucks and other larger vehicles, primarily in the North American market, <b>big-block</b> V8s continue to be used until today, though some manufacturers, such as for example the Ford Motor Company took a different approach and developed V10s for use in their heavy duty commercial vehicles, such as Trucks and Vans, and/or used small-block derived designs in both diesel, e.g. Powerstroke, as well as petrol applications for improved power and efficiency. To this day <b>Big-block</b> V8s are commonly used {{in a wide variety of}} automotive racing mostly across North America, and such engines are available from many small and independent engine builders.|$|E
