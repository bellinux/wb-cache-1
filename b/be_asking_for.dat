500|$|In January 2007, Brunner {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} would allow counties to recruit poll workers by mail, who would then undertake two paid training days, and work a paid eight-hour shift at the polls on Election Day. Brunner explained the plan in an interview: [...] "In terms of Ohio and what happened in the 2004 presidential election, there has been a crisis in confidence in our election system in Ohio, both nationally and in our state. One of the quickest ways to repair that {{is to make sure that}} we have adequate numbers of poll workers. ... We suggested this as one tool that the boards of elections would have available to them for recruiting poll workers. We would be looking to do this similar to how we recruit jurors, only jurors are recruited for two weeks of service whereas we'd only <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> three days. It would also allow us to offer split shifts to poll workers. In Ohio the polling places are open for thirteen hours, so essentially a poll worker works at least fourteen hours; with the average age of our poll workers at 72, that's a tough day for anyone, no matter what their age is. ... It's an option, and we can even include a trigger, so that a county has to be deficient by a certain percentage of poll workers to even be able to use this." [...] In the initial proposal it was not yet decided what wages would be paid, and whether refusing recruitment would result in penalties. The proposal will be decided by the Ohio General Assembly.|$|E
2500|$|Right {{after the}} EOKA {{campaign}} began the British government successfully {{began to turn}} the Cyprus issue from a British colonial problem into a Greek-Turkish issue. British diplomacy exerted back-stage influence on the Adnan Menderes government, {{with the aim of}} making Turkey active in Cyprus. For the British the attempt had a twofold objective. On one hand the EOKA campaign would be silenced as quickly as possible, on the other hand Turkish Cypriots would not side with Greek Cypriots against the British colonial claims over the island and the island would remain under the British. The Turkish Cypriot leadership at the time, visited Menderes to discuss the Cyprus issue. When asked how the Turkish Cypriots should respond to the Greek Cypriot claim of [...] enosis Menderes replied: [...] "You should go to the British foreign minister and request the status quo be prolonged, Cyprus to remain as a British colony.” Later when the Turkish Cypriots visited the British minister of foreign affairs and requested that Cyprus remain a colony, the Minister replied: [...] "You should not <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> colonialism at this day and age, you should <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> Cyprus be returned to Turkey, its former owner".|$|E

A children's edition of the book, written by a third party, Laurie Friedman of Miami, titled Angel Girl, had been released in September 2008. When Lerner Books learned that the book was based on Rosenblat's falsehoods they said that they wouldn't make any reprint and that they would refund any returned copy. About 2,000 copies were sold.|$|E

She replied [...] "I'm {{going to try to}} be good but I can't help it, I have to be me." [...] A few months later, the island of Montserrat (one of the United Kingdom's few remaining overseas territories) was devastated by a volcanic eruption which rendered half the island uninhabitable; when the 4,500 islanders asked for more help from the DfID, Short was reported to have remarked [...] "they will <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> golden elephants next" [...] and refused to visit the island. This remark caused great offence to the Montserratians and others; Labour MP Bernie Grant said that [...] "She sounds like a mouthpiece for an old nineteenth century colonial and Conservative government." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the riots May urged the identification of as many as possible of the young criminals involved. She said: [...] "when I was in Manchester last week, the issue was raised to me about the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of crimes of this sort. The Crown Prosecution Service is to order prosecutors to apply for anonymity to be lifted in any youth case they think is in the public interest. The law currently protects the identity of any suspect under the age of 18, even if they are convicted, but it also allows for an application to have such restrictions lifted, if deemed appropriate." [...] May added that [...] "what I've asked for is that CPS guidance should go to prosecutors to say that where possible, they should <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of criminal activity to be lifted".|$|E

The press claimed that his change of heart was induced by a government sponsorship. On June 20, 1911, the Synod offered the parties a final chance to withdraw their accusations; both refused. The Synod also offered both bishops a chance to sign in their resignation and vacate their seats simultaneously. Prompted by Chiricescu, Safirin refused—he feared that Arion was setting a trap for him.|$|E

60|$|Dr. C. J. Romanes {{tells of}} a female {{chimpanzee}} who was taught to count straws up to five. She held the straws in her hand, exposing the ends to the number requested. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> three, she held up three. If she <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> four, she held up four. All this is a mere matter of training. But consider now, Mr. Burroughs, what follows. When she <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> five straws and she had only four, she doubled one straw, exposing both its ends and thus making up the required number. She did not do this only once, and by accident. She did it whenever more straws <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> than she possessed. Did she perform a distinctly reasoning act? or was her action the result of blind, mechanical instinct? If Mr. Burroughs cannot answer to his own satisfaction, he may call Dr. Romanes a nature-faker and dismiss the incident from his mind.|$|R

60|$|Grandcourt had {{not been}} {{altogether}} displeased by Gwendolen's running away from the splendid chance he was holding out to her. The act had some piquancy for him. He liked {{to think that it}} was due to resentment of his careless behavior in Cardell Chase, which, when he came to consider it, did appear rather cool. To have brought her so near a tender admission, and then to have walked headlong away from further opportunities of winning the consent which he had made her understand him to <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for,</b> was enough to provoke a girl of spirit; and to be worth his mastering it was proper that she should have some spirit. Doubtless she meant him to follow her, and it was what he meant too. But for a whole week he took no measures toward starting, and did not even inquire where Miss Harleth was gone. Mr. Lush felt a triumph that was mingled with much distrust; for Grandcourt had said no word to him about her, and looked as neutral as an alligator; there was no telling what might turn up in the slowly-churning chances of his mind. Still, to have put off a decision was to have made room for the waste of Grandcourt's energy.|$|E

It had been a sad, weary, tear-laden performance,--the writing of that letter. She had resolved that no sign of a tear should be on the paper, and she had rubbed the moisture away from her eyes a dozen times during the work lest it should fall. There was but little of intended pathos in it; there were no expressions of love till she told him at the end that she would always love him dearly; there was no repining,--no mention of her own misery. She used all the arguments which others had used to her, and then drew her conclusion. She remembered that were she to tell him that she would still be true to him, she would in fact <b>be</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> some such pledge back from him; and she said not a word of any such constancy on her own part. It was best for both of them that the engagement should be broken off; and, therefore, broken off it was, and should be now and for ever. That was the upshot of Mary Lowther's letter.|$|E
