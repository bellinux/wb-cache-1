Batman's train was painted red so that Robin could use it, because Robin's train was damaged during a previous incident. The Robin side re-opened on April 7 and ran until June 28 when it was closed {{for the rest of the}} year. The Batman side did not operate at all, but three of the five cars from the original Robin train were placed on Batman's maintenance track. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of the problems the coaster had and the numerous failed attempts to fix the coaster, Six Flags decided to cut their financial and technical losses and dismantle the ride.|$|E

25|$|A {{reservation}} system for people classified as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes {{has existed for}} over 50 years. The presence of privately owned free market corporations in India is limited and public sector jobs have dominated the percentage of jobs in its economy. A 2000 report estimated that most jobs in India were in companies owned by the government or agencies of the government.

25|$|This was {{a gateway}} to many foreign investors to get entry into the Indian Telecom Markets. After March 2000, the {{government}} became more liberal in making policies and issuing licences to private operators.

Nearly 32 million handsets were sold in India. The data reveals the real potential for growth of the Indian mobile market. Many private operators, such as Reliance Communications, Jio, Tata Indicom, Vodafone, Loop Mobile, Airtel, Idea etc., successfully entered the high potential Indian telecom market.|$|E

25|$|Philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), who {{regularly}} cited De la Court's works, described in his unfinished Tractatus Politicus (1677) how the ideal state, a democratic republic, should function. According to Spinoza, kings {{have a natural}} tendency to pursue their own personal interests, and entrust large portions of power to confidants (who lack any official mandate, but often de facto run the country if the king is a weakling). These confidants are often noblemen, making it an aristocracy instead of a monarchy in practice. The best monarchy is a quasi-monarchy, a crowned republic in which princes have as little power as possible. Spinoza proposes a council of state, elected by citizens, to take the most important decisions, and replace the murderous and pillaging royal mercenary armies by an unpaid draft army of citizens that defends its own country for self-preservation. If this council of state is large and representative enough, {{there will never be}} a majority in favour of war, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the suffering, destruction and high taxes it will cause.|$|E
