25|$|The Energy Factor – In this usage {{the word}} energy has several connotations. It {{refers to the}} total {{response}} {{of the body to}} the making of sound. It refers to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism. It also refers to the amount of <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance that pressure, and it refers to the dynamic level of the sound.|$|E
25|$|Phonation is {{the process}} of {{producing}} vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract. It takes place in the larynx when the vocal folds are brought together and <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied to them {{in such a way that}} vibration ensues causing an audible source of acoustic energy, i.e., sound, which can then be modified by the articulatory actions of the rest of the vocal apparatus. The vocal folds are brought together primarily by the action of the interarytenoid muscles, which pull the arytenoid cartilages together.|$|E

50|$|When played, the kaval is {{held with}} both hands at an angle of {{approximately}} 45° from the body, with the four fingers of the one hand covering the lower holes; the upper three holes and the thumbhole are covered with the other hand. The mouth covers ~¾ of the end. Change of the <b>breath</b> air <b>pressure</b> also changes the pitch.|$|R
2500|$|Vibrato: Vibrato can be {{achieved}} on most notes by opening and closing one of the open holes, or by variation of <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> (this last is actually both vibrato (pitch modulation), and tremolo (amplitude modulation)). Of the two, fingered (i.e., true) vibrato is much more common than diaphragmatic (breath) vibrato (i.e., tremolo), except on notes like the lowest note on the whistle where fingered vibrato is much more difficult. [...] A common method of achieving vibrato is to finger a note, and then quickly flick a finger on and off, not the hole below the fingered note, but the hole two below the fingered note, leaving an open hole in between. [...] This technique can be heard on The Chieftains' iconic air, Women of Ireland (Chieftains IV).|$|E
50|$|The Digital Horn transmits initial <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> as MIDI note-on velocity, {{subsequent}} <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> {{changes during}} a sustained note as channel after-touch, and portamento on/off as CC 65 with values of 0 and 127.|$|E
50|$|Both {{fingers and}} the breath can both {{be used to}} control the pitch of the recorder. Coordinating the two is {{essential}} to playing the recorder in tune and {{with a variety of}} dynamics and timbres. On an elementary level, <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> and fingerings must accord with each other to provide a pitch which is well in tune. As an example of a more advanced form of coordination, a gradual increase in <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> combined with the shading of holes, when properly coordinated, results in an increase in volume and change in tone color without a change in pitch. The reverse is possible, decreasing <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> and gradually lifting fingers.|$|E
50|$|Transpulmonary {{pressure}} {{can be measured}} by placing pressure transducers. The alveolar pressure is estimated by measuring the pressure in the airways while holding one's <b>breath.</b> The intrapleural <b>pressure</b> is estimated by measuring the pressure inside a balloon placed in the esophagus.|$|R
50|$|The WX5 wind {{controller}} simulates a {{wind instrument}} {{because of the}} way it is played, the key layout, and because it responds to <b>breath</b> (wind) <b>pressure</b> as well as lip pressure on a simulated reed mouthpiece similar to that of a saxophone or clarinet. The wind and lip pressure information is converted to MIDI data which is interpreted by the external sound module. Usually the wind pressure is interpreted as loudness and lip pressure is interpreted as pitch bend; thus, the instrument responds much like an acoustic wind instrument and extremely realistic musical phrasing is available to the player.|$|R
40|$|We studied several {{relevant}} biological {{aspects of}} breath-alcohol, analysis in 55 healthy men and women, after alcohol ingestion and during breath-alcohol analysis with a typical 4 th-generation instru-ment.

5000|$|Oversinging has two meanings. One is a {{technical}} understanding, where oversinging {{is understood as}} [...] "pushing the voice", and [...] "is when a singer pushes too much <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> through the larynx", which is known as overblowing of the vocal folds. The result is over-production of sound.|$|E
50|$|The {{pitch and}} {{volume of the}} {{recorder}} sound {{is influenced by the}} speed of the air travelling through the windway, which may be controlled by varying the <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> and the shape of the vocal tract. The sound is also affected by the turbulence of the air entering the recorder. Generally speaking, faster air in the windway will produce a higher pitch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{energy factor}} - [...] "energy" [...] has several connotations. It {{refers to the}} total {{response}} {{of the body to}} the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.|$|E
50|$|The {{first few}} breaths are {{delivered}} to the patient according to the ventilator manufacturer's particular algorithm for determining the patient's resistance and compliance. These are 'test breaths' that the ventilator can then use to calculate the optimal pressures for the next, regulated <b>breaths.</b> The <b>pressure</b> is constant during the set inspiratory time as with pressure-controlled CMV. The ventilator will use the exhaled tidal volume measured {{at the end of}} that breath's expiratory phase to calculate the pressure of the next breath. If the exhaled tidal volume is lower than the software threshold, the next breath will be delivered at a higher pressure, and if the exhaled tidal volume is higher than the software threshold, the next breath will be delivered at a lower pressure.|$|R
25|$|Breaths are {{classified}} as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous breath is a breath for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory <b>breath</b> (e.g. Airway <b>Pressure</b> Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath is, by definition, assisted.|$|R
50|$|These events {{occurred}} {{within minutes of}} administration of NeutroSpec and included shortness of <b>breath,</b> low blood <b>pressure,</b> and cardiopulmonary arrest. Affected patients required resuscitation with intravenous fluids, blood pressure support, and oxygen. Most, but not all, of the patients who experienced these events had existing cardiac and/or pulmonary conditions that may have placed them at higher risk for these adverse events. A review of all post-marketing reports showed an additional 46 patients who experienced adverse events that were similar but less severe. All of the reactions occurred immediately after NeutroSpec was administered.|$|R

Inflating a balloon via the mouth {{is difficult and}} can be dangerous. Particularly well-trained and talented twisters, however, can blow-up several balloons at once, and some can even blow up 160s, which are {{much more difficult to}} mouth-inflate than the more common 260s, as their narrowness requires a great deal more strength and <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> to inflate.|$|E
5000|$|Even with a {{high-quality}} digital sampler, the resulting sounds will not contain the complex nuances {{of a live}} orchestral performer. To obtain more authentic articulations and nuances from sampled or synthesized brass or woodwind sounds, these sounds can be performed using MIDI wind controllers rather than piano-style keyboards. Wind controllers can sense a musicians' embouchure, <b>breath</b> <b>pressure,</b> and other factors, and then this input can be [...] "translated" [...] by the synthesizer into the nuances that are expected in a traditional woodwind or brass instrument.|$|E
30|$|Recent {{advances}} in ultra-low power sensors have fostered {{the research in}} the field of body-centric networks, also referred to as body area networks (BANs) [1 – 4]. In these networks, a set of nodes (called sensors) is deployed on the human body. They aim at monitoring and reporting several physiological values, such as blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>breath</b> rate, skin temperature, or heart beating rate. Most of the time, sensing is performed at low rates but, in emergency situations, the network load may increase in seconds. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of the network outage, throughput, and achievable transmission rate can give insights on the maximum supported reporting rate and the corresponding performance.|$|R
50|$|Accompanied by <b>breath</b> under lung <b>pressure,</b> the glottis {{and vocal}} folds move in an open-close motion. During {{the opening and}} closing, {{the process by which}} the vocal cords meet is {{referred}} to as phonation (non-technically called vocalization), which is the general function of how vocal sound is produced. During phonation, vibratory cycles occur all too quickly for the unaided eye to observe. Therefore, if there lies a problem within someone's phonation cycle, it cannot be examined or diagnosed without the aid of technology like videostroboscopy or videokymography. The imaging of vocal fold vibrations is done by inserting an endoscope through the mouth in order to view the vocal folds from the top.|$|R

50|$|The myoelastic theory {{states that}} when the vocal cords are brought {{together}} and <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied to them, the cords remain closed until the pressure beneath them—the subglottic pressure—is sufficient to push them apart, allowing air to escape and reducing the pressure enough for the muscle tension recoil to pull the folds back together again. Pressure builds up once again until the cords are pushed apart, and the whole cycle keeps repeating itself. The {{rate at which the}} cords open and close—the number of cycles per second—determines the pitch of the phonation.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: High-intensity noninvasive {{ventilation}} (NIV) {{has been}} shown to improve outcomes in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. However, there is insufficient knowledge about whether with this more controlled ventilatory mode optimal respiratory muscle unloading is provided without an increase in patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA). Patients and methods: Ten chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients on home mechanical ventilation were included. Four different ventilatory settings were investigated in each patient in random order, each for 15 min, varying the inspiratory positive airway pressure and backup breathing frequency. With surface electromyography (EMG), activities of the intercostal muscles, diaphragm, and scalene muscles were determined. Furthermore, pressure tracings were derived simultaneously in order to assess PVA. Results: Compared to spontaneous breathing, the most pronounced decrease in EMG activity was achieved with the high-pressure settings. Adding a high breathing frequency did reduce EMG activity per breath, while the decrease in EMG activity over 1 min was comparable with the high-pressure, low-frequency setting. With high backup breathing frequencies less <b>breaths</b> were <b>pressure</b> supported (25 % vs 97 %). PVAs occurred more frequently with the low-frequency settings (P= 0. 017). Conclusion: High-intensity NIV might provide optimal unloading of respiratory muscles, without undue increases in PVA...|$|R
30|$|Pressure {{support is}} a {{spontaneous}} mode of ventilation where the patient breathes spontaneously and the ventilator supports the breathing with a preset pressure value for every <b>breath.</b> Decremented <b>pressure</b> support ventilation {{is the standard}} mode of weaning in our unit. Extubation at pressure support up to 10  cmH 2 O is an acceptable practice in our unit and a spontaneous breathing trial using T-tube is not mandated for weaning [16 – 20]. The criteria for eligibility for the weaning trial included resolution or improvement in the disease that led to commencement of mechanical ventilation; FiO 2 ≤[*] 30 %; pressure support ≤[*] 10 cmH 2 O; PEEP ≤[*] 5 cmH 2 O; tidal volume ≥[*] 5  ml/kg; respiratory rate <[*] 35 breaths/min; requirement of low inotropic or vasopressor support; light level of sedation (Richmond Agitation Sedation Score between −[*] 2 and +[*] 2) [21]; ability to cough; and absence of excessive bronchial secretions. The weaning trial comprised 60  min of pressure support of 0 or ≤[*] 10  cmH 2 O if required, to achieve a respiratory rate <[*] 35 breaths/min and a tidal volume of ≥[*] 5  ml/kg [16].

5000|$|Other {{vascular}} origins {{remain a}} possibility, however, {{according to research}} of jugular vein valve insufficiency in patients with TGA. In these cases TGA has followed vigorous exertion.

[...] It has been shown that performing a Valsalva maneuver (involving [...] "bearing down" [...] and increasing <b>breath</b> <b>pressure</b> against a closed glottis, which occurs frequently during exertion) may be related to retrograde flow of blood in the jugular vein, and therefore, presumably, cerebral blood circulation, in patients with TGA.|$|E

Another study found that the magnitude of increase in intraocular pressure correlates with the intraoral resistance associated with the instrument, and linked intermittent elevation of intraocular pressure from playing high-resistance wind instruments to incidence of visual field loss.

2500|$|Lung {{over-pressure}} {{injury in}} ambient pressure divers using underwater breathing apparatus is usually caused by breath-holding on ascent. The compressed {{gas in the}} lungs expands as the ambient pressure decreases causing the lungs to over-expand and rupture unless the diver allows the gas to escape by maintaining an open airway, as in normal breathing. The lungs do not sense pain when over-expanded giving the diver little warning to prevent the injury. [...] This does not affect breath-hold divers as they bring a lungful of air with them from the surface, which merely re-expands safely to near its original volume on ascent. The problem only arises if a <b>breath</b> of ambient <b>pressure</b> gas is taken at depth, which may then expand on ascent to more than the lung volume. [...] Pulmonary barotrauma may also be caused by explosive decompression of a pressurised aircraft.|$|R
30|$|The {{results from}} this study raise some very {{interesting}} and exciting concepts dealing with how the parameters of the mechanical <b>breath</b> (i.e., airway <b>pressures,</b> volumes, flows, and rates) injure or protect lung tissue and may help to elucidate the mechanisms of VILI. In addition, the impact of these breath parameters are analyzed as the stress delivered to the lung, and the response of the lung to this applied stress is measured as a strain. The study shows that if the stress is sufficient to exceed the inspiratory capacity of the lung, then stress failure occurs (i.e., pneumothorax); thus, in ventilation within this anatomical threshold of the lung, the main mechanism of VILI is dynamic strain. The unifying explanation is that the trigger for VILI is an excessive energy/power load, which encompasses all of the mechanical breath parameters.|$|R
