5|$|Keswick {{became a}} Local Government District in 1853 and an urban {{district}} with three wards in 1894, reflecting its {{growth in the}} latter part of the 19th century. The new urban district's northern boundary was extended from the Greta to the railway, taking in Great Crosthwaite and part of Underskiddaw in 1899. In 1974 the urban district was abolished and since then the town has been administered by Keswick Town Council and Allerdale Borough Council. Since 2010 Keswick has been in the Copeland parliamentary constituency, having previously been part of Workington and before that Penrith and The Border. The electoral ward of Keswick stretches <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the parish boundary and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 5,243.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the first}} ten years of the society's existence, the {{organization}} grew in membership and held meetings {{at least twice a}} month, and usually four times a month. The society debated an extensive range of subjects including scientific, religious, political, and social topics, often violating the constitution's rules banning religious and political subjects. The society's debates were often acrimonious and regularly spilled <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> the meetings and into the community. Between January 30, 1819 and January 22, 1830, the society's membership rolls reached 52 members; although as few as 15 members attended the bimonthly meetings, and no more than 17 members were ever present at a meeting.|$|E
5|$|The {{anamorphic}} form of P.semilanceata is an asexual {{stage in}} the fungus's life cycle involved {{in the development of}} mitotic diaspores (conidia). In culture, grown in a petri dish, the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt-like mat of mycelia. The conidia formed are straight to curved, measuring 2.0–8.0 by 1.1–2.0μm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of P.semilanceata <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi.|$|E
5|$|While {{the last}} three Fire Emblem titles had used a similar setting, with Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem both being set on the {{continent}} of Archanea, Kaga wanted to create something new for his next title. This was for two reasons: he wanted to move <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>confines</b> <b>of</b> Archanea, and also wanted to try his hand at a large-scale historical drama. Similar to other Fire Emblem titles, the setting drew inspiration from Medieval Europe. The story's inspiration changed, drawing from Norse and Celtic mythology {{as opposed to the}} elements from Classical mythology used by earlier titles. Similar to Mystery of the Emblem, the story was split into two halves, with the first half acting as an introduction for Seliph's quest. The story's main theme was how the stupidity of humans could forge history. The focus shifted away from the characters to the overall world of Jugdral, intended to show the scale of the conflict and make it seem like history in the making. While the backstory of Jugdral featured a clearly defined battle between good and evil, the main story's distinction between good and evil was blurred, exemplified by the descendants of the Twelve Crusaders being on opposing sides rather than united. A stated example was Alvis, whose conquests were driven by a wish to end discrimination against Loptyr descendants. Due to this, Kaga did not create a storyline focused on poetic justice and morality, instead aiming for a more realistic scenario. This realism also prompted the inclusion of elements such as patricide and incest, which had occurred in history but were not typically included in gaming narratives at the time. The story originally had three acts rather than two. The missing act would have covered the period {{between the first and second}} act, which put a more overt focus on the themes of patricide and incest. Due to time constraints, this third act needed to be cut. In a later interview, Kaga felt that the focus on narrative weakened the gameplay.|$|E
40|$|Most Apicomplexa reside and {{multiply}} in the cytoplasm of their host cell, within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) originating from both parasite and host cell components. Trafficking of parasite-encoded proteins destined to membrane compartments <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>confine</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parasite plasma membrane {{is a process}} that offers a rich territory to explore novel mechanisms of protein-membrane interactions. Here, we focus on the PVs formed by the asexual stages of two pathogens of medical importance, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma. We compare the PVs of both parasites, with a particular emphasis on their evolutionary divergent compartmentalization within the host cell. We also discuss the existence of peculiar export mechanisms and/or sorting determinants that are potentially involved in the post-secretory targeting of parasite proteins to the PV subcompartments...|$|R
40|$|Long {{distance}} reordering {{remains one}} of the greatest challenges in statistical machine translation research as the key contextual information may well be <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>confine</b> <b>of</b> translation units. In this paper, we propose Two-Neighbor Orientation (TNO) model that jointly models the orientation decisions between anchors and two neighboring multi-unit chunks which may cross phrase or rule boundaries. We explicitly model the longest span of such chunks, referred to as Maximal Orientation Span, to serve as a global parameter that constrains underlying local decisions. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art string-to-dependency translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. On NIST MT 08 set, our most advanced model brings around + 2. 0 BLEU and- 1. 0 TER improvement...|$|R

40|$|Reordering poses {{one of the}} {{greatest}} chal-lenges in Statistical Machine Translation re-search as the key contextual information may well be <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>confine</b> <b>of</b> translation units. We present the “Anchor Graph ” (AG) model where we use a graph structure to model global contextual information that is crucial for reordering. The key ingredient of our AG model is the edges that capture the relation-ship between the reordering around a set of selected translation units, which we refer to as anchors. As the edges link anchors that may span multiple translation units at decoding time, our AG model effectively encodes global contextual information that is previously ab-sent. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art translation system and demon-strate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. ...|$|R
