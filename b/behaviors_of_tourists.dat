On the other hand, tourism may increase recognition of the importance of respecting cultural diversity and developing an identity as a world citizen. Consumer can play a major role in the transformation of societies towards sustainability. Tourism is heterogeneous in nature, made up of many different types of traveler, seeking a wide range of tourism products. Tourist demand depends on the availability of time and money, on images, perceptions and attitudes. Tourists want experiences not places.

Little information {{as well as a}} flood can be disorienting and forces many tourists to join the majority visiting major sights. This causes a few crowded places in contrast to many under-utilized. A Destination Management Organization (DMO) has the goal to spread the tourists more evenly, whereas the tourists would like to enjoy the destination to its full potential according to their personal interests. The target of the Dynamic Tour Guide (DTG) is supporting both goals by means of pervasive computing based on the actual context which is defined by personal interests, location and schedule <b>of</b> a <b>tourist.</b> It enables a personalized, spontaneous and guided tour. A field trial was conducted in the summer of 2005 to study the following questions as a precondition for the development: (1) Is it possible to seed generic interest profiles in the mobile context that allow the accurate prediction of actual rankings?

40|$|Abstract—The {{study of}} tourist {{activities}} and the mapping of their routes {{in space and time}} has become an important issue in tourism management. Here we represent space-time paths for the tourism industry by visualizing individual tourist {{activities and the}} paths followed using a 3 D Geographic Information System (GIS). Considerable attention has been devoted to the measurement of accessibility to shopping, eating, walking and other services at the tourist destination. I turns out that GIS is a useful tool for studying the spatial <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourists</b> in the area. The value of GIS is especially advantageous for space-time potential path area measures, especially for the accurate visualization of possible paths through existing city road networks. This study seeks to apply space-time concepts with a detailed street network map obtained from Google Maps to measure tourist paths both spatially and temporally. These paths are further determined based on data obtained from map questionnaires regarding the trip activities of 40 individuals. The analysis of the data makes it possible to determining the locations of the more popular paths. The results can be visualized using 3 D GIS to show the areas and potential activity opportunities accessible to tourists during their travel time.

Yet, it remains unclear what constitutes good quality management. We explored whether rates of macaque aggression and stress levels differed under supervision of different park rangers at Valley of the Wild Monkeys (VWM) in Anhui Province, China. We hypothesized that lower levels of macaque aggression and self-directed behaviors (SDBs) would be observed if park rangers enforced park rules. <b>Behaviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourists,</b> park rangers, and monkeys were collected from August 16 to September 30, 2012. Rates of macaque aggression and SDBs were compared across different park rangers. At VWM, two pairs of park rangers interchangeably provisioned a group of macaques on a monthly basis. Our results showed that rates of monkey aggression and stress-related behaviors {{did not differ significantly}} among different park ranger conditions. We compared the first and second week rates of macaque aggression and stress-related behaviors post-alternation of park rangers for August and September. Our results showed that rates of aggression were not significantly different during two weeks post-alteration for both August and September, but rates of SDBs were significantly different between first and second weeks in August. Park rangers restricted tourists from interacting with the monkeys on only 8 out of 81 (9. 9 percent) visiting sessions, which suggests that rangers’ interventions during tourist interactions with macaques occurred infrequently at VWM...|$|E

40|$|Compared {{with local}} shoppers, tourist shoppers have very {{different}} shopping behaviors and preferences, which in turn influence the location selection decisions of retailers and the pricing of retail spaces. The implementation of "Individual Visit Scheme" (IVS) policy since July, 2003 which allows Mainland Chinese tourists to visit Hong Kong {{on an individual basis}} has significantly increased the proportion of tourist shoppers. This policy provides us with an invaluable opportunity to examine how changes in tourist-local shopper mix affect the pricing of retail spaces in Hong Kong. There have been very few empirical studies on the pricing of street level retail shops (or "shops") due to lack of transaction data and difficulties in identifying and measuring price-influencing location attributes of shops. Shops in Hong Kong have been more actively transacted compared to most markets around the world, which helps to solve the data availability problem. In this study, transactions of the shops in Causeway Bay, a major shopping area for both local and tourist shoppers in Hong Kong, during the period 1993 to 2011 has been used for empirical analysis. The difficulty of modeling the unknown location attributes of shops is tackled with use of spatial auto-regressive modeling techniques. The significances of this study are threefold. First, we find that the shopping <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourists</b> are influenced by their hometown shopping experiences. This is evidenced by the reversal of the impact of building age on shop’s transaction price after the implementation of IVS policy. Before this policy, when local shoppers were the majority, the effect of age on shop prices was positive as it captures some of the preferential location attributes of shops that were well known to local shoppers. When the proportion of Mainland Chinese tourist shoppers increased after the implementation of IVS, the impact of age on shop prices becomes negative as their hometown experiences suggest that new shops provide better shopping environment and are more preferred than old ones. The second contribution is to show how tourist shopper’s shopping behaviors are affected by the cost of stay. Compared with local shoppers, tourist shoppers have a much higher cost of stay. Shop location attributes that can reduce the shopper’s idle time (e. g. travelling and shopping around time) would be more valuable to tourist shoppers than local shoppers. This implies that the proximity to Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station and the accommodation facilities around the retail units are preferred by tourist shoppers. Empirical evidence shows that the value of proximity to MTR station has increased significantly after the implementation of IVS, which is consistent with the prediction from tourist shoppers’ high cost of stay. Finally, the third contribution of this study is improvement of empirical analysis method. A major problem in analyzing shop prices is the difficulty in measuring and modeling the specific price-influencing location factors, which give rise to misspecification of the hedonic price model. This study resolves this problem by adopting spatial econometric models. Our empirical results also show strong evidence of spatial auto-correlation in shop prices. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Intensification <b>of</b> <b>tourist</b> travel will naturally generate an increase of the negative environmental impacts and, in the long term, a decline in tourism development opportunities. In this context, more and more emphasis is placed on finding and promoting low environmental impact forms of travel, including eco-tourism, rural tourism, tourism in protected areas, cultural tourism, adventure tourism, etc., at the same time on encouraging, inciting potential tourists to consume these categories of products (holidays). Globally conducted studies have revealed a good understanding of and an increasing receptivity to sustainable forms <b>of</b> travel among <b>tourists.</b> Nevertheless, the place they hold in the structure <b>of</b> <b>tourist</b> circulation is still modest, mainly due to the insufficient supply, in its turn determined by ignorance of the demand and by the additional requirements the consumer of such holidays has to meet, especially in regard to behavior.

Mo- bile marketing companies already use Bluetooth for advertisement, but {{little is known about}} the user behavior and acceptance. This paper presents a study on user behavior, focused on tourists. The study is based on data which we collected with the help of a location- based information system. Bluetooth access points close to tourist attractions in the city of Koblenz provide pedestrians with information about tourist spots. These access points gather a lot of data, for example: which devices were found, how often and where these were found and whether the pedestrians received the offered messages. We started analyzing the data and got facts about the <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourists</b> in general, the number of visits and recurrence and the duration of staying...|$|R
