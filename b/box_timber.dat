40|$|Code on timber design CBS 5268 Part 2, 1991) {{gives no}} {{provisions}} {{for the design}} of layered braced and <b>box</b> <b>timber</b> columns except spaced timber columns. Very little information is available about these in the literature on timber structures. This paper provides procedure for determining the axial load capacity of mechanically connected built-up columns, such as layered columns, spaced columns, braced columns and box columns. In addition to that, it gives information about nail connection details and arrangement. Mainly concentrated on built-up timber columns made up with mechanical connection as it could be done locally. The theoretical development takes into account the effect of columns stability and effectiveness of the shear transfer. The experimental results obtained by under graduate students are compared with theoretical predictions. Conclusions are drawn with regards to the suitability of the design methods for built up timber columns made by nailed connections...|$|E

50|$|A {{date stone}} {{suggests}} that Norwell's tower windmill, in Main Street, {{was built in}} 1852. It is a five-storey brick tower, standing 43' (13.5m) high to the curb, with Yorkshire sliding windows. The cap was a typical ogee shape and probably originally covered in iron plates. There were three pairs of millstones on the first floor, overdriven by a wooden upright shaft in wooden bearings. The stones could be disengaged by means of elm glut <b>boxes</b> (glut <b>box</b> <b>timbers</b> have a slot cut in them to allow {{the top of the}} quant (the vertical shaft) to be removed, enabling the stone nuts (pinions), and hence the millstone to be disengaged from the great spur wheel).|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of combining small dimension timber with timber webs of suitable thickness {{has been demonstrated}} by of this experimental investigation on nailed built up <b>timber</b> <b>box</b> beams of different cross sectional profiles in which the flanges and webs are entirely of timber. No literature was available on such <b>timber</b> <b>box</b> beam construction. The effect of web thickness, overall depth, and shape of flange on the load carrying capacity and flexural rigidity of <b>timber</b> <b>box</b> beams were investigated. Timber beams consisting of webs of 25 mm thickness and overall depth of 225 mm were shown {{to be the most}} cost effective. The profile of the flange {{does not appear to have}} a significant effect on either the load carrying capacity or flexural rigidity. No attempt wa<i made to model the nail deformation on either the load capacity or the flexural rigidity. Rather, analytical studies showed that the load capacity of the 225 mm deep built-up all <b>timber</b> <b>box</b> beams are approximately 30 % and their flexural rigidity is in the range of 25 % to 40 % that of an integral hollow timber section of identical dimensions. Thus at first glance, the advantage of built up beams of these dimensions may seem questionable. However, considering the fact that integral hollow sections of these dimensions are not available and that there is value addition to the small dimension timber sections whose capacity in bending as solid timber sections acting alone is very small, the all <b>timber</b> built up <b>box</b> beams have immense potential...|$|R

When the ice melted in the spring these structures sank into the sand, and formed a stable and solid foundation on which he could afterward build at pleasure.

From green to approximately 15 % moisture content, the drying times including HT-LH treatment were 170 h for the nonkerfed control, 190 h for the kerfed control, and 150 h for both the kerfed and nonkerfed HT-LH specimens. Surface checks were effectively prevented by the HT-LH treatment while the kerfed HT-LH specimens were free from surface checks. In order to prevent the formation of internal checking during RF/V drying, {{it is suggested that}} HT-LH treatment should finish around the fiber saturation point.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} on nailed {{built up}} <b>timber</b> <b>box</b> beams of different cross sectional profiles {{in which the}} flanges and webs are both entirely of timber are carried out {{with the objective of}} understanding the behaviour of the different nailed built up beam configurations and identify their potential {{as an alternative to the}} use of solid timber beams. In particular the effect of web thickness, overall depth and shape of flange on the load carrying capacity and flexural rigidity of <b>timber</b> <b>box</b> beams are investigated. Timber beams consisting of webs of 25 mm thickness and overall depth of 225 mm are the most cost effective. The profile of the flange does not have a significant effect on either the load carrying capacity or flexural rigidity. It is observed that flexural rigidity and load capacity are better correlated with the second moment of area and section modulus of only the webs of the box beam rather than that of the entire box beam.

40|$|Intensive import/export {{quarantine}} {{operations were}} commenced in 1948 by the Forest Service with costs being {{met by the}} taxpayers. The first Regulations came in 1956 and contained a simple schedule of fees. These were extended in 1966 but still covered only sawn <b>timber,</b> <b>box</b> snooks, and <b>timber</b> in round form. In 1986 the Government decided that, under its "user-pays " policy, net funding for forestry services (including quarantine) would be reduced to zero over 5 years. New fee schedules were introduced in 1987 by the Ministry of Forestry. There was client resistance to paying for regulatory quarantine inspections. Some "national good " content was recognised by the Government. The impact of user-pays may initially have had some detrimental effect on import inspection effectiveness. Some countries do not need phytosanitary certificates for exports. Inspections ceased for these destinations and exporter costs were consequently reduced. At entry ports in Japan and Korea fumigation or some other form of sterilisation is automatically carried out. On the other hand, forest produce exported to Australia must meet very precise quarantine inspection standards, and some other countries demand a phytosanitary certificate based on the International Plant Protection Convention format. The introduction of user-pays also had an initial impact on forest health surveys. The Government may reorganise border control services...|$|R

Five sections were cut across the various ramparts and three area excavations were opened. This was following the most recent excavation practices developed by Mortimer Wheeler for his excavations at the hillfort at Maiden Castle in Dorset. O’Neill was able to define the earliest phase of the hillfort as smaller enclosure measuring 170 m by 80 m (1.2 hectares), with a gateway to the south, and defended with two rows of timber palisading. This enclosure stands on the highest area {{of the hill and}} contains a small mound which may have been a Bronze Age round barrow. Under the southern gate of this enclosure evidence for earlier Neolithic occupation was found. This enclosure was then modified by a <b>box</b> framed <b>timber</b> rampart, with an extension to the north-west and a barbican added to the south gateway.
