40|$|To date, most export {{performance}} {{studies have focused}} on providing business practitioners with set 'prescriptions' for export success. However, this approach has resulted in overwhelmingly inconsistent findings, so {{there is a need for}} alternative approaches. One alternative is through contingency theory, which posits that each firm's {{export performance}} is dependent on the context in which the firm operates. This study therefore uses contingency theory to establish if there is a relationship between export performance and the level of 'fit' between a firm's strategic orientation and its context. This study focused on exporting firms in the apparel industry in New Zealand. Firms were categorised as to whether they were entrepreneurial or conservative in their strategic orientation. The results showed that entrepreneurial firms could operate successfully in hostile or <b>benign</b> <b>external</b> <b>environments,</b> by using either organic or mechanistic export channel structures. But when entrepreneurial and conservative firms have a strategic orientation and channel structure that matches their <b>external</b> <b>environment</b> then there are no real performance advantages for entrepreneurial firms.

40|$|We examine 45 {{existing}} {{case studies}} of firms with strong corporate environmental performance (CEP) to empirically identify four organizational configurations for successful sustainability. These four configurations represent different combinations of variables describing a firm’s <b>external</b> <b>environment,</b> organizational structure, and its strategy-related activities. More specifically, these configurations vary in having a <b>benign</b> or challenging <b>external</b> <b>environment,</b> a mechanistic or organic structure, a low-cost or differentiation strategy, hands-on or hands-off participation by the top-management-team, high or low consideration given to stakeholders, and a short or long-term time orientation. Taken together the four organizational configurations introduce an understanding of equifinality for achieving CEP. In other words, given an adequate variety of ingredients, there are multiple recipes for successful sustainability. Implications fo...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} Indonesia’s relations with the United States and China, with a particular focus on security-related ties. Executive summary A country on the rise, Indonesia upholds a flexible foreign policy that allows it to productively engage with both the United States and China. Indonesian strategic thinking {{is dominated by the}} rise of China, the response to that rise, and how the rise will affect regional security architecture. Though Indonesia shares, and has historically shared, positive ties with the United States, Indonesia will avoid entering into an alliance and will continue to enmesh with both the United States and China. Indonesia places great importance on strong regional infrastructure, with ASEAN at the core, to maintain regional stability and to facilitate cooperation. By cementing regional institutions, Indonesia hopes to “engage and constrain” both China and the United States, especially in the face of increased Chinese assertiveness from 2010 onwards.   In a recent visit to the United States, Joko Widodo and Barack Obama committed to establishing a Strategic Partnership as well as an annual ministerial strategic dialogue — the next steps in the positive relationship between these two countries. Members of the Indonesian foreign policy community mostly view the United States as a fundamentally benign and trustworthy power, whereas Sino–Indonesian ties are tethered by an inherent wariness of Chinese intentions. Indonesia will continue to enjoy its middle-power status and largely <b>benign</b> <b>external</b> strategic <b>environment.</b> Time will tell if the changing South-East Asian security environment will deliver Indonesia, as Jokowi describes, “big country” status. Key points: 	Indonesia maintains a strong commitment to the foundational principle that the country should adopt a “free and active” foreign policy. This commitment means that Indonesia will not enter into a formal alliance, but will actively pursue enhanced bilateral ties with both the United States and China. 	Since independence, Indonesia has maintained a relatively cooperative and mutually supportive relationship with the United States. The current security partnership is limited by Indonesia’s current operating and strategic capacities, and a desire to maintain a diverse range of cooperative relationships. 	Indonesia’s relationship with China has been subject to sharp shifts, and while Indonesia seeks to benefit from closer economic relations with an economically rising China, the rise also underscores a persistent wariness in Indonesia that is likely to remain a limiting factor in the bilateral relationship...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{sustainability}} {{of a firm}} mainly depends on whether the firm has an effective strategy to align its internal operations with changes in the <b>external</b> <b>environment.</b> This paper introduces the KM model, which is a framework that guides a comprehensive and systematic strategic analysis of a firm. This article focused on using the KM model to examine a firm’s <b>external</b> <b>environment</b> systematically. The KM model divides a firm’s <b>external</b> <b>environment</b> into four interdependent and strategically relevant layers. By understanding the changes and trends in each layer {{as well as the}} interactive relationships across these layers, companies could identify the emerging needs and trends in the <b>external</b> <b>environment.</b> The model facilitates an orderly and effective way to identify gaps between a firm’s internal operations and changes in its <b>external</b> <b>environment.</b> The KM model provides a platform for incorporating most existing strategic analysis tools to obtain a comprehensive view of a firm’s <b>external</b> <b>environment,</b> and supports companies to set their global strategic positions accordingly...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a case study which explores the use of {{qualitative}} accounting information to measure business confidence in the <b>external</b> <b>environment</b> in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe experienced a very difficult <b>external</b> <b>environment</b> between the years of 2000 and 2008, characterized by social tension, political strife, and economic instability heightened by record hyperinflation and commodity shortages. However Zimbabwe’s <b>external</b> <b>environment</b> dramatically changed in 2009 when a multicurrency system was introduced and the local currency was abandoned together with all manner of price and foreign currency controls which had created commodity shortages. From qualitative accounting information contained in the financial reports of Delta Corporation Limited Zimbabwe, this paper compiled a record of business confidence in the <b>external</b> <b>environment</b> in Zimbabwe {{from the time of}} introduction of the multicurrency system one year post the general elections held on 31 March 2013. It was found that in the absence of hyperinflation and commodity shortages such as experienced {{at the peak of the}} economic meltdown in Zimbabwe in 2008, business confidence in the <b>external</b> <b>environment</b> in Zimbabwe may depend on how well a company was performing as opposed to the broader social-political-economic mix of factors in the <b>external</b> <b>environment.</b> The qualitative accounting information methodology of measuring business confidence was found to be a likely more accurate measure of perception of the business environment in Zimbabwe than the questionnaire methodology employed by various surveys conducted in Zimbabwe...|$|R
