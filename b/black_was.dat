5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black had helped to {{apprehend}} twenty years before. Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. <b>Black</b> <b>was</b> {{one of a number}} of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location — however, the tip was called in by Hance himself and the raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and <b>Black</b> <b>was</b> cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young <b>Black</b> <b>was</b> able to overpower and arrest him.|$|E

5|$|On August 12, 1937, Roosevelt {{nominated}} Black to {{fill the}} vacancy. By tradition, a senator nominated for an executive or judicial office was confirmed immediately and without debate. However, when <b>Black</b> <b>was</b> nominated, the Senate departed from this tradition {{for the first time}} since 1853; instead of confirming him immediately, it referred the nomination to the Judiciary Committee. <b>Black</b> <b>was</b> criticized for his presumed bigotry, his cultural roots, and his Klan membership, when that became public.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Black</b> pigment <b>is</b> an {{important}} pigment in the ceramic decoration. The traditional <b>black</b> pigment <b>is</b> spinel type matter containing Co, Fe or Cr elements. Carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> the best <b>black</b> pigment and <b>is</b> nontoxic. However, carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> oxygenated in the ceramic sintering process at atmosphere. Carbon black enclosed in the crystal latter of ZrSiO 4 was reported. However, {{the content of}} carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> little which decreases the color generation. Carbon black coated with SiO 2 was prepared by sol-gel method using combustion method using SiO 2 sol and black ink as raw materials. The obtained <b>black</b> pigment <b>was</b> characterized by XRD, TEM and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The {{results show that the}} black pigment does not change its color after calcinations at 1300 °C at atmosphere implying the carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> coated completely with SiO 2...|$|R

50|$|Carbon <b>black</b> (subtypes <b>are</b> {{acetylene}} <b>black,</b> channel black, furnace black, {{lamp black}} and thermal <b>black)</b> <b>is</b> a material {{produced by the}} incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products such as FCC tar, coal tar, ethylene cracking tar, and a small amount from vegetable oil. Carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> a form of paracrystalline carbon that has a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, albeit {{lower than that of}} activated carbon. It is dissimilar to soot in its much higher surface-area-to-volume ratio and significantly lower (negligible and non-bioavailable) PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) content. However, carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> widely used as a model compound for diesel soot for diesel oxidation experiments. Carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> mainly used as a reinforcing filler in tires and other rubber products. In plastics, paints, and inks carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> used as a color pigment.|$|R

500|$|Modern {{scholars}} have differed {{in their view}} of whether the <b>Blacks</b> <b>were</b> Jacobites or not. Some argue that the links between the Blacks and the Jacobites were [...] "fantasies", and that the <b>Blacks</b> <b>were</b> [...] "simply a mixed group of foresters: labourers, yeomen and some gentry defending their customary rights". Others, however, have claimed that the <b>Blacks</b> <b>were</b> closely connected with Jacobitism and that the <b>Black</b> Act <b>was</b> designed to combat this political threat.|$|R

50|$|The word blackwhite {{denotes the}} Newspeak user's ability {{to believe that}} <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white, to know that <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white, and to forget that one has ever {{believed}} the contrary. Yet it has two contradictory connotations: (i) Applied to an opponent of Ingsoc ("Impudently claiming that <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white, in contradiction of the plain facts") and (ii) applied {{to a member of}} the Party ("A loyal willingness to say that <b>black</b> <b>is</b> white when Party discipline demands"). Moreover, as Newspeak, the word blackwhite also {{is an example of the}} Party's doublethink, which re-writes the past.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the score}} is tied after the final <b>black</b> <b>is</b> potted, the <b>black</b> <b>is</b> [...] "respotted" [...] and the cue ball put [...] "in hand".

Play then continues normally until the <b>black</b> <b>is</b> potted or another frame-ending situation occurs.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{speculative}} theories on the origin of the Brunswickers' dark and seemingly grim choice of garb. It has been suggested that <b>black</b> <b>was</b> chosen to mourn Duke Frederick William's late father; as a sign of respect for the Duke; or in mourning for the Duke's occupied homeland. Colonel Augustus Frazer, who had served alongside the Brunswickers, reported that <b>black</b> <b>was</b> adopted in mourning for the Duke's wife, Princess Marie of Baden, who had died in 1808, and that the black uniforms would not be put aside until Brunswick had been finally liberated.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{demonstration of}} this last idea {{occurred in the}} game Pintér–Brynell at the 1998 Elista Olympiad. White answered Black's 21...b5 with 22.b4!, and <b>Black</b> <b>was</b> unable to keep the queenside open with 22...bxa4? because 23.bxc5 Rxb1 24.Rxb1 dxc5 25.Bxc5 would have left White's central pawns unstoppable. After the game's 22...c4 23.a5! Qe7 24.Bd4 Black's queenside play had ground to a halt; Pintér later won with a pawn advance on the kingside.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from baseball, Black {{went on to}} become a sportscaster, automobile salesman, and insurance salesman.

He recovered and spent the following summer teaching for the city recreation department. The following year, on April 21, 1959, Black died in Cuyahoga Falls while watching an Indians game at his home.|$|E
