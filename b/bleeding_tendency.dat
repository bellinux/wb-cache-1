5|$|Thrombolysis, stenting {{and surgery}} {{are not used}} as widely as anticoagulation or {{antiplatelet}} drugs. These treatments are invasive or more risky, and are typically reserved for situations where symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical treatment may be unsafe (e.g. an unacceptable <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency).</b>|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency</b> or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency.</b> People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E

50|$|Anthemis cotula is {{regarded}} as toxic to dogs, cats, horses, and guinea pigs. Clinical signs include contact dermatitis, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, allergic reactions. Long term use can lead to <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendencies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Deficiency of Factor XIII {{leads to}} {{defective}} cross-linking of fibrin and vulnerability to late re-bleeds when the primary hemostatic plug is overwhelmed. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>tendencies</b> similar to hemophiliacs develop, such as hemarthroses and deep tissue bleeding.|$|R
25|$|Bernard-Soulier {{syndrome}} is a defect or deficiency in GPIb. GPIb, the receptor for vWF, can be defective {{and lead to}} lack of primary clot formation (primary hemostasis) and increased <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency.</b> This is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{acquired}} vWD {{contributes to}} the <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency</b> in people with an implant of a left ventricular assist device (a pump that pumps blood from the left ventricle of the heart into the aorta). Large multimers of vWF are destroyed by mechanical stress in both conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of vWD {{is about one}} in 100 individuals. However, {{the majority of these}} people do not have symptoms. The {{prevalence of}} clinically significant cases is one per 10,000. Because most forms are rather mild, they are detected more often in women, whose <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency</b> shows during menstruation. It may be more severe or apparent in people with blood type O.|$|E
50|$|Caplacizumab is an {{alternative}} option in treating TTP {{as it has been}} shown that it induces a faster disease resolution compared with those patient who were on placebo. However, the use of caplacizumab was associated with increase <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendencies</b> in the studied subjects.|$|R
30|$|Patients {{included}} in the study either had a normal coagulation profile or a defect that could be properly corrected prior to surgery. On the other hand, patients with <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendencies</b> that failed to be corrected prior to surgery were excluded from the current study.|$|R
50|$|Isolated {{cases of}} humans with mild to {{moderate}} <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendencies</b> {{have been found to}} have mutations in TP that are associated with defects in this receptors binding of TXA2 analogs, activating cell signal pathways, and/or platelet functional responses not only to TP agonists but also to agents that stimulate platelets by TP-independent mechanisms (see Genomics section below).|$|R
25|$|Hageman factor, {{now known}} as factor XII, was {{identified}} in 1955 in an asymptomatic patient with a prolonged bleeding time named of John Hageman. Factor X, or Stuart-Prower factor, followed, in 1956. This protein was identified in a Ms. Audrey Prower of London, who had a lifelong <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency.</b> In 1957, an American group identified the same factor in a Mr. Rufus Stuart. Factors XI and XIII were identified in 1953 and 1961, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure for treatment of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block {{the flow of blood}} through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency.</b> The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known {{coagulation}} factor disorders are the hemophilias. The three main forms are hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency), hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency or [...] "Christmas disease") and hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency, mild <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency).</b> Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders, whereas Hemophilia C {{is a much}} more rare autosomal recessive [...] disorder most commonly seen in Ashkenazi Jews.|$|E
5000|$|Pseudo-gray {{platelet}} syndrome {{differs from}} gray platelet syndrome (GPS), {{one of the}} giant platelet syndromes. GPS is characterized by [...] "thrombocytopenia, abnormally large agranular platelets in peripheral blood smears, and almost total absence of platelet alpha-granules and their constituents." [...] The defect in GPS is the failure of megakaryocytes to package secretory proteins into alpha-granules. Patients with the GPS are affected by mild to moderate <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendencies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Polypropylene (PP) {{thickened}} {{lubricating grease}} exhibits high oil <b>bleed</b> <b>tendency</b> at low temperatures, {{which makes it}} a promising candidate for low temperature applications. At elevated temperatures, PP thickened lubricating grease exhibits excessive oil bleeding, which limits its use at high temperatures. Excessive oil bleed adversely affects the lubricating performance of the PP thickened grease. The present work is focused on the study of the oil <b>bleed</b> <b>tendency</b> of PP and Maleated Polypropylene (mPP) thickened greases at various temperatures by incorporating virgin and recycled high density polyethylene (HDPE) into the thickener system. Grease containing various percentages of PP and mPP thickeners were prepared and modified with different percentages of virgin and recycled HDPE. Polymers were characterized through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. The oil bleed performance of these greases was evaluated by the conical sieve method (ASTM D 6184) at various temperatures. Storage (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of greases was determined by rheometry at 25 °C. Incorporation of HDPE and recycled HDPE in PP thickened grease decreased oil bleeding compared to the base grease...|$|R

2500|$|... vWF plays a {{major role}} in blood coagulation. Therefore, vWF {{deficiency}} or dysfunction (von Willebrand disease) leads to a <b>bleeding</b> <b>tendency,</b> which is most apparent in tissues having high blood flow shear in narrow vessels. From studies it appears that vWF uncoils under these circumstances, decelerating passing platelets. Recent research also suggests that von Willebrand factor is involved in the formation of blood vessels themselves, which would explain why some people with von Willebrand disease develop vascular malformations (predominantly in the digestive tract) that can bleed excessively.|$|E
