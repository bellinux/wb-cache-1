40|$|As {{few studies}} have {{analysed}} local variability in populations <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> Sus scrofa in Western Europe in recent years, our understanding of ecological processes currently affecting this species is limited. To analyse questions regarding local variability in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> abundance, we used information from 442 traditional drive hunts monitored throughout eight hunting periods in the Pyrenees mountain range (Urdués, N Spain). Results showed temporal oscillations in abundance, and a non–linear decrease of 23 % in the number <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> seen per drive hunt between 2004 and 2011. Numbers of dogs and hunters per drive hunt also affected indexes <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> abundance. Inter–annual variations in bag size may cause overestimations of variations in boar abundance and may even deviate from the population dynamics inferred from the number <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> seen per drive hunt. The multimodal patterns <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> abundance during the hunting periods suggest migrations in the Pyrenees.

40|$|The {{results of}} several studies whose theme was {{population}} density of {{game and the}} possibility of its estimation were summarized in this paper. Population density {{is one of the most}} important characteristics of animal population, especially in relation to the proper sustainable wildlife management. The first study dealt with verification technology of the Game Management Plan for selected ungulate species in the Czech Rep. Further work compared four different methods of counting and the appropriateness of using on the example <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in the forest environment. The following two papers tested the possibility of using the method of dung counting for estimating the numbers <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in the forest environment. Recent work has dealt with the study of the distribution <b>of</b> faeces <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar,</b> depending on the different hunting management within two neighbouring hunting grounds. The first study found that the hunting planning in the Czech Republic is not suitable for all ungulate game species. Photo traps could be used to estimate the abundance <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> only in combination with other independent methods.

40|$|International audienceInteractions between {{traditional}} livestock management practices and wildlife activities {{are important in}} the conservation of many mountain ecosystems including the summer rangelands in the Spanish Central Pyrenees, where rooting by <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> () is a large disturbance that can {{reduce the amount of}} area available to grazing livestock.

In addition, a preference for areas that had intermediate stocking rates was found. The relationship between the increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boars</b> and trends in livestock management suggests that the extent <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> rooting will increase especially in cattle grazing areas, and therefore, the area available for cattle grazing in Pyrenean mountain rangelands would decrease significantly...|$|R

40|$|The <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> (Sus scrofa L.) {{population}} {{has increased in}} most parts of Europe during the last three decades. As a consequence, population distribution ranges have shifted to more agricultural areas. These newly colonized areas are characterized by highly fragmented forest cover and a preponderance of crop fields and grasslands, thus increasing the risk of problematic interactions with farming activities and small game species. Although plasticity <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> to various environmental conditions is well known, understanding the ecological patterns that promote the density distribution of the species within agricultural areas remains of importance for adapted management strategies within these landscapes. Inside a recently occupied area (between 10 - 30 years <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> regular presence) <b>of</b> southern Belgium, we studied the relation between occurences <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> population, estimated by hunting bag and crop damages, with a set of environmental, anthropic and landscape variables.

In Spain, populations <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> have increased over the past three decades. In south-central Spain, fencing, supplemental feeding and illegal restocking <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> have become common management practices in order to increase the number <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in the region. These practices are not common in the north of the country, with the exception of uncon-trolled restocking, which has been reported in recent decades. Illegal restocking may have been carried out in one of three different ways: by breeding <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in captivity and releasing them; by interbreed-ing domestic pigs and <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> to increase the size of the animals and the number and size of litters; and by importing and releasing <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> from other European countries, mainly France (Rosell 1995, Garin-Bastuji and Delcueillerie 2001).

40|$|Background]: Field {{vaccination}} trials with Mycobacterium bovis BCG, an attenuated mutant of M. bovis, {{are ongoing}} in Spain, where the Eurasian <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> (Sus scrofa) {{is regarded as}} the main driver of animal tuberculosis (TB). The oral baiting strategy consists in deploying vaccine baits twice each summer, in order to gain access to a high proportion <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> piglets. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the response <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> to re-vaccination with BCG and to subsequent challenge with an M. bovis field strain. [Results]: BCG re-vaccinated <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> showed reductions <b>of</b> 75. 8 % in lesion score and 66. 9 % in culture score, as compared to unvaccinated controls. Only one <b>of</b> nine vaccinated <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> had a culture-confirmed lung infection, as compared to seven of eight controls. Serum antibody levels were highly variable and did not differ significantly between BCG re-vaccinated <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> and controls. Gamma IFN levels differed significantly between BCG re-vaccinated <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> and controls. The mRNA levels for IL- 1 b, C 3 and MUT were significantly higher in vaccinated <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> when compared to controls after vaccination and decreased after mycobacterial challenge. [Conclusions]: Oral re-vaccination <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> with BCG yields a strong protective response against challenge with a field strain. Moreover, re-vaccination <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> with BCG is not counterproductive. These findings are relevant given that re-vaccination is likely to happen under real (field) conditions.

We have reviewed 16 studies from a total of 21 study areas, to assess whether the absolute frequency <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in the wolf diet was influenced by (i) occurrence of the other ungulate species in diet and (ii) the number of available ungulate species. <b>Wild</b> <b>boar</b> {{turned out to be the}} main prey of the wolf (49 % occurrence, on average), followed by roe deer (24 %) and livestock (18 %).
