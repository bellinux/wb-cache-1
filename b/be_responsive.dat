5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> to their needs and communications.|$|E

The receptors in the mouth typically fall into two of the following categories: receptors that <b>are</b> <b>responsive</b> to specific chemicals and receptors that <b>are</b> <b>responsive</b> to particles such as hydrogen ions, which are charged.|$|R

25|$|A {{big part}} of Facebook's pitch {{is that it has}} so much {{information}} about its users that it can more effectively target ads to those who will <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> to the content. If Facebook can prove that theory to be true, then it may not worry so much about losing its cool cachet.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamics}} of New Brunswick politics {{are different from}} those of other Canadian provinces. The lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> to issues affecting all areas of the province. In addition, the presence of a large Francophone minority dictates that consensus politics is necessary, even when there is a majority government present. In this manner, {{the ebb and flow of}} New Brunswick provincial politics parallels the federal stage.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the AMPK activator AICAR as compared to somatostatin- 14 on cell viability and GH secretion in human GH-secreting pituitary adenomas in vitro and in rat GH 3 cells. Overnight treatment with AICAR increased phospho-(threonine- 172) AMPK levels (activated AMPK) in cultured human adenomas. As to the effects on cell viability, four adenomas out of 15 <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> to AICAR (0. 4 mM) and five adenomas <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> to SS- 14 (100 nM). One adenoma <b>was</b> <b>responsive</b> to both somatostatin and AICAR. The effects of cotreatment with SS- 14 and AICAR were investigated in eight adenomas. In two adenomas, the effects of AICAR + SS- 14 did not exceed the effect of AICAR. In two adenomas which <b>were</b> not <b>responsive</b> to either AICAR or SS- 14, the cotreatment was able to reduce cell viability versus control. Two adenomas <b>were</b> not <b>responsive</b> to any treatment. As to the effects on GH secretion, nine adenomas out of 15 <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> to AICAR. Twelve adenomas <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> to SS- 14. Eight adenomas <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> to both AICAR and SS- 14. Cotreatment exceeded the effect of single treatments in 4 out of 10 adenomas. In GH 3 cells, AICAR reduced the activity of p 70 S 6 kinase, which {{plays an important role in}} cell growth. SS- 14 did not affect significantly AMPK phosphorylation and p 70 S 6 K activity but it was able to enhance the inhibitory effect of AICAR on phospho-S 6 levels. Moreover, AICAR and SS- 14 reduced ERK phosphorylation with a different time course. The combined treatment reduced phospho-ERK levels at any time point...|$|R

Andreotti contacted Mafia boss Stefano Bontade {{to try to prevent}} the Mafia from killing Piersanti Mattarella. Bontade and other Mafiosi felt betrayed by Mattarella, who used to <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> to their interests (his father Bernardo Mattarella was rumoured {{to be associated with the}} Mafia).|$|E

25|$|Western riding is a {{style of}} horseback riding which evolved from the {{ranching}} and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish Conquistadors, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy in the American West. American cowboys needed to work long hours in the saddle over rough terrain, sometimes needing to rope cattle with a lariat (or lasso). Because of the necessity to control the horse {{with one hand and}} use a lariat with the other, western horses were trained to neck rein, that is, to change direction with light pressure of a rein against the horse's neck. Horses were also trained to exercise a certain degree of independence in using their natural instincts to follow the movements of a cow, thus a riding style developed that emphasized a deep, secure seat, and training methods encouraged a horse to <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> on very light rein contact.|$|E

Adopting such a strategy affects the development process and also has an important impact on an automaker's organizational structure. A platform strategy also offers advantages for the globalization process of automobile firms.|$|E

The paper (Legal Services: A Framework for the Future) was published in July 1989, and had a different tone to that of the Green Papers, referring more to the requirement of legal services to <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> {{to the needs of the}} client rather than the discipline of the market and problems with competition between branches of the legal profession.

[...] Occasionally, the governing body of an agency may <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> to the objections and protests by the public concerning {{a proposed}} property-related fee or charge. [...] Responses may {{take the form of}} not levying the property-related fee or charge or modifying the property-related fee or charge to make it more acceptable to the public.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909, Geddes {{assisted}} in the early planning of the southern aspect of the Zoological Gardens in Edinburgh. This work was formative in his development of a regional planning model called the [...] "Valley Section".This model illustrated the complex interactions among biogeography, geomorphology and human systems and attempted to demonstrate how [...] "natural occupations" [...] such as hunting, mining, or fishing are supported by physical geographies that in turn determine patterns of human settlement. The point of this model was to make clear the complex and interrelated relationships between humans and their environment, and to encourage regional planning models that would <b>be</b> <b>responsive</b> to these conditions.|$|E
