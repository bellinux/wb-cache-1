In addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> {{before they reach the}} step-up transformer (these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard). Even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible. Nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power.|$|E

The influence of soldering HTs on the RRR of the LHC main <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> cable strands has been determined. The RRR of several splice U-pieces and wedges dismounted from the LHC has been measured. A correlation between the Vickers hardness and the RRR of the high purity Cu profiles has been established. All U-pieces tested that were produced before 2009 have a RRR> 200, while the RRR of all wedges and of U-pieces of 2009 production have a much lower RRR.

50|$|Magnetic {{amplifiers}} can be {{used for}} measuring high DC-voltages without direct connection to the high voltage and are therefore still used in the HVDC-technique. The current to be measured is passed through the two cores, possibly by a solid <b>bus</b> <b>bar.</b> There is almost no voltage drop in this <b>bus</b> <b>bar.</b> The output signal, proportional to the ampere turns in the control current <b>bus</b> <b>bar,</b> is derived from the alternating excitation voltage of the magnetic amplifier, there is no voltage created or induced on the <b>bus</b> <b>bar.</b> The output signal has only a magnetic connection with the <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> so the <b>bus</b> may be, quite safely, at any (EHT) voltage with respect to the instrumentation.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} and compare three different fine line printing techniques for the silver front side metallization of industrial-type silicon solar cells: single print, dual print and print-on-print. We obtain finger heights of 5. 6 μm for single print, 9. 5 μm for dual print and 15. 1 μm for print-on-print {{as well as}} finger width between 46. 2 μm and 61. 3 μm. We process PERC solar cells with dual print and print-on-print. For the dual print, we test two different <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> designs, a standard rectangular shaped <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> and a segmented <b>bus</b> <b>bar.</b> The resulting PERC solar cells achieve conversion efficiencies of 19. 8 % for dual print and print-on-print. The dual print with segmented <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> design reduces the Ag paste consumption to 67. 7 mg, measured after printing prior to drying. To our knowledge, this is the lowest front side Ag paste consumption that has been reported so far. Additionally, we model optimum Ag finger width in dependence of electrical and geometrical parameters. We find that even when assuming very optimistic parameters, the optimum finger width of 26 μm is just a factor of two lower compared {{to the state of}} the art technology today...|$|R

In this thesis there are different protection schemes for the <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> have studied. The arc incident has discussed and put emphasis on the process of arc development. For mitigating the arc faults and other unwanted fault incident, {{it is important to have}} a co-ordination between the protecting devices. IEC 61850 is an important protocol of communication that has discussed from the basic idea. In the thesis it has given effort on the implementation of <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> protection scheme with the protection devices in the substation. Those devices are communicating with each other for exchanging the GOOSE message using IEC 61850. The protection devices are connected with arc sensor and getting the input signal from it.

The thesis has given the idea about the protection scheme of <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> implementation in a medium voltage substation perspective. It is also helps to understand how the protection devices are working and communicating with each other via GOOSE message. The thesis is also able to demonstrate the role of protection scheme on the <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> and the co-ordination of protective devices for implementation of the scheme.

5000|$|Feeder busway {{is used to}} {{interconnect}} equipment, such as between a transformer and a switchgear line up. A variant type is low-impedance busway, {{which is designed to}} have lower voltage drop by virtue of close spacing of <b>bus</b> <b>bars,</b> which reduces inductive reactance. [...] A trolley busway provides power to equipment that must be frequently moved. The busway is open at the bottom, and a movable collector assembly [...] "trolley" [...] is used to connect between the fixed <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> in the busway and the cable connected to moving equipment. Bus ducts are building service penetrants that are required to be externally firestopped where they penetrate fire separations required to have a fire-resistance rating. Any internal firestops that are supplied by the manufacturer may be tested as integral components to either UL857 or IEEE C37.23 for North American models, and then via ASTM E814, UL1479 or ULC-S115. Bus duct-internal firestops mitigate the transmission of internal fires, smoke and heat between fire compartments through the combustion of bus duct-internal covalent wrappings, spacers and brackets.|$|E
