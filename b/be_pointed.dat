5|$|The bee-eaters are a {{group of}} near-passerine birds in the family Meropidae {{containing}} three genera and 27 species. Most species are found in Africa and Asia, with a few in southern Europe, Australia, and New Guinea. They are characterised by richly coloured plumage, slender bodies, and usually elongated central tail feathers. All have long down-turned bills and medium to long wings, which may <b>be</b> <b>pointed</b> or round. Male and female plumages are usually similar.|$|E
