Thus, by <b>becoming</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the Byzantine civil wars as mercenaries and allies – especially through their use by Botaneiates and Melissenos during their respective revolts to hold down various cities for them – the Turks completed their relatively peaceful take-over of central and western Asia Minor.|$|E

5|$|Casino Royale {{takes place}} at the {{beginning}} of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill.

5|$|In November 1949 {{he joined}} Second Division club Hull City for a {{transfer}} fee of £19,000. He chose {{to join the}} Tigers ahead of bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester City who had shown interest in signing him {{due to the fact}} that Hull were managed by Raich Carter, who had been a great player before and after World War II. Carter did improve Revie's game but was not a success as Hull manager, as City finished mid-table in 1949–50 and 1950–51, before <b>becoming</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> a relegation battle in 1951–52. Teammate Andy Davidson later said Revie failed to fulfil his potential at Boothferry Park as he was not a tough player, and the rest of the Hull team were not physically dominant enough to protect him and allow him to dictate play with his accurate passing. As at Leicester, Revie felt the time had come for him to move on and handed in a transfer request once Carter departed.|$|E

In 1997 he was involved in the establishment of the International Asatru/Odinist Alliance alongside Murray's AA and the British Odinic Rite.
