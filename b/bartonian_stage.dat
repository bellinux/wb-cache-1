40|$|The Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for {{the base}} of the <b>Bartonian</b> (middle Eocene) <b>stage</b> is as yet undefined. Here, we assess the GSSP {{potential}} of the La Acebosa Formation exposed on {{the eastern side of the}} Cape of Oyambre (San Vicente de la Barquera, province of Cantabria, northern Spain). Sedimentological and benthic foraminiferal data indicate that the La Acebosa Formation represents a bathyal environment related to a deepening, eastwardfacing slope. Preliminary planktic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil results show that the upper part of the section corresponds to zones E 11 and CP 14 a, respectively, and thus could include the Lutetian–Bartonian boundary. Although the quality of demagnetization is quite poor, preliminary magnetostratigraphic data suggest that Chron C 19 n, which is most likely to define the Bartonian GSSP, could be recorded in the upper part of the La Acebosa Formation. A denser magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic sampling is required in the upper part of this unit in order to accurately identify Chron C 19 n and to establish the sequence of events across the Lutetian–Bartonian transition...|$|R
40|$|The Mead Stream section (South Island, New Zealand) {{consists}} of a 650 -m-thick series of continuous, well-exposed strata deposited on a South Pacific continental slope from the Late Cretaceous to the middle Eocene. We examined the uppermost Paleocene–middle Eocene part of the section, which {{consists of}} 360 m of limestone and marl, for detailed magnetic polarity stratigraphy and calcareous nannofossil and foraminifera biostratigraphy. Magneto-biostratigraphic data indicate that the section straddles magnetic polarity chrons from C 24 r to C 18 n, calcareous nannofossil zones from NP 9 a to NP 17 (CNP 11 –CNE 15, following a recently revised Paleogene zonation), and from the Waipawan to the Bortonian New Zealand stages (i. e., {{from the base of}} the Ypresian to the <b>Bartonian</b> international <b>stages).</b> The Mead Stream section thus encompasses 17 m. y. (56 – 39 Ma) of southwest Pacifi c Ocean history. The ages of calcareous nannofossil biohorizons are consistent with low- to midlatitude data from the literature, indicating that during the early–middle Eocene, the low- to midlatitude calcareous nannofossil domain extended at least to 50 °S– 55 °S in the South Pacific. Correlation of the magnetic polarity stratigraphy from the Mead Stream section with the geomagnetic polarity time scale allows us to derive sediment accumulation rates (SAR), which range between 8 and 44 m/m. y. Comparing the SAR with paleotemperature proxy records, we found that two intervals of increased SAR occurred during the early Eocene climatic optimum (52 – 50 Ma) and during the transient warming event peaking with the middle Eocene climatic optimum (40. 5 Ma). This correlation indicates that, at Mead Stream, the climate evolution of the early–middle Eocene is recorded in a sedimentation pattern whereby, on a millionyear time scale, warmer climate promoted continental weathering, transportation, and accumulation of terrigenous sediment...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a combined biostratigraphic (calcareous nannofossils, larger foraminifers) and magnetostratigraphic {{study of the}} Middle and Late Eocene marine units of the Igualada area, eastern Ebro Basin. The studied sections of Santa Maria de Miralles and La Tossa encompass the complete marine succession of the Santa Maria Group, where assemblages rich in larger foraminifers have been studied since the early 1950 's. A total of 224 paleomagnetic sites and 62 biostratigraphic samples were collected along a 1350 m-thick section that ranges from chron C 20 n to chron C 16 n (~ 43 Ma to ~ 36 Ma). The resulting magnetostratigraphy-based chronology challenges existing chronostratigraphic interpretations of these units and results in a new calibration of the biostratigraphic zonations. The base of calcareous nannofossil Zone NP 19 - 20 is pinned down to an older age than its presently accepted attribution, whereas the time span assigned to Zone NP 18 is significantly reduced. A revised calibration of larger foraminifers indicates that Zone SBZ 18, formerly assigned exclusively to the late Bartonian, extends its range to the earlymost Priabonian, the <b>Bartonian</b> <b>stage</b> being almost entirely represented by Zone SBZ 17. A division of Zone SBZ 18 into two subzones is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The study {{dealing with}} petrography, lithofacies and {{sedimentology}} of Tiyon formation help in correlation regionally and globally. During the Early-Middle Eocene rapid transgression and locally regression in Southern Lower Indus Basin deposited limestone interbedded shale in Tiyon formation in between Laki and Kirthar Formation. The main lithofacies distributed in Tiyon formation is limestone, nodular and marly limestone, highly fossilifereous with interbedded silty calcareous shale. The microfacies are mudstone, wackstone, packstone and grainstone with dominant Alveolinids, Assilina and Nummulities. The fauna are well preserved in similar lithofacies with minor change in France, Alpine, Himalayan and Indo-Pacific region. The Litho-biofacies of Tiyon formation indicates the marine transgression during Lutetian, {{west to east}} from Paris Basin through Libya, Egypt, Oman, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Sindh, Salt Range, Kutch, Rajasthan and Assam to Indonesia. The basal and middle part of the Tiyon formation yields Paracypris maridonalis, Paracypris sapperi, Schizoptocythere sp. Stigmatocythere oblique ostracods which are correlated to Saudi Arabia, Salt Range, Sor Range of Baluchistan and Kutch (India) area {{but in the middle}} to upper part Bairoloppilata and Krithe rutoti are common in Paris, Belgium and England. The presence of abundant gastropod species Velates perversus in European countries also confirms the Lutetian transgression from west to east Tethys. The upper part of Tiyon formation consists of Alveolina elongata, Nummulities obtusus, N. pinfoldi and N. perforatus indicates the Late Lutetian Early Bartonian. The Tiyon formation is correlated with Pir Koh Limestone, lower part of Drazinda shale of Zinda Pir, Drug area (D. G. Khan) Punjab, basal shale unit of the Kirthar Formation and upper most beds of Ghazij Shale exposed in the Sore-Range, Chorgali Formation, Kuldana Formation, Basal part of Kohat formation and Sakesar Formation The Tiyon formation is the unit of Chat member of Laki Formation. This distinct lithological unit with different stratigraphic position should be formalized as a separate formation.

40|$|This PhD-Thesis {{presents}} a new chronostratigraphy of the Paleogene sedimentary {{record of the}} SE margin of the Eastern Ebro Basin. It {{is based on a}} number of magnetostratigraphic sections and its integration with marine and continental biochronological data. A robust correlation with the geomagnetic polarity time scale is obtained and provides the record with absolute ages, spanning from chrons C 20 n to C 12 r (Lutetian to Rupelian stages, ca. 43. 0 - 31. 0 Ma). Main differences with respect to the current chronostratigraphic scheme of the Eastern Ebro Basin include the age of the uppermost marine units. While earlier schemes attributed a Bartonian age to these units regarding its biostratigraphical contents, new results supports a Lower Priabonian age, yielding an interpolated age of ca. 36. 0 Ma (within chron C 16 n. 2 n) for the continentalization process. This age is in concordance with a reinterpretation of earlier magnetostratigraphic data from the Western South Pyrenean Foreland Basin, and indicates that continentalization of the basin occurred as a rapid and isochronous event. The analysis of the observed sedimentation trends are used to evaluate the character of this process. Thus, contrasting sedimentation trends between the Western and Eastern sectors of the South Pyrenean foreland are proposed to indicate that basin closing preferentially affected those areas subjected to sediment bypass towards the ocean domain. Moreover, new results provide improved temporal constraints for the sediments of the Eocene Montserrat alluvial fan and fan-delta complex. Thus a Lutetian age is ascribed to the whole La Salut Formation and the age of the Montserrat Conglomerates spans from Upper Lutetian to Lower Priabonian. The new chronological framework is used to unravel the forcing controls on the sequential arrangement of the Montserrat area at different temporal scales, and also to revise the tectonosedimentary history. Obtained results show a correlation between (tectonic) subsidence and forelimb rotation measured on deformed strata of Montserrat. Furthermore, integration of subsidence curves from different sectors of the Eastern Ebro Basin allows estimating the variable contribution of tectonic loads from the two active basin margins: the Catalan Coastal Ranges and the Pyrenees. The results support the presence of a double flexure from Late Lutetian to Late Bartonian, associated to the two tectonically active margins. From Late Bartonian to Early Priabonian the homogenization of subsidence values is interpreted {{as the result of the}} coupling of the two sources of tectonic load. Finally, the obtained chronology contributes to the calibration of several biostratigraphic zonations to the geomagnetic polarity time scale. In the marine realm, the base of calcareous nannofossil Zone NP 19 - 20 is pinned down to an older age than its currently accepted attribution, whereas the time span assigned to Zone NP 18 is significantly reduced. A revised calibration of larger foraminifers indicates that Zone SBZ 18, formerly assigned exclusively to Late Bartonian, extends its range to the earlymost Priabonian, being the <b>Bartonian</b> <b>stage</b> almost entirely represented by Zone SBZ 17. A division of Zone SBZ 18 into two subzones is also proposed. In the continental realm, the magnetostratigraphic record of the Eastern Ebro Basin yields accurate ages for the immediately pre- and post-Grand Coupure mammal fossil assemblages found in this basin. Thus, the Grande Coupure, a major terrestrial faunal turnover recorded in Eurasia associated with the overall climate shift at the Eocene-Oligocene transition, is found to occur with a maximum allowable lag of 0. 5 Myr with respect to this boundary. Furthermore, results from this PhD-Thesis allow revisiting correlations for the controversial Eocene-Oligocene record of the Hampshire Basin (UK), and their implications for the calibration of the Mammal Paleogene reference levels MP 18 to MP 21. Aquesta Tesi Doctoral presenta una nova cronologia del registre sedimentari Paleogen del marge SE del sector oriental de la Conca de l’Ebre. La cronologia obtinguda es basa en la integració d’un conjunt de sèries magnetostratigràfiques amb totes les dades biostratigràfiques dels registres marí i continental disponibles en aquest sector de la conca. L’establiment d’una correlació robusta amb l’escala de temps de polaritat geomagnètica proveeix al registre sedimentari Paleogen d’un marc cronològic amb edats absolutes que van des del cron C 20 n fins al cron C 12 r (ca. 43. 0 - 31. 0 Ma), és a dir, del Lutecià al Rupelià. Aquest nou marc cronològic proporciona les eines necessàries per a la quantificació i posterior comprensió de l’evolució tectonosedimentària dels marges adjacents a la Conca de l’Ebre. Finalment, la cronologia resultant de la present Tesi Doctoral contribueix a la calibració amb l’escala de temps geològic de les biozonacions de nanofòssil calcari i macroforaminífers (Shallow Benthic Zones), així com dels nivells de referència de mamífers paleògens europeus (European vertebrate Mammal Paleogene –MP- reference levels) ...|$|E
