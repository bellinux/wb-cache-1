Despite the low score she still managed to finish 9th in the all-around. In stark contrast, Dominique Dawes and Shannon Miller both started out on the uneven bars, and after the first two rotations (uneven bars and balance beam) they were in 1st and 2nd place respectively. The excitement however, proved to be short lived. Miller came up short on her first tumbling pass on floor (a double layout), and stepped out of bounds on her last tumbling pass on floor (a full twisting double back). A score of 9.475 dashed any dreams of a medal for her. Next up was Dawes, and while doing a punch front on floor she fell out of bounds. She scored a 9.000 {{and just like that}} team USA was completely out of the all-around contention. Miller ended up placing 8th, while Dawes placed 17th. World champion Lilia Podkopayeva took the title and the gold, while the three Romanians took revenge for their disappointing team bronze by sweeping the other medals (Gina Gogean won silver, and Simona Amânar and Lavinia Miloşovici tied for bronze).|$|E

Application of the Nintendo Wii-fit balance {{board and}} its games {{have been used}} in Physical Therapy clinics, showing success in {{individuals}} with neurological disorders, and has been recommended as a minimum baseline assessment of a symptoms checklist and standardized cognitive and balance assessments for concussion management by the NCAA. However, it still faces challenges of being considered a reliable and consistent tool for producing normative data in the allied healthcare. Because there is little to no evidence for the Wii-fit balance board as a valid balance assessment tool for clinical and/or research usage, the significance {{of this study is to}} provide substantial evidence of whether the Nintendo Wii-fit balance board can be used as a valid balance assessment tool. Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of the Wii-fit balance board as an assessment tool for balance by comparing it to the Bertec <b>balance</b> <b>check</b> platform and Kistler force platform. Design. Experimental Study Setting. UNLV research laboratory Patients or Other Participants. Twelve apparently healthy, male (n = 5) and female (n= 7) subjects between the ages of 18 - 30 years (age = 23 ± 3 yrs.) weighing no more than 1468 N (mass = 69. 9 ± 22. 6 kg, height = 167. 6 ± 3 cm). Main Outcomes or Measure(s). Subjects completed five trials of the Nintendo Wii-fit game called the 2 ̆ 2 Stillness Body Test 2 ̆ 2 on each of the following instruments: Bertec <b>balance</b> <b>check</b> platform, Kistler force platform, and Nintendo Wii-fit balance board (WBB). Results from the tests were used to compare center of pressure (CoP) maximum excursion range relationships among the three instruments. Results. The results indicated that there was a significant CoP maximum excursion range positive relationship between the Bertec <b>balance</b> <b>check</b> platform and WBB in both the anterior-posterior (A/P) and medial-lateral (M/L) direction, suggesting measurement validity(r A/P = 0. 710, p A/P = 0. 010, r M/L = 0. 759, p M/L = 0. 004). However, there was only a significant positive relationship between the Kistler force platform and WBB in the medial-lateral direction (M/L) but not in the anterior-posterior (A/P) direction, suggesting comparative validity only in the medial-lateral direction (M/L) (r A/P = 0. 465, p A/P = 0. 128, r M/L = 0. 579, p M/L = 0. 049).

In doing so, {{there is a need}} to make better use of information and knowledge generated in all stages of development. The key to project information management is the information flow associated with inter-organizational communication and the effectiveness of the project manager to communicate with and feedback to the rest of the project team throughout the project life cycle. Better communication can be achieved by using computer tools for effective data processing and information management, through Information Communication Technologies (ICT). As the majority of the construction organizations are Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the communication management research is required to address management and communication processes adopted by SMEs. These issues can be addressed by global research, but also require clear understanding of the management and communication processes followed by SMEs of each distinct regional area or country. The research was conducted through a sequential mixed methods approach focusing on collecting and analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data in the study in a sequential manner. To develop a <b>balance</b> <b>check</b> mechanism, the research was divided into four phases: Interpretive analysis of perceived benefits of use of ICT for building project management, conducted by Interpretive Structural Modeling analysis; Questionnaire survey data collection and empirical analysis of data including Structural Equation Modeling analysis (quantitative method); Semi-structured interview survey data collection and analysis including Data Envelopment Analysis (quantitative and qualitative method) and case studies analysis conducted by SAP-LAP analysis (qualitative method) leading to synthesis of the results of the four phases. The purpose of this four-phase, sequential mixed methods study was to start with the pragmatic assumptions; obtain statistical, quantitative results from a broad sample of organizations to analyze or study research variables at industry and organization levels and then follow up with a few organizations and projects to study the research variables at the level of the organization and people.

40|$|Predicting the {{availability}} of water resources in hydrologically stressed regions, like the U. S. Southwest, depends fundamentally {{on the ability to}} understand and adequately reproduce the interaction of vegetation processes with climate and its effects on the water cycle. Within the framework of the PILPS Semi-Arid Experiment (PILPS San Pedro), two 4 + year long data sets from the USDA Experimental Watershed in the Walnut Gulch, Arizona, are used for an intercomparison analysis of eight state-of-the-art Land-Surface Models (LSM) 1. Off-line runs using the provided forcing and default parameters (a priori established model parameters for semi-arid regions) that included several energy and water balance model outputs and state variables allow to perform split sample validation tests using goodness-of-fit measures (R 2, IA, NSE, RMSE, Bias), similarity measures (Hausdorff Norm), statistical correlation (Taylor diagrams), etc. The considered time scales for the analysis were: monthly, daily average, annual, interannual. Because the data sites (Lucky Hills and Kendall) correspond to two different semi-arid environments (shrub and grass, respectively) we attempt to diagnose {{the extent to which the}} standard representation of the participant parameterization schemes is adequate. We focus on evaluating both, the consistency of net energy partition into latent, sensible and ground heat flux components as well as closure and decomposition of the water balance. Interannual closure check showed that all of the schemes have energy balance residuals less than ± 2 wm- 2. The mean annual ground heat flux is zero for three models (C,H,I). Three models (A,E,D) lose ground heat flux and two (B,G) have positive mean annual ground heat fluxes. Models fail to reproduce the annual net radiation. Large differences in the surface energy partitioning between latent and sensible heat fluxes have been observed among models and between sites. The Bowen ratio for Lucky Hills site (shrub) is 4. 86 opposed to 2. 23 for the Kendall site (grass). The among-model range of Bowen ratios for the grassland site varies from 1. 38 to 5. 30. In the shrub site it ranges between 2. 65 and 6. 27. Four models present the same partitioning independently of the site. Those differences suggest the possibility that different schemes predict different energy balance climatologies and that depending on the model probably different physical mechanism may be controlling the exchanges at the surface. In Lucky Hills most of the models (except H,B) represent well the annual latent heat flux but underestimate on the sensible by more than 15 %. In Kendall, only one model (D) represents the mean annual latent heat adequately and the rest of them underestimate it. Three (B, E, G) overestimate on the sensible heat and the underestimation of the others is not larger than 20 %. The monthly diurnal cycle of net radiation and sensible heat is better modeled than the cycle of latent heat or ground heat. Interannual water <b>balance</b> <b>check</b> showed that residuals of only three of the schemes (G,H,I) are less than ± 3 mm. All others fail to fulfill the criteria for closure. The partition of available water into runoff and evaporation reveal that models fail to plot along the total annual precipitation line. Models present a great variability in the individual terms of the 1 A: BATS 2, B: CBM, C:ISBA, D:NOAH, E:SEWAB, G:SPONSOR, H:SSIB, I:SWAP water balance, being estimates of runoff and soil moisture the most different. Comparison between model predicted runoff events and observations from stream gauges nearby the flux towers have been performed. In general, models present runoff when it has been recorded at the gauges and the majority of them also when no event has been observed. However, the differences in runoff quantity for a given event are very large among the models. The soil moisture estimates show very different behaviors and differences here are of orders of magnitude. These results point out serious shortcomings in the ability of LSM to reproduce water and energy exchanges in different semi-arid environments. Not only have we concluded that the parameterization need revision but that semi-arid regions constitute a complex environment within which an easy transferability of characteristics is not appropriate...|$|E
