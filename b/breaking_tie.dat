50|$|As President of the Senate (Article I, Section 3, Clause 4), {{the vice}} {{president}} oversees procedural matters and may cast a tie-breaking vote. There is a strong convention within the U.S. Senate that {{the vice president}} should not use their position as President of the Senate to influence the passage of legislation or act in a partisan manner, except in the case of <b>breaking</b> <b>tie</b> votes. As President of the Senate, John Adams cast 29 tie-breaking votes that was later surpassed by John C. Calhoun with 31, no other vice president since then has ever threatened this record. Adams's votes protected the president's sole authority over the removal of appointees, influenced the location of the national capital, and prevented war with Great Britain. On at least one occasion Adams persuaded senators to vote against legislation he opposed, and he frequently addressed the Senate on procedural and policy matters. Adams's political views and his active role in the Senate made him a natural target for critics of George Washington's administration. Toward the end of his first term, a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters caused him to exercise more restraint in hopes of seeing his election as President of the United States.|$|E
40|$|Tiebreakers are {{familiar}} tools for decisionmaking. Ready examples include penalty shootouts in soccer matches and vice presidents <b>breaking</b> <b>tie</b> {{votes in the}} Senate. But we lack a precise understanding of the concept and a normative theory {{for the use of}} tiebreakers. This Article strictly defines a tiebreaker as a kind of lexically inferior decision rule and then builds justifications for tiebreaking decision structures. Concentrating on situations in which ties are considered intolerable, the Article suggests methods for either preventing ties or designing sensible tiebreakers. As to the latter, tradeoffs are identified for the use of random variables, morally relevant variables, and doublecounted variables within a lexically inferior decision rule. Finally, the Article applies its conceptual and normative lessons to three problems: the best design for affirmative action programs, the proper interpretive method for legal texts, and the core function of adjudication. The closing sections evaluate law and adjudication as one large tiebreaker for the rest of social life, with contrasts and comparisons to some other major theories for the mission of courts in the United States...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{computational}} {{complexity of the}} problem of controlling the result of an election by <b>breaking</b> <b>ties.</b> When the chair is only asked to <b>break</b> <b>ties</b> to choose between one of the co-winners, the problem is trivially easy. However, in multi-round elections like STV, we prove that it can be NP-hard for the chair to compute how to <b>break</b> <b>ties</b> to ensure a given result. Our results contain several surprises. For example, whilst it is NP-hard to compute a ma-nipulating vote for a multi-round rule like Nanson, it is polynomial for the chair to control the result by <b>breaking</b> <b>ties.</b> As a second example, it can be NP-hard to control an election by <b>breaking</b> <b>ties</b> even with a simple two-stage voting rule. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{computational}} complexity {{of controlling the}} result of an election by <b>breaking</b> <b>ties</b> strategically. This problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding the winner of an election under parallel universes tie-breaking. When the chair of the election is only asked to <b>break</b> <b>ties</b> to choose between one of the co-winners, the problem is trivially easy. However, in multi-round elections, we prove that it can be NP-hard for the chair to compute how to <b>break</b> <b>ties</b> to ensure a given result. Additionally, we show that the form of the tie-breaking function can increase the opportunities for control. Indeed, we prove that it can be NP-hard to control an election by <b>breaking</b> <b>ties</b> even with a two-stage voting rule. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we analyse {{the effect}} of using {{appropriate}} <b>tie</b> <b>breaking</b> criteria in dispatch rules. We consider four different dispatch procedures, and {{for each of these}} heuristics we compare two versions that differ only in the way ties are broken. The first version <b>breaks</b> <b>ties</b> randomly, while the second uses a criterion that incorporates problem-specific knowledge. The computational results show that using adequate <b>tie</b> <b>breaking</b> criteria improves the performance of the dispatch heuristics. The magnitude of the improvement is different for the four heuristics, and also depends on the characteristics of each specific instance. The use of problem-related knowledge for <b>breaking</b> <b>ties</b> should therefore be given some consideration in the implementation of dispatch rules...|$|R
