5|$|June 9, 2015: Just {{four days}} after Andres brought record-breaking rain to the Desert Southwest, another {{low-pressure}} system containing the remnants of Hurricane Blanca <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> record-breaking rainfall to many Arizona cities, including Tucson and Yuma.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} post-war period, a {{shortage}} of machinery, tools, and materials, {{as well as a}} dearth of new orders, hampered operations. Some salvage work occurred, as well as rubble-clearance and basic repairs. One of the first, rare, major contracts was for a university hospital in Bonn, 1946-49. The introduction of the German mark in 1948 {{and the beginning of the}} Wirtschaftswunder <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> new work.|$|E
5|$|Following Pitt's {{death in}} January 1806, Wilberforce began to {{collaborate}} {{more with the}} Whigs, especially the abolitionists. He gave general support to the Grenville–Fox administration, which <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> abolitionists into the cabinet; Wilberforce and Charles Fox led the campaign in the House of Commons, while Lord Grenville advocated the cause in the House of Lords.|$|E
50|$|The end of 2011 <b>brought</b> three <b>more</b> {{important}} events.|$|R
50|$|Wagle also <b>brought</b> out <b>more</b> than 80 {{books in}} the {{capacity}} of a publisher.|$|R

5|$|Texas {{succeeded in}} its bid {{to join the}} United States in 1845, {{one of the key}} causes of the {{subsequent}} Mexican-American War. Texas' annexation <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> people to Texas. Ranching interests expanded around the bay, along with the growth of the farming and lumber enterprises in the region. The construction of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson (GH) Railroad, begun in 1857, further spurred more growth in the region.|$|E
5|$|Weakening as {{it crossed}} the peninsula, Dean emerged into the Bay of Campeche and re-strengthened {{before making a}} second {{landfall}} in Veracruz. Although the second landfall did not bring winds as intense as the first, it <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> rainfall and caused devastating landslides in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Between the two landfalls, Dean caused MXN$2billion (US$184million; 2007dollars) of damage and killed 13people.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1840s, European {{settlers}} cleared vast {{tracts of}} land for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. Europeans knew little of the kakapo until George Gray of the British Museum described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kakapo. In the late 19th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect {{as many as possible}} before the bird became extinct.|$|E

5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
5|$|Contact with Americans and Europeans in {{the early}} 19th century <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{first arrived}} on the {{southeast}} North American mainland in 1521, brought by Ponce de Leon on his second trip to the region, where they were used by officers, scouts and livestock herders. Later expeditions <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> horses and cattle to Spanish Florida. By the late 16th century, horses were used extensively in the local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing, especially {{in what is now}} northern Florida and southern Georgia. The horses brought to North America by the Spanish and subsequently bred there included Barbs, Garranos, Spanish Jennets, Sorraias, Andalusians and other Iberian breeds. Overall, they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds, including short backs, sloping shoulders, low set tails and wide foreheads.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum kept {{on making}} rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant {{was added to}} the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey—a change that <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during {{shooting}} involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead of Bond, who ends up just finding the man dead). For {{the last quarter of the}} movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, and changed the location of Bond and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice.|$|E
5|$|New Year's Eve of 1924 <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> illness. Wise's uncle Fred Gienke, his wife, Lily, {{and several}} of their {{children}} all began suffering stomach pains similar to those Hasel had experienced before her death. Several family members were hospitalized, and Lily and Fred were both dead by February 1925. In total, seventeen relatives were taken ill with similar symptoms {{in the fall and}} winter of 1924/1925. Four of the Gienke children were left partially paralyzed from the mysterious illness.|$|E

5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several combat service support branches.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the Grand Prix. Williams, Jaguar, Ferrari, Sauber and Prost all brought updated front wings. Ferrari also introduced a new underfloor and <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> powerful versions of their V10 engines for qualifying and the race. Williams installed extra cooling on their cars to combat high temperatures in qualifying. Minardi planned to introduce a new revision to their cars aerodynamic package which included a new engine cover, a titanium gearbox and rear suspension geometry. The team decided to only test the gearbox during the first free practice session.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{succeeded in}} its bid {{to join the}} United States in 1845 which helped launch the Mexican-American War. Texas' {{annexation}} <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> people to Texas and ranching interests around the bay began to grow. Throughout the 19th century Galveston remained Texas' dominant metropolis and the communities around the bay were strongly tied economically and culturally to the city though, as Houston began to develop, so did the Bay Area's ties to it. The construction of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad further spurred growth in the area.|$|E
25|$|The Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia in 1968 <b>brought</b> yet <b>more</b> persecution. One {{in four of}} the lecturers was affected in some way.|$|R

5|$|The old {{villages of}} Three Bridges, Crawley and Ifield lay within the ancient parishes of Crawley and Ifield. Both of their 13th-century parish churches are still used for Anglican worship. Expansion of the borough's {{boundary}} has <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> churches into Crawley, including the early 11th-century church at Worth—formerly an isolated Wealden village at {{the centre of}} its own large parish. Ifield was a centre of Nonconformism in the 17thcentury: its Friends Meeting House was built in 1676, when more than 25% of the village's residents were Dissenters.|$|E
5|$|To besiege the fortress, Ferdinand <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> than 400 Fussvolk (foot soldiers) {{and five}} squadrons of mounted soldiers, plus {{a half dozen}} heavy caliber cannons, called culverins. His soldiers, among them Spanish and Italian mercenaries, took up {{quarters}} in neighboring villages, a process accompanied by pillage, arson, murder and rape. On 18 November, {{the first day of}} the siege, Ferdinand sent a trumpeter and formally asked the fortress to surrender; the defending garrison replied that they had sworn their allegiance to Gebhard and would fight to the death for him.|$|E
5|$|Vijender {{appeared}} on Bollywood actor Salman Khan's game show 10 Ka Dum. He {{was accompanied by}} Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat. Other appearances includes the fourth season of the Indian dance reality show Nach Baliye with actress Bipasha Basu. Vijender is credited by the critics and the media for bringing the sport of boxing back into the limelight in India. His {{rise to the top}} rank of the boxing world has been an inspiration for the younger generation and has <b>brought</b> <b>more</b> aspirants and followers, to the sport.|$|E
