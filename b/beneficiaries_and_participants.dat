Some public officials from the Municipal Assembly, Ministries of Local Government and Rural Development, and Gender, Children and Social Welfare as well as a representative of project sponsors were also interviewed. Specifically, the key informants were interrogated on the structure, prospects and challenges of the project, how the transformation of perceived waste into some value and the marketability of the products occurs, and present a more nuanced account of the value chain than the over-simplified end-of-pipe approach. Answers were also sought for the role of the NGO as well as the relationship among the local authorities, the NGO and the local community.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of entrepreneurship as a veritable tool for poverty reduction {{in developing countries}} has accelerated economic growth and development. This study applied qualitative research design and collected data from fifteen informants; we analyze the data using Nvivo software and assess entrepreneurship public policies on the paucity of resources. The cardinal objectives of our study are to identify entrepreneurship potentials to moderate multidimensional economic challenges such as poverty, youth unemployment and suggest laudable strategies to policy makers in the Nigeria context. Findings from the study revealed that policy thrust, capacity building and provision of capital resources was discovered in concrete terms to revamp the illness of small and medium scale enterprises. We equally found that strengthening government commissions, agencies and directorates will unlock the multifarious challenges confronting entrepreneurship culture to lessen poverty. Finally, this paper passionately recommended for establishment of cooperatives, proven financial policies, expanding SMEs projects to the local governments, legislations and vigorous political will. Future research direction suggested for a quantitative research approach from the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>participants</b> of poverty alleviation programs in the study are...|$|E

Using Bernanke 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualization of the credit channel theory of monetary policy, {{the purpose of this}} correlational study was to investigate whether a subsidy program, the National Accelerated Agricultural Inputs Access Program (NAAIAP), affected the rates of fertilizer usage and food production in Kakamega County, Western Kenya. Purposive stratified sampling was used to select 114 participants consisting of 72 farmers in each of the 2 groups: NAAIAP <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>and</b> nonbeneficiaries. <b>Participants</b> completed a survey on fertilizer usage rates, income earned, and surplus maize yield. Data were analyzed using multiple regression to test whether there was a difference between the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>and</b> nonbeneficiary groups regarding income, surplus product, and the dependent variable of fertilizer usage. Results indicated that beneficiaries of NAAIAP credit program bought and prepared to use fertilizers significantly earlier than did their counterparts. Further, the results of multiple regression indicated significant positive correlation (p 3 ̆c. 05) between income earned from sale of surplus maize yield and quantity of fertilizer used by farmers in Kakamega County. These findings suggest that NAAIAP improved food security and farmers 2 ̆ 7 income in Kakamega Count. This study contributes to social change by recommending to subsidy program administrators in Kakamega County to consider policy changes. Such policy changes may improve program outreach to resource-poor farmers and improve income and product yield in the agricultural sector of Kenya...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a socio-economic monitoring survey of 110 sampled respondents/households across the 12 barangays of Cagayancillo, using a survey instrument through personal interviews. Findings show that on the average, the respondent was 48 years old, with 7 years of formal education, has lived in Cagayancillo for 31 years and belonged to a family/household with 6 members. Cagayanens had shifted to farming as the main source of their livelihood and income, while fishing was only second. Based on their income data, Cagayanens are living below poverty threshold level of income. Poverty incidence ranged from 67 - 79 % of the Cagayanen households. The income data for 1999 and 2004 when compared, plus the respondents' perception that present aquatic resources are not in good condition, somehow allude to the possibility that the Cagayanens may just easily fall on the vicious cycle of poverty and environmental degradation. The good news can be the increasing involvement of people in coastal resource management and conservation. By including the people in the main Cagayancillo islands as <b>beneficiaries</b> of <b>and</b> <b>participants</b> in the conservation efforts and projects, WWF-Philippines/ KKP has perhaps initiated a good momentum for a democratized and more sustainable stakeholders management of coastal resources in Cagayancillo. In order to sustain this momentum for continuous people's participation in coastal resource management and conservation, and eventually the alleviation of poverty in Cagayancillo, concerned policy makers and other entities need to consider some options, one of which is the continuation of conservation efforts started by WWF-Philippines for another 2 - 3 years...|$|R

MethodsThe project's applicants were 18 operational agencies in national long-term care institutions in Korea, <b>and</b> <b>participants</b> were care recipients (n =  2263) registered in long-term care institutions. We applied our healthcare system to the recruited participants for a 3 -month period from October 2012 to December 2012. We measured the community-based home healthcare services such as long-term care, health and medical service, and welfare and leisure service prior to and after applying the community-based home healthcare system. ResultsAfter the implementation of community-based home healthcare project, all community-based home healthcare services showed an increase than prior to the project implementation. The nutrition management service was the most increased and its increase rate was 628. 6 %. A comparison between the long-term care insurance <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>and</b> nonbeneficiaries showed that health and medical services’ increase rate of nonbeneficiaries was significantly higher than beneficiaries (p <  0. 001). ConclusionOur community-based home healthcare project might improve the service implementation for older adults and there was a difference in the increase rate of health and medical services between Korean national long-term care insurance <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>and</b> nonbeneficiaries...|$|R
