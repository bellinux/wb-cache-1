40|$|The <b>Bradypus</b> <b>variegatus</b> inhabits {{the forests}} of South America and feeds from leaves, {{branches}} and sprouts from different plants. Due to its diet {{and the lack of}} literature on the morphological aspect of Xenarthras, five <b>Bradypus</b> <b>variegatus</b> tongues from animals which died from natural causes were evaluated, and they came from Pará State Museum Emílio Goeldi and were donated to the Laboratory of Animal Morphological Research (LaPMA) from UFRA, for revealing the different types of papillae and epithelial-connective tissue. Macroscopically, the tongues presented elongated shape, rounded apex, body, root, median sulcus in the root's apex, and two vallate papillae. The mucous membrane of the tongue revealed a keratinized stratified pavement epithelium, while the ventral surface of the tongue was thin and smooth, not provided with any type of papillae. However, the dorsal surface of the tongue was irregular with the presence of three types of papillae: filiform, fungiform and vallate papillae. The filiform papillae found were of a simple type, presenting a rounded base, irregularly distributed with a larger concentration and development on the tongue's apex and body. The fungiform papilla showed a practically smooth surface with irregular format, with the presence of gustatory pores; these were found all over the dorsal surface, with larger concentration at the rostral part of the apex. Only two vallate papillae were observed disposed in the root of the tongue, surrounded by a deep groove, and revealing several taste buds. The tongues from <b>Bradypus</b> <b>variegatus</b> presented gustatory papillae similar to the ones described for other Xenarthras species and wild mammals...|$|R

Here we present the first descriptive allometric pattern of mandible form among the brown-throated sloth <b>Bradypus</b> <b>variegatus</b> (Schinz, 1825), based {{on the study of}} 25 specimens by means of geometric morphometric methods. The results obtained indicate that the species has a non-allometric slope, and therefore shape variation could hardly be explained by size. An established 'lever index', which can characterize the mandibular mechanical advantage, was maintained independently of the mandibular size.

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose the {{analysis}} of genetic diversity of the common three-toed sloth, <b>Bradypus</b> <b>variegatus,</b> {{in an attempt to}} understand population structure, identify divergent intraspecific units, and contribute to the knowledge of biodiversity in the neotropical forests. We analyzed a 387 bp segment of the mitochondrial DNA control region in 28 individuals distributed in different localities of both Atlantic and Amazon forests. Our results demonstrated that the genetic diversity of B. variegatus is distributed in six management units, MUs. The observed MUs encompass six phylogenetic lineages and represent respectively north and south regions of Atlantic forest, three regions within the Amazon forest, and a transition region between these two biomes. Considering the fact that these MUs are concordant with phylogroups and endemism areas already described for other vertebrate species, we can say that the study of B. variegatus, a widely distributed and not endangered species, can help to identify areas for conservation biology purposes in neotropical rain forests...|$|R

40|$|Sloths are {{considered}} {{to have one of}} the lowest mass-specific metabolic rates of any mammal and, in tandem with a slow digestive rate, have been theorized to have correspondingly low rates of ingestion. Here, we show in a study conducted over five months, that three captive <b>Bradypus</b> <b>variegatus</b> (Brown-throated sloths) had a remarkably low mean food intake of 17 g kg− 1 day− 1 (SD 4. 2). Food consumption was significantly affected by ambient temperature, with increased intake at higher temperatures. We suggest that the known fluctuation of sloth core body temperature with ambient temperature affects the rate at which gut fauna process digesta, allowing for increased rates of fermentation at higher temperatures. Since Bradypus sloths maintain a constantly full stomach, faster rates of fermentation should enhance digestive throughput, increasing the capacity for higher levels of food intake, thereby allowing increased energy acquisition at higher ambient temperatures. This contrasts with other mammals, which tend to show increased levels of food intake in colder conditions, and points to the importance of temperature in regulating all aspects of energy use in sloths...|$|R

By increasing the taxa density for anteaters and sloths {{we were able to}} clarify some points of the Pilosa phylogenetic tree. Our mitochondrial 16 S results show Bradypodidae as a monophyletic and robustly supported clade in all the analysis. However, the Pleistocene fossil Mylodon darwinii does not group significantly to either Bradypodidae or Megalonychidae which indicates that trichotomy best represents the relationship between the families Mylodontidae, Bradypodidae and Megalonychidae.

The teeth are extremely hypsodont and bilophodont, and the sagittal section. of each loph is triangular with a sharp edge. This suggests that the teeth were used mainly for cutting, rather than grinding, and that hard and fibrous food was not the main dietary component.

Almost 90 % of the misidentified specimens were B. variegatus from north-central Brazil, erroneously attributed to B. tridactylus. These misidentified specimens {{are reported in}} taxonomic reviews as the southernmost records of B. tridactylus. A history of confusing nomenclature regarding sloth species exists, and these particular misidentifications could be attributable to the similarity in face and throat color between B. variegatus from north-central Brazil and B. tridactylus. The molecular phylogeny of morphologically confirmed sloth specimens exhibits 2 monophyletic lineages representing B. variegatus and B. tridactylus. The split time between these 2 lineages was estimated at 6 million years ago (mya), contradicting previous studies that estimated this divergence to be 0. 4 mya. Taxonomic inconsistencies were detected when comparing the molecular phylogeny to previously published DNA sequences ascribed to B. tridactylus. Misidentification or introgression could underlie such phylogenetic incongruities.

The {{goal of this}} study was to {{determine}} basic ecology aspects such as: the home range, preference of vertical strata, time budget and diet. At the Agroecological Scientific Station Fatima (ECAF), located in the province of Pastaza, Ecuador, two females were released and monitored by telemetry system over a period of time of seven months. The following data was taken: Behavior, plant species of their diet and range of daily displacement. Released females maintain a home range of 8. 5 ha (female H- 001) and 3. 7 ha (female H- 002) with an average of 6. 1 ha according to the method of Minimum Convex Polygon. According to the method of Kernel, home range is 13. 2 ha and 5. 8 has with an average of 9. 5 ha. Arboreal vertical strata preferred by two individuals, is the canopy (H- 001 = 56. 7 % and H- 002 = 53. 5 %). We identified a total of 14 plant species as part of their diet, and the leafs were the only resource observed to be eaten. The behavior with the highest percentage registered was rest (H- 001 = 94. 7 % and H- 002 = 92, 42 %). This is the first report of this kind of data for Ecuador. Peer reviewe...|$|R
