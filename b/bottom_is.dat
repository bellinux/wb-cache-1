5|$|Like all blackwater {{streams in}} Florida, {{the color of}} most of the St. Johns is black, owing to the tannins in leaf litter and {{decaying}} aquatic plants. Spring fed streams, on the other hand, are remarkably clear and visibility is very high, even when the river <b>bottom</b> <b>is</b> dozens of feet below.|$|E
5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the <b>bottom</b> <b>is</b> reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E

2500|$|The Bottomless Pit was {{originally}} {{said to have}} no <b>bottom.</b> Stones <b>were</b> tossed into it, but no sound of the stones striking the <b>bottom</b> <b>was</b> heard.

The stones made no sound when they struck the <b>bottom</b> because they <b>were</b> lodged in the soft soil.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bottoms</b> v. <b>Bottoms</b> <b>was</b> a {{landmark}} child custody case in Virginia that awarded {{custody of the}} child to the grandmother instead of the mother, primarily because the mother was a lesbian. [...] In April 1993, Kay Bottoms sued her daughter, Sharon Bottoms, for custody of Sharon Bottoms' son, Tyler Doustou. On April 5, 1993 judge Buford Parsons ruled that Sharon <b>Bottoms</b> <b>was</b> an unfit parent and Kay <b>Bottoms</b> <b>was</b> awarded custody of her grandson. Sharon <b>Bottoms</b> <b>was</b> allowed visitation rights two days a week, but Tyler was not allowed in his mother’s home or to have any contact with his mother’s partner." ...|$|R

5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{granodiorite}} stele, {{found in}} 1799, inscribed with three {{versions of a}} decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King PtolemyV. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the <b>bottom</b> <b>is</b> in Ancient Greek. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone {{proved to be the}} key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E
5|$|The shadowed {{portion of}} the crater was imaged with the Terrain Camera of the Japanese SELENE {{spacecraft}} using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim. The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30° slope that leads down to a 6.6km diameter floor. The handful of craters along the interior span {{no more than a}} few hundred meters. The <b>bottom</b> <b>is</b> covered by an uneven mound-like feature that is 300 to 400m thick. The central peak is about 200m in height.|$|E
5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap <b>bottom</b> <b>is</b> covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E

5|$|Determined to {{make this}} the king's happiest {{birthday}} ever and save the day, SpongeBob sets out to find Triton and bring him to the party. Once found, Triton initially ignores SpongeBob, but after smelling SpongeBob's terribly smelly breath, he tells him to undo the lock. Unable to figure it out, SpongeBob calls his best friend, Patrick, to help out. Patrick unlocks Triton's cell, and the Prince escapes the island. No one anticipates Triton's wrath, Triton destroys Bikini Bottom. Noticing {{that something is wrong}} at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Patrick enter the building from the back, discovering the guests and staff locked in a cage. When Patrick unlocks the cell, Triton attempts to escape his father, who catches up to him. King Neptune can't tolerate his son's wrongdoings, but on seeing how Triton destroyed Bikini <b>Bottom,</b> <b>is</b> pleased that he's finally using powers, becoming a worthy successor. The family leaves for home, with King Neptune crediting SpongeBob for this development; the townsfolk of Bikini Bottom see differently, chasing him and Patrick in an angry mob.|$|E
5|$|The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and {{scapular}} {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a brown {{spot on the}} nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the <b>bottom</b> <b>is</b> faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and {{the bottom of their}} breasts are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown on the back and whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|E
5|$|This item, {{consisting}} of one painting and associated caption/text, was originally the third {{scene of the}} Matsudaira clan scroll before being reshaped into a hanging scroll by Masuda Donō in 1933. At some point it was in possession of the Ōkura clan　(大倉家), but it is now owned by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and in custody of the Tokyo National Museum. It was designated an Important Cultural Property on March 31, 1953. Like its preceding and successive scenes (scenes 2 and 3 from the Gotoh edition), the painting depicts the celebration for the 50th day {{of the birth of}} the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008). The main characters are in full dress in a room decorated with kichō partitioners and the prince's grandfather, Fujiwara no Michinaga at the <b>bottom</b> <b>is</b> offering rice cake (mochi) to the prince in a form of ceremonial ritual.
