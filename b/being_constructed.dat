40|$|The study {{aimed to}} verify Allardt's {{prosperity}} {{model in the}} field of economic prosperity based on the notions of being, loving and having and to explore the existence of possible correlation among sets of all three variables. Canonical correlation analysis to predict relative prosperity was performed for selected 110 nations with the focus on Romania and Slovenia. The study results for Romania for 2011 indicate low approval of the government, low confidence in the judicial system as well as in financial institutions, in addition to concerns about health prospects and lack of confidence in the transparency of elections for the loving construct. In addition, the <b>being</b> <b>construct</b> is also negative in Romania suggesting overall dissatisfaction with the economic status and development, indicating strong dissatisfaction with governmental efforts to address poverty and efforts regarding sanitation, concerns about environment, existing standard of living and life expectancy, suggesting a weak health system. The study further suggests for Slovenia for 2011 negative expectations for the loving construct and below average expectations for the <b>being</b> <b>construct.</b> The approval of the government and confidence in the judicial system and financial institutions in Slovenia is also low, the only positive expectation is the confidence in electoral system, but Slovenians are also worried about their health prospects. In addition, the <b>being</b> <b>construct</b> for Slovenia is also slightly below average, indicating dissatisfaction with economic development and below average satisfaction with water quality and environment, and life expectancy suggesting health system inefficiency. The longitudinal study for the time period from 2011 till 2016 suggests moderate improvements for Romania in eight areas of relative prosperity, especially for the natural environment, governance and education, and for Slovenia practically unchanged situation. The study further suggests that both nations still face numerous challenges but due to implement ation of certain structural reforms till 2016, albeit limited, some additional improvements regarding the economic prosperity of their citizens could be expected in the near future...|$|R

The {{project is}} broken into two parts: {{the first is}} constructing new travel lanes from I-485 interchange (exit 19) to West Catawba Avenue (exit 28), at an estimated cost of $57 million. The second would be to convert the existing HOV lanes from Brookshire Boulevard (exit 11) to I-485 (exit 19).

40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the level of psychological well being (PWB), negative affectivity, and perceived quality of life in a sample of fibromyalgic female patients. Methods: a clinical group of 48 women with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia presenting to receive clinical assistance at the Santa Chiara Hospital of Pisa (Italy) was compared to a group of 48 healthy controls recruited from the general population of the same area. Measures of PWB, negative affectivity, daily functional status, and perceived quality of life were obtained from standardised, self-administered rating scales. Statistical analyses focused on between-groups differences and on correlations among the major variables under the study. Results: cases showed significantly higher depression symptomatology, more difficulties in daily living/functioning skills, and a poorer perceived quality of life than normal controls. Between-groups differences in anxiety symptoms or in PWB dimensions did not attain statistical significance. When correlations were evaluated, cases did not show correlations between PWB and perceived quality of life, while controls had a positive correlation. Cases and controls had similar negative correlations between PWB and depression, between PWB and difficulties in daily living. Conclusion: fibromyalgic subjects seemed to link their perception of quality of life to the level of depression and the difficulties in daily living, and not to the psychological well <b>being</b> <b>constructs.</b> Healthy subjects showed to link their perception of quality of life to the level of depression, the difficulties in daily living, and the psychological well <b>being</b> <b>constructs...</b>|$|R
