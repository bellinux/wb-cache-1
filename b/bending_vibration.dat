50|$|For ammonia, NH3, the {{symmetric}} <b>bending</b> <b>vibration</b> {{is observed}} as two branches near 930 cm−1 and 965 cm−1. This so-called inversion doubling arises because the symmetric <b>bending</b> <b>vibration</b> {{is actually a}} large-amplitude motion known as inversion, in which the nitrogen atom passes through {{the plane of the}} three hydrogen atoms, similar to the inversion of an umbrella. The potential energy curve for such a vibration has a double minimum for the two pyramidal geometries, so that the vibrational energy levels occur in pairs which correspond to combinations of the vibrational states in the two potential minima. The two v = 1 states combine to form a symmetric state (1+) at 932.5 cm−1 above the ground (0+) state and an antisymmetric state (1−) at 968.3 cm−1.|$|E

50|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to obtain information about the different conformations of the methanium ion. The IR spectrum of plain methane has two C-H bands from symmetric and asymmetric stretching at around 3000 cm−1 and two bands around 1400 cm−1 from symmetrical and asymmetric bending vibrations. In the spectrum of CH5+ three asymmetric stretching vibrations are present around 2800 - 3000 cm−1, a rocking vibration at 1300 cm−1, and a <b>bending</b> <b>vibration</b> at 1100 1300 cm−1.|$|E

The asymmetric HCH <b>bending</b> <b>vibration</b> of methyl chloride is typical. It shows a series of intense Q-branches with weak rotational fine structure. Analysis of the spectra is made more complicated by the fact that the ground-state vibration is bound, by symmetry, to be a degenerate vibration, which means that Coriolis coupling also affects the spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|From 1942 to 1945 {{he was the}} Research Associate {{in charge}} of Vibration and Flutter, Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. It was during this time {{that he made a}} number of {{significant}} contributions to the theory and practice of engineering. In 1944, he published “A New Method of Calculating Natural Modes of Uncoupled <b>Bending</b> <b>Vibration</b> of Airplane Wings and Other Types of Beams”. An efficient numerical method for finding the undamped natural frequencies and mode shapes of structures modeled with numerous beam and inertia elements, the tabular procedure became known as the Myklestad Method. This approach while more complex, is similar to methods developed earlier for torsional systems, and in the introductory sections of Myklestad's article the path-finding work of Heinrich Holzer is credited. In 1945, a similar numerical method was published by M. A. Prohl, [...] "A General Method for Calculating Critical Speeds of Flexible Rotors". As a consequence the method is also often called the Myklestad-Prohl method or Prohl-Myklestad method. See also Rotordynamics.|$|E
50|$|In CO2, the <b>bending</b> <b>vibration</b> ν2 (667 cm−1) has {{symmetry}} Πu. The first {{excited state}} of ν2 is denoted 0110 (no excitation in the ν1 mode, one quantum of excitation in the ν2 bending mode with angular momentum about the molecular axis equal to ±1, no excitation in the ν3 mode) and clearly transforms {{according to the}} irreducible representation Πu. Putting two quanta into the ν2 mode leads to a state with components of symmetry (Πu × Πu)+ = Σ+g + Δ g. These are called 0200 and 0220, respectively. 0200 has the same symmetry (Σ+g) and a very similar energy to the first excited state of v1 denoted 100 (one quantum of excitation in the ν1 symmetric stretch mode, no excitation in the ν2 mode, no excitation in the ν3 mode). The calculated unperturbed frequency of 100 is 1337 cm−1, and, ignoring anharmonicity, the frequency of 0200 is 1334, twice the 667 cm−1 of 0110. The states 0200 and 100 can therefore mix, producing a splitting and also {{a significant increase in}} the intensity of the 0200 transition, so that both the 0200 and 100 transitions have similar intensities.|$|E
