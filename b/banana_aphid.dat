50|$|The <b>Banana</b> <b>aphid</b> (Pentalonia nigronervosa) is an aphid in the {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in {{the order}} Hemiptera. It is a true bug and sucks sap mainly from Musa species.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is known}} that <b>Banana</b> <b>aphid</b> (Pentalonia nigronervosa) transmits the virus from {{infected}} to healthy plants by feeding. Aphids feed on the plant phloem tissues by injecting their thin, flexible stylet into the epidermis of the plant tissue until it reaches the phloem of the leaves. Then the aphid injects saliva and sucks the cell contents. This ingestion of viral components is done inadvertently by the aphid. Vector transmission of the BBTV is circulative and non-propagative, meaning that transmission of the virus occurs from and to the phloem tissues and the virus does not replicate within the aphid’s midgut. Acquisition of the virus by the <b>banana</b> <b>aphid</b> requires about 18 hours of feeding and then the aphid can retain the virus for approximately two weeks. [...] The retransmission of this virus can happen after as little as two hours of feeding on a healthy plant however it takes about {{a month for the}} BBTD symptoms to appear after infection. To infect, the carrier aphid can feed on the banana plant for as few as 15 minutes, but more often a couple hours, as the longer feeding time will increase the odds of transmission. The suckers produced on infected plants that would usually be used for planting the next season will also be diseased, which is one way the disease can spread from year to year. Banana aphids also have the capability to feed on Heliconia and flowering ginger; however, these alternate hosts of the aphid vector are not hosts of the virus. The ability of banana aphids to feed on alternate hosts {{is important to keep in}} mind when attempting to control the virus.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of two Sternorrhyncha species, the <b>banana</b> <b>aphid</b> (Pentalonia nigronervosa Coquerel (Hemiptera: Aphididae, Aphidinae)), vector of the banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), and the latania scale (Hemiberlesia lataniae Signoret (Hemiptera: Diaspididae, Diaspidinae)) with Musa acuminata balbisiana Colla (ABB Group) ‘Bluggoe’ (Musaceae) was investigated {{by a combination}} of conventional and spatially resolved analytical techniques, 1 H NMR, UHPLC-MS, and matrix-free UV-laser desorption/ionization MS imaging. After infestation, the feeding sites of P. nigronervosa on the pseudostem and the exocarp of banana fruit developed a red tinge, in which tissue-specific accumulations of phenylphenalenones were discovered. Phenylphenalenones were also detected in the black mats of sooty molds growing on the <b>banana</b> <b>aphid</b> exudates and in the dorsal scales of H. lataniae. This suggests that although these secondary metabolites {{play a role in the}} reaction of banana plants towards attack by sucking insects, an aphid and an armored scale have established mechanisms to exude these metabolites before they deploy their deleterious effect...|$|E
50|$|Control {{of banana}} bunchy top is {{achieved}} by killing the <b>banana</b> <b>aphids</b> then destroying all infected material. First, the aphids should be killed on the infected banana material, {{and then all the}} plant material should be destroyed {{to prevent the spread of}} the virus. Infected banana plants can be sprayed with an insecticide like Sevin to reduce or get rid of the aphid population, since control of viruses starts with control of the vectors. The agriculture department, however, recently obtained an EPA waiver for the pesticide Provado is a means of controlling the aphids that spread the disease.|$|R
5000|$|Banana bunchy top is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by a}} {{single-stranded}} DNA virus called the Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV). It was first identified in Fiji in 1891, and has spread around the world since then. Like many viruses, BBTV was named after the symptoms seen, where the infected plants are stunted and have [...] "bunchy" [...] leaves at the top. The disease is transmitted from plant-to-plant in tropical regions of the world by <b>banana</b> <b>aphids,</b> which can also feed on Heliconia and flowering ginger (from the Zingiberaceae family), which {{is an important factor in}} control of the disease. There are no resistant varieties, so controlling the spread by vectors and plant materials are the only management methods. Symptoms include spotting any deformed plant appearance.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Aphids {{are known}} to live in {{symbiosis}} with speciÞc bacteria called endosymbionts that havepositiveornegative impactson theirhosts. In this study, sixbananaaphid(Pentalonianigronervosa Coquerel) strains fromvariousgeographicalorigins(Gabon,Madagascar, andBurundi) were screened to determine their symbiotic content, using complementary genomic (16 S rDNA sequencing and speciÞc polymerase chain reaction) and proteomic (two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis coupled with protein identiÞcation by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-ßight mass spectrometry) approaches. Despite the geographical heterogeneity, the combined methods allowed us to identify the same two symbionts in the six aphids strains tested: Buchnera aphidicola and Wolbachia. Although B. aphidicola is found in almost all aphid species, the systematic presence of Wolbachia in <b>banana</b> <b>aphids</b> is particularly interesting, as this bacterium usually has a low prevalence in aphid species. Phylogenetic analyses showed that theWolbachia sp. strain found in P. nigronervosa was {{very similar to the}} strain present in aphids of the genusCinara, known to have developed a strong and long-term symbiotic association with Wolbachia. The high level of asexual reproduction in P. nigronervosa could be linked to the presence of Wolbachia, but its prevalence also suggests that this symbiotic bacterium could play a more essential role in its aphid host...|$|R
40|$|Most parasitoids of aphids {{are small}} wasps {{belonging}} to the families Braconidae or Aphelinidae. However, some dipteran parasitoids are also known to use aphids as hosts. We describe and give life-history information on a new species of aphid parasitoid, Endaphis fugitiva Gagne and Muratori, found to parasitize the <b>banana</b> <b>aphid,</b> Pentalonia nigronervosa Coquerel, the vector of banana bunchy top virus. Field and laboratory observations show that fly eggs are laid on the leaves near an aphid colony, the newly hatched fly larvae search for hosts while crawling on the leaf, and then penetrate the aphid between the legs and thorax. They develop as koinobiont endoparasitoids, and eventually emerge from the aphid anus and {{fall to the ground}} to pupate in the soil. We provide data relevant to parasitoid rearing on patterns of emergence, adult longevity, and effects of pupation substrate on adult emergence rate, and we discuss the potential of this new species to contribute to the biocontrol of <b>banana</b> <b>aphid</b> in Hawaii.

40|$|Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) {{severely}} {{affects the}} sustainability of Hawaii’s banana crop industry. Although the virus rarely kills the plant, infection severely limits production of marketable fruit. The only known vector of BBTV is the <b>banana</b> <b>aphid</b> (Pentalonia nigronervosa, Hemiptera: Aphididae). This study was conducted on three farms located in Kahuku, Waialua and Waianae {{on the island of}} Oahu, Hawaii. Within each farm, 16 plots were set up in a grid pattern for monthly sampling. Average numbers of aphids were compared with ANOVA for each farm by month. Taylor’s Power Law was used to determine dispersion within plantations. There were no distinct patterns in seasonal distribution, but aphid numbers were negatively correlated with rainfall in some plantations. An aggregated dispersion pattern was evident in plantations with lesser cultural management inputs. We also observed a seasonal edge-effect (larger numbers of aphids closest to plantations’ edges). Due to the vector status of <b>banana</b> <b>aphid,</b> an understanding of the seasonal and spatial distribution of banana aphids is an important component in developing efficient BBTV management strategies...|$|E

Using specific primers the BBTV-DNA-R was amplified, cloned into a prokaryote vector, sequenced and a molecular comparative analysis of BBTV-DNA-R {{of this study}} and some overseas isolates of BBTV-infected banana plants was determined. Results showed that the component 1 consists of 1108 nts and contains a sequence of 69 nts representing the CR-SL of 31 nts. A CR-M (90 nts) at the position (972 – 1062) characterized with GC-rich sequence from nts 76 to 90 (average of 80 % G+C) was found. Alignment results of BBTV DNA-R confirmed {{the presence of a}} number of conserved regions in all isolates. Large ORF of 861 nts at position 102 to 962 in the virion sense were detected. The predicted protein of this ORF consisted of 286 amino acids and had a molecular weight of 33. 8 kDa. The DNA-phylogenetic analysis showed a percent identity of 98. 0 and 97. 9 between BBTV DNA-R and isolates of Pakistan (isolate TJ 1) and Australia (isolate V 1), respectively. The similarities between the gene product of Egyptian BBTV DNA-R and the 30 overseas isolates ranged from 93. 7 to 99. 0 %. Differences in phylogenetic trees based on the entire sequence of BBTV DNA-R, CR-M and amino acid sequences confirmed the existence of two taxonomic groups of BBTV and the Egyptian isolate belongs to the south pacific group...|$|R

40|$|Banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) is {{a serious}} threat to banana and {{plantain}} (Musa spp.) production. BBTD is caused by the Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV, genus Babuvirus) which is spread through infected plant propagules and <b>banana</b> <b>aphid,</b> Pentalonia nigronervosa. A high level of resistance to BBTD in Musa spp. has not been yet discovered, but there is a wide range of susceptibility among Musa genotypes. In this study, performance of 16 Musa genotypes to BBTD infection was studied during 37 months in two replicated field experiments planted in a BBTD-endemic location in the South region of Cameroon. BBTD expression varied among genotypes without any specific patterns related to their genomic composition. In Abang Minko'o, highest BBTD incidence was observed in Cavendish Williams (100 %) and in the plantain hybrid variety PITA 23 (91. 6 %). A larger group of 11 genotypes including 4 plantain landraces, 3 hybrid plantains, 3 hybrid bananas and a Cavendish Grande Nain were susceptible with incidence between 40 and 80 %. The disease incidence was least in Gros Michel and Fougamou which after 37 months had less than 20 % symptomatic plants. In Kou'ou-si, 60 % BBTD incidence was observed on PITA 23 while two plantain landraces (Asung Mbele, Big Essong) and Gros Michel remained uninfected at 37 months after planting. The <b>banana</b> <b>aphid</b> was present on all genotypes; but excepting PITA 23 and Williams in Abang Minko'o and PITA 14 and PITA 23 in Kou'ou-si, the occurrence of infection was not correlated to aphid abundance.

Using the DNA-S and DNA-R segments of the virus genome, the genetic diversity of BBTV isolates was also determined from these countries relative to virus isolates across the banana-growing regions around the world. The results established that BBTD is widely prevalent in all parts of DRC, Malawi, Angola and Gabon, in south and western part of Cameroon. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of DNA-S and DNA-R indicate that BBTV isolates from these countries are genetically identical forming a unique clade within the ‘South Pacific’ phylogroup that includes isolates from Australia, Egypt, South Asia and South Pacific. These results imply that farmers’ traditional practice of transferring vegetative propagules within and between countries, together with virus spread by the widely prevalent <b>banana</b> <b>aphid</b> vector, Pentalonia nigronervosa, could have contributed to the geographic expansion of BBTV in SSA.

A collection of 43 genotypes was assembled, representing the major genomic groups of edible bananas, as well as related wild species. Six replicates of each were planted at Waimanalo, Oahu, in March 2012. From its installation, the planting was exposed to natural populations of virus-vectoring aphids, and symptom development was recorded from August 2012 until November 2014. Four edible cultivars, ‘Kayinja’, ‘NPV’, ‘Highgate’ and ‘Cocos’, and one wild species, Musa acuminata subsp. malaccensis, displayed low incidence of BBTV over the course of field observation, and have favorable agronomic or breeding characteristics. These five most desirable field clones were also manually inoculated with viruliferous aphids in the greenhouse and observed for a period of three months. All plants were evaluated for disease symptoms, and presence or absence of virus was confirmed by PCR assays.

Information available on the interactions between BBTV and its vector is very limited. The goal of this work is to foster {{a basic understanding of}} BBTV-aphid interaction that will allow the generation of new options for the management of the disease. I have developed an immunofluorescence assay that allowed us to specifically localize BBTV into the anterior midgut (stomach) and into specific cells forming the principal salivary glands within the aphid vector. In order to examine the translocation and retention of BBTV into the aphid vector, I used timecourse experiments and transmission assays coupled with real-time PCR and immunofluorescence assays on dissected aphid tissues. These results indicate that BBTV is internalized into the anterior midgut in which it accumulates and is retained at concentrations higher than either in the haemolymph or in the principal salivary glands. I document that the anterior midgut and principal salivary glands can have direct contact within the aphid body, suggesting a possible haemolymph-independent translocation path. Through additional experiments, I have analyzed the interaction between GroEL proteins produced by the endosymbiotic bacterium Buchnera aphidicola, harbored within the aphid, and BBTV viral particles. Interaction assays were performed using immunocapture PCR, dot-blot, and far-western blot assays. However, I failed to obtain evidence of BBTV-GroEL interaction. Furthermore, I have used transmission assays, real-time PCR and immunofluorescence to analyze the localization, accumulation, and transmission efficiency of BBTV across 4 different lineages of Pentalonia, including Pentalonia caladii, a species colonizing heliconias, ginger and taro.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 68 - 70). vii, 75 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmAphids are small, soft-bodied insects with sucking mouthparts {{that belong}} to the order Hemiptera, suborder Sternorrhyncha, family Aphididae. Their reproduction can be parthenogenetic or sexual, with cyclical parthenogenesis and associated host alteration being {{a feature of the}} family. Aphids often alternate between viviparity and oviparity, and may exhibit polyphenism, showing different sexual and morphological forms. Their development is hernimetabolous (Dixon 1998). There are approximately 4000 species described worldwide, most of which are present in temperate 4 regions (Dixon et al. 1987). Approximately 250 species are considered to be agricultural pests (Blackman and Eastop 1984). Problems associated with aphids include direct feeding damage and powdery mildew associated with honeydew excretion, but aphids are often only considered of economic importance as vectors of plant viruses (Agnos 1997). Monitoring for the presence of a pest can provide knowledge about its distribution, changes in its abundance, and provide information for the development of sustainable control strategies. The central component of monitoring is insect sampling (Binns et al. 2000; Dent 2000). Different types of sampling plans for aphids on several crops have been published, such as soybean (Hodgson et al. 2004; Onstad et al. 2005), tomatoes (Hummel et al. 2004), and Brussels sprouts (Wilson et al. 1983). At present, there are no sampling plans available for <b>banana</b> <b>aphid,</b> in Hawaii or elsewhere. Without such a plan, control efforts for P. nigronervosa cannot be undertaken in an economical and ecologically sound fashion, in keeping with the principles of integrated pest management (Dent 2000). Summary of chapters. Because the pathogen vectored by P. nigronervosa is affecting Hawaii's banana industry so adversely, I studied aspects of the biology, ecology, and control of this organism. Without understanding of the biology and ecology of P. nigronervosa, long term control of BBID will be difficult. Relevant local studies would be helpful to formulate effective control strategies for this aphid and its vectored pathogen. Control strategies for P. nigronervosa cannot be consistently applied without an effective aphid sampling plan, so I have chosen to formulate one. In addition, I have studied the efficacy of the newly approved chemical control for P. nigronervosa - imidacloprid - (commercial name - Provado 1. 6 F®) ...|$|E
40|$|Plantain {{and banana}} (Musa spp.) {{are among the}} most {{important}} staple crops for food and income generationfor the rural and urban populations in the humid forest agroecological zone of West Africa. Until recently,Cucumber mosaic virus (genus Cucumovirus) and Banana streak virus (genus Badnavirus) were the onlyviruses reported to occur in Musa spp. in West Africa. In 2011, an outbreak of banana bunchy top disease(BBTD) caused by Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV; genus Babuvirus, family Nanoviridae) was reported inOuémé Département (6 ° 30 ′N and 2 ° 36 ′E) in the Republic of Benin (2). BBTV {{is one of the most}} economicallyimportant pathogens of Musa spp. It is well established in Central Africa and also in Angola, Malawi, andZambia in Southern Africa (2). Plants infected at early growth stages are severely dwarfed and do not bearfruit. BBTV is transmitted by the <b>banana</b> <b>aphid</b> Pentalonia nigronervosa, which is widespread in Africa (1). Theregions in the Republic of Benin affected by BBTV border Ogun State (7 ° 00 ′N and 3 ° 35 ′E) of Nigeria. Epidemiological investigations were conducted during May 2012 at 31 locations in Ogun State to determinethe potential risk of BBTV spreading into Nigeria. Plants with typical symptoms of BBTD (stunting, narrow andshortened leaves, chlorotic streaks on petioles and pseudostem) were observed in four locations: Ilashe,Odan-Itoro, Ido-Ologun, and Igbogila. Total DNA was extracted from 90 leaf samples randomly collected fromsymptomatic and asymptomatic banana and plantain plants in these areas. Samples were tested for BBTV bypolymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primer pairs, mREP-F and mREP-R, which amplifies a 241 -bp of BBTVDNA-mRep segment (1), and Scp-F and Scp-R specific for approximately 1075 -bp BBTV DNA-S that encodescoat protein gene (1). The amplicons of expected size were obtained from 17 of 90 samples analyzed(18. 8 %). BBTV in the symptomatic plants was further confirmed by nucleic acid spot hybridization (NASH) assay using DIG-labeled 1, 075 -bp probe corresponding to coat protein gene and chromogenic detection as perthe previously described protocol (3). The DIG-probe specifically reacted with nucleic acid from thesymptomatic plants, but not with negative controls, providing conclusive evidence for the BBTV. The PCRproducts of DNA-mRep segment amplified from three banana plants infected with BBTV collected in Ilashe(Ipokia Local Government Area) were purified and sequenced in both directions. The sequences of theseisolates were 100 % identical with each other (GenBank Accession Nos. JX 290301, JX 290302, and JX 290303). A BLASTn search revealed 100 % nucleotide sequence identity with a BBTV isolate from Benin (JQ 437548) and 99 to 100 % identity with DNA-mRep sequences of several other BBTV isolates from Africa, Australia, India,and the South Pacific. Further analysis of the 241 -bp mRep gene sequences with Neighbor-Joiningphylogenetic analysis grouped the BBTV isolate with the South Pacific isolates. To our knowledge, this is thefirst report of BBTV in Nigeria. This underscores need for surveys to assess the extent of BBTV spread inNigeria and strict implementation of phytosanitary measures, including restrictions on the movement ofplanting material from disease-affected regions, to prevent further spread of this important disease.

40|$|Bananas are an {{important}} subsistence and export crop with over 130 tonnes of banana produced annually. Domesticated banana are triploid and sterile and {{it is thought that}} wild diploid bananas were domesticated between 7, 000 and 10, 000 years ago somewhere in the region of Indonesia, Philippines, New Guinea or the Southeast Asia peninsula. Triploid bananas were subsequently moved around the world through vegetative propagules and more recently through tissue culture. A number of diseases are associated with bananas, including banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) and banana streak disease (BSD), both caused by DNA viruses. BBTD is caused by Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus (genus Babuvirus; family Nanoviridae). Characteristic symptoms of BBTD are severe stunting of the plant and bunching of the leaves, with a green dot-dash streak {{on the underside of the}} leaves. Both viruses can cause severe crop loss and are of concern to banana growing regions. BSD is caused by a number of banana-infecting badnaviruses species (Badnavirus; Caulimoviridae), all of which contain a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. Characteristic symptoms of BSD include chlorotic and necrotic streaks on the leaves, which are not always seen across all leaves, or even across an entire leaf. BBTV is a multi-component virus which is transmitted by the <b>banana</b> <b>aphid</b> Pentalonia nigronervosa. It is the type member of the babuviruses, which contains two other accepted species, Cardamom bushy dwarf virus (CBDV) and Abaca bunchy top virus (ABTV), which infect large cardamom and Musa spp, respectively. It is generally accepted that the genome of BBTV consists of six different components, with each component individually encapsidated. BBTV is able to evolve through recombination, reassortment and mutation. The large numbers of sequenced BBTV components in Chapter Two and Three (927), and publically available component sequences, have allowed for in-depth analyses into the diversity and evolution of this important plant pathogen. Our analysis shows that both reassortment and recombination play a significant role in the evolution of BBTV. Additionally, we found high genetic diversity in two geographic regions, the Southeast Asian / Far East region and the Indian subcontinent. Phylogenetic analysis of all full genomes, with recombinant regions and reassorted components removed, identified that the BBTV genomes circulating in the majority of countries have likely originated from single founder populations. All nanoviruses contain two common regions which are common across species. The common region stem-loop (CR-SL) is involved in initiation of replication and is recognised by the replication-associated protein (Rep), encoded in the DNA-R component. The Rep recognises cognate components through iteron sequences in the CR-SL and nicks the component at the nonanucleotide motif to initiate replication. The common region major (CR-M) is involved in secondary strand replication. The large amount of sequence data generated in Chapters Two and Three, and a recent deposition of a large number of CBDV sequences, allowed a comprehensive analysis of the common regions of the babuviruses. All CR-SL across the three species showed high similarity including the iteron sequences. The CR-M regions however were not similar across the species. Alphasatellites, which only encode a Rep, have previously been found associated with some babuvirus, nanovirus and geminivirus isolates. Therefore these were also analysed for common regions. The babuvirus alphasatellites were more similar to the other alphasatellites than to the babuvirus components. Both BBTV and banana-infecting badnaviruses are DNA viruses which infect the same host species, therefore the banana material that was collected for BBTV analyses was also screened for three species of banana-infecting badnaviruses. Species specific screening primers were designed for Banana streak MY virus (BSMYV), Banana streak OL virus (BSOLV) and Banana streak GF virus (BSGFV) across the movement protein motif located on open reading frame (ORF) three. With these primers we had a higher detection rate, for all three species, compared to previously published primers for banana-infecting badnaviruses. Eighty-two banana samples from 11 countries were found to be positive for at least one badnavirus, with the majority containing BSMYV. Of the 82 positive samples, 51 samples were also positive for BBTV. Banana-infecting badnaviruses are able to exist in two forms, a circular episomal infective form which is transmitted by a number of mealybug species and an endogenous form which is integrated into the banana genome and does not cause symptoms. However, a number of endogenous forms have been identified which are able to reactivate from the Musa genome into the episomal infectious form. As both forms are potentially able to cause infection, detection of either form is important in the identification of clean planting stock. This PhD thesis investigated banana infecting DNA viruses, Banana bunchy top virus and three banana-infecting badnaviruses. In-depth analyses of the global diversity, evolution and the dispersal of BBTV were undertaken. The common regions of the babuviruses and alphasatellites were characterised and screening primers for BSMYV, BSOLV and BSGFV were designed...|$|E
