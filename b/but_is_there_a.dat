Under ordinary circumstances this would probably have occurred. In times that did not force one to ponder, {{it is not likely}} I should have recoiled from uniting myself with a party formed of the best families in England, and ever famous for accomplished men and charming women. But I enter life {{in the midst of a}} convulsion in which the very principles of our political and social systems are called in question. I cannot unite myself with the party of destruction. It is an operative cause alien to my being. What, then, offers itself? The Duke talks to me of Conservative principles; but he does not inform me what they are. I observe indeed a party in the State whose rule it is to consent to no change, until it is clamorously called for, and then instantly to yield; but those are Concessionary, not Conservative principles. This party treats institutions as we do our pheasants, they preserve only to destroy them. <b>But</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> statesman among these Conservatives who offers us a dogma for a guide, or defines any great political truth which we should aspire to establish? It seems to me a, barren thing, this Conservatism, an unhappy cross-breed; the mule of politics that engenders nothing. What do you think of all this, Coningsby? I assure you I feel confused, perplexed, harassed. I know I have public duties to perform; I am, in fact, every day of my life solicited by all parties to throw the weight of my influence in one scale or another; but I am paralysed. I often wish I had no position in the country. The sense of its responsibility depresses me; makes me miserable. I speak to you without reserve; with a frankness which our short acquaintance scarcely authorises; but Henry Sydney has so often talked to me of you, and I have so long wished to know you, that I open my heart without restraint.' ...|$|E

5000|$|In December 2004, Donohue defended Mel Gibson's movie The Passion of the Christ. During a {{discussion}} of the film on the television show Scarborough Country, Donohue said: Hollywood is controlled by secular Jews who hate Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular. It's not a secret, OK? And I'm not afraid to say it. That's why they hate this movie. It's about Jesus Christ, and it's about truth. It's about the Messiah. When Rabbi Shmuley Boteach responded calling Donohue's statement anti-Semitic, Donohue said: In short, I did not single out secular Jews as some have said. Nonetheless, I do regret using the verb [...] "controlled", and that is because it suggests that there is some kind of cabal among secular Jews. That's nonsense. <b>But</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> segment of the secular Jewish community that is anti-Catholic? Absolutely.|$|E
50|$|Guru Gobind Singh, who had {{abolished}} {{the institution of}} masands replaced charan pahul with khanda di Pahul. He summoned a special assembly in the Keshgarh Fort at Anandpur on the Baisakhi day of 1756 Bk/30 March 1699. After the morning devotions and kirtan, he suddenly stood up, drawn sword in hand, and, to quote Bhai Santokh Singh, Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth, spoke: “The entire sangat is very dear to me; <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> devoted Sikh who will give his head to me here and now? A need has arisen at this moment which calls for a head.” A hush fell over the assembly. Daya Ram , a shopkeeper of Lahore, arose and offered himself. He walked behind the Guru to a tent near by. Guru Gobind Singh returned with his sword dripping blood and demanded another head. The Guru again asked for another head, this time Dharam Singh from Hastinapur or modern Meerut, presented himself to the Guru. Guru Gobind Singh gave three more calls. Mohkam Chand, a calico printer/tailor from Dwarka, Gujarat, Himmat Rai, a water-bearer from Jagannath Puri, Orissa, and Sahib Chand, a barber from Bidar, Karnataka stood up one after another and advanced to offer their heads. They were the first five Sikhs as understood in modern parlance.|$|E
