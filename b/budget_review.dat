5|$|The TGS with Tracy Jordan crew have {{finished}} taping their fiftieth episode {{and decide to}} celebrate. Their boss, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), goes to the writers' room and tells the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), about how the whole company is undergoing cutbacks. After an unsuccessful presentation about TGS, Brad Halster (Roger Bart)—one of the consultants {{in charge of the}} cutbacks—informs Liz that she needs to cut her annual budget by 25 percent. Liz, anxious about her employees losing their jobs, decides to use sexual bartering to solve the problem and asks Brad on a date, which he accepts. Liz dresses in the trashiest outfit she can find, and goes on her date. The next day, she discovers that cutbacks are still taking place at TGS, and confronts Brad. Realizing that he was being used, Brad charges Liz with sexual harassment and she is suspended from work for two weeks. Jack tells Liz that the <b>budget</b> <b>review</b> process will start over again, this time under his supervision.|$|E

25|$|Several {{government}} agencies provide budget data. These include the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Treasury Department. The CBO publishes The Budget and Economic Outlook in January, which covers a ten-year window and is typically updated in August. It also publishes a Long-Term Budget Outlook in July and a Monthly <b>Budget</b> <b>Review.</b> The OMB, {{which is responsible}} for organizing the President's budget presented in February, typically issues a budget update in July. The GAO and the Treasury issue Financial Statements of the U.S. Government, usually in the December following the close of the federal fiscal year, which occurs September 30. There is a corresponding Citizen's Guide, a short summary. The Treasury Department also produces a Combined Statement of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances each December for the preceding fiscal year, which provides detailed data on federal financial activities.|$|E

40|$|Examining the origins, conduct, {{conclusions}} of, {{and reactions}} to, previous <b>budget</b> <b>reviews</b> {{provides some indications}} about how the current National Commission of Audit might unfold. Introduction On 22 October 2013 the Abbott Government announced {{the appointment of a}} National Commission of Audit. In announcing the review, Treasurer Joe Hockey and Finance Minister Cormann said ‘[i]t is …essential that the Commonwealth government live within its means and begin to pay down debt’. The review, headed {{by the president of the}} Business Council of Australia, Tony Shepherd AO, has broad terms of reference that are intended to allow it to ‘assess the role and scope of Government, as well as ensuring taxpayers’ money is spent wisely and in an efficient manner. 2 ̆ 7 The other members of the Commission are the current head of the New South Wales Independent Regulatory and Pricing Tribunal, Dr Peter Boxall AO, former public servants Tony Cole AO and Robert Fisher AM, and former politician Amanda Vanstone. The appointment of the current Commission of Audit has not passed without criticism. For example, the Shadow Finance Minister, Tony Burke has described the review as a ‘Commission of Cuts,’ and declared that it was ‘an extraordinary outsourcing of the responsibilities of Government across to big business’. The current National Commission of Audit is but one in a long series of <b>budget</b> <b>reviews</b> that have been conducted by Commonwealth, state and territory governments in Australia. Many previous reviews have largely been forgotten by the general public and sometimes even by the governments that have commissioned them. Others provided broad recommendations that have assisted in providing coherence and purpose to what have usually been new administrations. Examining the origins, conduct and conclusions of, and reactions to previous reviews provides some indications about how the current National Commission of Audit might unfold. While every review is inevitably a product of its time and the political and economic circumstances in which it was commissioned, there are recurring themes that emerge from many of these exercises. Arguably, the general nature of the findings and recommendations of <b>budget</b> <b>reviews</b> can be broadly predicted, but how—and even if—governments respond to them cannot.   Examining past reviews may also show whether the current review has provided genuinely new approaches to managing and prioritising Commonwealth expenditure and service delivery, or has rehashed well-worn policy prescriptions posed repeatedly by prior reviews...|$|R

40|$|Although {{often viewed}} as a {{premature}} and difficult activity, evaluation of state advanced technology programs has commenced in response to annual state <b>budget</b> <b>reviews.</b> Three issues related to evaluation of state advanced technology programs are examined here: (1) the political and institutional context within which evaluation is being performed; (2) technical issues concerning the specification of outcomes, reliance on process indicators such as leveraging ratios, and dependence on self-reported assessments for outcome measures; and (3) the limits to program evaluation {{as a guide to}} policymaking. The diffusion of specific evaluation approaches may be exerting an independent influence on programmatic characteristics of other states, shaping both the relative emphasis accorded different objectives and the choice of evaluation techniques...|$|R
