25|$|Paulson {{agreed with}} Bernanke {{that the only}} way to unlock the frozen capital markets was to provide direct {{injections}} into financial institutions so investors would have confidence in these institutions. The government would take a non-voting share position, with 5% dividends for the first year on the money lent to the banks and 9% thereafter until the banks stabilized and could repay the government loans. According to the book Too <b>Big</b> <b>To</b> <b>Fail,</b> Paulson, Bernanke, New York Federal Reserve Chairman Timothy Geithner, and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair attended the meeting on October 13, 2008, at which this plan was presented to the CEOs of nine major banks.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues in the regulatory reform debate is that of systemically important financial institutions. This paper proposes a framework for identifying and supervising such institutions; the framework is designed to remove the advantages they derive from becoming systemically important and to give them more time-consistent incentives. It defines criteria for classifying firms as systemically important: size (the classic doctrine of too <b>big</b> <b>to</b> let <b>fail)</b> and the four C’s of systemic importance (contagion, concentration, correlation, and conditions); it also discusses the concept of progressive systemic mitigation.

500|$|The {{most recent}} reform came {{into effect in}} July 2010 when President Obama signed [...] "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act". The act covers {{a broad range of}} changes. The {{highlights}} of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence, ends too <b>big</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> bail outs, advance warning system, transparency and accountability for exotic instruments, executive compensation and corporate governance, protects investors, and enforces regulations on the books. The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower, which was established to administer the SEC's whistleblower program. Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $1,000,000 sanction. The rewards are between 10% and 30% of the dollar amount collected. Whistleblowers help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on. The result is less harm to investors, quickly holding offenders responsible, and to maintain the integrity of the U.S. markets.|$|E

40|$|Currently, the Big Four {{accounting}} firms – PwC, EY, Deloitte, and KPMG – dominate the audit oligopoly. Many {{have raised the}} question: “Are the Big Four too big or too few to fail?” This paper looks at the history {{leading up to the}} establishment of the Big Four, cases since the fall of Arthur Andersen, and empirical evidence on the probability of a <b>Big</b> Four failure <b>to</b> conclude that it is not likely for a <b>Big</b> Four <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> under current circumstances. However, if the Big Four are truly too few <b>to</b> <b>fail,</b> it raises problems of moral hazard in the industry. This paper explores the inclination of the Big Four towards moral hazard by examining the reasons auditors might be less inclined to act {{in the best interest of}} financial statement users. In exploring solutions, this paper finds that the best way to ensure auditor’s act in the interest of public investors is to align their financial incentives with independent third parties rather than management or board members...|$|R

5000|$|Due the {{postponement}} of play on Thursday, {{the second}} round started at 2 pm on Friday with players starting at the 1st and 10th tees. In what proved to be another very difficult round at Augusta, Weir took a four stroke 36-hole lead with a four-under 68 for 138 (−6). Only 16 of the 93 competitors finished with a round below par, and only four were under par at the halfway mark. First round leader Clarke came back to earth with 76 (+4) for solo second at 142 (−2). Phil Mickelson charged up the leaderboard with a two-under 70 into a tie for third place with amateur Barnes. (Two other amateurs also made the cut, Hunter Mahan and Ryan Moore.) Five were tied for fifth place at even-par 144, including two former Masters champions in Vijay Singh and José María Olazábal. The round was completed on Saturday morning and the 36-hole cut was set at 149 (+5). The <b>biggest</b> name <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> make the weekend was Colin Montgomerie.|$|R
30|$|The {{specimen}} size has {{also a significant}} effect on the UCS test results that an increase in the size makes a decrease in the UCS values [7, 8, 9]. Stress concentration at the crack initiation location in the specimens increases with an increase in the size under a same load per a contact area condition. That situation is a significant reason making <b>bigger</b> specimens <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> under lower measured strength values in comparison with smaller size specimens [10, 11, 12]. In the UCS tests of rock materials, the loading rate is many times load control selected with the unit of kN/s. It is known that the increase in the loading rate makes also an increase in the UCS values [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Big size specimens tested under a same load controlled rate (kN/s) have lower deformation rates (mm/min) and strain rates (s− 1) which cause to measure lower UCS values than those of the specimens with smaller sizes. From this point of view, it can be inferred that a relatively high loading rate should be selected to not have a decrease in the UCS values in case of increase in the {{specimen size}}.|$|R

50|$|The Complaint alleges that, from June 2009 {{through at}} least September 2010, the {{defendants}} raised approximately $5.6 million from 74 investors who invested in promissory notes issued by an Isle of Man company. Although investors were told that their money {{would be used to}} repay certain debts of the issuer's parent company, and thereby release assets that would be used to secure their promissory note obligations, the Complaint alleges that nearly all of the offering proceeds were transferred <b>to</b> <b>BIG</b> and its subsidiaries. According to the Complaint, in addition to misrepresenting {{the manner in which the}} offering proceeds would be used, the defendants <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> tell investors that BIG and its subsidiaries were in a precarious financial state.
