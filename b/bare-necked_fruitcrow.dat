5|$|While it is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} the Cotinga species, the purple-throated cotinga differs from them in {{that it has a}} heavier, stubbier bill, distinctive pale fringing on the back feathers, and barred underparts in the female. While it is still generally considered to be closely related to the Cotinga species, recent molecular analysis has suggested that the species may in fact form a separate clade with other canopy-dwelling cotingas, specifically the neotropical bellbirds of the genus Procnias, the cotingas of the genus Carpodectes, the black-faced cotinga of the monotypic genus Conioptilon, and the <b>bare-necked</b> <b>fruitcrow</b> of the monotypic genus Gymnoderus. Of these genera, the molecular analysis suggested that the purple-throated cotinga was most closely related to the neotropical bellbirds. This cotinga does not have a recognized subspecies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bare-necked</b> <b>fruitcrow</b> (Gymnoderus foetidus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Cotingidae. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Gymnoderus. It is found in the Amazon Rainforest, {{especially}} near rivers. It is relatively common, but generally rarer and more local north of the Amazon River. Both sexes are overall mainly blackish, but the male has distinctive, large greyish-blue facial- and neck-wattles and greyish-white wings, which flash conspicuously in flight.|$|E
