5|$|Mardas {{arrived in}} England in 1965, exhibiting his Kinetic Light Sculptures at the Indica Gallery. He {{impressed}} John Lennon with the Nothing Box; {{a small plastic}} box with randomly <b>blinking</b> <b>lights,</b> and allegedly {{said that he could}} build a 72-track tape machine. Mardas was in India with the Beatles at the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India, and was then given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in Savile Row. His schemes lost Apple at least £300,000 (£3 million in 2016 pounds).|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the props}} in The Wrath of Khan had been reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} the prop designs, {{creating}} updated and sleeker versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with small pieces from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than <b>blinking</b> <b>lights,</b> to suggest the props were real and manufactured.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} <b>blinking</b> <b>lights.</b> The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E

5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four <b>blinking</b> <b>lights.</b> The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method to display {{information}} {{based on the}} saccadic eye movement. Using this method, we can make small-size devices. The device based on this method {{can be a very}} simple one composed of two <b>blinking</b> <b>light</b> points and around a vertical <b>blinking</b> <b>light</b> array. This method uses the saccadic eye movement for displaying information, so its viewer can be limited to people who are actively looking for it. Considering these features, this method is suitable for wearable and ubiquitous computing...|$|R
50|$|This same {{external}} stimulus {{can also}} lead to an increased response of a conditioned reaction, called disinhibition, when introduced after experimental extinction (when the conditioned response process is independent of the conditioned stimulus). During extinction, the subject has been unconditioned as to not show the conditioned response when presented by the paired conditioned stimulus. An example of disinhibition is where a rat that was conditioned to walk from point A to point B {{at the sound of the}} buzzer and then unconditioned, and introduced with a different stimulus, such as a <b>blinking</b> <b>light,</b> will again exhibit the conditioned reaction of walking to point B. The observed response of walking to point B after a <b>blinking</b> <b>light</b> stimulus will be relatively greater compared to the rat’s movement during the unconditioned phase (when the rat was not presented with either the buzzer or <b>blinking</b> <b>light).</b>|$|R

500|$|The episode {{introduced}} the Deep Throat character, played by Jerry Hardin, {{who served as}} Mulder's informant for the first season. The character {{was inspired by the}} historical Deep Throat, and served {{to bridge the gap between}} the protagonists and the conspirators they would investigate. The episode itself focused on common elements of ufology, with a setting reminiscent of Area 51 and Nellis Air Force Base. It contained several special effects that Carter later described as [...] "good, given the [...] restrictions"; although he singled out the scenes featuring <b>blinking</b> <b>lights</b> as being poorly executed. In its initial American broadcast, [...] "Deep Throat" [...] was viewed by approximately 6.9 million households and 11.1 million viewers and attracted positive reviews from critics.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{introduced}} Mardas to Lennon, {{and it was}} at {{this point}} that Mardas impressed Lennon with the Nothing Box; a small plastic box with randomly <b>blinking</b> <b>lights</b> that Lennon would stare at for hours while under the influence of LSD. Lennon later introduced the renamed John Alexis Mardas as his [...] "new guru", calling him [...] "Magic Alex". Mardas allegedly told Lennon about ideas for futuristic electronic devices he was [...] "working on", which he later denied either promising or discussing: a telephone that responded to its owner's voice and could identify who was calling, a force field that would surround the Beatles' homes, an X-ray camera, paint that would make anything invisible, car paint that would change colour by flicking a switch, and wallpaper speakers, which would actually {{be a part of the}} wallpaper. Mardas later asked for the V-12 engines from Lennon's Rolls-Royce and George Harrison's Ferrari Berlinetta car, so he could build a flying saucer. Mardas also denied making these claims.|$|E
500|$|Disaster Transport was a bobsled roller coaster, {{meaning the}} wheels were not {{attached}} to a track as on a conventional roller coaster. The cars— resembling bobsleds— operated within a steel trough, on which {{they were allowed to}} operate freely. This allowed the ride to swing from side to side when turning sharp corners, as an actual bobsled would. Guests would enter 10 passenger bobsleds, secured by a lap bar. After leaving the [...] "launch area", the bobsled traveled up the [...] lift hill at a 15-degree-angle, which featured red and blue <b>blinking</b> <b>lights</b> on the sides. After reaching the top of the lift hill, it curved to the right, dropping [...] at a 27-degree-angle and reaching a top speed of 40mph (64km/h). After that, it curved to the left into a mid course brake run. After the mid course brake run, the bobsled turned left followed by several banked turns and curves and two more brake runs. One cycle of the ride lasted about 2 minutes and 32 seconds.|$|E

500|$|During Brown's {{visit to}} Australia for his F.A.M.E. Tour, {{he made a}} guest {{appearance}} at Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber's concert at the Acer Arena in Sydney on April28,2011, where they performed [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] together. For the performance, Bieber covered Busta Rhyme's verse. On June 26, 2011, Brown performed the song at the 2011 BET Awards, where he opened his performance with his single [...] "She Ain't You", while wearing a gray suit with voluminous pant legs and a cape fashioned out of a jacket. He then performed [...] "Look at Me Now", {{as a group of}} dancers in similarly street black hoodies joined him on stage. For the performance, Brown switched his outfit to a black jumpsuit. Rhymes later appeared from a brightly lit cube flanked by dancers in eerie, transparent masks illuminated by <b>blinking</b> <b>lights.</b> Wearing a black jacket with enormous, ridged sleeves, Rhymes dropped the microphone after performing his verse and walked off the stage. Brown ended the performance with [...] "Paper, Scissors, Rock", a song from F.A.M.E..|$|E
500|$|Everton {{and makeup}} {{designers}} Michael Westmore, Scott Wheeler, and Jake Garber wanted {{to upgrade the}} pasty white look the Borg had retained since The Next Generations second season, born out of a need for budget-conscious television design. [...] "I wanted it to look like they were [...] {{from the inside out}} rather than the outside in," [...] Everton said. Each Borg had a slightly different design, and Westmore designed a new one each day to make it appear that there was an army of Borg; in reality, between eight and twelve actors filled all the roles as the costumes and makeup were so expensive to produce. Background Borg were simulated by half-finished mannequins. Westmore reasoned that since the Borg had traveled the galaxy, they would have assimilated other races besides humans. In the television series, much of the Borg's faces had been covered by helmets, but for First Contact the makeup artist removed the head coverings and designed assimilated versions of familiar Star Trek aliens such as Klingons, Bolians, Romulans, Bajorans, and Cardassians. Each drone received an electronic eyepiece. The <b>blinking</b> <b>lights</b> in each eye were programmed by Westmore's son to repeat a production member's name in Morse code.|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{attempted}} {{to change the}} look of Star Trek to match the nautical atmosphere he envisioned and stay within budget. The Enterprise, for example, was given a ship's bell, boatswain's call, and more <b>blinking</b> <b>lights</b> and signage. To save money on set design, production designer Joseph Jennings used existing elements from The Motion Picture {{that had been left}} standing after filming was completed. Sixty-five percent of the film was shot on the same set; the bridge of the Reliant and the [...] "bridge simulator" [...] from the opening scene were redresses of the Enterprises bridge. The Klingon bridge from The Motion Picture was redressed as the transporter and torpedo rooms. The filmmakers stretched The Wrath of Khans budget by reusing models and footage from the first Star Trek film, including footage of the Enterprise in spacedock. The original ship miniatures were used where possible, or modified to stand in as new constructions. The orbital office complex from The Motion Picture was inverted and retouched to become the Regula I space station. Elements of the cancelled [...] television show, such as bulkheads, railings, and sets, were cannibalized and reused. A major concern for the designers was that the Reliant should be easily distinguishable from the Enterprise. The ship's design was flipped after Bennett accidentally opened and approved the preliminary Reliant designs upside-down.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Sun of a Gun", {{directed}} by ThirtyTwo, was first released onto Vevo on 19 October 2010. It was filmed in 2010 in Brooklyn, and displays Oh Land {{in two different}} themes: dark and light. According to Oh Land herself, she [...] "wanted the video to show the two different states {{that you can get}} in when you are in love with someone". The dark side reflects her [...] "desire to protect oneself from being hurt and celebrating independence", while the light side reflects her [...] "desire to be loved and the joys of being in love". The video opens with the dark side of Oh Land, wearing a black dress and extensive eye makeup. She performs the song's choreography atop a cloud-like stage, surrounded by <b>blinking</b> <b>lights.</b> As the track's chorus begins, the light side of Oh Land appears, in a skin-colored dress and longer hair, in front of a screen displaying the sun. The second verse finds her wearing a different black dress, and singing the song by many mirrors; simultaneously, visuals of Oh Land on the ground dancing appear. The following chorus shows the same scenario, but in the same skin-colored dress from earlier. In the song's bridge, both versions of the singer pull a shawl over their head, allowing it to move with the wind. The video concludes with Oh Land closing her eyes as the screen cuts to black.|$|E

This episode seems to have been re-syndicated with the earlier lagoon opening.|$|R
2500|$|Diagnosis is {{typically}} made based on patient history. The physical examination should be normal. The primary diagnosis for JME {{is a good}} knowledge of patient history [...] and the neurologist's familiarity with the myoclonic jerks, which are {{the hallmark of the}} syndrome. Additionally, an electroencephalogram (EEG), will indicate a pattern of waves and spikes associated with the syndrome. The EEG generally shows a very characteristic pattern with generalized 4–6Hz polyspike and slow wave discharges. [...] These discharges are often provoked by photic stimulation (<b>blinking</b> <b>lights)</b> and sometimes hyperventilation. Both a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) and computed tomography scan (CT scan) should appear normal in JME patients.|$|E
2500|$|A {{pivoting}} arm {{equipped with}} a stop sign {{is a piece of}} equipment required by law on North American school buses. The sign normally stows flat {{on the left side of}} the bus, and is deployed by the driver while picking up or dropping off passengers. Some buses have two such stop arms, one near the front facing forwards, and one near the rear facing backwards. The stop sign is retroreflective and equipped either with red <b>blinking</b> <b>lights</b> above and below the [...] legend, or with a [...] legend that is illuminated by LEDs. Unlike a normal stop sign, this sign requires other vehicles travelling in both directions to remain stopped until the sign is retracted.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{parts from}} three 1981 DeLoreans {{were used in}} the first film. Liquid {{nitrogen}} was poured onto the car for scenes after it had travelled through time {{to give the impression that}} it was cold. The base for the nuclear reactor was made from the hubcap from a Dodge Polara. Aircraft parts and <b>blinking</b> <b>lights</b> were added for effect. In one of the first scenes, carbon dioxide extinguishers were hidden inside the DeLorean to simulate the exhaust effect. Ultimately, five real DeLoreans {{were used in the}} filming of the trilogy, plus one [...] "process" [...] car built for interior shots. In the off-road scenes in the third film, a modified-for-off-road VW Beetle frame was fitted to the DeLorean with the whitewall tires and baby Moon hubcaps. A seventh DeLorean was also used in the filming; however, this one was merely a full-sized, fiberglass model used for exterior shots where the vehicle hovers above the set as well as when the actors interact with the vehicle.|$|E
