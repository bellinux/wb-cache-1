40|$|Proteolytic enzymes {{appear to}} have an {{essential}} role in multiple phases of mammalian fertilization. Plasmin, the active enzyme of the plasminogen activation system that stimulates fibrinolysis and proteolysis has a less well-documented role in reproduction. The current study was conducted to investigate the effect of the active protease, plasmin, on the ability of bovine sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction. Aliquots of freshly ejaculated bull sperm were incubated in capacitating conditions with 10 mug ml(- 1) of heparin for 4 h. Every 2 h an aliquot of spermatozoa was exposed to lysophosphatidylcholine (100 mug ml(- 1)) or 0, 0. 1, 1, 10 and 100 mU of plasmin to induce the acrosome reaction in capacitated spermatozoa. Plasmin increased the percentage of live acrosome reacted sperm after 4 h of incubation in the capacitation medium. Viability was not affected by any of the treatments. This study provides new information on <b>bovine</b> acrosome <b>reaction</b> during in vitro incubation with plasmin and indicates that this protease may participate in the proteolytic events that accompany fertilization...|$|R

Free carboxyhemoglobin and polyhemoglobin microcapsules {{were characterized by}} UV–Vis spectroscopy in the absorption range 450 – 650  nm and cyclic voltammetry in the voltage range from − 0. 8 to 0. 6  mV to evaluate the ability to break the bond with carbon monoxide and to study the carrier’s affinity for oxygen, respectively. SEM used to observe the shape of cross-linked gelatin-polyhemoglobin microparticles showed a regular distribution of globular shapes, with mean size of ~ 750  nm, which was ascribed to gelatin. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was also performed to detect iron presence in microparticles. Cyclic voltammetry using an Ag–AgCl electrode highlighted characteristic peaks at around − 0. 6  mV that were attributed to reversible oxygen bonding with iron in oxy-polyhemoglobin structure.

Although we previously detected, isolated, and characterized BCoV strains from adult cattle with WD (WD-BCoV strains) during the winter in South Korea, the precise epidemiology, {{as well as the}} causative agent of diarrhea in adult cattle in the warmer seasons, has not been examined. We examined 184 diarrheic fecal specimens collected from 75 herds of adult cattle from seven provinces during the spring (warm), autumn (warm), and summer (hot) seasons. <b>Bovine</b> coronavirus-positive <b>reactions</b> were detected for 107 (58. 2 %) diarrheic fecal samples (in 47 / 75 herds). Of these 107 positive samples, 90 fecal samples from 33 herds tested positive for BCoV alone and 17 fecal samples from 14 herds also tested positive for other pathogens. Biological comparisons between the 9 BCoV strains isolated in this study and the 10 previously isolated WD-BCoV strains revealed that there was no receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) activity against mouse erythrocytes in the 9 BCoV strains but the 10 WD-BCoV strains had high RDE activity. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike (S) and hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) proteins revealed that all the Korean BCoVs clustered together regardless of season and were distinct from the other known BCoVs, suggesting a distinct evolutionary pathway for the Korean BCoVs. These and previous results revealed a high prevalence and widespread geographical distribution of BCoV, suggesting that this virus is endemic in adult cattle with diarrhea in all seasons in South Korea...|$|R

40|$|Purified PIVKA-II is {{converted}} into prothrombin by a cell-free system derived from normal <b>bovine</b> liver. The <b>reaction</b> conditions are described. In {{the absence of}} vitamin K many mammals generate proteins (PIVKAs) which axe immunologically identical to the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors but which lack thet functional activity [1]. At the moment of their discovery in 1963 121 It was already supposed that PIVKAs were precursors of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. After the discovery by Stenflo and coworkers [3] that the 7 -calboxyl gloups present in 10 glutamic acid residues of prothrombin account for the difference between PMA-II and prothrombin, {{it was to be}} expected that the vitamin K-dependent system brought ahout the carboxylation of PIVKA. Suttie and coworkers [4, 5] showed that liver microsomes from vitamin K-deficient rats mediate in the incorporation of l 4 C-Iabeled COz and generate factor II activity, supposedly from an endogenous plecursor.

40|$|Themycobacterial immunodominant ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 antigens are {{strongly}} recognizable in tuberculosis-infected cattle, {{and they do}} not elicit a response in cattle without infection. In addition, they are absent in most environmental mycobacterial spe-cies, and therefore, their use can be an alternative to purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin {{in the development of a}} more specific skin diagnostic test in cattle. The aim of the current study was to assess the potential of an ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 (E 6 -C 10) protein cocktail in a skin test format in naturally tuberculosis-infected and paratuberculosis-infected cattle. We also included MPB 83 as a third component in one of the protein cocktail preparations. The protein cocktail was tested at different dose con-centrations (5, 10, and 15 g per protein). The best skin response to the E 6 -C 10 protein cocktail was obtained with 10 g. Subse-quently, this concentration was tested in 2 herds with high and low bovine tuberculosis prevalence, the latter with paratubercu-losis coinfection. Our data show that the E 6 -C 10 cocktail allows identification of an important proportion of animals that PPDB is not able to recognize, especially in low-prevalence herds.

40|$|A escassez de dados sobre tuberculose e micobacterioses em ovinos (Ovis aries) motivou o presente trabalho de isolamento e tipificação de microorganismos presentes em linfonodos e lesões macroscópicas sugestivas de tuberculose. Foram avaliados pelo teste tuberculinico, 353 ovinos das raças Santa Inês e Texel de duas propriedades da região de Pindamonhangaba - São Paulo. Dos 57 animais selecionados para abate, 31 apresentavam reação ao PPD bovino maior que ao PPD aviário e 26 com reação ao PPD bovino menor que ao PPD aviário. Onze animais (19, 3 %) apresentaram na necrópsia lesões sugestivas de tuberculose. Os órgãos afetados foram o fígado, linfonodo submandibular, intestino, pulmão, linfonodo mediastino e glândula mamária. Foram isoladas micobactérias de sete (12, 3 %) animais e a tipificação genética pelo método de PRA demonstrou cinco (71, 42 %) infectados pelo Mycobacterium flavescens 1, um (14, 28 %) pelo M. kansasi, e um (14, 28 %) por micobactéria pertencente ao Complexo M. tuberculosis. Exames bacteriológicos para outras bactérias e/ou fungos isolaram Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis em quatro (7, 01 %) dos 57 animais abatidos. Houve isolamento simultâneo de micobactérias e de Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis em dois (3, 5 %) dos 57 animais abatidos. Os exames histopatológicos apontaram em nove (15, 78 %) animais a presença de {{granuloma}} e coloração de Ziehl-Neelsen positivo. A análise dos resultados obtidos permitiram concluir que, neste trabalho, os testes imunoalérgicos (Teste Cervical Simples e Teste Cervical Comparativo) não foram capazes de diferenciar infecção provocada pelo M. flavescens 1, M. kansasi, complexo M. tuberculosis e C. pseudotuberculosis.

Tuberculin skin test was performed in 353 Santa Ines and Texel ovine breeds of two properties located at Pindamonhangaba Municipality - Sao Paulo State. Fifty seven animals were selected to be slaughtered and 31 of them had the bovine PPD skin test higher than avian PPD and other 26 presented <b>bovine</b> PPD <b>reaction</b> lower than avian PPD. Eleven animals (19. 3 %) showed tuberculosis-like gross lesions at necropsy. Most affected organs were liver, submandibular lymph nodes, intestines, lungs, mediastinic lymph nodes and mammary gland. It was possible to isolate mycobacteria from seven (12. 3 %) animals and genetic typing by the PRA method showed that five animals (71. 42 %) were infected with Mycobacterium flavescens 1, one (14. 28 %) with M. kansasi, and one (14. 28 %) with M. tuberculosis complex mycobacteria. Bacteriological culture isolation for other bacteria and/or fungi were positive for Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis in four (7. 01 %) of 57 slaughtered animals.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{there has been}} an {{accelerated}} development in medical modalities for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Tissue conservation of neighbouring healthy tissue and development of a minimally/non-invasive treatment for cancer remain the primary unsolved issues regarding cancer treatments/therapies. Nanoparticle contrast agents for molecular targeted imaging have widespread interest in diagnostic applications with cellular resolution, specificity and selectivity for visualization and assessment of various disease processes. Of particular interest is the gold nanoparticle, owing to its tunability of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and its relative inertness. This study explores adjusting various wet chemical synthesis parameters to synthesise anisotropic gold nanoparticles with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in the near infra-red (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Multimodal nanoprobes were then constructed with these anisotropic gold nanoparticles as core to be used with multiple optical imaging and therapeutic modalities. To achieve this goal, multibranched gold nanoparticles (nanostars) were synthesised using a one-pot synthesis methodology. The SPR wavelength of the nanostars was tuned to be within the optical imaging window of 600 â 900 nm by varying synthesis parameters such as pH, temperature and ratio of reducing agent to the gold precursor. For the construction of multimodal gold nanoprobes, gold nanostars were first coated with a monolayer of diethylthiatricarbocyanine iodide (DTTCi), a Raman reporter dye. In a separate <b>reaction,</b> <b>bovine</b> serum albumin (BSA) was chemically denatured to expose the thiol groups, which was conjugated with photosensitisers (PS), hypericin and chlorin e 6, to protect the fluorescence of photosensitisers from quenching by the gold nanostars. This BSA-PS conjugate was added to the nanostars to complete the synthesis of the multimodal nanoprobe. This nanoprobe was optically characterised using UV-Visible, fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy to confirm the retention of optical properties of all the individual components. The therapeutic ability of the nanoprobe was examined by investigating the singlet oxygen generation and photothermal capability by purpose-built laser setup and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The structure and shape of the gold nanostars were further optimised for the SPR to lie within the second optical window (1050 â 1400 nm) to further enhance the contrast for deep tissue imaging. Synthesis methodology included using silver ions for gold to be reduced on its surface, thereby growing into nanostars with longer and sharper branches, which reflected in the SPR band red shifting to 1050 - 1200 nm. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrated the tunability of the SPR and surface charge distribution of these nanostars. Silica coated gold nanostars were successfully used as contrast agent for Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI) of nanostars embedded phantoms. NIR in vivo PAI and photothermal efficiency of gold nanostars were then investigated as a proof-of-concept. Xenografted tumours were administered with nanostars and irradiated using 1064 nm continuous wave laser (0. 5 W/cm 2 for 10 minutes) and the localised temperature increase (photothermal effect) was monitored using thermal imaging. PAI was used to image the localisation and retention of nanostars within tumours, and was also used to measure the tumour volume. The â 9 â temperature increase within tumours induced localised hyperthermia which shrunk the tumour volume initially and the subsequent increase in tumour size did not reach significance. This tumour regrowth after photothermal therapy (PTT) was suggestive of thermo-resistance by cancer cells as a result of mild hyperthermia. The quantification of tumour destruction at cellular level showed 39. 8 % decrease in the percent cellular area of the tumours that underwent PTT demonstrated that the PT effect of nanostars did result in significant tumour cell death. 2017 - 05 - 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to gain a better understanding of the heat-induced whey protein reactions that occur during the manufacture of milk powders. Attention was focused on the preheating step, because most of the whey protein reactions that affect powder properties occur during this step. Skim milk was heated at a range of temperatures (70 to 130 °C) and times (5 s to 1800 s), normally used in powder manufacture, using a pilot-scale UHT plant equipped with direct steam injection. The temperature and time conditions were characterized by residence time distribution analysis. After heating the milk samples were analyzed by quantitative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-dissociating and dissociating conditions. Using reaction progress data (reactant concentration versus time) determined over a range of temperatures, apparent reaction orders, reaction rates and Arrhenius parameters were determined by non-linear regression. This one-step approach gave Arrhenius parameters of considerably higher precision than the commonly used alternative of first determining the rate constants and then the Arrhenius parameters from the temperature dependence of those constants. Kinetic parameters were calculated for β-lactoglobulin A, β-lactoglobulin B, α-lactalbumin, immunoglobulin G and <b>bovine</b> serum albumin. <b>Reaction</b> orders for β-lactoglobulin varied from 1. 0 to 1. 6, while values for α-lactalbumin were in the range 0. 9 to 1. 1. The denaturation of Immunoglobulin G could be described by a 2 nd order <b>reaction,</b> whereas <b>bovine</b> serum albumin followed a reaction order of 2. 8. There was a marked change in activation energy for β-lactoglobulin at 90 °C (51. 18 to 301. 73 kJ mol- 1) and α-lactalbumin at 80 °C (52. 87 to 203. 26 kJ mol- 1). No such change was observed for Immunoglobulin G and bovine serum albumin over the temperature range 70 - 90 °C. At temperatures 80 °C β-lactoglobulin associated at a faster rate than α-lactalbumin, but < 80 °C the rates of association were similar. Under all heating conditions only a portion (= 55 %) of the denatured β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin associated with the casein micelles; the rest remained in the serum as aggregates. Based on the interrelationships between denaturation, aggregation and association behaviour of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin a novel mechanism was proposed and a mathematical model was developed. This model could accurately predict the formation of β-lactoglobulin aggregates and their subsequent association with the casein micelles. The extent of whey protein denaturation, aggregation and association in milk was affected by compositional factors, such as pH, whey protein concentration and total solids content. Increasing the pH of milk from 6. 48 to 6. 83 prior to heating had little effect on β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin denaturation and aggregation, but greatly decreased their association with the casein micelles. When the whey protein concentration in milk was increased from 0. 52 to 1. 24 g/ 100 g there was a marked increase in the extent of denaturation, aggregation and association of α-lactalbumin with the casein micelles, the effect being less marked on β-lactoglobulin. As the total solids content increased from 6 % to 13 % the extent of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin reactions increased. Examination of whey protein reactions in milks obtained during the New Zealand dairying season, showed that the extent of denaturation, aggregation and association was greater in late season milk. This increase was possibly caused by the increased whey protein and κ-casein concentrations. Preliminary studies were carried out on the evaporation and spray drying processing steps. Little further denaturation and aggregation of whey proteins occurred during the evaporation and spray drying steps, while the association of whey proteins with the casein micelles increased slightly during evaporation. However both these processing steps caused considerable changes in soluble minerals and calcium ion activities...|$|R
