40|$|The {{effects of}} changes in {{dosimetry}} conditions on the radiation sensitivity of a constant biological population were determined. The organism {{used for this study}} was the strain B of Escherichia coli. The percentage survivals of these cells in an aqueous solution were determined at the same total exposure with different quality x-rays. The total absorbed dose was measured as a function of x-ray quality. During all irradiations the focal- target distance, tube current, field size, and biological population were held constant. The distribution of radiation to which the organisms were exposed was kept constant by the use of a rotating exposure platform. This platform was constructed of materials such that the contributions from backscatter would be minimized. The results indicated that the test organism was more sensitive to low energy x-rays than to high energy x-rays in the range from 15 keV to 145 keV effective energy. However, at low effective x-ray energies the absorbed dose was found to be lower than at higher effective energies. This was explained by differences in the specific ionization of different energy x-rays in aqueous solutions.

40|$|Abstract—Transverse {{electromagnetic}} (TEM) {{cells can}} be used for exposing biological culture specimens to electromagnetic fields and observing possible anomalous effects. The uniformity of field exposure is critical to quantifying the biological response versus the electromagnetic dose. Standing waves and other electromag-netic field nonuniformities can cause nonuniform exposure. This paper reports the results of high-resolution three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of a complete TEM cell designed for operation at 837 MHz. Several different cases were studied in which the number of culture dishes, the depth of the culture liquid, and the orientation of the culture dishes were varied. Further, the effect of the culture-dish glass bottom thickness and the meniscus of the liquid medium were examined. The FDTD results show that there is a significant nonuniform field and specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution within the culture medium for each case examined. Hence, biolog-ical dose-response experiments using the TEM cell should account for the possibility of strong localized SAR peaking in the culture media to provide useful data in setting exposure standards for wireless communications.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the risk for biological damage of an individual after overexposure to ionizing radiation due to an accident or a terroristic attack passes through {{the evaluation of the}} absorbed dose received from the person/s involved. This evaluation, corresponding also to how dangerous the overexposure is, using methodologies typical of the <b>biological</b> <b>dosimetry,</b> is done with the help of reference calibration curves and it presumes that all individuals exposed have the same individual radiosensitivity, which is true when the biological system into account are human lymphocytes of the peripheral blood (PBL). It supposes that a certain dose of radiation produces the same quantity of variation (chromosomal aberrations) in that biological system in all the exposed. The goal of this Ph. D. thesis is the application of various cytogenetic methodologies to detect in a reliable and possibly fast way chromosomal aberrations non stable (dicentrics and centromeric rings) in the lymphocytes of the human peripheral blood after gamma irradiation and the construction of calibration curves dose effect able to give rapidly a response of the absorbed dose in case of radiation accident. The time needed to give a reliable response on the absorbed dose is crucial and {{this is especially true in}} radiation emergency medicine. The objective was to standardize, develop and apply sophisticate, sensitive and reliable methodologies for the estimation of the absorbed doses after accidental gamma radiation overexposures for radiation protection purposes. Specifically, in the present study the following were performed: I. 	Application of the classic “golden standard” methodology of <b>biological</b> <b>dosimetry</b> which provides stimulation of the lymphocytes and Giemsa staining of the chromosomes at mitosis II. 	Development, consolidation and application of original methodologies in <b>biological</b> <b>dosimetry</b> using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes for painting specifically chromosome telomers and centromeres III. 	Application and consolidation of the method of premature chromosome condensation (PCC) where no stimulation at lymphocytes is needed IV. 	Development of a fast, sensitive and reliable methodology, absolutely original in the field of <b>biological</b> <b>dosimetry</b> for dose evaluation combining the PCC method with the FISH using PNA probes for centromers and telomers V. 	Construction for all the above methodologies, using in vitro experiments, of calibration curves dose-effect where unstable chromosomal aberrations where plotted against gamma dose given. The dose interval investigated was between 0. 3 Gy and 8 Gy; more than 12. 500 slides with metaphases and interphases were scored using Microscopic analysis of chromosome aberrations. Dose effect curves are linear quadratic and for their construction a minimum of 500 cells or 100 dicentrics per dose were analysed. The Poisson distribution of the chromosomal aberrations was tested for every dose and the coefficients alpha and beta of the linear quadratic equation, their errors and p value were calculated.

40|$|Imaging {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} techniques to quantify radiation dose. While films and active fluorescent detectors are still commonly used in physical <b>dosimetry,</b> <b>biological</b> imaging is emerging as a new method to visualize and quantify radiation dose in biological targets. Methods for biological imaging are normally based on molecular fluorescent probes, labeling chromatin-conjugated molecules or specific repair proteins. Examples are chromatin-binding coumarin compounds, which become fluorescent under irradiation, or the H 2 AX histone, which is rapidly phosphorylated at sites of DNA double-strand breaks and can be visualized by immunostaining. Many other DNA repair proteins can be expressed with fluorescent targets, such as green fluorescent protein, thus becoming visible for dose estimation in vivo. The possibility to visualize radiation damage in living biological targets is particularly important for repair kinetic studies, for estimating individual radiation response, and for remote control of living samples exposed to radiation, for instance in robotic space missions. In vivo dose monitoring in particle therapy exploits the production of positron emitters by nuclear interaction of the incident beam in the patient's body. Positron emission tomography (PET) can then be used to visualize and quantify the particle dose in the patient, and it can in principle also be used for radiotherapy with high-energy X rays.

40|$|Asteroid and comet {{impacts on}} Earth are {{commonly}} viewed {{as agents of}} ecosystem destruction, be it on local or global scales. However, for some microbial communities, impacts may represent an opportunity for habitat formation as some substrates are rendered more suitable for colonization when processed by impacts. We describe how heavily shocked gneissic crystalline basement rocks exposed at the Haughton impact structure, Devon Island, Nunavut, Arctic Canada, are hosts to endolithic photosynthetic microorganisms in significantly greater abundance than lesser-shocked or unshocked gneisses. Two factors contribute to this enhancement: (a) increased porosity due to impact fracturing and differential mineral vaporization, and (b) increased translucence due to the selective vaporization of opaque mineral phases. Using <b>biological</b> ultraviolet radiation <b>dosimetry,</b> and by measuring the concentrations of photoprotective compounds, we demonstrate that a covering of 0. 8 mm of shocked gneiss can provide substantial protection from ultraviolet radiation, reducing the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores by 2 orders of magnitude. The colonisation of the shocked habitat represents a potential mechanism for pioneer microorganisms to invade an impact structure in the earliest stages of post-impact primary succession. The communities are analogous to the endolithic communities associated with sedimentary rocks in Antarctica, but because they occur in shocked crystalline rocks, they illustrate a mechanism {{for the creation of}} microbial habitats on planetary surfaces that do not have exposed sedimentary units.

These capabilities include available biodosimetry techniques, infrastructure, human resources (existing trained staff), financial and organizational resources (including the role of national contact points and their articulation with other stakeholders in emergency response) as well as robust quality control/assurance systems. Materials and methods: A survey was prepared and sent to the RENEB partners in order to acquire information about the existing, operational techniques and infrastructure in the laboratories of the different RENEB countries and to assess the capacity of response in the event of radiological or nuclear accident involving mass casualties. The survey focused on several main areas: laboratory’s general information, country and staff involved in biological and physical dosimetry; retrospective assays used, the number of assays available per laboratory and other information related to biodosimetry and emergency preparedness. Following technical intercomparisons amongst RENEB members, an update of the survey was performed one year later concerning the staff and the available assays.

The spatial dimensions of optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters make them ideal for measuring dose at a specific location. However the response of these dosimeters varies with photon energy.

This method is confirmed using an ion chamber dosimeter and computer simulation. The construction of 24 Am irradiators for tissue culture and animal experiments using this dosimetry method is also described. The results of tissue culture experiments performed using these irradiators are presented, and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) is determined for two fields with approximately equal dose-rates produced by shielding 24 Am foil sources with aluminum and polyethylene. Biological effects can result from single instances of energy deposition within a cell or from the combination of separate instances, but at low dose-rates biological repair mechanisms reduce the probability of effects resulting from the combination of separate instances. At a sufficiently low dose-rate the effects due to combination of separate instances are negligible. A model of low dose-rate energy deposition within a cell nucleus was developed to determine this doserate.

The technique, applied to circulating lymphocytes, has been developed into a routine procedure to evaluate the dose {{in the case of}} real or suspected accidental exposure. Considering the radiosensitivity of lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo as being the same, the dose effect relationship obtained after in vitro irradiation of blood has been widely used, with medico-legal value, for evaluating individual radiation exposure. This report presents an overview of strengths, limitations and perspectives on biodosimetry...|$|E
40|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>dosimetry,</b> {{based on}} the {{analysis}} of micronuclei (MN) in the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay {{can be used as}} an alternative method for scoring dicentric chromosomes in the field of radiation protection. <b>Biological</b> <b>dosimetry</b> or Biodosimetry, is mainly performed, in addition to physical dosimetry, with the aim of individual dose assessment. Many {{studies have shown that the}} number of radiation-induced MN is strongly correlated with dose and quality of radiation. The CBMN assay has become, in the last years, a thoroughly validated and standardised technique to evaluate in vivo radiation exposure of occupational, medical and accidentally exposed individuals. Compared to the gold standard, the dicentric assay, the CBMN assay has the important advantage of allowing economical, easy and quick analysis. The main disadvantage of the CBMN assay is related to the variable micronucleus (MN) background frequency, by which only in vivo exposures in excess of 0. 2 - 0. 3 Gy X-rays can be detected. In the last years, several improvements have been achieved, with the ultimate goals (i) of further increasing the sensitivity of the CBMN assay for low-dose detection by combining the assay with a fluorescence in situ hybridisation centromere staining technique, (ii) of increasing the specificity of the test for radiation by scoring nucleoplasmic bridges in binucleated cells and (iii) of making the assay optimally suitable for rapid automated analysis of a large number of samples, viz. in case of a large-scale radiation accident. The development of a combined automated MN-centromere scoring procedure remains a challenge for the future, as it will allow systematic biomonitoring of radiation workers exposed to low-dose radiation...|$|E
40|$|Slit-scan {{flow cytometry}} {{provides}} {{a method to}} analyze large numbers of metaphase chromosomes {{in a relatively short}} time due to morphological features. The high detection rate requires fast computing for on-line analysis. Up to now, this has been achieved using special-purpose computers, parallel systems or other complex hardware. Here, we describe an algorithm that can be implemented on a general-purpose personal computer. Digitized chromosome profiles can be classified by several criteria especially for the detection of chromosome abnormalities in <b>biological</b> <b>dosimetry.</b> A data set of approximately 4600 profiles was used. Programming in assembler results in an average computing time of about 600 microseconds per profile. Thus on-line evaluation of slit-scanning data appears to become feasible for many flow cytometers running nowaday...|$|E
40|$|The {{micronucleus}} assay {{is frequently}} used {{for purposes of}} <b>biological</b> <b>dosimetry.</b> Due to high interindividual variability in the spontaneous frequency of micronuclei, its sensitivity in the low dose region is poor. It {{has been suggested that}} this problem can be mitigated by selectively analyzing the frequency of those micronuclei which contain only acentric fragments. Using a pan-centromeric FISH probe we have studied the dose dependence of micronuclei with centromeres in peripheral lymphocytes of human donors. In contrast to previous publications, our approach is based on determining the relative frequency of micronuclei with and without centromeric signals. Our results confirm previous observations that in the low dose range of ionizing radiation, the micronucleus-centromere assay is more sensitive than the conventional micronucleus test...|$|E
