40|$|In {{this paper}} I seek {{to explore the}} idea of the otherness of childhood. I suggest that there are {{considerable}} differences between the <b>becomings</b> of children and the <b>becomings</b> of adults. In the face of these a number of questions need to be asked about adult–childhood relations in society and about academic approaches to children and childhood, particularly in terms of representing childhood and the implications of such representing. The paper sets out the idea of otherness, locates this within current debate about the crisis of childhood, and then argues that non-representational approaches might be particularly relevant to progressing children’s geographies. These approaches stress modesty, practice, experimentation, messiness, creativity and openness...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} Hotel Transvaal {{is used as}} a case study to add to the discussion: 'How {{hospitality}} practices can lead to spaces of difference?' In the case of Hotel Transvaal, artists attribute'hospitality' principles to draw attention towards massive state interventions in the so called problem Neighbourhoods. The artists invite others to experience this transformation through a stay in Hotel Transvaal. Hotel Transvaal is unlike any other hotel, since it is not fixed in one building, but includes an entire neighbourhood. A neighbourhood houses residents and Hotel Transvaal turns these residents into hosts and guests. These authors indicate how Hotel Transvaal, by playing with the organizing principles of hospitality, can facilitate difference by evoking unexpected <b>becomings</b> and intensities. This article is built up as follows: Firstly, the transformation process of the Transvaal neighbourhood is described, where the neighbourhood forms the context for Hotel Transvaal. Secondly, the setting of the daily operations of Hotel Transvaal is conceptualized as a space of hospitality, which can be regarded as a Deleuzian assemblage with a certain extent of organization. This conceptualization clears the road for the third part, a spotlight on the <b>becomings</b> and intensities which are 'produced' by the assemblage Hotel Transvaal. The last section discusses the <b>becomings</b> and intensities within a larger context of art, new space and cultural laboratories...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} materialist feminist {{theories}} to rethink relationships between girls' bodies and agency. New feminist onto-epistemologies redefine agency as ‘becomings’ that dynamically emerge through assemblages comprising moving bodies, material, mechanical, organic, virtual, affective and less-than-conscious elements. Vignettes from a multi-modal, ethnographic study conducted {{over three years}} are used to demonstrate how place influenced young teen girls' body-movement repertoires. The place was a former coal-mining locale with a proud tradition of masculine, working-class labour. The vignettes focus on corporeality and demonstrate wide variations and fluctuations in girls' experiences of agency, which we theorise through the Deleuzeo-Guatarrian concept of ‘becoming’. We discuss how material feminism(s) helps us to understand girls' <b>becomings</b> as emergent within assemblages that carry legacies of the past. Some girls experienced <b>becomings</b> that could not easily be spoken about yet which allowed them to imagine expansive futures while others felt unable to move on in life...|$|R

40|$|Two open-fronted {{structures}} {{associated with}} minor numbers of Chichén slatewares {{have been found}} at the minor site of Nohcacab in Quintana Roo. These could potentially be interpreted as either conquest by Chichén Itzá, the spread of a “Quetzalcoatl cult”, trade, or “diffusion”. Such interpretations necessarily touch upon the idea of ethnicity. However, the evidence for ethnic groups from material remains is problematic for several reasons. The major obstacle is the tendency among archaeologists to attribute to materiality, what is not there, such as quasi-objects. Such quasi-objects {{are believed to be}} shared among past humans, and materialities are forced to fit these quasi-objects. Ethnicity and culture are such quasi-objects, external to the materialities. These “traditional ” quasi-objects are rejected as levels of analysis and a polyagentive approach is proposed that break with culture-history and social constructivism. Here, social groups are first replaced by series, and focus is laid upon the nodes around which series form: the materiality of actants. However, these are just actualisations or <b>becomings</b> of a virtual multiplicity that always is in change, free of essences and externalities. <b>Becomings</b> are what make materialities form the trajectories of human action through their causative capabilities, or polyagency. These processes are exemplified by the materialities at Nohcacab and the causeways of nearby Ichmul...|$|R

40|$|Textiled <b>Becomings</b> Making from scratch, moving, {{performing}} and reflecting Haya Cohen Griffith University To move {{is to create}} (with) sense. A body perceives through difference. A change in environment provokes a sensory event. (Manning, 2006) This paper was presented {{as a part of}} a panel on the Reflective Artist. As an arts practitioner, I understand how different arts forms provide various ways of reflecting on the relationship between body and environment. In the context of the World Dance Alliance Global Summit 2008, I feel that there is a strong overlap between the visual arts and dance through the importance of movement. The focus of my paper is on the ways in which the movements involved in the making - whether making textile, sculptures or painting - offer ways of knowing that are unique to each material process. I use my current art project, Textiled <b>Becomings,</b> to explore the links between movement, performance (or performativity) and material processes. Within this project the embodied significance of textile art is amplified through the process of making 'from scratch' in which I use raw materials such as cotton and seeds, to make my own yarns.

40|$|Inspiring consternation {{and praise}} in near equal measure, Deleuze (1995 : 143) once {{observed}} that "everything I&# 039;ve written is vitalistic, at least I hope it is, {{and amounts to}} a theory of signs and events". This chapter proposes a pedagogy of signs and events, grounded in Deleuze&# 039;s vitalism and practised (or lived) according to the ethology that Deleuze derives from Spinoza. Such a pedagogy should, in turn, yield a novel ethics of the sign whereby the <b>becomings</b> that Deleuze (1994) regards as central to all life may be accelerated or promoted. Reflecting recent attempts to articulate a Deleuzian philosophy of education (see Semetsky, 2006), I will endeavour to express a literacy of signs and events {{in the course of}} exploring the mechanisms by which bodies learn to territorialise place, amid the processes by which places territorialise bodies. My conjecture is that a Deleuzian literacy of signs and events should help to establish an &# 039;ethico-ethology&# 039; of place capable of explaining the <b>becomings</b> that transform bodies and places alike. I will then apply this conjecture to the analysis of qualitative data recently collected in Melbourne, Australia among individuals recovering from a mental illness. On the basis of this analysis, I will argue that recovery may be construed as a process of learning to manipulate the signs and events of one&# 039;s &# 039;becoming well&# 039;...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{material}} <b>becomings</b> of software, investigating the way software comes to being software and the agents which are participating in this <b>becomings.</b> Introducing the notion of ‗mineralization‘ as a conceptual tool, taken from Manuel DeLanda and applied {{in the context of}} software, the thesis investigates the material origin of software and the complex geo-political framework in which software is entangled with. Throughout this text, the main aim is not to situate software in one particular context or analyze one type of software, but rather work with a multi-layered perception of software, dealing with its multiplicities. Engaging with different scholars and scholarly fields of conceptualizing the materiality of software and the material connections of the digital, here software is mapped out not in relation to fixed spatio-temporal objects, or final forms as a ‗dead matter‘. Rather, software is taken as vibrant matter, which possesses certain fuzziness {{when it comes to the}} way it functions, as revealing and withdrawing constantly from human perception and its own being. This thesis begins with the premise that software operates as a black box, and that it brings into opaqueness the labor, materials and different agents which makes software. The notion of mineralization brings a new way for approaching conceptually the materialization of software and the way it actualizes itself through various assemblages...|$|R
