Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Stradbroke Island knew it as mintie. Banyalla is another aboriginal name for the species.|$|E

5|$|During the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed.

5|$|Eighty-nine {{per cent}} of courts martial {{returned}} a guilty verdict, {{the vast majority}} of cases being for offences such as Absence Without Leave (the most common offence), drunkenness and insubordination.

Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews would soon be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami.

Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E
5|$|At {{a special}} sitting of Parliament on 28 August 1939, Rhodesia {{determined}} {{to stand by}} Great Britain {{in the event that}} war should break out, as was expected. Of a white population of just 65,000, only 10,000 were fit and available for active service. It was decided not to create a full Rhodesian formation: if it were wiped out, the colony's future prosperity would be put at risk. Instead mostly small groups of Rhodesians were distributed throughout the British Army, Navy and Air Force. In the Defence Report of 1939, it was stated that forces would be trained and organised not only for internal security and defence <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>to</b> defend British interests in service outside its borders.|$|E
