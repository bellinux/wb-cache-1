40|$|Excerpt] The {{submission}} {{of this report}} to the Congress continues {{a series of reports}} by the U. S. Department of Labor on the impact o f the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) on U. S. employment. The current report covers calendar year 2003 and represents the eleventh in the series. The ATPA, enacted on December 4, 1991, authorized the President to proclaim duty-free treatment for eligible articles from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, The ATPA expired on December 4, 2001, but was subsequently expanded in product coverage and renewed to December 31, 2006 by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) that was signed into law by the President on August 6, 2002. Section 207 of the ATPA directs the Secretary of Labor to undertake a continuing review and analysis {{of the impact of the}} agreement on U. S. employment and submit a summary report of such analysis annually to the Congress. During 2003, $ 1. 6 billion in U. S. imports from the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> entered the United States duty-free under provisions in the ATPA; however, a significant portion of these duty-free entries (about 40 percent) probably would have qualified for duty-free entry under other existing U. S. trade preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences. In addition, $ 4. 2 billion in U. S. imports from the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> benefited exclusively from the ATPDEA and entered the United States duty-free under its provisions for expanded product coverage. ATPA duty-free benefits in 2003 represented 14 percent of total U. S. imports from the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> and only 0. 1 percent of total U. S. imports from all nations. ATPDEA duty-free benefits in 2003 accounted for 36 percent of total U. S. imports from the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries,</b> but only 0. 3 percent of total U. S. imports from all sources. Overall, U. S. imports from the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> that benefited exclusively from the ATPA (on eligible products not eligible for GSP) and the ATPDEA (all covered products) amounted to $ 5. 2 billion in 2003, which represented about 45 percent of all U. S. imports from the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries,</b> but just 0. 4 percent of total U. S. imports from all sources. The main finding of this report is that preferential tariff treatment under the ATPA/ATPDEA has neither had an adverse impact on nor posed a significant threat to U. S. employment...|$|R

The feasibility of allowing preferences has, however, been questioned by economists from a development perspective. This article evaluates {{the efficiency of}} preferences {{as a means to}} enhance market access and identifies the main impediments to its effective utilization by the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> in Switzerland. The findings show that the benefits from preferences are concentrated selectively in a few <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> and that nearly one-third of imports potentially covered under preferences come under Most-favoured-nation (MFN) tariffs.

50|$|Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 (CBERA) — P.L. 98-67 (August 5, 1983), Title II, {{authorized}} unilateral {{preferential trade}} and tax benefits for eligible Caribbean countries, including duty-free treatment of eligible products. Often {{referred to as}} the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). Amended several times, the last substantive revisions were made in the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-382, Title II, August 20, 1990). This made trade benefits permanent (repealing the September 30, 1995 termination date). The law gives preferential trade and tax benefits for eligible Caribbean countries, including duty-free entry of eligible products. To be eligible, an article must be a product of a <b>beneficiary</b> <b>country</b> and imported directly from it, and at least 35% of its import value must have originated in one or more CBERA beneficiaries. Slightly different import value rules apply to articles entering from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The duty-free import of sugar and beef products is subject to a special eligibility requirement intended to ensure that increased production of sugar and beef will not adversely affect overall food production. Preferential tariff treatment does not extend to imports of: textiles and apparel subject to textile agreements, specified footwear, canned tuna, petroleum and its products, and watches or watch parts containing any material originating in countries denied normal trade relations (most-favored-nation) trade status. Special criteria applied to the duty-free import of ethanol through FY2000. Import-sensitive products, not accorded duty-free tariff treatment, are eligible to enter at lower than normal trade relations tariff rates. These products include handbags, luggage, flat goods (such as wallets, change purses, and key and eyeglass cases), work gloves, and certain leather wearing apparel.|$|E

40|$|Emerging donors, such as India, Brazil and South Africa, have {{provided}} assistance to {{other developing countries}} for many decades. However, the creation of dedicated aid agencies in emerging donor countries {{is a relatively new}} feature. The establishment of these aid agencies is often motivated by the objective of better coordinating and managing the increasing volume and scope of their development assistance activities. Since many of these emerging donors are also recipients of Official Development Assistance (ODA) from traditional donors, this institutionalization and professionalization of their development assistance raises some difficult questions. How do traditional donors perceive this new development in <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> and how do they respond to it in terms of aid allocations and co-operation arrangements? Do traditional donors still perceive <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> that {{are in a position to}} provide development assistance to other countries as being eligible to receive aid? These are the fundamental questions that this research study aims to answer. This research study is based on the hypothesis that the creation of dedicated aid agencies in <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> prompts traditional donors to either freeze, reduce or terminate ODA and rethink their development cooperation strategies. It argues that traditional donors perceive <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> with dedicated aid agencies as no longer in need of foreign assistance. In order to test this hypothesis and identify changes in the flow of aid, the research study compares official aid flow data for five selected traditional donors (France, Germany, the UK, the US and EU Institutions) to three emerging donor countries (India, Brazil and South Africa) before and after the establishment of dedicated aid agencies. The research further investigates whether other factors, such as beneficiary countries' socioeconomic performance and compliance with DAC norms and standards, play a role in traditional donors' aid allocation decisions. Alongside the quantitative analysis, the research uses semi-structured elite interviews with representatives of the five traditional donors as well as development cooperation experts to solicit qualitative responses. The findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis suggest that the establishment of dedicated aid agencies in emerging donor countries does not have a negative impact on traditional donors' aid allocations. Other factors, such as the economic status of <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries,</b> domestic debates and the strategic interests of traditional donors', seem to play a much more important role in this regard. In fact, traditional donors welcome the creation of such aid agencies and actively support <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries</b> in this endeavour.

40|$|The Generalised System of Preferences, {{known as}} GSP, {{is defined as}} “a formal system of {{exemption}} from the more general rules applied by the European Union on its trade relationship with third countries”. Specifically, it is a system of exemption from the GATT MFN clause that obligates WTO member countries to treat the imports of all other WTO member countries not worse than they treat the imports of their "most favoured" trading partner. The objective of GSP is to assist developing countries on poverty reduction, by helping them to generate revenue through international trade. In EU law, the GSP traditionally comes under the Common Commercial Policy, Article 133 of the EC Treaty as amended by Article 188 C of the Treaty of Lisbon. Implementation and utilisation of GSP should not solely be a duty of the preference-granting country but of the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>country</b> as well.

40|$|The few {{empirical}} studies which {{examine the effects}} of preferential trade liberalization on growth find no direct relationship between membership in a PTA and growth across countries. This is somewhat surprising, given the large literature which argues that trade liberalization is likely to encourage more rapid growth. However, sensitivity analysis has shown that this link between freer trade and growth may be indirect, as freer trade strongly increases investment, and higher investment strongly increases growth. This paper tests for both direct and indirect effects of preferential trade liberalization on growth and investment, by examining the impact of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [...] a non-reciprocal PTA implemented by the U. S. in 1984 to encourage growth and development in Caribbean and Central American countries. A two-equation simultaneous system is estimated, using pooled data on twelve <b>beneficiary</b> <b>countries,</b> from 1970 - 1998.
