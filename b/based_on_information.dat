40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} of data association of the Optimal Assignment (OA) algorithm <b>based</b> <b>on</b> dynamic <b>information,</b> an improved Point-Track Optimal Assignment (IPTOA) algorithm <b>based</b> <b>on</b> multi-source <b>information</b> is proposed. The improved algorithm gets valid 3 -tuple of measurement set by solving 3 -Dimensional (3 -D) assignment problem which is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> dynamic <b>information.</b> Then fuses multi-source information by combination rule of D-S evidence theory and constructs the point-track correlation matrix between valid 3 -tuple of measurement and target track. Compared with the optimal assignment algorithm <b>based</b> <b>on</b> dynamic <b>information,</b> the new algorithm effectively fuses multi-source information to correlate measurement data, which improves the performance of multi-target tracking in different degrees. Simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the new algorithm...|$|R

5|$|The National Register of Electors is updated {{to reflect}} various {{changes in the}} Canadian population, {{including}} address changes, reaching voting age, naturalisation, and death. Every year, about 3,000,000 address changes are processed by Elections Canada from information obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency, Canada Post, provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent voters lists. Every year, about 400,000 Canadians reach voting age and 200,000 Canadians die, resulting in changes to the National Register of Electors <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>information</b> obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency, provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent voters lists. Additionally, 120,000 individuals a year become naturalised Canadians, and {{are added to the}} National Register of Electors by Elections Canada <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>information</b> obtained from Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Collectively, these represent about 20% of the entries in the National Register of Electors.|$|E

5|$|By {{capturing}} Glina, the HV trapped {{the bulk}} of the ARSK Kordun Corps and about 35,000 evacuating civilians in the area of Topusko, prompting its commander to request UNCRO protection. The 1st Guards Brigade, approaching Topusko from Vojnić, received orders to engage the ARSK Kordun Corps, but the orders were cancelled at midnight by the chief of the HV General Staff. Instead, the Zagreb Corps was instructed to prepare a brigade-strength unit to escort unarmed persons and ARSK officers and non-commissioned officers with side arms to Dvor and allow them to cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>information</b> obtained from UN troops, it was believed that the ARSK forces in Banovina were about to surrender.|$|E
