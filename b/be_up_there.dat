500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Blood was generally positive. Writing for Blogcritics, Marty Dodge praised the album as [...] "jaw droppingly impressive", considering it to [...] " [...] {{the potential to}} <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> in top albums of the year". Andrew Reilly of MadeLoud lauded Blood as OSI's best album, although considered other individual songs from the band's catalog to be stronger than those on the album. Alex Henderson of Allmusic regarded Blood as [...] "an album that falls short of earth-shattering but is still solid and worthwhile".|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{was asked}} about the {{controversy}} during a trip to Canada in 1969. He repeated his opinion that the Beatles were more influential on young people than Christ, adding that some ministers had agreed with him. He called the protestors in the US [...] "fascist Christians", saying he was [...] "very big on Christ. I've always fancied him. He was right." [...] In 1978, he thanked Jesus {{for an end to the}} Beatles' touring, saying [...] "if I hadn't said [...] and upset the very Christian Ku Klux Klan, well, Lord, I might still <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with all the other performing fleas! God bless America. Thank you, Jesus." ...|$|E
500|$|... no {{data was}} {{available}} {{for the number of}} women's football players in the country. In 2006, there was international uproar when Saudi authorities sought to prevent women from attending a game between the Saudi Arabia national football team and the Sweden national football team. In 2008, the situation for women's football in the Middle East was said by author Gary Brecher to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> in popularity of freedom and democracy in the region. An all-women's school sporting competition was held at Effat University in 2010. The tournament was investigated by Saudi authorities because, according to Ahmed al-Zahrani, director of the Girls Education Department in Jeddah, the country does not have [...] "any regulations that say that it's okay for girl schools to hold sports classes or training". In 2011, women's football was seen as a way to combat a growing problem of obesity in the country.|$|E

500|$|In a February 4, 2008 {{appearance}} on the G4 television program Attack of the Show!, Mark Ebner, journalist {{and author of the}} book Hollywood, Interrupted, and Nick Douglas of Gawker.com commented on Project Chanology. Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Romeo Void {{formed at}} the San Francisco Art Institute in February 1979. Vocalist Debora Iyall {{occasionally}} visited the Bay Area to see Patti Smith perform. She {{decided to pursue}} an art education after reading a fortune cookie. [...] "It was in the late '70s at the Indochina Friendship Booth at the annual Fourth of July streetfair in Eureka, California," [...] she said. [...] "I got a fortune cookie that said 'Art is your fate, don't debate.' That next January, I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco." [...] She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it {{in my mind that}} you had to be skinny to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just do whatever you want, be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength {{to come back here}} – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said three or four months ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do that, I believe we will <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E

Why, they are twenty feet from the ground, so that you would want a long ladder, and when you got <b>up</b> <b>there</b> you would find {{that you could not}} open the shutters. I said nobody had <b>been</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> but I did go up myself to have a look round when I first settled down here, and there is a big bar with a padlock." ...|$|R
500|$|On {{top of his}} {{technical}} talent, Friday {{was physically}} very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: [...] "When {{he was in the}} line-up you'd have a centre-forward and a centre-half; not only would he <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as [...] "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. [...] "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. [...] "They couldn't get the ball off him. He was {{one of those guys who}} could beat five players easily". Andrews agreed: [...] "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him".|$|E

[...] "They sleep, eat, train and rest, that's all they do but as an athlete you have to do all those things. Running with Craig made me feel more positive," [...] Farah said. [...] "If I ever want {{to be as good as}} these athletes I've got to work harder. I don't just want to be British number one, I want to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with the best." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his joint {{review of}} Electronic Sound and Life with the Lions, Ed Ward of Rolling Stone {{dismissed}} the Lennons' album as [...] "utter bullshit" [...] {{and said that}} Harrison had [...] "done quite well learning his way around his new Moog Synthesizer {{in such a short}} time, but he's still got a way to go". Ward added: [...] "The textures presented are rather mundane, there is no use of dynamics for effect, and the works don't show any cohesiveness to speak of. However, if he's this good now, with diligent experimentation he ought to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with the best in short order." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like Guitar Hero, Rock Band has {{influenced}} the music culture. Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy, {{the founders of}} Harmonix, were together named in Time Magazines list of the 100 most influential people of 2008 for their creation of Rock Band. In the article, guitarist Steven Van Zandt claims, [...] "in the history of rock 'n' roll, Rock Band may just turn out to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> {{with the rise of}} FM radio, CDs or MTV." [...] Both were awarded the 2009 Game Developers Choice Pioneer Award for their influence on music video games culminating with Rock Band, and the 2010 USA Network's [...] "Character Approved" [...] Award for New Media in 2010 for the impact that their vision and leadership for Rock Band has had on the social nature of the game. A reality television show, Rock Band 2: The Stars, was created by VH1, featuring several players performing and being eliminated by judges Alice Cooper and Sebastian Bach. The Pennsylvania-based band, The Jellybricks, released a viral video of their song [...] "Ruin Us" [...] which is overplayed on footage from Rock Band 2 using avatars resembling the band members.|$|E
2500|$|Kirwan {{shouldered}} {{much of the}} songwriting responsibility {{during this}} troubled and uncertain period for the band, through the changes in both the line-up and in musical style. The pressure showed in his health and he suffered problems with alcoholism; stories abound of Kirwan not eating for several days at a time, subsisting largely on beer. [...] He gradually became estranged from the other band members, and things {{came to a head}} during the autumn of 1972. Before a concert on that year's US tour, Kirwan and Welch rowed over tuning and Kirwan flew into a rage, banging his head and fists against the wall, then smashing his Gibson Les Paul guitar and refused to go onstage. Instead he watched {{while the rest of the}} band struggled through without him, and offered unwelcome criticism afterwards. Kirwan was sacked by Fleetwood, who had hitherto been the only other member still speaking to him. Fleetwood later said: [...] "It was a torment for him, really, to <b>be</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> and it reduced him to someone who you just looked at and thought 'My God'. It was more a thing of, although he was asked to leave, the way I was looking at it was, I hoped, it was almost putting him out of his agony." [...] He later commented, [...] "I don't think he's ever forgiven me really." ...|$|E
