50|$|Lamborghini {{designed}} and built the Lamborghini 350GTV in only four months, in time for an October unveiling at the 1963 Turin Motor Show. Due to the ongoing disagreement with engine designer Giotto Bizzarrini, a working powerplant was not available for the prototype car {{in time for the}} show. The car went on display in Turin without an engine under its hood; according to lore, Ferruccio Lamborghini had the engine bay filled with bricks so that the car would sit at an appropriate height above the ground, and made sure that the <b>bonnet</b> <b>stayed</b> closed to hide the missing engine. The motoring press gave the 350GTV a warm response.|$|R
50|$|At this point, only Henry and Royal James {{were within}} range of each other. For five to six hours, the two sides dueled, each unable to move. Henry was {{grounded}} in a position which left her crew with minimal cover from incoming fire. The opposite was true for Royal James, whose hull provided a bulwark against enemy fire. During the fighting, <b>Bonnet</b> <b>stayed</b> on deck with his pistol in hand and warned that he would shoot any man who showed cowardice. The pirates' morale was good though; they cheered each other on and dared the South Carolinians to board. After five hours of fighting the South Carolinians had suffered 30 casualties, with nine pirates also killed or injured.|$|R
500|$|Bonnet {{set sail}} for Nassau, Bahamas, to the haven for pirates {{known as the}} [...] "pirates' republic", but he was seriously wounded en route during an {{encounter}} with a Spanish warship. After arriving in Nassau, Bonnet met Edward Teach, the infamous pirate Blackbeard. Incapable of leading his crew, Bonnet temporarily ceded his ship's command to Blackbeard. Before separating in December 1717, Blackbeard and Bonnet plundered and captured merchant ships along the East Coast. After Bonnet failed to capture the Protestant Caesar, his crew abandoned him to join Blackbeard aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge. <b>Bonnet</b> <b>stayed</b> on Blackbeard's ship as a guest, and did not command a crew again until summer 1718, when he was pardoned by North Carolina governor Charles Eden and received clearance to go privateering against Spanish shipping. Bonnet was tempted to resume his piracy, but {{did not want to}} lose his pardon, so he adopted the alias [...] "Captain Thomas" [...] and changed his ship's name to Royal James. He had returned to piracy by July 1718.|$|R
500|$|Under Captain Richards, the Revenge {{captured}} a Jamaican sloop, the Adventure, captained by David Herriot. Herriot joined the pirates, and Blackbeard now possessed three ships. Bonnet accompanied Blackbeard to South Carolina, where Blackbeard's four vessels blockaded {{the port of}} Charles Town in the late spring of 1718. Needing a place to rest and refit their vessels, Blackbeard and Bonnet headed north to Topsail Island, where the Queen Anne's Revenge ran aground and was lost. Leaving the remaining three vessels at Topsail Island, Blackbeard and Bonnet went ashore and journeyed to Bath, which was then capital of North Carolina. Once there, both men accepted pardons from Governor Charles Eden under King George's Act of Grace, putatively on condition of their renouncing piracy forever. While Blackbeard quietly returned to Topsail Island, <b>Bonnet</b> <b>stayed</b> in Bath to get a [...] "clearance" [...] to take the Revenge to Denmark's Caribbean colony of St. Thomas, where he planned to buy a letter of marque and go privateering against Spanish shipping. Eden granted Bonnet this clearance.|$|R

5000|$|Bonnet and Gordon are cousins. They {{were born}} in Skegness, Lincolnshire, England, {{although}} his webpage In Memory Of states Gordon was born 18 May 1948, in Blackpool, Lancashire. While <b>Bonnet</b> <b>stayed</b> in England, Gordon grew up in Australia where he met the Bee Gees {{for the first time}} in 1964, on which Gordon recorded [...] "House Without Windows" [...] and [...] "And I'll Be Happy" [...] both songs were written by Barry Gibb In 1965, Gordon recorded two other Barry Gibb compositions: [...] "Little Miss Rhythm and Blues" [...] and [...] "Here I Am". Gordon returned to England in 1966 and recorded one single as 'Trev Gordon' then returned to Australia, and returned to England again in 1967 to join Grahamâ€™s band the Graham Bonnet Set. In 1968, they became the Marbles, and signed a recording contract with the Australian record label impresario, Robert Stigwood. [...] Although Stigwood signed only Bonnet and Gordon, drummer Steve Hardy from the Blue Sect/the Graham Bonnet Set, continued to work with them. Hardy's vocal work was on the song [...] "By the Light of the Burning Candle" [...] (with vocals by Gordon originally, later, the song was reworked in July 1968 with Bonnet on vocals).|$|R
5000|$|He {{arrived in}} Bali in 1929 {{where he met}} the German artist Walter Spies and the Dutch musicologist Jaap Kunst. With Kunst, he made a trip to Nias, {{returning}} to Bali in 1930. He was invited to live in Ubud in by Cokorda Gde Raka Sukawati. Between 1929 and 1940 <b>Bonnet</b> <b>stayed</b> in Ubud. When Spies moved to Campuhan, Bonnet took over Spies' water palace in Ubud and set up his studio. He became involved in community issues including healthcare and education. He was also very involved in the Pita Maha movement, which encouraged local artists to raise their artistic standards. After the Japanese arrived in Bali, Bonnet remained free until 1942 when {{he was ordered to}} be sent to Sulawesi. He spent the remainder of World War II in internment camps in Pare-Pare, Bolong and Makassar. In 1947 Bonnet returned to Bali where he built his house and studio in Campuan. [...] Despite the deterioration in the relationship between The Republic of Indonesia and Holland Bonnet was able to stay due to his relationship with President Sukarno who had collected 14 of his works. He was expelled from Indonesia in 1957 after he refused to finish a portrait of President Soekarno; he was able to return 15 years later.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the people}} of the North Carolina coast very seldom {{interfered}} with pirates, as we have seen, and it is likely that <b>Bonnet</b> might have <b>stayed</b> in port as long as he pleased, and repaired and refitted his vessel without molestation if he had bought and paid for the planks and timber he required. But when it came to boldly seizing their property, that was too much even for {{the people of}} the region, and complaints of Bonnet's behavior spread from settlement to settlement, and it very soon became known all down the coast that there was a pirate in North Carolina who was committing depredations there and was preparing to set out on a fresh cruise.|$|R
60|$|The {{old home}} life began again, {{although}} it was a very quiet life. Dickory went into Mr. Delaplaine's counting-house, but it was hard for the young man to doff the naval uniform which had been bestowed upon him by Blackbeard, for he knew he looked very well in it, and everybody else thought so and told him so; but it could not be helped, and with all convenient speed he discarded his cocked hat {{and all the rest of}} it, and clothed himself in the simple garb of a merchant's clerk, although it might be said, that in all the West Indies, at that day, there was no clerk so good-looking as was Dickory. Dame Charter was so thankful that her boy had come safely through all his troubles, so proud of him, and so eminently well satisfied with his present position, that she asked nothing of her particular guardian angel but that Stede <b>Bonnet</b> might <b>stay</b> away. If, after tiring of piracy, that man came back, as his relatives wished him to do, the good dame was sure he would make mischief of some sort, and as like as not in the direction of her Dickory. If this evil family genius should be lost at sea or should disappear from the world in some equally painless and undisgraceful fashion, Dame Charter was sure that she could in a reasonable time quiet the grief of poor Kate; for what right-minded damsel could fail to mingle thankfulness with her sorrow that a kind death should relieve a parent from the sins and disgraces which in life always seemed to open up in front of him.|$|R
