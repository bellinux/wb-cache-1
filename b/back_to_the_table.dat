5|$|This coup {{was soon}} {{followed}} {{by his first}} world title in 1942. Over the following three decades, Crane won almost two dozen major championships, including the World Crown in 1946, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1972, the Ballantine International Championship in 1965, the International Roundrobin championship in 1968, and the World Series of Billiards in 1978 at age 65. Of these triumphs, his win at the 1966 World Crown is the most celebrated. At that tournament, he ran 150 and out in the finals, never letting his opponent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> after an early safety battle; an accomplishment {{that has never been}} equaled. Crane also holds the record for the most runner-up finishes for the World Crown with 13.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Project #9 {{was brought}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> after {{catching}} {{the interest of}} Michael Bennett, then {{in the midst of}} his success with A Chorus Line. Ralph and Devine returned, and Bennett had Eyen, who was to direct, begin workshopping Big Dreams, as the musical was now known. Joining the cast at this time were Ben Harney, Obba Babatunde, Cleavant Derricks, and twenty-year-old gospel singer Jennifer Holliday as Carter's replacement (after Carter accepted an offer from NBC to star in Gimme a Break). However, Holliday left the project during the workshopping phase, as she disliked the material and was upset that her character, Effie White, died at the conclusion of the first act. Eyen, Bennett, and Krieger continued to iron out the story and songs. Cheryl Gaines and Phyllis Hyman were both considered as replacements for Holliday.|$|E
25|$|Liang faced Northern Ireland's Joe Swail in {{the last}} 16 of the tournament. In a humorous incident, Liang fluked a red after {{scattering}} the balls, but failed to notice {{and went back to}} his seat. To laughter, Swail pointed out his mistake and the referee called Liang <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> In the 23rd frame, Liang, with a 12–10 lead, prematurely celebrated winning after potting match ball, only to go on to lose the frame due to a snooker. Swail came back to level the match at 12–12. In the final frame, Liang made breaks of 34 and 30 early on. He missed the final yellow but snookered Swail, leaving the white in the jaws of the pocket. Liang played a safety and Swail snookered him behind the blue, but Liang failed to hit the ball and Swail had the white replaced. Liang then hit the yellow directly. This incident proved controversial as the referee replaced the white in the wrong position, giving Liang a better sight of the yellow. At the time, Swail nodded his assent to the referee, but in a post-match interview, complained and accused Liang of unprofessional behaviour for not pointing out the referee's error. Commentators countered that Swail should have queried the placement of the ball before Liang took his shot, and given the tension of the situation Liang could be forgiven for not thinking clearly. Liang {{went on to win the}} frame 74–34, and thus, the match 13–12.|$|E
