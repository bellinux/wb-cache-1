5|$|Doxorubicin is {{commonly}} used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, <b>bleomycin,</b> vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).|$|E
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent <b>bleomycin.</b> Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius {{are exposed}} to the DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, <b>bleomycin</b> or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S.solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bleomycin,</b> a {{glycopeptide}} {{isolated from}} Streptomyces verticillus, also intercalates DNA, but produces free radicals that damage DNA. This occurs when <b>bleomycin</b> binds to a metal ion, becomes chemically reduced and reacts with oxygen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bleomycin</b> (a {{chemotherapeutic}} agent) {{and possibly}} taxane chemotherapy may cause scleroderma, and occupational exposure to solvents {{has been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} systemic sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{chemotherapeutic}} {{agents are}} associated with organ-specific toxicities, including cardiovascular disease (e.g., doxorubicin), interstitial lung disease (e.g., <b>bleomycin)</b> and occasionally secondary neoplasm (e.g., MOPP therapy for Hodgkin's disease).|$|E
25|$|Role of Thy-1 in {{fibrosis}} and fibroblast differention {{may have}} some tissue variation. In lung fibrosis Thy-1 level is suppressed in stimulated fibroblasts. Thy1 knock out mice have increased fibrosis in the lung. Fibrosis induced by radiation mimicking chemotherapeutic agent <b>Bleomycin</b> is also increased in these mice.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{therapy is}} a {{combination}} of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with mesna, BCD (<b>bleomycin,</b> cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low.|$|E
25|$|Electrochemotherapy is the {{combined}} treatment in which injection of a chemotherapeutic drug {{is followed by}} application of high-voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor. The treatment enables the chemotherapeutic drugs, which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells (such as <b>bleomycin</b> and cisplatin), to enter the cancer cells. Hence, greater effectiveness of antitumor treatment is achieved.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as <b>bleomycin</b> and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is {{difficult}} to treat, {{and it does not}} respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone CHOP, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone , vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, <b>bleomycin</b> VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{can cause}} anemia; {{intravenous}} iron {{has been found}} to be more effective than oral iron supplements in reducing the need for blood transfusions. Typical cycles of treatment involve one treatment every 3 weeks, repeated for 6 weeks or more. Fewer than 6 weeks (cycles) of treatment is less effective than 6 weeks or more. Germ-cell malignancies are treated differently than other ovarian cancers— a regimen of <b>bleomycin,</b> etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) is used with 5 days of chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 3 to 4 cycles. Chemotherapy for germ cell tumors has not been shown to cause amenorrhea, infertility, birth defects, or miscarriage. Maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective.|$|E

2500|$|Although most of {{the drugs}} derived from {{bacteria}} are employed as anti-infectives, some have found use in other fields of medicine. [...] Botulinum toxin (from Clostridium botulinum) and <b>bleomycin</b> (from Streptomyces verticillus) are two examples. [...] Botulinum, the neurotoxin responsible for botulism, can be injected into specific muscles (such as those controlling the eyelid) to prevent muscle spasm. [...] Also, the glycopeptide <b>bleomycin</b> {{is used for the}} treatment of several cancers including Hodgkin's lymphoma, head and neck cancer, and testicular cancer. [...] Newer trends in the field include the metabolic profiling and isolation of natural products from novel bacterial species present in underexplored environments. [...] Examples include symbionts or endophytes from tropical environments, subterranean bacteria found deep underground via mining/drilling, and marine bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{a letter from}} Steven Wolff, an oncologist at Vanderbilt University, Armstrong went to the Indiana University medical center in Indianapolis [...] and decided to receive {{the rest of his}} treatment there. The standard treatment for Armstrong's cancer was a [...] "cocktail" [...] of the drugs <b>bleomycin,</b> etoposide, and cisplatin (or Platinol) (BEP). The first chemotherapy cycle that Armstrong underwent included BEP, but for the three remaining cycles, he was given an alternative, vinblastine etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP), to avoid lung toxicity associated with <b>bleomycin.</b> Armstrong credited this with saving his cycling career. At Indiana University, Lawrence Einhorn had pioneered the use of cisplatin to treat testicular cancer. Armstrong's primary oncologist there was Craig Nichols. On October 25, his brain lesions which were found to contain extensive necrosis, were surgically removed by Scott A. Shapiro, a professor of neurosurgery at Indiana University.|$|E
2500|$|Test {{articles}} passing muster {{in vitro}} can be evaluated {{in a number}} of in vivo models (usually in mice) of ALI including chlorine inhalation, intratracheal instillation of <b>bleomycin</b> and in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) overexpressing transgenic mice exposed to high dose doxycycline. Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. <b>Bleomycin</b> is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. <b>Bleomycin</b> forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased lung compliance. A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{carried out}} in the 1980s {{revealed}} that a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant called XR-1 was [...] "extremely sensitive" [...] with regard to being killed by gamma rays during the G1 portion of the cell cycle but, in the same research studies, showed [...] "nearly normal resistance" [...] to gamma-ray damage during the late S phase; {{and in the course of}} this research, XR-1’s cell-cycle sensitivity was correlated with its inability to repair DNA double-strand breaks produced by ionizing radiation and restriction enzymes. [...] In particular, in a study using somatic cell hybrids of XR-1 cells and human fibroblasts, Giaccia et al. (1989) showed that the XR-1 mutation was a recessive mutation; [...] and in follow-up to this work, Giaccia et al. (1990) carried out further studies examining the XR-1 mutation (again using somatic cell hybrids formed between XR-1 and human fibroblasts) and were able to map the human complementing gene to chromosome 5 using chromosome-segregation analysis. [...] Giaccia et al, tentatively assigned this human gene the name “XRCC4” (an abbreviation of “X-ray-complementing Chinese hamster gene 4”) and determined that (a) the newly named XRCC4 gene biochemically restored the hamster defect to normal levels of resistance to gamma-ray radiation and <b>bleomycin</b> and (b) the XRCC4 gene restored the proficiency to repair DNA DSBs. [...] Based on these findings, Giaccia et al. proposed that XRCC4 ― as a single gene― was responsible for the XR-1 phenotype.|$|E

50|$|Allergic {{reactions}} to <b>bleomycin</b> can occur. A small test dose of <b>bleomycin</b> is often given {{prior to the}} first round of ABVD to screen for patients who may be allergic.|$|E
50|$|The {{most serious}} {{complication}} of <b>bleomycin</b> is pulmonary fibrosis and impaired lung function. It {{has been suggested}} that <b>bleomycin</b> induces sensitivity to oxygen toxicity and recent studies support the role of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1beta in the mechanism of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Any previous treatment with <b>bleomycin</b> should therefore always be disclosed to the anaesthetist prior to undergoing a procedure requiring general anaesthesia. Due to the oxygen sensitive nature of <b>bleomycin,</b> and the theorised increased likelihood of developing pulmonary fibrosis following supplemental oxygen therapy, it has been questioned whether patients should take part in scuba diving following treatment with the drug.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bleomycin</b> acts by {{induction}} of DNA strand breaks. Some studies suggest <b>bleomycin</b> also inhibits incorporation of thymidine into DNA strands. DNA cleavage by <b>bleomycin</b> depends on oxygen and metal ions, {{at least in}} vitro. The exact mechanism of DNA strand scission is unresolved, {{but it has been}} suggested that <b>bleomycin</b> chelates metal ions (primarily iron), producing a pseudoenzyme that reacts with oxygen to produce superoxide and hydroxide free radicals that cleave DNA. An alternative hypothesis states that <b>bleomycin</b> may bind at specific sites in the DNA strand and induce scission by abstracting the hydrogen atom from the base, resulting in strand cleavage as the base undergoes a Criegee-type rearrangement, or forms an alkali-labile lesion. In addition, these complexes also mediate lipid peroxidation and oxidation of other cellular molecules. Therefore, <b>bleomycin</b> is used in combination with doxorubicin in Hodgkins lymphoma, as they have additive and complementary effects on the DNA, since doxorubicin acts by intercalating between DNA strands, and also acts on topoisomerase II enzyme thus relaxing the topoisomerase complexes.|$|E
50|$|Stubbe, in {{collaboration}} with John Kozarich, also elucidated the structure and function of <b>bleomycin,</b> an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat cancer. They discovered how <b>bleomycin</b> induces DNA strand breaks in tumor cells, which in turn induces apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|Pseudoapoptosis {{has also}} been used in some {{instances}} when describing an accelerated, drug induced apoptotic pathway by <b>bleomycin.</b> Cell death occurs as it would in apoptosis, but certain apoptotic mechanisms are not utilized when {{in the presence of}} <b>bleomycin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pulmonary toxicity, or lung damage, {{can occur}} {{with the use}} of <b>bleomycin</b> in ABVD, {{especially}} when radiation therapy to the chest is also given as part of the treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. This toxicity develops months to years after completing chemotherapy, and usually manifests as cough and shortness of breath. High concentrations of oxygen, such as those often used in surgery, can trigger lung damage in patients who have received <b>bleomycin,</b> even years later. Pulmonary function tests are often used to assess for bleomycin-related damage to the lungs. One study found <b>bleomycin</b> lung damage in 18% of patients receiving ABVD for Hodgkin disease. Retrospective analyses have questioned whether <b>bleomycin</b> is necessary at all; however, at this point it remains a standard part of ABVD.|$|E
