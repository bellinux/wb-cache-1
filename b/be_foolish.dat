5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would <b>be</b> <b>foolish,</b> for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It would <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with Spencer holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led Spencer going into the last lap of the race. Heading down the back straight, Spencer placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, Spencer came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and into the dirt. Spencer was able {{to get back on the}} track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would have to win the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with Spencer finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting end to a great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however Spencer was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E

25|$|Charvaka {{believed}} {{that there was nothing}} wrong with sensual pleasure. Since it is impossible to have pleasure without pain, Charvaka thought that wisdom lay in enjoying pleasure and avoiding pain as far as possible. Unlike many of the Indian philosophies of the time, Charvaka did not believe in austerities or rejecting pleasure out of fear of pain and held such reasoning to <b>be</b> <b>foolish.</b>|$|E

Consequently, Batman is forced to recapture the escapees, a mission that takes him three months and drives him {{to the brink of}} mental and physical collapse. Exhausted, Batman returns to his home in Wayne Manor, only to find Bane waiting for him.|$|E
25|$|On December 6, 2006, Deming {{testified before}} the US Senate {{committee}} on the Environmental and Public Works, concluding that The amount of climatic warming {{that has taken place}} in the past 150 years is poorly constrained, and its cause--human or natural--is unknown. There is no sound scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty. If the climate does warm, {{it is likely to be}} beneficial to humanity rather than harmful. In my opinion, it would <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria.|$|E
25|$|In October 1967, he met Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, {{and asked}} him to inform other Communist leaders, as well as Arab leaders about his ideas for a {{peaceful}} settlement. In early 1970, he was invited to talks by Egyptian president Gamel Abdel Nasser, but was stopped by the Israeli government. Attempts to contact the Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, in 1974, were even seen as high treason. Goldmann thought this behavior to <b>be</b> <b>foolish.</b> In 1982, he called on the Israeli Prime Minister to not reanimate anti-Zionism and antisemitism with the campaign in the Lebanon.|$|E

Skeptical males said she would be lucky to get three applicants; actually she had 151 the first year (1918), and has had to turn many away ever since. At first, the Reformed Church in America was the main backer of the Vellore school, but since Dr. Scudder agreed to make it coeducational it {{has the support of}} 40 missions. Of 242 students today, 95 are men.|$|E
500|$|Dmowski had a scientist's {{background}} and thus preferred logic and reason over emotion and passion. He once told famous pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski that music was [...] "mere noise". Dmowski {{felt very strongly}} that Poles should abandon what he considered to <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> romantic nationalism and useless gestures of defiance and should instead work hard at becoming businessmen and scientists. Dmowski was very much influenced by Social Darwinist theories, then popular in the Western world, and saw life as a merciless struggle between [...] "strong" [...] nations who dominated and [...] "weak" [...] nations who were dominated.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him.

McKinley decided against this, feeling {{that he could not}} outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, and that he would <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to try. [...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E

500|$|... "Goodbye, Toby" [...] was {{generally}} well-received by critics. TV Squad's Jay Black said that [...] "The Office {{is at its}} best when its exposing the dramas that take [...] place at every workplace". Black {{went on to say}} that Angela's rudeness to Phyllis [...] "was a small thread throughout the show, but a hilarious one". Kelly West of Cinemablend.com wrote that even though the episode did not play-out [...] "the way [...] expected", she was [...] "definitely not complaining". Alan Sepinwall, a writer for The Star-Ledger, was critical of the proposal scenario, saying that [...] "I really, really, really hope the writers aren't going to <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> enough to try to create real strife in the PB (Pam Beesly and Jim) relationship over how long it's going to take Jim to propose." [...] Furthermore, Sepinwall felt that [...] "Goodbye, Toby" [...] might have been, up until that point in the series, the show's [...] "best hour-long 'Office' ever".|$|E
500|$|On 15 February 1990, in {{a speech}} {{delivered}} at the Sapienza University of Rome, Cardinal Ratzinger (later to become Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called [...] "a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, {{of science and technology}} goes today". Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying [...] "The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune." [...] The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views." ...|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on February 17, 1911. The film was met {{with a wide variety}} of reviews by critics; with the majority proving to be negative. The Morning Telegraph, like others, found the story to <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> and completely improbable on many accounts. While the reviewer stated that no magistrate would have sent the man to jail for assault with a blunt knife, it was the jail substitution via a changing of clothes which proved to be impossible. H. Jeanval of The Moving Picture News found the baron to be boorish by shading a lady's hand with a glove on and wondered at how Thanhouser was able to film the prison scenes. Walton, also of The Moving Picture News summed up the film and stated, [...] "Good teaching as to woman's 'class', but as to details sadly lax." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror panned the film beginning with, [...] "Nothing more improbable or inconsistent has been seen on the screen in some time..." [...] The reviewer concluded the review of the improbable plot as to having been [...] "dreamed up by a ten-year-old girl." ...|$|E

500|$|Mustaine stated {{he did not}} [...] "go {{into making}} this record with any pre-conceived notions". He {{said some of the}} lyrics on United Abominations were written about his {{frustration}} with his past record labels, stating [...] "a lot of that translated into the intensity on the record." [...] Mustaine wrote the songs for the album in an attempt to [...] "stir something {{in the minds of the}} listener". The lyrics of the album were mostly about choices the American government were making at the time, which Mustaine found to <b>be</b> <b>foolish.</b> Mustaine stated recording the new songs was [...] "super fun", despite having troubles with some of the complex music and vocal arrangements. All of the lyrics and music, with the exception of one song, were written by Mustaine. [...] "Never Walk Alone... A Call to Arms" [...] was co-written by Mustaine and guitarist Glen Drover. When bassist James LoMenzo was asked about the lyrics of the album, he said to [...] "talk to Dave about that". Although most of the band had no writing credits on the album, they stated that they were excited about recording the music.|$|E
500|$|Clarence {{did well}} in school, and upon his {{graduation}} from Waltham High School in 1903, he took the entrance examinations for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He passed, and after taking basic courses at the school, did advanced work in engineering. During the summers, he worked for J.B. Worcester & Co., a firm which had constructed much of the Boston subway system. While at school, he became a favourite pupil of Professor George Swain; after Howe graduated in 1907, Swain offered Howe a job as his teaching assistant. Howe accepted, although the young engineer felt that he should leave the Boston area to begin his career. Soon afterwards, Howe was offered an opportunity to become an engineering professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A popular story about Howe was that Swain had Howe and fellow engineer James Barker toss a coin to see who would get the job. Barker denied the tale later in life, stating he {{had no interest in}} the position and no one who knew Howe would <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> enough to gamble with him, as Howe had shown himself to be uncommonly lucky. [...] In any event, Howe had no better prospects in sight; unemployment among his classmates was high due to the Panic of 1907.|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Singer {{said that}} Legion had been {{designed}} {{to fit into the}} X-Men universe, but also to stand alone, so [...] "you wouldn't have to label" [...] the relationship between the series and the films. Hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's [...] "subjective reality", it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away, noting that his series Fargo, which is connected to the 1996 film of the same name, at first [...] "had to stand on its own feet" [...] before exploring those connections more; [...] "We have to earn the right {{to be part of this}} universe. My hope is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call and say they would <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> enough not to connect these things." [...] He did state that [...] "you can't tell this story without" [...] acknowledging that Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, who appears in the films. This acknowledgement comes in [...] "Chapter 7", with the appearance of Xavier's signature wheelchair in one of Haller's memories. Hawley explained that Haller would look to learn more of his father in future seasons, with Xavier potentially making a physical appearance in the series at that point.|$|E
