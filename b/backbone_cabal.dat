50|$|The <b>backbone</b> <b>cabal</b> was an {{informal}} organization of large-site administrators {{of the worldwide}} distributed newsgroup-based discussion system Usenet. It existed from about 1983 at least into the 2000s.|$|E
50|$|Richard Sexton: I {{posted a}} few BIFF {{articles}} from my account at gryphon, {{but now there}} are about 20 people, well connected, posting BIFF forgeries. You probably don't {{want to hear that}} the people doing them had to find something to occupy themselves after they dissolved the <b>backbone</b> <b>cabal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{backbone}} providers, the <b>backbone</b> <b>cabal,</b> {{were instrumental}} in this reorganization of Usenet since they had great influence with respect to supporting a new newsgroup. Some suggest {{that members of the}} cabal had interests in bundling certain newsgroups into the talk.* hierarchy, so {{that they would not be}} objected to by their supervisors.|$|E
50|$|A {{historically}} significant Internet figure, he {{is renowned}} for first analyzing the Morris Worm, {{one of the}} earliest computer worms, and his role in the Usenet <b>backbone</b> <b>cabal.</b> Spafford {{was a member of the}} President's Information Technology Advisory Committee 2003-2005, has been an advisor to the National Science Foundation (NSF), and serves as an advisor to over a dozen other government agencies and major corporations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{birth of}} the alt.* {{hierarchy}} is tied to a drastic transformation of the Usenet, the Great Renaming of 1987. The [...] "backbone carriers", or the <b>backbone</b> <b>cabal</b> {{as they have been}} referred to by some users of the Usenet, were vital hubs in the distribution chain of most of the newsgroup postings. Their effort to change the way newsgroups are organized led to objections from some vocal Usenet users.|$|E
5000|$|There Is No Cabal is a catchphrase used on Usenet. Its common abbreviation, TINC, is used humorously {{to suggest}} that people should lighten up and not see a {{conspiracy}} around every corner. It is alternatively used as a pseudo-ironic statement, since presumably an insider or someone who knows [...] "the cabal" [...] would inevitably deny {{that there is a}} cabal. It was used extensively by members of the <b>backbone</b> <b>cabal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Horton {{continued}} to lead Usenet until 1988. During {{this time she}} promoted rapid growth by arranging news feeds for new sites. Each new site agreed to be the feed for two more new sites as the need arose. This policy contributed {{to the growth of}} Usenet to over 5000 sites by 1987. Along with Rick Adams and Eugene Spafford, Horton created the Usenet Backbone, later described as the <b>Backbone</b> <b>cabal.</b> The backbone insured the reliability and performance of the overall network.|$|E
50|$|The cabal {{was created}} {{in an effort to}} {{facilitate}} reliable propagation of new Usenet posts: While in the 1970s and 1980s many news servers only operated during night time to save on the cost of long distance communication, servers of the <b>backbone</b> <b>cabal</b> were available 24 hours a day. The administrators of these servers gained sufficient influence in the otherwise anarchic Usenet community to be able to push through controversial changes, for instance the Great Renaming of Usenet newsgroups during 1987.|$|E
