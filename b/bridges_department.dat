It consists of a continuous beam, supported at its ends and by two sloping legs, which are hinged at both ends. The side spans are 140 ft long, while the centre span is 190 ft long. It was probably the first bridge in England to use prestressing cables which did not pass through the concrete sections, {{and one of the first}} to use precast concrete hinges.

Two {{solutions to the}} over-determined set of equation involved in the identification methods are adopted. One is direct calculation of the pseudo inverse and another calculation of the pseudo inverse via the singular value decomposition technique for the ill-conditioned problems encountered. A few multi-axle vehicles were designed and constructed in the laboratory for validation purposes based on the ASSHTO standard specifications of highway bridges. Two kinds of frames between the tractor and trailer of trucks and, three types of vehicle suspension systems were simulated. Different multi-axle vehicle loads were identified from the measured bending moment responses of bridges under different operation condition in the laboratory. The effects of various vehicle and bridges parameters were evaluated. Comparative studies show that both TDM and FTDM methods involved in the moving force identification system (MFIS) are good identification methods and could efficiently identify the multi-axle vehicle loads on <b>bridges.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the impact interaction between the abutment and the girder subjected to nonuniform seismic excitation. An impact model based on tests is presented by taking material properties of the backfill of the abutment into consideration. The conditional simulation is performed to investigate the spatial variation of earthquake ground motions. A two-span continuous steel box girder bridge is taken as the example to analyze and assess the pounding interaction between the abutment and the girder. The detailed nonlinear finite element (FE) model is established and the steel girder and the reinforced concrete piers are modeled by nonlinear fiber elements. The pounding element of the abutment is simulated by using a trilinear compression gap element. The elastic-perfectly plastic element is used to model the nonlinear rubber bearings. The comparisons of the pounding forces, the shear forces of the nonlinear bearings, the moments of reinforced concrete piers, and the axial pounding stresses of the steel girder are studied. The made observations indicate that the nonuniform excitation for multisupport bridge is imperative in the analysis and evaluation of the pounding effects of the <b>bridges.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of crack {{growth for the}} fatigue damage accumulation near tip where damage is most severe is analyzed. Fatigue life is assessed for the welded members of bridges under traffic loading. Two parts are considered. They consist {{of the development of}} a fatigue damage accumulation model for welded bridge members and a method for calculating the stress intensity factor that is needed for evaluating the fatigue life of welded bridge members with cracks. Based on the concept of continuum damage accumulation and fatigue and fatigue crack growth relations, results are obtained to describe the relationship between the cracking count rate and the effective stress intensity factor. Crack growth and fatigue life are found for two types of welded members assisted by using fatigue experimental results. The stress intensity factors are modified by correcting for the geometric shape of the welded members in order to reflect the influence of the weldment and geometry. This is accomplished via the stress intensity factor. The calculated and measured fatigue lives were generally in good agreement for the initial cracking conditions of two types of welded members widely used in steel <b>bridges.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Long-span {{suspension}} bridges {{are often}} subject to multiple types of dynamic loads, especially those located in wind-prone regions and carrying both trains and road vehicles. Fatigue assessment shall be performed {{to ensure the}} safety and functionality of the bridges. This paper proposes a framework for fatigue analysis of a long-span suspension bridge under multiple loading by integrating computer simulation with structural health monitoring system. By taking the Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong as an example, a computationally efficient engineering approach is first proposed for dynamic stress analysis of the bridge under railway, highway and wind loading. The fatigue-critical locations are then determined for key bridge components, and databases of the dynamic stress responses at the critical locations are established. The time histories of dynamic stresses induced by individual loading during the design life of the bridge are generated based on the databases. The corresponding stress time histories due to the combined action of multiple loading are also compiled. Finally, fatigue analysis is performed to compute the cumulative fatigue damage over the design life of 120 years. The results indicate {{that it is necessary to}} consider the combined effect of multiple loading in the fatigue analysis of long-span suspension <b>bridges.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|For supertall structures, {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the most significant factors to affect the structural responses. For example, the field monitoring exercise of Guangzhou New TV Tower (GZNTVT) has shown that the diurnal movement at the top of the main structure due to variation of temperature could be as large as 10 cm in magnitude, which is even larger than the typhoon-induced displacement. Therefore, monitoring and understanding the temperature effects on the super-tall structure are of practical importance. A long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) system consisting of over 700 sensors of sixteen types has been implemented on the GZNTVT for real-time monitoring of the structure at both construction and service stages. For the supertall structures like GZNTVT, the non-symmetry, non-uniform, and twisted geometry configuration makes it not appropriate to develop a one-dimensional or two-dimensional finite element model like bridges to obtain the accurate temperature distribution. Consequently the temperature induced responses cannot be obtained. In this study, a method to predict temperature induced deformation of the supertall structures by using the measured strain data obtained from its SHM system is proposed. To verify the effectiveness, the predicted displacements are compared with the GPS-measured displacements. The proposed method can be extended to other supertall structures and <b>bridges.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} {{systems have been}} developed and installed in several long-span suspension bridges around the world, aiming to monitor structural health conditions of the bridges in real time. Nevertheless, many key issues remain unsolved, {{such as how to}} take full advantage of the health monitoring system for effective and reliable damage detection of these complex structures. An innovative testbed was therefore established in a laboratory to allow researchers to recreate rational damage scenarios, apply different sensors and sensing networks, and test various damage detection algorithms. The design principles of the laboratory-based testbed are introduced. The paper will then outline the design and setup of a physical model for a long-span suspension bridge, which will consider various damage scenarios. Geometric measurements and modal tests were subsequently carried out to identify its geometric configuration and dynamic characteristics, respectively. The finite-element modeling of the physical bridge model was finally established using a commercial software package, which was followed by a finite-element model updating the use of the measured modal properties. This testbed, comprising of the delicate physical model and the updated finite-element model of a long-span suspension bridge, could solve a benchmark problem for the structural health monitoring of long-span suspension <b>bridges.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the {{experimental}} validation of the multi-type sensor placement and response reconstruction method for structural health monitoring of long-span suspension bridges. The method for multi-type sensor placement and response reconstruction is briefly described. A test bed, comprising of a physical model and an updated finite element (FE) model of a long-span suspension bridge is also concisely introduced. The proposed method is then applied to the test bed; the equation of motion of the test bed subject to ground motion, the objective function for sensor location optimization, the principles for mode selection and multi-type response reconstruction are established. A numerical study using the updated FE model is performed to select the sensor types, numbers, and locations. Subsequently, with the identified sensor locations and some practical considerations, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, laser displacement transducers, and accelerometers are installed on the physical bridge model. Finally, experimental investigations are conducted to validate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the reconstructed responses using the measured responses from the limited number of multi-type sensors agree well with the actual bridge responses. The proposed method is validated to be feasible and effective for the monitoring of structural behavior of long-span suspension <b>bridges.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Support {{settlement}} and cable slippage of a long-span suspension bridge may occur {{when it is}} subjected to extreme events. The evaluation of effects of support {{settlement and}} cable slippage on the remaining capacity then becomes important before making a retrofitting decision. However, {{it is difficult to}} conduct such an evaluation on the prototype bridge. This paper therefore presents experimental and numerical studies {{to examine the effects of}} support settlement and cable slippage on the structural performance of a long-span suspension bridge through a testbed, which include a laboratory-based model and an updated finite-element (FE) model. Four support settlement cases are experimentally studied with two on anchorage settlements and two on tower settlements. Main cable slippage at the top of towers is then investigated experimentally in two opposite directions. Both support settlement cases and cable slippage cases are also simulated using the corresponding FE model, and results are compared with those from the tests. Finally, numerical studies are conducted to investigate cable slippage caused by large support settlement. The results show that the experimental and numerical simulation using the testbed is an effective way to assess the effects of support settlement and cable slippage on long-span suspension <b>bridges.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental EngineeringDepartment of Electrical Engineerin...|$|E
