5|$|On 13–14 November, Ferdinand of Bavaria (Ernst's <b>brother)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Count of Arenberg {{took the}} Elector's castle at Poppelsdorf; on 18 November, {{they moved to}} attack the Godesburg. This {{fortress}} was considerably stronger than the one at Poppelsdorf and of supreme strategic importance for the projected attack on Bonn, {{the capital city of}} the Electorate.|$|E
5|$|Richard III was {{followed}} by another adaptation, the comedy, Love Makes a Man, which was constructed by splicing together two plays by John Fletcher: The Elder <b>Brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Custom of the Country. Cibber's confidence was apparently restored {{by the success of}} the two plays, and he returned to more original writing.|$|E

5|$|Shea Ohmsford, the protagonist, Flick's adopted <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only {{remaining}} descendant of Jerle Shannara. Shea must find an ancient magical sword, the Sword of Shannara, {{and use it}} to destroy the antagonist, the Warlock Lord. A major theme of this novel revolves around Shea—part of his quest includes finding a belief in himself. This is a search that every subsequent Brooks protagonist must undergo.|$|E
5|$|Ernst {{depended}} on his <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Catholic barons in the Cathedral Chapter {{to hold the}} territory he acquired. In 1585, Munster, Paderborn, and Osnabrück succumbed to Ferdinand's energetic pursuit in the eastern regions of the electorate, and a short time later, Minden. With their help, Ernst could hold Bonn. Support {{from the city of}} Cologne itself was also secure. To oust Gebhard, though, Ernst ultimately had to appeal for aid to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who commanded Spanish forces in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Gaius Julius Caesar (named {{in honor}} of his famous relative) was born in Antium (modern Anzio and Nettuno) on 31 August 12 AD, the third of six {{surviving}} children born to Germanicus and his second cousin Agrippina the Elder. Gaius had two older brothers, Nero and Drusus, as well as three younger sisters, Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla. He was also a nephew of Claudius, Germanicus' younger <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> future emperor.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, back in England, Brock's brother William faced {{financial}} difficulties, as {{the bank}} {{in which he was}} a senior partner failed. Isaac's commissions had been purchased with a loan entered into the bank's books by his <b>brother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Brocks faced a demand for payment. Isaac could not meet the £3000 debt, but made over the whole of his salary to his brother Irving, to be used for whatever was considered most critical: his commission debt or the family's other bills.|$|E
5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction for his <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs would no longer have absolute power but would instead rule by the consent of the nobles. A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required the consent of the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Sharon Hawkins (Michele Morgan) – Virgil's older sister, Sharon attends college, but {{she still}} lives at home. She volunteers at a hospital, and counsels young people at the Freeman Community Center. While they do argue frequently, Sharon and Virgil really do care about each other and are quick {{to come to the}} other's defense if one of them is in danger. After their mother died, Sharon took it upon herself to act as the woman of the house after, mostly when it comes to doling out chores between her and her <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cooking (which, at least {{according}} to Virgil, Sharon is not good at).|$|E

5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the series, Hime is an {{extremely}} feminine-looking second-year high school student who gets troubled by debt collectors because his parents have racked up {{a large amount of}} debt in his name for constantly traveling overseas. When the student council pays off his creditors, he is obligated to join them as a servant, and must also cross-dress {{for the rest of his}} time in high school. While at first he only cross-dresses because he has no other choice, he starts to slowly shows signs of enjoying it, much to the delight of his <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> student council.|$|E
5|$|Through {{connections}} that Cohen had with record producer Samuel Charters, the group signed a recording contract with Vanguard Records in December 1966, {{just as the}} label, which had primarily released folk music, was attempting to branch out into the growing psychedelic rock scene. While the band waited to record their debut album, they were present at the Human Be-In, along with other influential San Francisco musical acts, including Jefferson Airplane, Big <b>Brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Holding Company, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The event was a prelude to the Summer of Love and helped publicize counterculture ideals such as ecology, free-love {{and the use of}} illicit drugs.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Earp was {{the last}} {{surviving}} Earp <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last surviving participant of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral when he died {{at home in the}} Earps' small rented bungalow at 4004 W 17th Street, in Los Angeles, of chronic cystitis on January 13, 1929, at the age of 80. His brother Newton died almost a month prior on December 18, 1928. Charlie Welsh's daughter Grace Spolidora and his daughter-in-law, Alma, were the only witnesses to Wyatt's cremation. Josephine was apparently too full of grief to assist. Wyatt was survived by Josephine and sister Adelia. He had no children.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there was}} never an {{official}} tour of the album, the band gigged in the UK to promote the album. They played dates in Ireland and Scandinavia, and in late October the band was to embark on their first tour of the United States. It was unsuccessful, {{mainly because of the}} mental breakdown of Barrett. In his capacity as tour manager, Andrew King travelled to New York to begin preparations, but he ran into serious problems. Visas had not arrived, prompting the cancellation of the first six dates. The band finally flew across the Atlantic on 1 November, but work permits were not yet obtained, so they settled into a hotel in Sausalito, California, just north of San Francisco. After a number of cancellations, the first US performance was given 4November at Winterland Ballroom, following Janis Joplin fronting Big <b>Brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Holding Company.|$|E
5|$|Arhys informs Daryus that Gabriel {{will be at}} Heaven's Cove {{that night}} ("Moment of Betrayal"). While the meeting time {{approaches}} ("Heaven's Cove"), Faythe decides {{that she wants to}} use the power of her royal status to change the world for good ("Begin Again"). At the amphitheater, Arhys changes his mind on the deal, and when Daryus shows up, they start a fight. Daryus overpowers Arhys and kills him ("The Path That Divides"), unaware that Xander followed them and saw the whole scene. As Xander runs to his father's dead body, Daryus sees the silhouette of someone approaching him. Assuming it to be Gabriel, he attempts to kill him, realising too late that it is actually Faythe ("The Walking Shadow"). Gabriel arrives at the scene and sees his dead <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dying Faythe. Covering Xander's ears, he unleashes a scream that causes Daryus to go deaf and that is heard by Nafaryus, Arabelle, and the entire town ("My Last Farewell").|$|E
5|$|Brodie died {{nine months}} before {{publication}} of the book. As death neared, the cancer spread to her brain and bones, and Brodie experienced intense pain. During this period, she was visited in the hospital by her brother Thomas, who had remained a practicing Latter-day Saint. Brodie asked him to “give me a blessing,” although she had long been estranged from both her <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> LDS Church. A few days later, Brodie released a note saying that her request for a priesthood blessing should not be misinterpreted as a request {{to return to the}} Church. It was Brodie’s last signed statement. In accordance with her wishes, friends spread her ashes over the Santa Monica Mountains, which she loved and had successfully helped to protect from real estate development.|$|E

5|$|Historian Ruth Brandon in {{an article}} for the New Scientist noted that William Huggins, Serjeant Cox, Crooke's wife and daughter, his {{laboratory}} assistant, and a Mrs Humphrey were all present during the Crookes experiments with Home. However, Barry Wiley has written that when Crookes published his report on the experiments in the Quarterly Journal of Science in 1871 {{he did not mention}} all the names of the observers present in the room. Wiley has stated that four females were present during the experiments as was Crookes' <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> original report by Crookes did not refer to any spirits but many years later in 1889 he revealed in his Notes of séances with D. D. Home the names of the observers and claimed Home was in communication with spirits.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} festival, the Experience were booked {{for a series}} of five concerts at Bill Graham's Fillmore, with Big <b>Brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane. The Experience {{outperformed}} Jefferson Airplane during the first two nights, and replaced them {{at the top of the}} bill on the fifth. Following their successful West Coast introduction, which included a free open-air concert at Golden Gate Park and a concert at the Whisky a Go Go, the Experience were booked as the opening act for the first American tour of the Monkees. They requested Hendrix as a supporting act because they were fans, but their young audience disliked the Experience, who left the tour after six shows. Chandler later admitted that he engineered the tour in an effort to gain publicity for Hendrix.|$|E
5|$|Several {{more people}} are {{attacked}} and reduced to ash. A search of Eastern European employees leads them to Russian night nurse Tomas (Ravil Isyanov), but he is gone when they search his apartment. Despite being ordered to end the investigation and that the suspect is wanted by the Russian government and the CIA, Broyles tells Olivia (Anna Torv) to continue the case. Walter posits the entity needs radiation, and chooses its victims based on their exposure levels. They learn that Tomas stole his comatose brother, a former cosmonaut, and has been moving him around to both protect him and contain the entity. Fearing capture, Tomas removes his brother from the hospital; Walter speculates that the cosmonaut brought the entity back with him upon returning from space. Walter is finally able to solve the formula, and Broyles sadly tells Tomas over the phone that his <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> entity cannot be separated. However, during their conversation, the entity escapes his brother's body and kills Tomas. The Fringe team is able to trace the call, and Broyles shoots the host (Tomas' brother) in the head to stop the entity from attacking another victim.|$|E
