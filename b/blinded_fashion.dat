40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Adjudication {{committees}} (ACs) {{are recommended}} in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to standardize {{the assessment of}} events. We aimed to assess the reporting and functioning of ACs (synonyms: clinical event committees, endpoint committees) in clinical trials. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched five high-impact-factor medical journals for reports of RCTs with clinical event endpoints published between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. RESULTS: ACs were reported in 33. 4 % of the 314 reports of RCTs. ACs were reported in 29. 6 % of trials with low risk of misclassification (i. e., "hard" main outcome), in 47. 5 % of trials with medium risk of misclassification (i. e., subjective main outcome and intervention delivered in a <b>blinded</b> <b>fashion)</b> and in 31 % of trials with high risk of misclassification (i. e., subjective main outcome without intervention delivered in a <b>blinded</b> <b>fashion).</b> Selected cases to be adjudicated consisted largely of events identified by site investigators (93. 3 %). Data provided to the AC were reported for 47. 4 % of ACs. CONCLUSION: Reporting of ACs is not fitted {{to the risk of}} biased misclassification. Important aspects of the functioning of ACs are insufficiently reported or raise methodological issues. We propose some recommendations for planning and reporting ACs in clinical trials...|$|E

By assuming that the nonlinear distortion function makes the observed signal less sparse (this is observed in frequency transforms), the proposed method aims at estimating the original signal via a sparsity recovery procedure. Our approach is based on an approximation of the ℓ 0 -norm and on the use of polynomial functions as compensating structures. In order to assess the viability of the developed method, we perform a representative set of experiments on synthetic data...|$|R
