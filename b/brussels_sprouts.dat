5|$|Cabbage (Brassica oleracea or B.oleracea var. capitata, var. tuba, var. sabauda or var. acephala) is {{a member}} of the genus Brassica and the mustard family, Brassicaceae. Several other cruciferous {{vegetables}} (sometimes known as cole crops) are considered cultivars of B.oleracea, including broccoli, collard greens, <b>brussels</b> <b>sprouts,</b> kohlrabi and sprouting broccoli. All of these developed from the wild cabbage B.oleracea var. oleracea, also called colewort or field cabbage. This original species evolved over thousands of years into those seen today, as selection resulted in cultivars having different characteristics, such as large heads for cabbage, large leaves for kale and thick stems with flower buds for broccoli.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts,</b> cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|Many plants, {{including}} {{a variety of}} food plants, synthesize dopamine to varying degrees. The highest concentrations have been observed in bananas—the fruit pulp of red and yellow bananas contains dopamine at levels of 40 to 50 parts per million by weight. Potatoes, avocados, broccoli, and <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts</b> may also contain dopamine at levels of 1 part per million or more; oranges, tomatoes, spinach, beans, and other plants contain measurable concentrations less than 1 part per million. The dopamine in plants is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine, by biochemical mechanisms {{similar to those that}} animals use. It can be metabolized in a variety of ways, producing melanin and a variety of alkaloids as byproducts. The functions of plant catecholamines have not been clearly established, but there is evidence that they {{play a role in the}} response to stressors such as bacterial infection, act as growth-promoting factors in some situations, and modify the way that sugars are metabolized. The receptors that mediate these actions have not yet been identified, nor have the intracellular mechanisms that they activate.|$|E

40|$|Differences in allelochemistry {{of plants}} may {{influence}} {{their ability to}} attract parasitoids. We studied responses of Diadegma semiclausum (Hellén), a parasitoid of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella L.), to inter- and intraspecific variation in odor blends of crucifers and a non-crucifer species. Uninfested <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> (Brassica oleracea L. gemmifera), white mustard (Sinapis alba L.), a feral Brassica oleracea, and malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were compared for their attractivity to D. semiclausum in a Y-tube bioassay. Odors from all plants were more attractive to the parasitoid than clean air. However, tested against each other, parasitoids preferred the volatile blend from the three cruciferous species over that of malting barley. Wasps also discriminated between uninfested crucifers: mustard was as attractive as feral B. oleracea, and both were more attractive than <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout.</b> Attractivity of uninfested plants was {{compared with that of}} plants infested by larvae of the host P. xylostella. Host-infested mustard and <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> were more attractive than uninfested conspecifics. Interestingly, the volatile blends of uninfested white mustard and infested <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> were equally attractive. We also compared the volatile composition of different plant sources by collecting headspace samples and analysing them with GC-MS. Similarities of volatile profiles were determined by hierarchic clustering and non-metric scaling based on the Horn-index. Due to the absence of several compounds in its blend, the volatile profile of barley showed dissimilarities from blends of crucifers. The odor profile of white mustard was distinctly different from the two Brassicaceae. Feral Brassica oleracea odor profile was different from infested <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout,</b> but showed overlap with uninfested <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout.</b> Odor blends from infested and uninfested <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> were similar, and mainly quantitative differences were found.

25|$|Calcium oxalate is {{the most}} common {{component}} of kidney stones. Early investigators isolated oxalic acid from wood-sorrel (Oxalis). Members of the spinach family and the brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, <b>brussels</b> <b>sprouts)</b> are high in oxalates, as are sorrel and umbellifers like parsley. Rhubarb leaves contain about 0.5% oxalic acid, and jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) contains calcium oxalate crystals. Similarly, the Virginia creeper, a common decorative vine, produces oxalic acid in its berries as well as oxalite crystals in the sap, in the form of raphides. Bacteria produce oxalates from oxidation of carbohydrates.|$|E
40|$|Companion {{planting}} is a small-scale intercropping practice {{often associated}} with organic or biodynamic gardening. Two garden-scale studies tested popular companion planting claims by comparing garden beds devoted entirely {{to one of three}} or more test crops (monocultures) to all possible two-crop mixtures (dicultures) of the same species. A third study evaluated effects of planting density and crop ratio in three dicultures using a novel experimental design to create gradients in both factors. All studies incorporated basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> (Brassica oleracea L.), and tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.). A preliminary study also included snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), radish (Raphanus sativus L.) before <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout,</b> and dicultures of tomato and <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> with a white clover (Trifolium repens L.) living mulch. Double blind taste tests over three years showed no consistent preference for tomatoes grown with companions over those grown in monoculture. An apparent inhibitory effect of companion planting on some pests of <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> (e. g. imported cabbageworm, Pieris rapae L.; striped flea beetle, Phylollotreta striolata Fab.) in the first study was reversed in the second study when earlier planting of <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> allowed it to compete more effectively with its companions. Relative yield indices calculated for a range of densities (1. 1 - 47. 2 plants/square meter) and crop ratios indicated advantages (mean = 20 %) to planting either tomato or <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> with basil companions, but no advantage to planting tomato and <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> together. The highest yields in tomato, basil, and <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> monocultures occurred at inter-plant spacings of 25, 25 and 40 cm respectively, suggesting advantages to high-density planting. Yield advantages to diculture were most pronounced at the highest densities tested, and in dicultures incorporating the highest proportions of basil. Canopy light absorption and soil moisture content were inversely correlated, and the use of light and water resources was correlated with plant density and biomass production. I conclude that garden-scale intercropping can offer advantages over monoculture, but these are not achieved simply by combining certain compatible companion species. Crop densty, ratio, and relative planting times all affect the way that companion species interact with one another and their environment...|$|R

40|$|Increased vegetational {{diversity}} {{influences the}} behaviour of carabid beetles by changing plant-related abiotic factors. These abiotic factors (light, humidity and habitat structure) affect {{the selection of}} oviposition sites and egg survival of carabid beetles. In a field experiment, more larvae of Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) (Coleoptera Carabidae) were caught in <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> intercropped with barley than in <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> alone. The influence {{of the presence of}} living barley and <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> plants on oviposition was studied in the laboratory. Also, the effects of wet/dry substrate, light/shadowed and structured/unstructured environment on the number of eggs laid were investigated under laboratory conditions. Results indicate a preference for moist, shadowed, structurally complex environments as egg laying sites. This preference results in significantly higher numbers of eggs laid by beetles in barley compared to <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout.</b> Vegetation characteristics by themselves may influence egg-laying-site preferences, in addition to the availability of prey for adults and larvae in the different cropping systems.

25|$|In 2002, {{researchers}} from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health identified the blueprint of genes and enzymes in the body that enable sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli and other vegetables, to prevent cancer and remove toxins from cells. The discovery was made using a “gene chip,” which allows researchers to monitor the complex interactions of thousands of proteins on a whole genome rather than one at time. This study was the first gene profiling analysis of a cancer-preventing agent using this approach. University of Minnesota researcher Sabrina Peterson, PhD, RD, coauthored a study with Johanna Lampe of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, in October 2002 that investigated the chemoprotective effect of cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts).</b> Study results published in The Journal of Nutrition outline the metabolism and mechanisms of action of cruciferous vegetable constituents, discusses human studies testing effects of cruciferous vegetables on biotransformation systems and summarizes the epidemiologic and experimental evidence for an effect of genetic polymorphisms (genetic variations) in these enzymes on response to cruciferous vegetable intake.|$|E
500|$|Although cabbage has an {{extensive}} history, {{it is difficult}} to trace its exact origins owing to the many varieties of leafy greens classified as [...] "brassicas". The wild ancestor of cabbage, Brassica oleracea, originally found in Britain and continental Europe, is tolerant of salt but not encroachment by other plants and consequently inhabits rocky cliffs in cool damp coastal habitats, retaining water and nutrients in its slightly thickened, turgid leaves. According to the triangle of U theory of the evolution and relationships between Brassica species, B. oleracea and other closely related kale vegetables (cabbages, kale, broccoli, <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprouts,</b> and cauliflower) represent one of three ancestral lines from which all other brassicas originated.|$|E

(Homo., Aphididae) and its primary parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh) (Hym., Braconidae) in <b>brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> fields and adjoining flower plots in winter. A wide variety of 14 plant species were included in the study, each established as monoculture plots. <b>Brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> fields and flower plots were established at two sites. One site was located in an open agricultural landscape, the other in a landscape dominated by mixed forest. Brevicoryne brassicae and D. rapae were found on <b>brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> plants but not in the flower plots. Brevicoryne brassicae was initially more abundant in the open landscape, but as their densities declined rapidly in time, no living aphids were recovered at both sites by February. The density of aphids parasitized by D. rapae showed a similar trend, but densities of eight mummies per <b>brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> plant were still present by the end of February. These findings suggest that (i) flower species under investigation do not function as sources of B. brassicae and (ii) <b>brussels</b> <b>sprout</b> plants that are not harvested may not only harbour D. rapae populations that may sustain biological control, but are also likely to act as sources of B. brassicae infestation.
